Methods: The oscillations were assessed by means of adaptive classification of short-term spectral patterns. Results: Lorazepam (a) decreased the percentage of EEG/MEG segments with fast-theta, delta-alpha, fast-theta-alpha and alpha activity and increased percentage of EEG/MEG segments with delta, delta-slow-theta, delta-beta, slow-theta and polyrhythmic activity; (b) decreased diversity of EEG/MEG signals (in terms of spectral patterns) and increased the general instability of the signal; (c) increased stabilization periods of the spectral patterns (reduced brain information processing); (d) maintained larger maximum periods of temporal stabilization for delta, slow-theta, delta-slow-theta, delta-beta and polyrhythmic activity (in terms of spectral patterns); (e) did not increase power in the independent beta rhythm. Conclusions: Lorazepam caused significant reorganization of the EEG/MEG microstructure. These results suggest also that adaptive classification analysis of single short-term spectral patterns may provide additional information to conventional spectral analyses.

Here, we introduce fractally scaled envelope modulation (FSEM) estimation which is sensitive specifically to the changing properties of oscillatory activity. FSEM utilizes the fractal characteristic of wavelet transforms to produce a compact, two-dimensional representation of time series data where signal components at each frequency are made directly comparable according to the spectral distribution of their envelope modulations. This allows the straightforward identification of neural oscillations and other signal components with an envelope structure different from noise. For stable oscillations, we demonstrate how partition-referenced spectral estimation (PRSE) removes the noise slope from spectral estimates, yielding a level estimate where only peaks signifying the presence of oscillatory activity remain. The functionality of these methods is demonstrated with simulations and by analyzing MEG data from human auditory brain areas. FSEM uncovered oscillations in the 9- to 12-Hz and 15- to 18-Hz ranges whereas traditional spectral estimates were able to detect oscillations only in the former range. FSEM further showed that the oscillations exhibited envelope modulations spanning 3-7 s. Thus, FSEM effectively reveals oscillations undetectable with spectral estimates and allows the use of EEG and MEG for studying cognitive processes when the common approach of stimulus time-locked averaging of the measured signal is unfeasible.

Method: Twenty-two patients attending with antecedent of thinner abuse only, and twenty two controls without alcohol, smoking, and drug abuse in the same age range and gender were studied. EEG recording were compared by means of the analyses of peak of frequency (POF), frequency of disorganization, and asymmetry of the background activity in patients and controls at rest eyes-closed condition in electrodes P3, P4, O1, and O2. Results: Significant differences in POF among groups was observed in P3 and P4 location showing lower values in thinner abusers, but not in 01 and 02 locations. Frequencies of disorganization and asymmetry showed significantly higher proportions in thinner abusers. Bivariate correlations among POF at the four electrode location and time of thinner abuse showed significant values. However after partial correlation calculation correcting for age, significant values disappeared. Conclusion: Thus thinner abuse relates with slowing of POF in the EEG of patients with thinner abuse associated with disorganization, and asymmetry depending on time of abuse.

When high-frequency activity is digitized and displayed on a typical monitor, it is altered in ways that are not always appreciated and that may have an impact on the intracranial EEG (ICEEG) interpretation. We describe a case of a neocorticalonset seizure in which false localization occurred with a 12-s per screen display. Because frequencies in excess of 100 Hz are not uncommon in neocortical seizures, at most 4 to 5 s of EEG, depending on the screen resolution, data-sampling rate, and other factors, should be displayed at one time during visual interpretation to localize the seizure onset. Alternatively, spectral analysis should be performed on recordings of neocortical seizures to detect high-frequency activity that may be missed on visual inspection.

The features of these changes appear as subject-specific temporal traces of EEG rhythmic components at specific channels located over the scalp. Accurate classification of MI tasks based upon EEG may lead to a noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) to decode and convey intention of human subjects. We have previously proposed two novel methods on time-frequency feature extraction, expression and classification for high-density EEG recordings (Wang and He 2004; Wang, Deng, and He, 2004). In the present study, we refined the above time-frequency-spatial approach and applied it to a one-dimensional "cursor control" BCI experiment with online feedback. Through offline analysis of the collected data, we evaluated the capability of the present refined method in comparison with the original time-frequency-spatial methods. The enhanced performance in terms of classification accuracy was found for the proposed approach, with a mean accuracy rate of 91.1% for two subjects studied.

The approach we consider is based on narrow-band power time-frequency decompositions of single-trial data. The ensuing power measures have a chi(2)-distribution. The use of the general linear model (GLM) under normal error assumptions is, therefore, difficult to motivate for these data. This is unfortunate because the GLM plays a central role in classical inference and is the standard estimation and inference framework for neuroimaging data. The key contribution of this work is to show that, in many circumstances, one can appeal to the central limit theorem and assume normality for generative models of power. If this is not appropriate, one can transform the data to render the error terms approximately normal. These considerations allow one to analyze induced and evoked oscillations using standard frameworks like statistical parametric mapping. We establish the validity of parametric tests using synthetic and real data and compare its performance to established nonparametric procedures.

The present study aimed to detect alcohol-induced changes in spontaneous neuronal oscillations with combined EEG and MEG techniques. The effects of alcohol on spontaneous neuronal rhythms were studied in 12 healthy subjects after 0.8 g/kg alcohol or juice in a double-blind, placebo-con trolled, cross-over design using simultaneous high-resolution MEG and EEG in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The data were analyzed with a power spectral density analysis. MEG recording showed that alcohol significantly increased the relative power of alpha rhythm (8-10 Hz) and reduced the relative power of beta activity (17-25 Hz)in both left and right hemispheres, but only in the eyes-closed condition. These effects did not depend on gender. No analogous statistically significant changes were observed in EEG rhythms. However, the power of alpha and beta rhythms was positively correlated in MEG and EEG recordings, indicating that MEG and EEG reflect similar processes. A distinct sensitivity of MEG and EEG to the sources of cortical oscillations, a better signal-to-noise ratio of MEG, as well as strong spatial blurring of potentials in EEG are most likely the reasons for the observed differences in the effects of alcohol on spontaneous oscillations as detected with two methods.

With the development of modern signal processing and statistics techniques, we have the ability to explore more information from EEG, much beyond classic trial-averaging approach. This paper discusses some characteristic methods for feature extraction and pattern classification on EEG data theoretically, and a combined spatial-temporal-frequency analysis strategy is proposed. After comparison of the linear function and support vector machine, reinforcement training is introduced to optimize a pre-designed linear classifier while at the same time restrain over-fitting of the classifier.

In brief, this analysis suggests that 'activation', as indexed by increases in hemodynamic signals, should be associated with a loss of power in lower EEG frequencies, relative to higher frequencies. The fact that activation is expressed in terms of frequency (i.e., per second) is consistent with a dimensional analysis in the sense that activations reflect the rate of energy dissipation (per second). In this heuristic, activation causes an acceleration of temporal dynamics leading to (i) increased energy dissipation; (ii) decreased effective membrane time constants; (iii) increased effective coupling among neuronal ensembles; and (iv) a shift in the EEG spectral profile to higher frequencies. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations of how changes in the EEG spectrum are expressed hemodynamically. Furthermore, the heuristic provides a simple measure of neuronal activation based on spectral analyses of EEG. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All of the methods presented here consider the scalp electric field as the basic analysis entity in space. In time, the resolution of the methods is between milliseconds (time-domain analysis), subseconds (time- and frequency-domain analysis) and seconds (frequency-domain analysis). For any of these methods, we show that large parts of the data can be explained by a small number of topographic distributions. Physically, this implies that the brain regions that generated one of those topographies must have been active with a common phase. If several brain regions are producing EEG signals at the same time and frequency, they have a strong tendency to do this in a synchronized mode. This view is illustrated by several examples (including combined EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) and a selective review of the literature. The findings are discussed in terms of short-lasting binding between different brain regions through synchronized oscillations, which could constitute a mechanism to form transient, functional neurocognitive networks.

The aim of this work is to investigate low frequency oscillations (< 300 Hz), particularly within the gamma band (30-110 Hz), during tibial stimulation. Twenty-one volunteers were subjected to 5 Hz stimulation by current pulses of 0.2 ms duration and the minimum intensity to provoke involuntary twitch. EEG signals without (spontaneously) and during stimulation were recorded at primary somatosensory area. A time-frequency analysis indicated the effect of the stimulus artifact in the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) frequencies up to 5 ms after the stimulus. The oscillations up to 100 Hz presented the highest relative power contribution (approximately 99%) for the SEP and showed difference (p < 0.01) from the frequencies of the spontaneously EEG average. Moreover, the range 30-58 Hz was identified as the band with the highest contribution for the tibial SEP morphology (p < 0.0001).

It is based on a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG time series, which is measured by several electrodes in the scalp surface, and includes the computation of a statistic that measures the deviations of the log-power with respect to the pre-stimulus average; the computation of a significance index for these deviations; a new type of display (the time-frequency-topography plot) for the visualization of these indices, and the segmentation of the time-frequency plane into regions with uniform activation patterns. As a particular example, an experiment to study EEG changes during figure and word categorization is analyzed in detail. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, this assumption has been challenged by research suggesting that ERP peaks reflect event-related synchronization of ongoing EEG oscillations. In this study, we investigated the validity of a set of methods that have been used to demonstrate that particular ERP peaks result from synchronized EEG oscillations. We simulated epochs of EEG data by superimposing phasic peaks on noise characterized by the power spectrum of the EEG. When applied to the simulated data, the methods in question produced results that have previously been interpreted as evidence of synchronized oscillations, even though no such synchrony was present. These findings suggest that proposed analysis methods may not effectively disambiguate competing views of ERP generation.

Methods: The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their percent ratio were assessed by a probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs), which reveals temporal dynamics of these SPs and results in the probability-classification profile. Results: It has been demonstrated that the interictal EEG was characterized by (a) a shift towards higher frequencies in all observed brain oscillations, (b) an increased amount of polyrhythmic activity, (c) a decrease in SP types diversity, (d) a decreased relative incidence of the SP type change in the transition between neighboring EEG epochs of the same EEG, and (e) an increased temporal stabilization periods of polyrhythmic activity. All these were observed in distributed brain areas. Conclusions: It was suggested that these findings reflect a disorganization of neurodynamics in the epileptic brain. At the same time, the fact that all these indices were significantly different from surrogate EEG reflects a non-occasional and thus, most likely, an adaptive nature of the microstructural reorganization of interictal EEG. Significance: Parameters of interictal EEG without the signs of epileptiform activity can be considered as additional information in premorbid diagnostics of epistatus.

J	Szucs, D				Szucs, D			The use of electrophysiology in the study of early development	INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Editorial Material							INFANT BRAIN; EEG POWER; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; HZ	Electrophysiology is a timely and important tool in the study of early cognitive development. This commentary polishes the definition of event-related potential (ERP) components; often interpreted as expressions of mental processes. Further, attention is drawn to time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) which conveys much more information than the exclusive use of traditional ERP methodology. Several studies have shown that frequency bands of the EEG undergo systematic development in early childhood. EEG frequency analysis has a potential in early risk assessment. 40 Hz gamma range oscillation bursts accompany stimulus feature binding both in infants and in adults, probably indexing grouping and selection of distributed neuronal populations. Methodological concerns are noted and the need for long-term normative studies is stressed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We divide each ECT EEG time series into four phases and calculate the power spectrum and coherence of left and right prefrontal EEGs for each phase. Previously, we have qualitatively demonstrated certain ECT EEG dynamical patterns by using a neo-cortical neural network model. Now we quantitatively analyze the dynamical phase shifts of the ECT EEG data. Our results are suggestive for a deeper understanding of the ECT EEG patterns and for building more realistic cortical models. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most EEG research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes 'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental events. Although these measures are nearly complementary, they do not fully model the event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot isolate the signals of the contributing cortical areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG features are better viewed as time/frequency perturbations of underlying field potential processes. The new approach combines independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, and trial-by-trial visualization that measures EEG source dynamics without requiring an explicit head model.

Recent studies have, however, reported also infraslow fluctuations in neuronal population activity, magnitude of electroencephalographic oscillations, discrete sleep events, as well as in the occurrence of interictal events. Here we use direct current electroencephalography to demonstrate large-scale infraslow oscillations in the human cortex at frequencies ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 Hz. These oscillations, which are not detectable in conventional electroencephalography because of its limited recording bandwidth (typical lower limit 0.5 Hz), were observed in widespread cortical regions. Notably, the infraslow oscillations were strongly synchronized with faster activities, as well as with the interictal epileptic events and K complexes. Our findings suggest that the infraslow oscillations represent a slow, cyclic modulation of cortical gross excitability, providing also a putative mechanism for the as yet enigmatic aggravation of epileptic activity during sleep.

Since EEG signals contain a wealth of information about brain functions, there are many approaches to analyzing EEG signals with spectral techniques. In this study, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT) were applied to EEG signals obtained from a normal child and from a child having an epileptic seizure. For this purpose, we developed a program using Labview software. Labview is an application development environment that uses a graphical language G, usable with an online applicable National Instruments data acquisition card. In order to obtain clinically interpretable results, frequency band activities of delta, theta, alpha and beta signals were mapped onto frequency-time axes using the STFT, and 3D WT representations were obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Both results were compared, and it was determined that the STFT was more applicable for real-time processing of EEG signals, due to its short process time. However, the CWT still had good resolution and performance high enough for use in clinical and research settings. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results: AR frequencies declined from the age of 45 years and slowed with increasing age independently of non-AR pathology and gender. Females had higher AR frequencies than males. EEGs with non-GBA pathology had lower GBA frequencies and higher GBA amplitudes. Higher GBA amplitudes were associated with lower GBA frequencies in normal EEGs for all age groups. EEG interpretations by 4 independent electroencephalographers showed the same trends, but differed in exact assessment of frequencies and amplitudes. Conclusions: EEG interpretations stored in a categorized database with easy access to data have successfully been used to evaluate interobserver variation and other quality control measurements. Statistical analysis of the data has at the same time produced new information regarding the development of AR and GBA throughout life. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

To specify such changes, we measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence during performance on a declarative learning task (word pair associations) and subsequent sleep. Compared with a nonlearning control condition, learning performance was accompanied with a strong increase in coherence in several EEG frequency bands. During subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, coherence only marginally increased in a global analysis of EEG recordings. However, a striking and robust increase in learning-dependent coherence was found when analyses were performed time-locked to the occurrence of slow oscillations (<1 Hz). Specifically, the surface-positive half-waves of the slow oscillation resulting from widespread cortical depolarization were associated with distinctly enhanced coherence after learning in the slow-oscillatory, delta, slow-spindle, and gamma bands. The findings identify the depolarizing phase of the slow oscillations in humans as a time period particularly relevant for a reprocessing of memories in sleep.

Results of PCA include component time-series waveforms and factors representing the contribution of each component to each electrode; these factors may be displayed as contour maps representing the topographic distribution. of each component. However, PCA often does not achieve the most useful separation of components. PCA may be performed in the frequency domain to potentially improve results. After inspecting principal components of the frequency spectra, spectral values in a selected frequency range are multiplied by a chosen factor to emphasize (or de-emphasize) these frequencies and PCA is redone, promoting the separation of different frequencies into different components. Phase-encoded Fourier spectral analysis (PEFSA) uses multichannel complex Fourier spectra (amplitude and phase) to obtain positive or negative (phase-encoded) potentials at each electrode for any selected frequency. These may be displayed as a contour map representing the topographic distribution of the selected frequency. Applying both techniques, we found that EEG activities of differing frequency were readily separated by PEFSA, while standard PCA often mixed activities with different frequencies into a single component. However, frequency-domain PCA gave a component whose spatial distribution well matched PEFSA results. PCA is superior to PEFSA for separating activities with overlapping frequencies but differing spatial distributions. Preservation of phase information is an advantage of PEFSA and PCA over topographic maps that represent only amplitude (or power) at a given frequency. PCA or PEFSA maps can serve as a starting point for source localization.

J	Li, XL				Li, Xiaoli			Temporal structure of neuronal population oscillations with empirical model decomposition	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						neuronal oscillation; empirical mode decomposition; epileptic seizure; hippocampus	TETANUS TOXIN MODEL; SEIZURES	Frequency analysis of neuronal oscillation is very important for understanding the neural information processing and mechanism of disorder in the brain. This Letter addresses a new method to analyze the neuronal population oscillations with empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Following EMD of neuronal oscillation, a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are obtained, then Hilbert transform of IMFs can be used to extract the instantaneous time frequency structure of neuronal oscillation. The method is applied to analyze the neuronal oscillation in the hippocampus of epileptic rats in vivo, the results show the neuronal oscillations have different descriptions during the pre-ictal, seizure onset and ictal periods of the epileptic EEG at the different frequency band. This new method is very helpful to provide a view for the temporal structure of neural oscillation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Using a new algorithm to detect oscillatory events in the electroencephalogram (EEG), we studied their properties and changes throughout the night. The present approach was based on the idea that the EEG may be described as a superposition of stochastically driven harmonic oscillators with damping and frequency varying in time. This idea was implemented by fitting autoregressive models to the EEG data. Oscillatory events were detected, whenever the damping of one or more frequencies was below a predefined threshold. Sleep EEG data of eight healthy young males were analyzed (four nights per subject). Oscillatory events occurred mainly in three frequency ranges, which correspond roughly to the classically defined delta (0-4.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5 Hz) and sigma (11.5-16 Hz) bands. Their incidence showed small intra- but large inter-individual differences, in particular with respect to alpha events. The incidence and frequency of the events was characteristic for sleep stages and non-rapid eye movement (REM)-REM sleep cycles. The mean event frequency of delta and sigma (spindle) events decreased with the deepening of sleep. It was higher in the second half of the night compared with the first one for delta, alpha and sigma oscillations. The algorithm provides a general framework to detect and characterize oscillatory patterns in the EEG and similar signals.

J	Mizuhara, H; Wang, LQ; Kobayashi, K; Yamaguchi, Y				Mizuhara, H; Wang, LQ; Kobayashi, K; Yamaguchi, Y			A long-range cortical network emerging with theta oscillation in a mental task	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						human fm theta; long-range coherent network; negative BOLD response; simultaneous fMRI and EEG	ALPHA-RHYTHM; EEG; GAMMA; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; ARTIFACT; HUMANS; SIGNAL; BOLD	Human scalp EEG has demonstrated that global coherence among distant areas increases during cognitive tasks, suggesting that oscillating neural activities work to generate global neuronal assemblies for cognitive functions. The theta oscillation in a frequency range of 4-8 Hz with large amplitudes which emerges during mental tasks around the frontal midline region is called fm theta. If theta oscillation concerns the global neuronal assemblies, fm theta should be associated with regional activities that depend on task conditions. In the present study, we examine the EEG-related brain activities by developing simultaneous EEG and fMRI during a mental calculation task. EEG-related negative BOLD was dominant over anterior medial regions, suggesting a major contribution of negative BOLD to fm theta. Negative and positive BOLD were found over distant regions. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that the connectivity varied remarkably according to mental conditions. In the rest condition, the connectivity was localized, whereas in the task condition, a long-range coherent network was formed by the anterior midline, posterior cingulate and right middle temporal cortices with linking between the right middle temporal and left lateral cortices during numerical processing. Further EEG analyses indicate that the long-range coherent network executing cognitive functions is coordinated in the time window of theta oscillations.

But because of the nature and some limitation of themselves, their application in EEG analysis has been limited. Considering the excellence and shortcoming of STFT and wavelet, in the "virtual EEG recording and analysis instrumentation", the multi-resolution time-frequency analysis method based on STFT and wavelet packet transform has been introduced to advance the self-adaptive ability for signals, so more flexible division of frequency bands in EEG can be obtained and the basic rhythms in EEG signals can be detected efficiently.

Event related potential (ERP) is a kind of cognitive electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, which are directly related with task and average across spontaneous EEG. Effective time-frequency representation method and how to analyze EEG based on the event related cognitive task in time-frequency domain according to their experiment speciality are the hot study at present. In current paper, a new time-frequency method about filter bank and Hilbert transform (FBHT) was introduced, and the application for ERP and ER-EEG signal were explored in order to mine new information effectively during the classic Stroop cognitive task.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a tool for diagnosing AD for several decades. The hallmark of EEG abnormalities in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms. These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, cholinergic deficits, etc. This article reviews main findings of EEG abnormalities in AD patients obtained from conventional spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamical methods. In particular, nonlinear alterations in the EEG of AD patients, i.e. a decreased complexity of EEG patterns and reduced information transmission among cortical areas, and their clinical implications are discussed. For future studies, improvement of the accuracy of differential diagnosis and early detection of AD based on multimodal approaches, longitudinal studies on nonlinear dynamics of the EEG, drug effects on the EEG dynamics, and linear and nonlinear functional connectivity among cortical regions in AD are proposed to be investigated. EEG abnormalities of AD patients are characterized by slowed mean frequency, less complex activity, and reduced coherences among cortical regions. These abnormalities suggest that the EEG has utility as a valuable tool for differential and early diagnosis of AD. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The inherent complexity of the spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG oscillations indicates that conceptual models that view source activity as consisting only of a few cc equivalent dipoles" are inadequate. We present an approach that uses volume conduction models to characterize the distinct spatial filtering of cortical source activity by average reference EEG, high-resolution EEG, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). By comparing these three measures, we can make inferences about the sources of EEG oscillations without having to make prior assumptions about the sources. We apply this approach to spontaneous EEG oscillations observed with eyes closed at rest. Both EEG and MEG recordings show robust alpha rhythms over posterior regions of the cortex; however, the dominant frequency of these rhythms varies between EEG and MEG recordings. Frontal alpha and theta rhythms are generated almost 'exclusively by superficial radial dipole layers that generate robust EEG signals but very little MEG signals; these sources are presumably mainly in the gyral crowns of frontal cortex. MEG and high-resolution EEG estimates of alpha rhythms provide evidence of local tangential and radial sources in the posterior cortex, lying mainly on sulcal and gyral surfaces. Despite the detailed information about local radial and tangential sources potentially afforded by high-resolution EEG and MEG, it is also evident that the alpha and theta rhythms receive contributions from non-local source activity, for instance large dipole layers distributed over lobeal or (potentially) even larger spatial scales.

Classical inferences made on the ensuing statistical maps must control family wise error (FWE) when searching across the map's dimensions. In this paper, we borrow multiple comparisons procedures, established in neuroimaging, and apply them to electrophysiological data. These procedures use random field theory (RFT) to adjust p-values from statistics that are functions of time and/or frequency. This RFT adjustment for continuous statistical processes plays the same role as a Bonnferonni adjustment in the context of discrete statistical tests. Here, by analysing the time-frequency decompositions of single channel EEG data we show that RFT adjustments can be used in the analysis of electrophysiological data and illustrate the advantages of this method over existing approaches.

This article reports the relationship between the electroencephalographic activity and the HRV spectral power in several specific frequency bands. The authors discovered that relationships do exist between HRV and electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. In particular, it was found that, prior to the changes of EEG, the changes of HRV usually indicate the shift of sleep stages. HRV frequency analysis indicates that the very-low-frequency components of HRV are closely related to sleep EEG. Results show that the rhythm of the spectral power oscillations in some specific frequency bands of HRV is almost the same as the sleep cycle, which reflects the rhythm of sleep to a certain extent.

J	Smith, JS				Smith, JS			The local mean decomposition and its application to EEG perception data	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						demodulated signal time-frequency representation; electroencephalogram; instantaneous frequency; local mean decomposition; phase concentration; visual perception	INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; PHASE-LOCKING; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; TASK; RESPONSES; GAMMA; THETA	This paper describes the local mean decomposition (LMD), a new iterative approach to demodulating amplitude and frequency modulated signals. The new method decomposes such signals into a set of functions, each of which is the product of an envelope signal and a frequency modulated signal from which a time-varying instantaneous frequency can be derived. The LMD method can be used to analyse a wide variety of natural signals such as electrocardiograms, functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and earthquake data. The paper presents the results of applying LIVID to a set of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) visual perception data. The LMD instantaneous frequency and energy structure of the EEG is examined, and compared with results obtained using the spectrogram. The nature of visual perception is investigated by measuring the degree of EEG instantaneous phase concentration that occurs following stimulus onset over multiple trials. The analysis suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the theta phase concentrations of the perception and no perception EEG data.

We recorded simultaneously 50 channels EEG and EMG from quadriceps and biceps femoris muscles of the left upper leg. Three experimental conditions were investigated with the patient in a seated position: (i) recording during rest (Rest), (ii) recording while the patient had to hold his left leg horizontally stretched out (Postural), and (iii) recording while the patient had to hold his left leg horizontally stretched out against a vertical force (Postural against force). Coherence, phase difference and cumulant density were computed as indicators for cortico-muscular coupling. The cortical component preceding the silent period was shown by averaging and was reconstructed. During postural and postural against force conditions, the EEG over the vertex was significantly coherent with EMG, in alpha (7-15 Hz) and beta range (15-30 Hz). The strongest coherence peak was at 21 Hz. No high-frequency coherence was observed. The phase difference and the cumulant density estimate corresponded to a 32 ms time lag between motor cortex and muscles, with EEG leading. The broadening of the coherence spectrum at which the motor cortex drives the muscles together with the excessive coherence levels and the giant SEP could reflect the hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex. The frequency content of the coherence may be characteristic for this type of myoclonus. The results lend support to the view that the frequency analysis may have some diagnostic potential in cortical myoclonus. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Material and Methods: Respiratory thoracic movements, changes of blood pulse frequency and passive head movements of 20 healthy subjects were examined outside and inside an MR magnet at rest in a simultaneously recorded 21-channel surface EEG. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded simultaneously. On the basis of the correlation of the left ventricular ejection time (LVET) with the heart-rate, a post-processing heart-rate dependent subtraction of the cardiac activity-related artifacts of the EEG was developed. The quality of the post-processed EEG was tested by detecting alpha-activity in the pre- and post-processed EEGs. Results: Inside the magnet, passive head motion but not respiratory thoracic movements resulted in EEG artifacts that correlated strongly with cardiac activity-related artifacts of the EEG. The blood pulse frequency influenced the appearance of the cardiac activity-related artifacts of the EEG. The removal of the cardiac activity-related artifacts of the EEG by the implemented post-processing algorithm resulted in an EEG of diagnostic quality with detected alpha-activity. Conclusion: When recording an EEG in MR environment, heart rate-dependent subtraction of EEG artifacts caused by ballistocardiogram contamination is essential to obtain EEG recordings of diagnostic quality and reliability.

We tested whether independent component analysis (ICA) is a necessary preprocessing tool to determine fractal properties of amplitudes of decomposed EEG records in theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillations. The subjects were required to track a moving spot on a city map displayed on a computer screen by pushing forward a joystick in two experimental conditions: the spot moved in steps either with constant or fractal time intervals. The wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method was applied to estimate the local fractal dimensions D(h) for recovered EEG via reduced independent components (ICs) localized inside and outside the brain. The measure of fractality, i.e. the Hoelder exponent h(Dmax), was statistically estimated among experimental conditions, We established multifractality for extracted IC per se, specific for filtered oscillations in both experimental conditions: long-range correlation for theta and alpha, and anticorrelation for beta and gamma. Similar results were obtained for filtered versions of recovered EEG. Multifractal scaling, specific for lower and higher EEG oscillations, proved to be very stable intrinsic feature for the activity of large brain areas. The external events (task conditions) and the extended number of ICs, including those at the boundary line of the brain, did not have influence upon the scaling, although their effects might be statistically different for a given filtered oscillation.

The exact composition of brain oscillations was assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. In contrast to previous studies of depression, the current study found that major depression affects brain activity in nearly the whole cortex and manifests itself in considerable reorganization of the composition of brain oscillations in a broad frequency range: 0.5-30 Hz. At the same time, the magnitude of the effect of depression was maximal in the posterior cortex of the brain. Interhemisphere asymmetry during major depression was also observed in the whole cortex with right hyperactivity in frontal, parietal and occipital brain areas. It is suggested that depressive brain is manifested in the superposition of distributed multiple oscillations. Our findings provide new insight on the relationship between major depressive disorder and cortical oscillatory activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

We describe, for the first time in an unselected group of patients with neocortical epilepsy, the finding that high-frequency (60-100 Hz) epileptiform oscillations are highly localized in the seizure onset zone, both before and temporally removed from seizure onset. These findings were observed in all six patients with neocortical epilepsy out of 23 consecutive patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for pre-surgical evaluation during the study period. The majority of seizures (62%) in these patients were anticipated by an increase in high-frequency activity in the 20 min prior to neocortical seizure onset. Contrary to observations in normal brain, high-frequency activity was strongly modulated by behavioural state, and was maximal during slow-wave sleep, which may explain the propensity for neocortical onset seizures to begin during sleep. These findings point to an important role for neuromodulatory circuits, probably involving the thalamus, in mechanisms underlying seizure generation in neocortical epilepsy. These findings demonstrate that high-frequency epileptiform oscillations may prove clinically useful in localizing the seizure onset zone in neocortical epilepsy, for identifying periods of increased probability of seizure onset, and in elucidating mechanisms underlying neocortical ictogenesis. Confirmation that prolonged bursts of high-frequency activity may predict focal onset neocortical seizures will require prospective validation on continuous, prolonged recordings in a larger number of patients. Importantly, the results show that the dynamic range utilized in current clinical practice for localization of epileptogenic brain largely ignores fundamental oscillations that are signatures of an epileptogenic brain. It may prove that many currently available clinical EEG systems and EEG analysis methods utilize a dynamic range that discards clinically important information.

We developed a software routine for analysis and visualization of spatiotemporal patterns of EEG oscillations: event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS). Further, the spatiotemporal representation of task-related coherence (TRC) was also proposed for investigation of interregional neuronal connectivity. As concurrent artifacts and volume conduction effect may result incorrect or spatially blurred estimation of EEG features, we have embedded data preprocessing functions to reduce these effects including: correcting eye movement-related artifact, changing reference methods and spatial filtering undesirable neuronal activity. These functions were subsequently applied to study EEG time-frequency patterns during self-paced movements in normal volunteers.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is essentially a method for extracting individual signals from mixtures of signals. Time-frequency analysis provides a powerful tool for the analysis of EEG signals. The original EEG signal is divided into independent components, and the noisy components were chosen by time-frequency analysis method.

We check the hypotheses that the fractal properties of filtered EEG (1) change with respect to the law of spot movement; (2) differ among filtered EEG components and scalp sites; (3) differ among real and imaginary tracking. Sixteen right-handed subjects begin to perform IM, next - real spot tracking (RM and BM) following a moving spot on streets of a citymap displayed on a computer screen, by push forward/backward a joystick. Multichannel long-lasting EEG is band-pass filtered for theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillations. The Wavelet-Transform-Modulus-Maxima-Method is applied to reveal multifractality [local fractal dimensions D-max(h)] among task conditions, frequency bands and sites. Non-parametric statistical estimation of the fractal measures h (Dmax) is finally applied. Multifractality is established for all experimental conditions, EEG components and sites as follows among filtered components - anticorrelation (h (Dmax) < 0.5) in beta and gamma, and long-range correlation (h (Dmax) > 0.5) for theta and alpha oscillations; among tasks - for RM and BM, h (Dmax) differ significantly whereas IM resembles mostly RM; among sites - no significant difference for local fractal properties is established. The results suggest that for both imaginary and real visual-motor tracking a line, multifractal scaling, specific for lower and higher EEG oscillations, is a very stable intrinsic one for the activity of large brain areas. The external events (task conditions) insert weak effect on the scaling.

It is indicated that the satisfied results Pan be obtained by select different time-frequency testing and analysis methods based on the different purposes, and feature waves.

Methods: Using a whole-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded scalp EEG and MEG signals in 10 BRE patients (age 8-12 years) and visually identified unilateral interictal spikes that were simultaneously present on both EEG and MEG channels. We obtained the peak timing of individual spike complex based on MEG single-dipole modeling, and then applied wavelet transform to analyze the time-frequency components of corresponding MEG signals with respect to spike occurrence. Results: In the hemisphere with time-domain spike waveforms, we identified a clear increase of 0.5-4OHz activity around the spike peak, most prominent at alpha band (8-13 Hz). Notably, at the approximate timing we also observed an increase in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations over the homotopic area in the other hemisphere where no spike signals were found. Conclusions: Our results indicate bilateral increases in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations during unilateral spike formation in BRE patients. By using wavelet transform analysis, one could be able to detect some irritative feature that would in visual analysis remain undetected. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using a wavelet-based analysis, we investigated how power changes and phase clustering in different frequency bands contribute to the averaged event-related potentials (ERPs). In addition, we analyzed the actual mean phases of the different oscillations. Our analyses yielded the following results: (1) power changes contributed significantly only to the late components of the ERPs (> 400 ms) (2) earlier ERP components were produced by a stimulus-related broad-band phase and amplitude reset of ongoing oscillatory activity about 190 ms after stimulus onset that involved not only the theta band, but also covered alpha and lower beta band frequencies (3) phase and amplitude reset occurred during an epoch of increased phase entrainment over time that lasted for about two oscillation periods for all involved frequencies and was more pronounced for correct rejections than for hits. The broad-band phase and amplitude reset was observed for both hits and correct rejections, and therefore, did not appear to support a specific cognitive function, but rather to act as a general facilitating factor for the processes involved in this memory task. Further analyses of synchronization between oscillations and power changes in different frequency bands revealed a task-dependent modulation of gamma activity by the entrained theta cycle, a mechanism potentially related to memory encoding and retrieval in the rhinal cortex and hippocampus, respectively.

High-frequency oscillations during human focal seizures	BRAIN			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; ripples; fast ripples	HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; DYSPLASTIC NEOCORTEX; CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; BEHAVING RAT; HIPPOCAMPAL; HZ; PATTERNS; ONSET	Discrete high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 100-500 Hz have previously been recorded in human epileptic brains using depth microelectrodes. We describe for the first time similar oscillations in a cohort of unselected focal epileptic patients implanted with EEG macroelectrodes. Spectral analysis and visual inspection techniques were used to study seizures from 10 consecutive patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for medically refractory focal epilepsy. Four of these patients had focal seizure onset in the mesial temporal lobe, and in all 12 of their seizures, well-localized, segmental, very high frequency band (VHF: 250500 Hz) oscillations were visually identified near the time of seizure onset from contacts in this zone. Increased high-frequency band (HF: 100-200 Hz) activity compared with the background was distinguished both visually and with spectral analysis later in the seizures of 3/4 mesial temporal patients, involving contacts in the generator region and, in one patient, areas of contralateral peri-hippocampal propagation. Three patients with well-defined neocortical seizure-onset areas also demonstrated focal HF or VHF oscillations confined to the seizure-onset channels during their eight seizures. No discrete HF or VHF activity was present in the poorly localized seizures from the remaining three patients. These results show that discrete HFOs can be recorded from human focal epileptic brain using depth macroelectrodes, and that they occur mostly in regions of primary epileptogenesis and rarely in regions of secondary spread. Absent high-frequency activity seems to indicate poor localization, whereas the presence of focal HFOs near the time of seizure onset may signify proximity to the epileptogenic focus in mesial temporal lobe and neocortical seizures. We postulate that focal HFOs recorded with depth macroelectrodes reflect the partial synchronization of very local oscillations such as those previously studied using microelectrodes, and result from interconnected small neuronal ensembles. Our finding that localized HFOs occur in varying anatomical structures and pathological conditions perhaps indicates commonality to diverse epileptogenic aetiologies.

More specifically, we examine whether increases in theta (approximate to 3-7 Hz) and gamma (around 40 Hz) band power occur in response to sentences that were either semantically correct or contained a semantically incongruent word (semantic violation). ERP results indicated a classical N400 effect. A wavelet-based time-frequency analysis revealed a theta band power increase during an interval of 300-800 ms after critical word onset, at temporal electrodes bilaterally for both sentence conditions, and over midfrontal areas for the semantic violations only. In the gamma frequency band, a predominantly frontal power increase was observed during the processing of correct sentences. This effect was absent following semantic violations. These results provide a characterization of the oscillatory brain dynamics, and notably of both theta and gamma oscillations, that occur during language comprehension. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Recent hardware and software developments have made it feasible to acquire EEG and fMRI data simultaneously. We emphasize the potential of simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings to pursue new strategies in cognitive neuroimaging. Specifically, we propose that, by exploiting the combined spatiotemporal resolution of the methods, the integration of EEG and fMRI recordings on a single-trial level enables the rich temporal dynamics of information processing to be characterized within spatially well-defined neural networks.

High frequency oscillations in the somatosensory evokedpotentials (SSEP's) are mainly due to phase-resetting phenomena	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						evoked potential (EP); somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP); phase-based measures; time-frequency energy distributions; inter-trial coherence; high frequency oscillations (HFOs)	600 HZ; EVOKED POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; BURSTS; FIELDS	A small series of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) overlapping the earliest part of the N20 wave can be observed in the somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) of normal subjects. We tried to elucidate whether these high frequency components are mainly due to phase-resetting phenomena, to the emergence of new oscillations related to the stimuli, or to a combination of both. Averaged median-nerve SSEPs from seven healthy subjects were studied by means of time-frequency analysis. The presence of new oscillatory activities was evaluated by averaging the energy of the single-trial time-frequency transforms in the HFOs range (400-1000 Hz). To study phase-resetting phenomena, we measured intertrial coherence (ITC) in the same frequency range. A marked inter-trial coherence related to the HFOs was found, whereas energy changes (related to the emergence of new oscillations) were minimal. The combination of these three different approaches suggests that the HFOs are mainly due to resettings of the ongoing EEG activity originated in response to the stimuli. The emergence of new activities does not seem to be a relevant mechanism in the formation of these components. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG and SEP are variables that indirectly reflect cerebral blood flow (CBF) provided that anaesthetic regimen, body temperature, and arterial blood pressure of the patient are stable. When CBF decreases and reaches the functional threshold, stowing and/or attenuation of EEG occurs white the amplitude and the latency of cortical SEP are, respectively decreased and lengthened. Based on these changes, numerous criteria corresponding to critical thresholds have been defined. A decrease in EEG amplitude greater than 30% or EEG changes lasting more than 30 s have been considered as significant by clinicians. The main criteria resulting from computerized EEG analysis were a reduction in total power and/or in spectral. edge frequency. Regarding SEP, a more than 50% decrease in N20 amplitude and/or a more than 1 ms increase in central conduction time were the most frequently used criteria. According to the bulk of literature, it may be concluded that processed EEG analysis is more sensitive than visual EEG analysis to detect cerebral ischaemia, and that SEP are not less sensitive than conventional EEG. Moreover, literature shows that SEP are as specific as computerized EEG analysis to disclose ischaemia during carotid endarterectomy. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to introduce a new method for analyzing the P300 component, when performing a given cognitive task, in this case, a two-choice reaction time task. The discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies wavelet is employed to detect the presence of P300 in individual trials. Wavelet filtering is applied to remove noise and unwanted frequency components from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients based on prior knowledge of event-related potentials (ERPs). The filtering mask is computed from the grand-average of wavelet coefficients over all participants. With this filtering, the P300 component is accurately localized in both time and scale. The findings suggest the procedure to have considerable potential for the analysis of time-series data in the behavioral neurosciences.

Recent studies in animals suggest a similar functional role for very high frequency oscillations (VRFO) in the range 80-200 Hz. Since some intracerebral studies in humans link VHFO to epileptogenesis, it remains unclear if VHFO appear in the healthy human brain and if so which is their role. This study uses EEG recordings from twelve healthy volunteers, engaged in a visuo-motor reaction time task, to show that VHFO are not necessarily pathological but rather code information about upcoming movements. Oscillations within the range (30-200 Hz) occurring in the period between stimuli presentation and the fastest band responses allow highly accurate (> 96%) prediction of the laterality of the responding hand in single trials. Our results suggest that VHFO belong in functional terms to the gamma band that must be considerably enlarged to better understand the role of oscillatory activity in brain functioning. This study has therefore important implications for the recording and analysis of electrophysiological data in normal subjects and patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the reliability of methods for the discrimination between truthful and deceptive responses is still limited. Efforts to improve reliability have examined measures of central nervous system function such as EEG. However, EEG analyses based on either time- or frequency-domain parameters have had mixed results. Because EEG is a nonstationary signal, the use of joint time-frequency features may yield more reliable results for detecting deception. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of deception detection based on EEG features extracted through wavelet transformation. EEG was recorded from 4 electrode sites (F3, F4, F7, F8) during a modified version of the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT) in 5 subjects. Wavelet analysis revealed significant differences between deceptive and truthful responses. These differences were detected in features whose frequency range roughly corresponds to the EEG beta rhythm and within a time window which coincides with the P300 component. These preliminary results indicate that joint time-frequency EEG features extracted through wavelet analysis may provide a more reliable method for detecting deception than standard ERPs.

Mechanisms of evoked and induced responses in MEG/EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; NEURAL MASS MODEL; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SINGLE NEURONS; BRAIN; GAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Cortical responses, recorded by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, can be characterized in the time domain, to study event-related potentials/fields, or in the time-frequency domain, to study oscillatory activity. In the literature, there is a common conception that evoked, induced, and on-going oscillations reflect different neuronal processes and mechanisms. In this work, we consider the relationship between the mechanisms generating neuronal transients and how they are expressed in terms of evoked and induced power. This relationship is addressed using a neuronally realistic model of interacting neuronal subpopulations. Neuronal transients were generated by changing neuronal input (a dynamic mechanism) or by perturbing the systems coupling parameters (a structural mechanism) to produce induced responses. By applying conventional time-frequency analyses, we show that, in contradistinction to common conceptions, induced and evoked oscillations are perhaps more related than previously reported. Specifically, structural mechanisms normally associated with induced responses can be expressed in evoked power. Conversely, dynamic mechanisms posited for evoked responses can induce responses, if there is variation in neuronal input. We conclude, it may be better to consider evoked responses as the results of mixed dynamic and structural effects. We introduce adjusted power to complement induced power. Adjusted power is unaffected by trial-to-trial variations in input and can be attributed to structural perturbations without ambiguity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They are usually reported using time-locked averaging of EEG during repetitive tasks. We tested the hypothesis that continuous gamma EEG would be measurable during mental tasks. Methods: We investigated sustained human gamma EEG oscillations induced by 8 cognitive tasks (Visual Checkerboard, Expectancy, Reading, Subtraction, Music, Expectancy, Word learning, Word recall, and a Video Segment) in 20 subjects using standard digital EEG recording and power spectral analysis. Results: All of the cognitive tasks augmented gamma power relative to a control condition (eyes open watching a blank computer screen). This enhancement was statistically significant at more than one scalp site for all tasks except checkerboard. The Expectancy, Learning, Reading and Subtraction tasks expressed the most impressive gamma response, up to 5 fold above the control condition and there was some task-related specificity of the distribution of increased gamma power, especially in posterior cortex with visual tasks. Conclusions: Widespread gamma activation of cortical EEG can easily be demonstrated during mental activity. Significance: These results establish the feasibility of measuring high frequency EEG rhythms with trans-cranial recordings, demonstrate that sustained gamma EEG activity correlates with mentation, and provides evidence consistent with the temporal binding model.

Methods: We characterized the different levels of EEG synchronization during sleep (in the 0.25-2.5 Hz band) of five healthy subjects by means of the synchronization likelihood (SL) algorithm and analyzed its long-range temporal correlations by means of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Results: We found higher-levels of interregional synchronization during 'cyclic alternating pattern' (CAP) sleep than during nonCAP with a small but significant difference between its A and B phases. SL during CAP showed fluctuations probably corresponding to the single EEG slow-wave elements. DFA showed the presence of two linear scaling regions in the double-logarithmic plot of the fluctuations of SL level as a function of time scale. This indicates the presence of a characteristic time scale in the underlying dynamics which was very stable among the different subjects (1.23-1.33 s). We also computed the DFA exponent of the two scaling regions: the first, with values approximate to 1.5, corresponded to fluctuations with period 0.09-0.75 s and the second, with values approximate to 1, corresponded to fluctuations with period 1.5-24.0 s. Only the first exponent showed different values during the different sleep stages. Conclusions: All these results indicate a different role for each sleep stage and CAP condition in the EEG synchronization processes of sleep which show a complex time structure correlated with its neurophysiological mechanisms. Significance: Very slow oscillations in spatial EEG synchronization might play a critical role in the long-range temporal EEG correlations during sleep which might be the chain of events responsible for the maintenance and correct complex development of sleep structure during the night.

Comparison of signals in the time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain between real and simulated signals show similarities validating the EEG simulator. This model can provide artefact free EEG signals for researchers so that algorithm parameters can be tuned or so that automatic EEG detection algorithms, such as seizure detection and epileptic spike detection, can be evaluated.

This method is suitable for time delay estimation of narrow band coherence signals for which the conventional methods cannot be reliably applied. We show, by analysing coupled Rossler attractors with a known delay, that the method yields satisfactory results. Then, we apply this method to human pathologic tremor. The delay between simultaneously measured traces of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) data of subjects with essential hand tremor is calculated. We find that there is a delay of 11-27 milli-seconds (ms) between the tremor correlated parts (cortex) of the brain (EEG) and the trembling hand (EMG) which is in agreement with the experimentally observed delay value of 15 ms for the cortico-muscular conduction time. By surrogate analysis we calculate error bars of the estimated delay. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Time-frequency analysis of the responses to the odorants revealed that the stimulations elicited induced oscillatory responses, as well as already described olfactory evoked potentials. These oscillatory responses were composed of two frequency components - one in the beta band (15-25 Hz) and a faster one, in the low gamma band (25-35 Hz) - both of which lasted during the full duration of the inspiration. In pairs of identical odorants, the power of gamma oscillations was weaker for the second odorant (the target) than for the first one (the sample). We observed no such difference when the first and second odorants of a pair were different. Thus, gamma oscillations in the amygdala are weaker for repeated stimuli, a mechanism known as repetition suppression. This is consistent with an involvement of the human amygdala in the encoding and retrieval of olfactory information independently of its hedonic properties, at least in epileptic patients. Altogether, our results corroborate in humans evidence found in animals that oscillations serve as a common coding process of olfactory information.

The hypothesis is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification accuracy when using different wavelets/filters for EEG analysis. When classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the wavelet/filter used, ranged from 6.92% to 11.99%, almost twofold. Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of the six standard wavelets tested. Similarly, when differentiating between preparation for left- or right-hand movements, classification using the SNAP was more accurate (10.03% error) than for four out of five of the standard wavelets (9.54% to 12.00% error) and internationally competitive (7% error) on the 2001 NIPS competition test set. Phenomena shown only in maps of discriminatory EEG activity may explain why the SNAP appears to have promise for improving EEG wavelet analysis. It represents the initial exploration of a potential family of EEG-specific wavelets.

Beat-to-beat variability signals synchronized to QRS occurrence on ECG signals were extracted from respiration, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) traces. The analysis was restricted to sleep stage 2. Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) periods were detected from EEG signals and the following conditions were identified: stage 2 non-CAP (2 NCAP), stage 2 CAP (2 CAP) and stage 2 CAP with myoclonus (2 CAP MC). The coupling relationships between pairs of variability signals were studied in both the time and frequency domains. Passing from 2 NCAP to 2 CAP, sympathetic activation is indicated by tachycardia and reduced respiratory arrhythmia in the heart rate signal. At the same time, we observed a marked link between EEG and HRV at the CAP frequency. During 2 CAP MC, the increased synchronization involved myoclonus and respiration. The underlying mechanism seems to be related to a global control system at the central level that involves the different systems.

In addition to their vital clinical utility.. electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the electrophysiological correlates of functional brain activation in greater detail than non-invasive recordings. The proximity of ECoG electrodes to the cortical sources of EEG activity enhances their spatial resolution, as well as their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for high-frequency EEG activity. ECoG recordings have.. therefore.. been used to study the event-related dynamics of brain oscillations in a variety of frequency ranges, and in a variety of functional-neuroanatomic systems, including somatosensory and somatomotor systems, visual and auditory perceptual systems, and cortical networks responsible for language. These ECoG studies have confirmed and extended the original non-invasive observations of ERD/ERS phenomena in lower frequencies, and have discovered novel event-related responses in gamma frequencies higher than those previously observed in non-invasive recordings. In particular, broadband event-related gamma responses greater than 60 Hz, extending up to similar to 200 Hz, have been observed in a variety of functional brain systems. The observation of these "high gamma" responses requires a recording system with an adequate sampling rate and dynamic range (we use 1000 Hz at 16-bit A/D resolution) and is facilitated by event-related time-frequency analyses of the recorded signals. The functional response properties of high-gamma activity are distinct from those of ERD/ERS phenomena in lower frequencies. In particular, the timing and spatial localization of high-gamma ERS often appear to be more specific to the putative timing and localization of functional brain activation than alpha or beta ERD/ERS. These findings are consistent with the proposed role of synchronized gamma oscillations in models of neural computation, which have in turn been inspired by observations of gamma activity in animal preparations, albeit at somewhat lower frequencies. Although ECoG recordings cannot directly measure the synchronization of action potentials among assemblies of neurons, they may demonstrate event-related interactions between gamma oscillations in macroscopic local field potentials (LFP) generated by different large-scale populations of neurons engaged by the same functional task. Indeed, preliminary studies Suggest that such interactions do occur in gamma frequencies, including high-gamma frequencies, at latencies consistent with the timing of task performance. The neuronal mechanisms underlying high-gamma activity and its unique response properties in humans are still largely unknown, but their investigation through invasive methods is expected to facilitate and expand their potential clinical and research applications, including functional brain mapping, brain-computer interfaces, and neurophysiological studies of human cognition.

Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using discrete wavelet transform, and classification using ANN. EEG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using wavelet transform. Then these sub-band frequencies were used as an input to an ANN with two discrete outputs: normal and epileptic. In this study, FEBANN and DWN based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the ROC curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The DWN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN based counterpart. Within the same group, the DWN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The introduced method requires no prior knowledge of the reactive frequency bands, their temporal behavior or cortical locations. The algorithm implements an arbitrary time-frequency segmentation procedure by using a flexible local discriminant base algorithm for given multichannel brain activity recordings to extract subject specific ERD and ERS patterns. Extracted time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis to reduce the feature set which is highly correlated due to volume conduction and the neighbor cortical regions. The reduced feature set is then fed to a linear discriminant analysis for classification. We give experimental results for 9 subjects to show the superior performance of the proposed method where the classification accuracy varied between 76.4% and 96.81% and the average classification accuracy was 84.9%.

Electroencephalography has demonstrated a role of these signals for cognitive functions including visual perception, attention, learning and memory. During auditory processing, magnetoencephalogram has identified oscillatory activity in higher frequency ranges and with a more discrete localization than electroencephalogram. Gamma-band activity increases have been observed in the putative auditory dorsal and ventral processing streams during the processing of auditory spatial and pattern information, respectively. Additional gamma-band activity has been found over the frontal cortex during top-down tasks. Oscillatory activity in the gamma range may serve to assess the temporal dynamics of cortical networks and their interactions. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AEP transient signals are obtained via frequency domain deconvolution of overlapped responses. Simultaneous acquisition of Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), Middle Latency Response (MLR), and Long Latency Response (LLR) is obtained at an average stimulation rate of 39.1 Hz, using 10, 20 and 100 second electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Deconvolved responses confirm previous observations on the reduction and disappearance of the P1 MLR component during stage III and IV, obtained with standard averaging and stimulation methods. Results indicate that auditory stimulation at high rates during sleep, using short time sweeps, may help correlating the sleep EEG indicative of different arousal levels, with corresponding AEPs.

Associations were studied between performance on WAIS and resting EEG spectral parameters in heroin abusers and normal young males. The most prominent associations between WAIS and EEG variables were consistently registered in polar and lateral frontal/temporal derivations. WAIS subtests predominantly loading on retrieval from long-term memory stores were significantly associated with delta bands mean frequencies. Subtests with strong working memory component related to theta2 mean frequency at temporal leads. Subtests requiring problem-solving operations correlated with alpha bands parameters, whereas psychomotor speed was associated with beta power. The data are in agreement with the hypothesis of Von Stein & Sarnthein (2000).

In contrast to this, the recording bandwidth of the routine clinical EEG (typically around 0.5-50 Hz) that was originally set by trivial technical limitations has remained practically unaltered for over half a decade. An increasing amount of evidence shows that salient EEG signals take place and can be recorded beyond the conventional clinical EEG bandwidth. These physiological and pathological EEG activities range from 0.01 Hz to several hundred Hz, and they have been demonstrated in recordings of spontaneous activity in the preterm human brain, and during epileptic seizures, sleep, as well as in various kinds of cognitive tasks and states in the adult brain. In the present paper, we will describe the practical aspects of recording the full physiological frequency band of the EEG (Full-band EEG; FbEEG), and we review the currently available data on the clinical applications of FbEEG. Recording the FbEEG is readily attained with commercially available direct-current (DC) coupled amplifiers if the recording setup includes electrodes providing a DC-stable electrode-skin interface. FbEEG does not have trade-offs that would favor any frequency band at the expense of another. We present several arguments showing that elimination of the lower (infraslow) or higher (ultrafast) bands of the EEG frequency spectrum in routine EEG has led, and will lead, to situations where salient and physiologically meaningful features of brain activity remain undetected or become seriously attenuated and distorted. With the currently available electrode, amplifier and data acquisition technology, it is to be expected that FbEEG will become the standard approach in both clinical and basic science.

In past decades, various qEEG methods have been extensively studied. This article provides a detailed review of the advances in this field. qEEG methods are generally classified into linear and nonlinear approaches. The traditional qEEG approach is based on spectrum analysis, which hypothesizes that the EEG is a stationary process. EEG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear, especially in some pathological conditions. Various time-frequency representations and time-dependent measures have been proposed to address those transient and irregular events in EEG. With regard to the nonlinearity of EEG, higher order statistics and chaotic measures have been put forward. In characterizing the interactions across the cerebral cortex, an information theory-based measure such as mutual information is applied. To improve the spatial resolution, qEEG analysis has also been combined with medical imaging technology (e.g., CT, MR, and PET). With these advances, qEEG plays a very important role in basic research and clinical studies of brain injury, neurological disorders, epilepsy, sleep studies and consciousness, and brain function.

Time frequency characterization of evoked brain activity in multiple electrode recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ambiguity function diagrams; bistable images; EEG; time frequency analysis; Wigner distribution function	WIGNER DISTRIBUTION; SIGNAL ANALYSIS; EEG; PERCEPTION; TOOL	This paper explores global time frequency approaches to EEG data analysis with the Wigner Distribution Function and the Symmetric Ambiguity Function. The task chosen was to characterize the activity profile of EEG signals in sample Frontal, Central and Occipital electrodes from human subjects, coincident with the perception of a reversal in the orientation of a bistable Necker cube figure. The result of this analysis has implications for blind signal processing as the goal was to identify an unknown input source eliciting the observed EEG signals. The methods demonstrate an internally initiated EEG signal source not tied to a regularly anticipated external source. The results demonstrate the general applicability of the methods for a wide variety of neural and biological signals and systems. The findings can be summarized as the observation of high energy activity patterns in terms of significant dissimilarities in the waveform, both in time and frequency, in the Frontal and Occipital electrodes, approximately 200-600 ms prior to the appearance of the premotor potentials in the medial electrodes.

J	Vanhatalo, S; Voipio, J; Kaila, K				Vanhatalo, S; Voipio, J; Kaila, K			Full-band EEG (FbEEG): an emerging standard in electroencephalography	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						DC-EEG; broadband EEG; slow oscillations; fast oscillations; neonatal EEG; epilepsy; sleep	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL SPREADING DEPRESSION; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE SEIZURES; 600 HZ; VISUAL-CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; SEP COMPONENTS; DC RECORDINGS	While enormous resources have been recently invested into the development of a variety of neuroimaging techniques, the bandwidth of the clinical EEG, originally set by trivial technical limitations, has remained practically unaltered for over 50 years. An increasing amount of evidence shows that salient EEG signals are observed beyond the bandwidth of the routine clinical EEG, which is typically around 0.5-50 Hz. Physiological and pathological EEG activity ranges at least from 0.01 Hz to several hundred Hz, as demonstrated in recordings of spontaneous activity in the immature human brain, as well as during epileptic seizures, or various kinds of cognitive tasks and states in the adult brain. In the present paper, we will review several arguments leading to the conclusion that elimination of the lower (infraslow) or higher (ultrafast) bands of the EEG frequency spectrum in routine EEG leads to situations where salient and physiologically meaningful features of brain activity are ignored. Recording the full, physiologically relevant range of frequencies is readily attained with commercially available direct-current (DC) coupled amplifiers, which have a wide dynamic range and a high sampling rate. Such amplifiers, combined with appropriate DC-stable electrode-skin interface, provide a genuine full-band EEG (FbEEG). FbEEG is mandatory for a faithful, non-distorted and non-attenuated recording, and it does not have trade-offs that would favor any frequency band at the expense of another. With the currently available electrode, amplifier and data acquisition technology, FbEEG is likely to become the standard approach for a wide range of applications in both basic science and in the clinic.

Instantaneous frequencies of the heart beat, respiration and a-waves were then determined from 30-minutes recordings. The instantaneous cardiac frequency was defined as the inverse value of the time interval between two consecutive R-peaks. The instantaneous respiratory frequency was obtained from recordings of the excursions of thorax by application of the Hilbert transform. To obtain the instantaneous frequency of a-waves, the EEG signal recorded from the forehead was first analysed using the wavelet transform. Then the frequency band corresponding to a-waves was extracted and the Hilbert transform applied. Synchronization analysis was performed and the direction of coupling was ascertained, using pairs of instantaneous frequencies in each case. It is shown that the systems are weakly bidirectionally coupled. It was confirmed that, in conscious healthy humans, respiration drives cardiac activity. We also demonstrate from these analyses that a-activity drives both respiration and cardiac activity.

After TIPSS implantation hepatic decompression had been achieved and the liver function as well as the clinical status improved daily. Simultaneously, the digital EEG showed a decrease in the power of the theta band and an increase in the physiological alpha frequency band. The theta/alpha ratio decreased after TIPSS, despite an elevated arterial ammonia level. The patient had a well-preserved liver parenchyma before the occurrence of the BCS. After portal decompression by TIPSS, the liver function normalized and the liver resumed efficient synthesis and parts of its detoxification task. This regeneration capacity was documented by a rise in cholinesterase after TIPSS. After temporary substitution of albumin the serum albumin concentration returned to normal. Thus, some neurotoxic substances with high albumin-binding capacity may not be absorbed by the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, it appears likely that the length of time the brain is exposed to neurotoxic substances plays a role in the clinical and electroencephalographic changes. Compared to the conventional EEG the theta/alpha ratio reflected better metabolically conditioned electroencephalographic changes after TIPSS.

However, as both methods are based on handling two-way data, i.e. two-dimensional matrices, multi-way methods might improve the interpretation of frequency transformed multi-channel EEG of channel x frequency x time data. The multiway decomposition method Parallel Factor (PARAFAC), also named Canonical Decomposition (CANDECOMP), was recently used to decompose the wavelet transformed ongoing EEG of channel x frequency x time (Miwakeichi, F., Martinez-Montes, E., Valdes-Sosa, P.A., Nishiyama, N., Mizuhara, H., Yamaguchi, Y., 2004. Decomposing EEG data into space-time-frequency components using parallel factor analysis. Neuroimage 22, 1035-1045). In this article, PARAFAC is used for the first time to decompose wavelet transformed event-related EEG given by the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) encompassing ANOVA analysis of differences between conditions and 5-way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition. A flow chart is presented on how to perform data exploration using the PARAFAC decomposition on multi-way arrays. This includes (A) channel x frequency x time 3-way arrays of F test values from a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) between two stimulus conditions; (B) subject-specific 3-way analyses; and (C) an overall 5-way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition. The PARAFAC decompositions were able to extract the expected features of a previously reported ERP paradigm: namely, a quantitative difference of coherent occipital gamma activity between conditions of a visual paradigm. Furthermore, the method revealed a qualitative difference which has not previously been reported. The PARAFAC decomposition of the 3-way array of ANOVA F test values clearly showed the difference of regions of interest across modalities, while the 5-way analysis enabled visualization of both quantitative and qualitative differences. Consequently, PARAFAC is a promising data exploratory tool in the analysis of the wavelets transformed event-related EEG. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using a high resolution description of EEG rhythms and transients in terms of their time occurrence and width, frequency and amplitude, we present a detailed detection and parameterization of delta waves, including also the time occupied by each delta wave-a parameter inaccessible directly by previously applied signal processing methods. To validate the proposed parameterization, we construct a simple detector of sleep stages 3 and 4, based explicitly upon the classical criteria related to delta waves. To properly compare its performance to the inter-expert agreements and other expert systems, we sort out and discuss the methodology of reporting concordance in this context. Since the proposed parameterization proves to be compatible with the visual analysis of EEG, we can derive new variables for quantitative analysis of EEG patterns recognized for decades. As examples, we present a continuous description of delta waves and sleep spindles in the overnight sleep, and compare results to the traditional FFT-based estimates. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the concomitant studies require methods capable of describing the quantitative variation of the signal in both time and frequency. Here we present a quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis, based on the Orthogonal Discrete Wavelet Transform (ODWT), of generalized epileptic tonic-clonic EEG signals. Two quantifiers: the Relative Wavelet Energy (RWE) and the Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy (NTWS) have been used. The RWE gives information about the relative energy associated with the different frequency bands present in the EEG and their corresponding degree of importance. The NTWS is a measure of the order/disorder degree in the EEG signal. These two quantifiers were computing in EEG signals as provided by scalp electrodes of epileptic patients. We showed that the epileptic recruitment rhythm observed for generalized epileptic tonic-clonic seizures is accurately described by the RWE quantifier. In addition, a significant decrease in the NTWS was observed in the recruitment epoch, indicating a more rhythmic and ordered behavior in the brain electrical activity.

In the quantitative analysis, higher mean WE values of 16-channel EEGs under eyes open state imply higher degrees of EEG complexity compared with their counterparts under eyes closed state, which exhibits that more complex process will occur even when a very simple neural information processing happens (e.g., eyes open). In the qualitative analysis, blocked alpha rhythms were observed under eyes open state over posterior (particularly occipital) areas via the time-frequency, the time-space, and the time-frequency-space variability of relative wavelet intensity (RWI); and the evolution of delta rhythm is against the change of the WE under both two states, which suggests stronger delta activities are corresponding with lower degrees of EEG complexity (i.e., lower WE).

J	Clemens, B				Clemens, B			Pathological theta oscillations in idiopathic generalised epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						generalised epilepsy; electroencephalography	EEG COHERENCE; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; THALAMUS	Objective: To investigate spectral power, inter- and intra-hemispheric coherence in the interictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) of 41 patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. Methods: Two minutes of eyes-closed waking interictal EEG activity was analysed. Fast Fourier transformation was performed. Raw and age-regressed, Z-transformed values were computed for 19 electrodes and 4 frequency bands: absolute power (AP, ZAP), percent power (RP, ZRP), band mean frequency (MF, ZMF), inter-hemispheric (CO, ZCO) and intra-hemispheric (IC, ZIC) coherence. Compressed values (scalp averages) were computed for each parameter and 4 frequency bands. Compressed data of the patients (GE group) and the healthy controls (C group) were compared. Results: ZAP across the entire 1.5-25.0 Hz range was greater in the GE than in the C group. Delta and theta ZRP was greater, alpha ZRP was less in GE than in C. ZMF and ZIC was about the same in the GE and C groups. The crucial, band-specific finding was significantly greater theta-ZCO in the GE group, in contrast to normal or decreased ZCO in the other bands. In addition, within-group correlation between ZAP of the frequency bands, correlation of ZAP and ZCO, correlation of ZIC and ZCO were different for the two groups. Conclusions: The pattern of enhanced ZAP, ZRP, ZCO, together with normal ZIC and ZMF in the theta range was a peculiar, novel finding in GE. It was incompatible with any of the known patterns of altered power and coherence due to lesional or metabolic aetiology. This pattern presumably indicates the presence of a powerful, diffuse, hypersynchronous, hypercoherent theta oscillation at the thalamo-cortical level of the brain. The role of inter-hemispheric connections in maintaining this oscillation was suggested. The other findings suggest disturbed central regulation of EEG power and coherence in the interictal state.

J	Merica, H; Fortune, RD				Merica, H; Fortune, RD			Spectral power time-courses of human sleep EEG reveal a striking discontinuity at similar to 18 Hz - Marking the division between NREM-specific and wake/REM-specific fast frequency activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						beta band limits; brainstem-thalamic activating neurons; neuronal transition probability model; spectral analysis; spindles	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; HIGH-RESOLUTION; DELTA-WAVES; BANDS; BRAIN; WAKEFULNESS; HZ; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS	Spectral power time-courses over the ultradian cycle of the sleep electroencephalogram ( EEG) provide a useful window for exploring the temporal correlation between cortical EEG and sub-cortical neuronal activities. Precision in the measurement of these time-courses is thus important, but it is hampered by lacunae in the definition of the frequency band limits that are in the main based on wake EEG conventions. A frequently seen discordance between the shape of the beta power time-course across the ultradian cycle and that reported for the sequential mean firing rate of brainstem-thalamic activating neurons invites a closer examination of these band limits, especially since the sleep EEG literature indicates in several studies an intriguing non-uniformity of time-course comportment across the traditional beta band frequencies. We ascribe this tentatively to the sharp reversal of slope we have seen at similar to 18 Hz in our data and that of others. Here, therefore, using data for the first four ultradian cycles from 18 healthy subjects, we apply several criteria based on changes in time-course comportment in order to examine this non-uniformity as we move in 1 Hz bins through the frequency range 14-30 Hz. The results confirm and describe in detail the striking discontinuity of shape at around 18 Hz, with only the upper range ( 18-30 Hz) displaying a time-course similar to that of the firing-rate changes measured in brainstem activating neurons and acknowledged to engender states of brain activation. Fast frequencies in the lower range ( 15-18 Hz), on the other hand, are shown to be specific to non-rapid-eye-movement sleep.

Gamma band oscillations reveal neural network cortical coherence dysfunction in schizophrenia patients	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						gamma band; oscillations; EEG; schizophrenia; coherence; event-related potential; evoked power; induced oscillations; cognition; working memory	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY DEFICITS; WORKING-MEMORY; 40 HZ; AUDITORY-STIMULATION; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL NETWORKS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BIPOLAR DISORDER	Background: Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of h formation across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics. Methods. Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) werepresented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments. Results: Patients bad reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r=.32, p <.01). Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients havefrequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.

Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.

The InkCap was tested with temperature measurements on an electrically conductive phantom head and during structural and functional MRI (fMRI) recordings in 11 healthy human volunteers at 7 T. Combined EEG/fMRI measurements were conducted to study the interaction between the two modalities. The EEG recordings with the InkCap demonstrated up to a five-fold average decrease in signal variance during echo-planar imaging, with respect to a cap made of standard carbon fiber leads. During concurrent EEG/fMRI measurements in human volunteers, alpha oscillations were clearly detected at 7 T. Minimal artifacts were present in the T2* and high-resolution structural MR images of the brain parenchyma. Our results show that the InkCap technology considerably improves the quality of both EEG and (f)MRI during concurrent measurements even at 7 T. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Time-frequency methods such as wavelets, when carefully applied, allow simultaneous analysis of both types of activity. Here we used wavelets of different time and frequency resolutions in combination with spatial mapping to identify these processes. We found that auditory stimulation leads to a pattern of large-magnitude power increases and small-magnitude power decreases. The power increases, ranging from the theta to the beta frequency band, were accounted for by the transient auditory responses P50m, N100m and P200m. Following these responses, we observed a power reduction of non-phase-locked activity which occurred 250-500 ms after stimulus onset in the 14-24 Hz frequency range and could be localized to the temporal and parietal brain areas. These results indicate that auditory event-related processes consist not only of the well-established transient responses but also of power reductions of ongoing, non-phase-locked brain processes.

A generalized recursive estimation approach for 3rd-order time-frequency distributions (3rd-order TFD) is introduced. Based on 3rd-order TFD, time-variant estimations of biamplitude (BA), bicoherence (BC) and phase bicoherence (PBC) can be derived. Different smoothing windows and local moment functions for an optimization of the estimation proper-ties are investigated and compared. The methods are applied to signal simulations and EEG signals, and it can be shown that the new time-variant bispectral analysis results in a reliable quantification of QPC in the trace alternant EEG of healthy neonates.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 20 subjects through 16 channels have been studied under open eyes state and closed eyes state. The results indicate that EEG rhythm features and the dynamic process of brain activity can be revealed explicitly though the time-frequency variability and the time-frequency-space variability of BRIR. The alpha rhythm is best seen under eyes closed state and blocked when eyes are open generally, but it is strengthened in some times when it is blocked overall under open eyes state.

However, most EEG applications fail to capitalize on all of the data's available information, particularly that concerning the location of active sources in the brain. Localizing the sources of a given scalp measurement is only achieved by solving the so-called inverse problem. By introducing reasonable a priori constraints, the inverse problem can be solved and the most probable sources in the brain at every moment in time can be accurately localized. Methods and Results: Here, we review the different EEG source localization procedures applied during the last two decades. Additionally, we detail the importance of those procedures preceding and following source estimation that are intimately linked to a successful, reliable result. We discuss (1) the number and positioning of electrodes, (2) the varieties of inverse solution models and algorithms, (3) the integration of EEG source estimations with MRI data, (4) the integration of time and frequency in source imaging, and (5) the statistical analysis of inverse solution results. Conclusions and Significance: We show that modern EEG source imaging simultaneously details the temporal and spatial dimensions of brain activity, making it an important and affordable tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences.

It requires an optimal technique to continuously detect drivers' cognitive state related to abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control in (near-) real-time. The major challenges in developing such a system include: 1) the lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and 2) complicated and pervasive noise interferences in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In this paper, we develop a drowsiness-estimation system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) by combining independent component analysis (ICA), power-spectrum analysis, correlation evaluations, and linear regression model to estimate a driver's cognitive state when he/she drives a car in a virtual reality (VR)-based dynamic simulator. The driving error is defined as deviations between the center of the vehicle and the center of the cruising lane in the lane-keeping driving task. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively estimating drowsiness level using ICA-based multistream EEG spectra. The proposed ICA-based method applied to power spectrum of ICA components can successfully (1) remove most of EEG artifacts, (2) suggest an optimal montage to place EEG electrodes, and estimate the driver's drowsiness fluctuation indexed by the driving performance measure. Finally, we present a benchmark study in which the accuracy of ICA-component-based alertness estimates compares favorably to scalp-EEG based.

J	Tonner, PH; Bein, B				Tonner, P. H.; Bein, B.			Classic electroencephalographic parameters: Median frequency, spectral edge frequency etc	BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH-CLINICAL ANAESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						depth of anaesthesia; electroencephalogram; median frequency; spectral edge frequency; bispectral index		Even today many anaesthesiologists rely on parameters of the autonomic nervous system, such as blood pressure and heart rate to decide if a patient is adequately anaesthetized. It is thought that the electroencephalogram (EEG) may provide more information on the state of anaesthesia. Because full EEG analysis is not possible in the operating room, processed EEG parameters have been developed comprising complex information into a single value. Time and frequency domain parameters are calculated. The power spectrum results from a Fourier analysis and can be described by parameters such as median frequency, spectral edge frequency and others. It was noted, however, that anaesthetics at low doses increase frequency of the EEG, whereas at high doses the EEG is depressed. This biphasic response makes it difficult to clearly distinguish the exact anaesthetic state of a patient. Median frequency and spectral edge frequency have been studied in numerous studies. However, no sole indicator has been derived from the EEG that could serve as a descriptor of anaesthetic depth.	[Tonner, P.

In a previous paper [Neuroimage (in press)], we showed how the coupling among cortical areas can modulate the MEG or EEG spectrum and synchronise oscillatory dynamics. In this work, we exploit the model further by evaluating different measures of statistical dependencies (i.e., functional connectivity.) among MEG or EEG signals that are mediated by neuronal coupling. We have examined linear and nonlinear methods, including phase synchronisation. Our results show that each method can detect coupling but with different sensitivity profiles that depended on (i) the frequency specificity of the interaction (broad vs. narrow band) and (ii) the nature of the coupling (linear vs. nonlinear). Our analyses suggest that methods based on the concept of generalised synchronisation are the most sensitive when interactions encompass different frequencies (broadband analyses). In the context of narrow-band analyses, mutual information was found to be the most sensitive way to disclose frequency-specific couplings. Measures based on generalised synchronisation and phase synchronisation are the most sensitive to nonlinear coupling. These different sensitivity profiles mean that the choice of coupling measures can have dramatic effects on the cortical networks identified. We illustrate this using a single-subject MEG study of binocular rivalry and highlight the greater recovery of statistical dependencies among cortical areas in the beta band when mutual information is used.

A popular approach is identification of component modes on the basis of the time-varying spectrum of multichannel EEG recordings-in other words, a space/frequency/time atomic decomposition of the time-varying EEG spectrum. Previous work has been limited to only two of these dimensions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used to create space/time decompositions; suffering an inherent lack of uniqueness that is overcome only by imposing constraints of orthogonality or independence of atoms. Conventional frequency/time decompositions ignore the spatial aspects of the EEG. Framing of the data being as a three-way array indexed by channel, frequency, and time allows the application of a unique decomposition that is known as Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). Each atom is the tri-linear decomposition into a spatial, spectral, and temporal signature. We applied this decomposition to the EEG recordings of five subjects during the resting state and during mental arithmetic. Common to all subjects were two atoms with spectra signatures whose peaks were in the theta and alpha range. These signatures were modulated by physiological state, increasing during the resting stage for alpha and during mental arithmetic for theta. Furthermore, we describe a new method (Source Spectra Imaging or SSI) to estimate the location of electric current sources from the EEG spectrum. The topography of the theta atom is frontal and the maximum of the corresponding SSI solution is in the anterior frontal cortex. The topography of the alpha atom is occipital with maximum of the SSI solution in the visual cortex. We show that the proposed decomposition can be used to search for activity with a given spectral and topographic profile in new recordings, and that the method may be useful for artifact recognition and removal.

It allows the frequency and amplitude of a time-series to be evaluated with excellent time resolution. In this article we consider the application of EMD to the analysis of neuronal activity in visual cortical area V4 of a macaque monkey performing a visual spatial attention task. We show that, by virtue of EMD, field potentials can be resolved into a sum of intrinsic components with different degrees of oscillatory content. Low-frequency components in single-trial recordings contribute to the average visual evoked potential (AVEP), whereas high-frequency components do not, but are identified as gamma-band (30-90 Hz) oscillations. The magnitude of time-varying gamma activity is shown to be enhanced when the monkey attends to a visual stimulus as compared to when it is not attending to the same stimulus. Comparison with Fourier analysis shows that EMD may offer better temporal and frequency resolution. These results support the idea that the magnitude of gamma activity reflects the modulation of V4 neurons by visual spatial attention. EMD, coupled with instantaneous frequency analysis, is demonstrated to be a useful technique for the analysis of neurobiological time-series.

The translation of these EEG signals to control signals of a device is based on a good classification of various kinds of imagination. We have developed a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis approach for classifying motor imagery tasks. Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) were constructed based on wavelet decomposition and event-related (de) synchronization patterns were extracted from symmetric electrode pairs. The weighted energy difference of the electrode pairs was then compared to classify the imaginary movement. The present method has been tested in nine human subjects and reached an averaged classification rate of 78%. The simplicity of the present technique suggests that it may provide an alternative method for EEG-based BCI applications.

By using perfectly the hardware and software resources of computer, the system provides various complementary functions for sampling, analysis and processing of EEG signals., In addition, the data base management technique used in this system enables to perform effective management of patient information and EEG data. Particularly, from the view of clinical application and medical research, the system uses modem signal analysis methods synthetically to provide itself with not only analysis functions in time or frequency domain of traditional EEG instrument, but also the functions of extracting the band relative intensity ratio (BRIR) of the basic rhythms in EEG signals, filtering with zero phase-error and extracting feature waveforms of EEG signal with time-frequency, signal analysis methods. In order to improve the ratio of performance to cost, the system integrates the functions of EEG topography and automatic analysis of sleep stages, thus the EEG data can be analyzed from several way with the instrument to detect clinical diagnosis information effectively. By system integration method, the instrument is not only of diagnosis functions, but also of monitoring and analysis, so the instrument system is appropriate to wide application and is of high ratio of performance to cost.

The earliest use of qEEG was by Hans Berger in 1932 and since this time over 1,600 peer reviewed journal articles have been published in which qEEG was used to evaluate traumatic brain injury. Quantitative EEG is a direct measure of the electrical energies of the brain and network dynamics which are disturbed following a traumatic brain injury. The most consistent findings are: 1-reduced power in the higher frequency bands (8 to 40 Hz) which is linearly related to the magnitude of injury to cortical gray matter, 2-increased slow waves in the delta frequency band (1 to 4 Hz) in the more severe cases of TBI which is linearly related to the magnitude of cerebral white matter injury and, 3-changes in EEG coherence and EEG phase delays which are linearly related to the magnitude of injury to both the gray matter and the white matter, especially in frontal and temporal lobes. A review of qEEG reliability and clinical validation studies showed high predictive and content validity as determined by correlations between qEEG and clinical measures such as neuropsychological test performance, Glasgow Coma Scores, length of coma and MRI biophysical measures. Inexpensive and high speed qEEG NeuroImaging methods were also discussed in which the locations of maximal deviations from normal in 3-dimensions were revealed. Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of qEEG with a reduced number of EEG channels offers the feasibility of real-time monitoring of the EEG using Blue Tooth technology inside of a football helmet so that immediate evaluation of the severity and extent of brain injury in athletes can be accomplished. Finally, qEEG biofeedback treatment for the amelioration of complaints and symptoms following TBI is discussed.	151 Vet Adm Med Ctr, Res & Dev Serv, Neuroimaging Lab, Bay Pines, FL 33504 USA		Thatcher, RW (corresponding author), 151 Vet Adm Med Ctr, Res & Dev Serv, Neuroimaging Lab, Bay Pines, FL 33504 USA.	rwthatcher@yahoo.com							81	14	14	0	13	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES			0-387-32564-6				2006							241	265		10.1007/0-387-32565-4_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/0-387-32565-4_11			25	Clinical Neurology; Sport Sciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Neurosciences & Neurology; Sport Sciences	BEK07					2022-08-02	WOS:000237508100011

Typically this is performed by calculating the coherence between a single EEG electrode and a rectified EMG channel. However, there are strong biological reasons to expect that the cortical to muscular communication is many-to-many as opposed to one-to-one. Here we describe the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to find linear combinations of EEG channels and EMG channels separately. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is then used to determine Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) that estimated the envelope of the EMG ICs. We demonstrate that at least 2 EEG ICs correspond with EMG IC IMFs with much greater significance that the pairwise EEG-EMG comparison. Moreover, the proposed method successfully untangles the similar to 10Hz and similar to 30Hz effects of the corticomuscular coupling which are thought to underlie different neural processes. We suggest that the ICA/EMD approach is worthy of further exploration.

The aim of the present study was to classify the TD+ADHD comorbidity in the neurocognitive domain and to elucidate the neurophysiological background of TD+ADHD coexistence by analyzing event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in the theta (3-7.5 Hz) frequency band. Methods: Event-related potentials were recorded at 10 electrodes in 53 children (9-13 years old) from four groups (healthy controls, TD-only, ADHD-only, and combined TD+ADRD patients), while they performed an auditory selective attention task requiring a button press to a predefined target. Event-related theta oscillations were analyzed by means of time-frequency decomposition (wavelet analysis) in two latency ranges-early (0 - 200 ms) and late (200 - 450 ms). The effects of psychopathology factors (TD and ADHD) and task variables (attended channel and stimulus task relevance) on early (ETR) and late (LTR) theta response's were evaluated statistically. Theta response measures were further correlated with psychopathology scores and spontaneous theta EEG activity. Results: (1) The ETR was enhanced only in comorbid children and did not differ between the control, TD-only, and ADHD-only groups. (2) The LTR was larger in children with ADHD (ADHD-only and comorbid), but this effect was mediated by the spontaneous theta EEG activity. (3) The ETR was larger to attended stimuli at frontal-central electrodes contralateral to the side of attention, to the target stimulus type at frontal locations, and at the hemisphere contralateral to the side of the response. The functional reactivity and scalp distribution of ETRs were modulated by psychopathological factors. Conclusions: In the neurocognitive domain, the TD+ADHD comorbidity can be identified as a unique nosologic entity. Both the spontaneous theta activity and late event-related theta oscillations appear as neurophysiological markers of the ADHD condition. In children, the early event-related theta oscillations may be associated with representations of relevant target features in working memory. Significance: (1) A new model is proposed according to which TD+ADHD comorbidity can be classified at different levels (from neurobiological to cognitive). (2) The functional significance of stimulus-synchronized theta oscillations in children is described for the first time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated the neurophysiologic time pattern of multistable perceptual changes by means of a simultaneous recording with electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Volunteers responded to the subjective perception of a sudden change between stable patterns of illusionary motion (multistable transition) during a stroboscopic paradigm. We found a global deceleration of the EEG frequency prior to a transition and an occipital-accentuated acceleration after a transition, as obtained by low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) analysis. A decrease in BOLD response was found in the prefrontal cortex before, and an increase after the transitions was observed in the right anterior insula, the MT/V5 regions and the SMA. The thalamus and left superior temporal gyrus showed a pattern of decrease before and increase after transitions. No such temporal course was found in the control condition. The multimodal approach of data acquisition allows us to argue that the top-down control of illusionary visual perception depends on selective attention, and that a diminution of vigilance reduces selective attention. These are necessary conditions to allow for the occurrence of a perception discontinuity in absence of a physical change of the stimulus. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Balconi, M; Lucchiari, C				Balconi, M; Lucchiari, C			EEG correlates (event-related desynchronization) of emotional face elaboration: A temporal analysis	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						emotional face; event-related desynchronization; temporal analysis; hemispheric asymmetry	BRAIN POTENTIALS; AFFECTIVE STYLE; SYNCHRONIZATION; HEMISPHERES; AROUSAL; CORTEX; ALPHA; AREAS; THETA	An EEG frequency band analysis was conducted, in order to explore the significance of brain oscillations (delta, theta, alpha and beta) for emotional face comprehension during different post-stimulus time intervals (50-150; 150-250; 250-350; and 350-450ms). The study was conducted on twenty adults who looked at emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful) or neutral faces. The results showed that motivational significance of the stimulus can modulate the power synchronization (event-related desynchronization (ERD) decrease) within the frequency band of delta and theta. We propose that delta and theta respond to variations in processing stage of emotional face: whereas, delta reflects updating of the stimulus, theta responds to the emotional significance of face. The findings revealed that emotional discrimination by theta is observable mainly within 150-250 time interval and that it is more distributed on anterior regions, whereas delta is maximally synchronized within 250-350 interval and more posteriorly distributed for all the stimulus type. Finally, a right-hemisphere dominance was found for theta during emotional face comprehension. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

Combined time-frequency analyses of alpha and theta power revealed a clear dissociation between PD patients (N=10) and age-matched healthy controls (N=10). PD patients used sub-optimal stimulus encoding strategies for subsequent maintenance and recall, whereas the controls mainly used categorization processes. In contrast to controls, PD patients showed significantly less theta increase and upper alpha suppression at frontal locations and significant laterality of early posterior theta and lower-2 alpha oscillations at right posterior locations. These findings suggest that the fronto-striatal circuits participate in visual categorization processes. Furthermore, theta and alpha oscillations appear to be involved in mediating the integration processes in mnemonic networks underlying visual categorization. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A time-frequency analysis was performed for standard and target stimuli. The study revealed an early (26-59 ms) phase-locked oscillation. Around 200 ms, a non-phase locked response was found for standard and target stimuli in temporal posterior electrodes. At about 360 ms, a phase-locked oscillation was observed only after target stimuli in the "counting targets" condition. During the "reading" task this late activity was not found, and energy increases were lower than during "counting" task. The early oscillation may be related to the sensory processing of the stimuli. The response around 200 ms may be involved in auditory mismatch and/or memory retrieval, and late activity is probably a P300-related response. Attention enhances all these activities.

Methods: Spatio-temporal variability of brain oscillations (indexed by short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs)) was assessed by the probability-classification analysis of SPs. As a result, multi-dimensional SP-vector for each analysis EEG epoch was obtained. Results: It was demonstrated that interictal EEG was characterized (a) by a significant decrease of spatio-temporal variability of brain oscillations, (b) by longer periods of temporal stabilization for operational modules which comprise larger number of cortical areas, and (c) by significantly more intermittent recurrence when compared with EEG of control subjects. Generally it was shown that EEG channels display different states of coordination independently on their correlation and coherence using brain oscillations at multiple frequencies. Conclusions: Results of this study suggested that EEG correlate of chronic epileptogenesis in the brain is a particular metastable state of biopotential field, which can be estimated by SP-vector. The fact that all results were significantly different from surrogate EEGs reflects a nonoccasional and thus, most likely, an adaptive nature of spatio-temporal reorganization in interictal EEG. Significance: Parameters of spatio-temporal organization of interictal EEG without the signs of epileptiform activity can be considered as additional information in premorbid diagnostics of status epilepticus, and may also provide insights into basic laws that govern brain oscillations in general.

Complex ICA aims to model functionally independent sources as representing patterns of spatio-temporal dynamics. Applied to EEG data, it may allow non-invasive measurement of flow trajectories of cortical potentials. As complex ICA has a higher complexity and number of parameters than time-domain ICA, it is important to determine the extent to which complex ICA applied to brain signals is stable across decompositions. This question is investigated for the complex ICA method applied to the 5-Hz frequency band of data from a selective attention EEG experiment(1).

We used ICA to determine the brain responses to painful stimulation of the oesophagus. Methods: Twelve subjects with a median age of 41 years were included. With a nasal endoscope, two series of 35 electrical stimuli at the pain threshold were given to the distal oesophagus and the EEG was subjected to ICA. The sessions were separated by 30 minutes. For each component head models, event related images, spectral perturbation, coherence analysis, and dipoles were extracted. The most valid components were found according to time/frequency information and reliability in both experiments. Results: Reliable components with the most valid dipoles were found in the thalamus, insula, cingulate gyrus, and sensory cortex. Time locked activities were consistent with upstream activation of these areas, and cross coherence analysis of the sources demonstrated dynamic links in the beta (14-25 Hz) and gamma (25-50 Hz) bands between the suggested networks of neurones. The thalamic components were time and phase locked intermittently, starting around 50 ms. In the cingulate gyrus, the posterior areas were always firstly activated, followed by the middle and anterior regions. Components with dipoles in the sensory cortex were localised in several regions of the somatosensory area. Conclusions: The method gives new information relating to the localisation and dynamics between neuronal networks in the brain to pain evoked from the human oesophagus, and should be used to increase our understanding of clinical pain.

The skull, scalp and brain tissue do not distort magnetic fields, so the cortical activity can be easily measured. MEG is starting to be used to explore the effects of various psychopharmacological agents on resting brain, sensory and cognitive processing. Scopolamine and agents enhancing GABA functions have shown differential effects on cortical neural oscillations. Further, with GABA, serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine transmissions have differential effects on early cortical and pre-attentional processing in the auditory and frontal cortices. Monoamines also differently regulate the activity of the somatosensory cortex. Taken together, MEG with a resolution of milliseconds allows exploration of focal cortical effects of psychopharmacological agents giving information different from other brain-imaging modalities.

C	Ince, NF; Arica, S; Tewfik, A			IEEE	Ince, Nuri Firat; Arica, Sami; Tewfik, Ahmed			Classification of motor imagery EEG recordings with subject specific time-frequency patterns	2006 IEEE 14TH SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2			Turkish	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 14th Signal Processing and Communications Applications	APR 16-19, 2006	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE				We introduce an adaptive time-frequency plane feature extraction and classification system for the classification of motor imagery EEG recordings in a Brain Computer Interface task. First the EEG is segmented in time axis with a merge/divide strategy. This is followed by a clustering procedure in the frequency domain in each selected time segment to choose the most discriminant frequency features. The resulting adaptively selected time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis - PCA for dimension reduction and fed to a linear discriminant classifier. The algorithm was applied to all nine subjects of the 2002 BCI Competition. The classification performance of our proposed algorithm varied between 70% and 92.6% for each subject, which gives an average classification accuracy of 80.6%. The algorithm outperformed the reference standard Adaptive Autoregressive model based classification procedure for all subjects. This latter approach had an average error rate of %76.3 on the same subjects. We observed that the time-frequency tiling selected by the algorithm for EEG signal classification differs from subject to subject. Furthermore, the two hemispheres of the same subject are represented by distinct time-frequency segmentations and features. We argue that the method can adapt automatically to physio-anatomical differences and subject specific motor imagery patterns.

To infer user intent, EEG signals are classified by algorithms which typically use only one of the several types of information available in these signals. One such BCI uses slow cortical potential (SCP) measures to classify single trials. We complemented these measures with estimates of high-frequency (gamma-band) activity, which has been associated with attentional and intentional states. Using a simple linear classifier, we obtained significantly greater classification accuracy using both types of information from the same recording epochs compared to using SCPs alone.

Within a few minutes, a cable car facilitates an ascent from 1702 to 2700 m above sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mmHg (as compared to 760 mmHg at sea level). In this study, 10 healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at 990 m and 2700 m in altitude. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light flashed (repeated 50 times). The corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. From the ECG heart rate and heart rate variability measures in the time and frequency domain were calculated. An event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis was performed with the EEG data. Finally, the EEG activity and the ECG parameters were correlated. The study showed that with the fast ascent to 2700 m the heart rate increased and the heart rate variability measures decreased. The correlation analysis indicated a close relationship between the EEG activity and the heart rate and heart rate variability. Furthermore it was shown for the first time that the beta ERS in the 14-18 Hz frequency range (post-movement beta ERS) was significantly reduced at high altitude. Very interesting also is the loss of correlation between EEG activity and cardiovascular measures during finger movement at high altitude. The suppressed post-movement beta ERS at the altitude of 2700 m may be interpreted as results of an increased cortical excitability level when compared with the reference altitude at 990 m above sea level.

A study on these items was carried out. In addition, spectral analysis and a new analysis, performed in time domain, were compared in the assessment of HE. The EEG tracings of 73 cirrhotic patients with HE were analyzed. Artifact-free periods of about 1 min were selected. Equipment noise was measured by short-circuiting all the electrodes. The equipment noise was notable below 1.5 Hz; the best epoch length was 4 s and the statistical errors were minimal for the band with the highest relative power. Nineteen per cent of the tracings were unstable. The spectral values were found to be related to liver function and to the degree of HE, whereas the relationship with psychometric variables was poor. The indexes computed by time-domain analysis were found to be better related to psychometric findings. We have provided information on the optimisation of spectral EEG analysis and presented a time-domain analysis giving results related to psychometric tests and liver function.

A cable car allows an ascent within a few minutes to 2700 m, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mm of mercury compared to 760 mm at sea level. Ten healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at an altitude of 990 m and 2700 m. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light had flashed. The green light flashed 50 times. Simultaneously to the task, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The event-related desynchronization (ERD) analysis of the EEG data showed that changes in alpha ERD values are not significant, but event-related synchronization (ERS) values in the beta band decrease significantly from around 50 % to 10 %. Furthermore, the mean frequency of the beta band increased from 16.68 Hz to 16.81 Hz (p = 0.0019) with the ascent. The suppressed post-movement beta ERS at an altitude of 2700 m may therefore be interpreted as a result of an increased cortical excitability level when compared with the reference altitude of 990 m above sea level.

This technique is based on the concept of generalized entropy of a given probability distribution, known as the Renyi entropy. This concept allows defining generalized fractal dimension of encephalogram (EEG) and determining fractal spectra of encephalographic signals. These spectra contain information of both frequency and amplitude characteristics of EEG and can be used together with well-accepted techniques of EEG analysis as an enhancement of the latter. Powered by volume visualization of the brain activity, the method provides new clues for understanding the mental processes in humans.

The P300 potential is an important component of the ERP waveform and has been used to study cognition as well as psychiatric disorders such as alcoholism. In this work, we aim to further understand the nature of the event-related oscillation (ERO) components which form the P300 wave and how these components may be used to differentiate alcoholic individuals from controls. Methods: The S-transform decomposition method is used to derive TFR's from single trial and trial-averaged ERP data acquired during a visual oddball task. These TFR's are averaged within time and frequency windows to provide ERO measures for further investigation. ERO measures are compared with conventional ERP amplitude measures using correlation analyses. Statistical analyses was performed with MANOVA and stepwise logistic regressions to contrast an age-matched sample of control (N = 100) and alcoholic male subjects (N = 100). Results: The results indicate that the P300 waveform, elicited using infrequent salient stimuli, is composed of frontal theta and posterior delta activations. The frontal theta activation does not closely correspond to any of the conventional ERP components and is therefore best analyzed using spectral methods. Between group comparisons and group predictions indicate that the delta and theta band ERO's, which underlie the P300, show deficits in the alcoholic group. Additionally, each band contributes unique information to discriminate between the groups. Conclusions: ERO measures which underlie and compose the P300 wave provide additional information to that offered by conventional ERP amplitude measures, and serve as useful genetic markers in the study of alcoholism. Significance: Studying the ERP waveform using time-frequency analysis methods opens new avenues of research in electrophysiology which may lead to a better understanding of cognitive processes, lead to improved clinical diagnoses, and provide phenotypes/endophenotypes for genetic analyses.

The estimation of bicoherence allows us to determine whether a given time series represents a linear random process in cases where the bicoherence is trivial, i.e., a mere constant independent of frequency. In this study, we investigated the proportion of EEG epochs with nontrivial bicoherence during surgical anesthesia with propofol and alfentanil as an indicator for the degree of nonlinearity in the EEG. We reanalyzed 90 h of EEG recorded from 20 patients undergoing abdominal surgery using the Hinich procedure, which provides a statistical test for the following hypothesis: the EEG is a linear random process. In approximately 90% of all artifact-free, stationary EEG epochs, the bicoherence was found to be zero or a mere constant. Under these conditions, the EEG can be considered as a linear random process. Our findings suggest that the spectral information in the frequency domain delivered by the EEG monitoring during anesthesia is largely contained in the power spectrum of the signal. This calls into question the benefit of EEG bispectral analysis for monitoring anesthesia effect.

In recent years, brain - computer interface (BCI) based on EEG has been a growing field of research and development [4][5]. This paper presents to identify time frequency components of movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) [2][3][6] associated with the human voluntary muscle behaviors using the wavelet transform [8]. The EEG was recorded with the 5-channel referential derivations, Fz,Cz,C3,C4,Pz, referenced to the right earlobe based on the international 10-20 system [1]-[3]. The voluntary activity was recorded with the electrode placed on the palm side of the metacarpophalangeal joint when the subjects flexed the right - or left - hand index finger respectively and eyes closed.

The relevance of QEEG to the evaluation of behavioral disorders and pharmacological interventions	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG oscillations; EEG regulation; event-related potentials; homeostatic system; pharmaco-EEG; psychiatric disorders; QEEG	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; INPUTS; OCD	It has become apparent that the electrical signals recorded from the scalp of healthy individuals under standardized conditions are predictable, and that patients with a wide variety of brain disorders display activity with unusual features. It also early became apparent that centrally active medications produced striking changes in this activity. The application of computerized signal analysis to EEG recordings collected using standardized procedures has made it possible to obtain quantitative descriptions of brain electrical activity (QEEG) in normal individuals and patients with disorders of brain function or structure, as well as quantitative description of the ways in which centrally active medications alter this activity (Pharmaco-EEG or "PEEG"). With the emergence of three-dimensional EEG source localization techniques, it has recently become possible to visualize the mathematically most probable generators of QEEG abnormalities within the brain as well as the neuroanatomical regions where abnormal activity is most altered by efficacious medication. As QEEG and PEEG have evolved, a vast body of facts has been accumulated, describing changes in the EEG or event-related potentials (ERPs) observed. in a variety of brain disorders or after administration of a variety of medications. With some notable exceptions, these studies,have, tended to be phenomenological rather than analytic. There has not been a systematic attempt to integrate these phenomena in order to build better understanding of how the abnormal behaviors of a particular psychiatric patient might be related to the specific pattern of the deviant electrical activity, nor just how pharmacological reduction of that deviant activity may have resulted in more normal behavior. This article is an endeavor to provide a more specific theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of the homeostatic system underlying the regulation of the QEEG, and the mechanisms revealed by Pharmaco-EEG that aid in correcting these illnesses.

The method is based on the time-frequency distribution of the signal. As spikes are short time broadband events, they are represented as ridges in the time-frequency domain. In this domain, the high instantaneous energy of spikes allows them to be distinguishable from the background. To detect spikes, the time-frequency distribution of the signal of interest is first enhanced to attenuate the noise. Two frequency slices of the enhanced time-frequency distribution are then extracted and subjected to the smoothed nonlinear energy operator (SNEO). Finally, the output of the SNEO is thresholded to localise the position of the spikes in the signal. The SNEO is employed to accentuate the spike signature in the extracted frequency slices.

Human experts carry out this task relying on the direct visualization of EEG epochs. Techniques that enhance an intuitive visualization may encourage a wider use of more abstract descriptors, such as frequency domain features. Is paper presents a feature extraction method for EEG signals based on FFT and principal component analysis. The result of the method is a characterization of EEG epochs with only two variables. Density plots of this 2D projection show compact clusters that correspond to sleep behavioral states. The distance to the centroid of a cluster is a reliable scoring criterion which is both easy to visualize and easy to automate. The techniques presented here have been shown to work reliably for both human and rat sleep studies.

Maintaining high cognition is particularly important for the drivers behind the steering wheel. It requires an optimal estimation system to online continuously detect drivers' cognitive state related to abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based alertness estimation system with automatic feature selection mechanism. The independent component analysis (ICA) is used first to decompose the measured electroencephalogram (EEG). Then, a time-frequency analysis is performed to evaluate the time-frequency characteristic of each ICA component. We also proposed a new adaptive feature extracting mechanism for selections of frequency bands and ICA components. Different ranges of the alpha rhythm of subjects can be evaluated by the adaptive feature extracting mechanism according to the correlation coefficient between the ICA time-frequency response and the driving performance. The extracted features are then trained both by linear regression model and Self-cOnstructing Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Network (SONFIN) for the estimation of driving performance. The training and testing results of SONFIN are 96% and 91%, while the results of linear regression model are 90% and 85%, respectively. It demonstrates that the proposed adaptive feature extracting mechanism can achieve a great performance in alertness estimation with frequency band and component selection.

The brain circuitry involved in generating the beta oscillations is not well understood but appears to involve both cortical and subcortical structures. We have shown that single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex consistently elicit a brief beta oscillation. Reducing the local cortical excitability using low-frequency repetitive TMS does not change the amplitude of the induced beta oscillation (Van Der Werf and Paus in Exp Brain Res DOI 10.1007/s00221-006-0551-2). Here, we investigated the possible involvement of the thalamus in the cortically expressed beta response to single-pulse TMS. We included eight patients with Parkinson's disease who had undergone unilateral surgical lesioning of the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. We administered 50 single pulses of TMS, at an intensity of 120% of resting motor threshold, over the left and right primary motor cortex and, at the same time, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) using a 60-electrode cap. We were able to perform analyses on seven EEG data sets and found that stimulation of the unoperated hemisphere (with thalamus) resulted in higher amplitudes of the single-trial induced beta oscillations than in the operated hemisphere (with thalamotomy). The beta oscillation obtained in response to pulses applied over the unoperated hemisphere was also higher than that obtained in healthy controls. We suggest that (1) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex is higher in Parkinson's disease patients, (2) thalamotomy serves to reduce the abnormally high TMS-induced beta oscillations, and (3) the motor thalamus facilitates the cortically generated oscillation, through cortico-subcortico-cortical feedback loops.

It estimated the time-frequency energy of electroencephalogram (EEG) with Matching pursuit and Wigner-Ville distribution. Matching pursuit decomposed Event-Related EEG into a linear expansion of waveforms. A time-frequency energy distribution was derived by adding the Wigner-Ville distribution of each selected atoms. With the prior knowledge, the approach obtained the ratios of energy value over the motor-cortex as extracted features. The classifying time segment was determined according to Mahalanobis distance, and the feature vectors in this segment were used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) as a classifier. The results showed that the minimum error rates for 4 subjects were all lower than 15%, and the maximum mutual information were more than 0.6. The proposed method gives generally applicable, robust and high-resolution estimates.

However, it is matter of debate whether EEG arousals trigger leg movements or both EEG arousal and leg movements are separate expressions of a common pathophysiological mechanism. Previous studies showed that cardiac and cerebral changes occur in association with periodic limb movements (PLMs), and that a combining increase in delta activity and in heart rate (HR) occurs before the onset of PLMs. Patients and methods: This paper presents some preliminary data, obtained from a sample of 5 subjects with PLMD not associated to restless legs syndrome. To describe the temporal pattern of cardiac and EEG activities changes concomitant with PLMs in NREM sleep we used time frequency analysis technique. Results: PLM onset is heralded by a significant activation of HR and delta activity power, beginning 4.25 and 3 s respectively before PLMs onset, with PLMs onset and arousal onset failing together. Discussion: Delta and HR variations herald PLMs and activation of fast EEG frequencies. Such a stereotyped pattern is common in PLMs and in spontaneous or stimuli-induced arousals. Moreover a similar pattern seems to encompass the CAP phenomenon. The whole of these phenomena can be linked to the activity of a common brainstem system, which receives peripheral inputs, regulating the vascular, cardiac and respiratory activities and synchronizing them to cortical oscillations of EEG.

Methods: Using the Gabor expansion, a fast Fourier transformation based method, biamplitude, bicoherence and phase-bicoherence time courses of both burst and interburst patterns have been determined (common average reference EEG recordings). With a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz and a frequency grid of 1-1.5 double left right arrow 3.5-4.5 Hz (region-of-interest), a number of 15 frequency pairs result. These pairs have been investigated. Results: The burst and the interburst patterns are characterized by temporally and topographically different QPC profiles. All differences are dominant at the electrode Fp1 followed by Fp2. There is a significant difference (combined multiple and global test strategy) in the QPC characteristics between both patterns within the time period from 0.75 to 1.5 s after the pattern onset at electrode Fp1. The maximal QPC in burst patterns (especially at Fp1) can be observed during this time period. In contrast to this finding, maximal QPC in interburst patterns (at Fp1) are reached immediately after the onset and at 3 s. Summarising all findings, a QPC-rhythm of 0.1 Hz during TA can be assumed. Conclusions: It can be assumed that the QPC rhythm of the TA is generated by a pattern-spanning time-variant phase-locking process and there are indications for a possible correspondence between the QPC rhythm and vegetative rhythms. Significance: This study showed that advanced, time-variant analysis methods quantifying QPC rhythms are able to add new scientific information to the understanding of nature, characteristics and significance of TA in the neonatal EEG.

The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light flashed (repeated 50 times). The corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. From the ECG heart rate and heart rate variability measures in the time and frequency domain were calculated. An event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis was performed with the EEG data. Finally, the EEG activity and the ECG parameters were correlated. The study showed that with the fast ascent to 2700 m the heart rate increased and the heart rate variability measures decreased. Furthermore it was shown for the first time that the beta ERS in the 14 to 18 Hz frequency range (post-movement beta ERS) was significantly reduced at high altitude. Very interesting also is the loss of correlation between EEG activity and cardiovascular measures during finger movement at high altitude.

These systems can detect discrete stages (Stage MT, W, 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM). But, more detailed information extraction is impossible by them. Therefore, we tried to continuous wavelet analysis applied to EEG signals in order to extract more precise information for the stages. And we have proposed a modified wavelet transform method and an extraction method of time series of peak frequency based on time-frequency analysis. It is confirmed that the modified wavelet transform method is effective in some subjects, and it is clarified that feature extraction will be improved by the parameter timing. In this paper, we analyze the data of six all-night sleep experiments in our laboratory, and tested the effectiveness of the modified wavelet transform method in more detail by tuning the parameters. From these results, we could direct the way of improving the modified wavelet transform method and extracting the feature about sleep stages.

It was found that ongoing oscillations between 3 and 16 Hz are relevant to the generation of auditory evoked fields (AEF). First, phases of the oscillation were locked at around the timings of N100m, but randomly distributed from trial to trial at the other timings. Secondly, amplitudes of the oscillation were larger on average at around the timings of N100m than at the other timings, although the amplitudes fluctuated from trial to trial with almost the same standard deviations throughout the periods of observation. Thirdly, spatial distributions of the oscillatory activities were often reduced to an equivalent current dipole in the auditory cortex at around the timings of N100m, but seldom reduced at the other timings. An explanation of these results would be to suppose several oscillators within the cortex whose phases are locked at around the timings of N100m, but fluctuated randomly at the other timings.

We searched for a relationship between EEG amplitude modulation and modulation of simultaneously recorded cardiovascular variables and attempted to determine whether this relationship was altered in subjects with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Methods: We recorded EEG, blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), heart rate, respirations, and blood pressure from subjects with POTS and controls during head-up tilt. Time-frequency analysis of 0.512-s epochs of EEG was performed to determine peak alpha amplitude. Spectra were divided into 3 bands: ultraslow, middle, and respiratory. Results: EEG alpha amplitude modulation in all frequency bands was reduced in POTS subjects while supine. EEG modulation decreased in controls with head-up tilt but not in POTS subjects. Heart rate modulation in the respiratory frequency band decreased with head-up tilt and was significantly less (P<0.02) in ultraslow and respiratory frequency bands in POTS subjects after head-up tilt. Blood pressure and MCA flow velocity modulation in middle and respiratory bands increased with head-up tilt to a greater degree in POTS subjects. Blood pressure and MCA flow velocity modulation frequencies were moderately correlated, but correlations between EEG and cardiovascular variable modulation frequencies were generally low, being highest in the respiratory band but not statistically significant. Conclusion: There are subtle differences in EEG amplitude modulation in subjects with POTS. Altered EEG amplitude modulation in POTS may reflect altered brainstem physiology in this disorder.

Analysis of time-varying coherence of EEG during face recognition based on harmonic transform	2005 27TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-7	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2005	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Chinese Acad Engn Sci			NOUNS; POWER	Distinct cortical activity during face recognition was reported by a number of studies. Classical coherence analysis reflects the synchronization between two random processes in certain frequency under the assumption that the signals are stationary. In EEG study, the coherence analysis is mainly used to analyze the coupling and drive-response relation about the brain activities in different regions. Classical coherence analysis can extract the rhythmic consistency of the EEG activities in different regains. However, classical coherence can not extract the transient synchrony characteristics of brain activities. In order to track the spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG activities during cognitive conception, the time-varying coherence analysis is proposed. The EEG of 10 participants was recorded during recognition of familiar and unfamiliar faces, experiment results show that there is obvious difference about the model of information communication between temporal region and other brain regions in a rhythm during cognitive processing.

These nonstationary signals require some form of nonstationary analysis to detect seizures in the EEG data. A time-frequency (TF) matched filter has been previously proposed to detect seizures in both adult and newborn EEG. A method which constructs a reference or template set from a feature of EEG seizures, rather than the whole EEG seizure, displayed the most promising results. However this method suffered from an inability to adequately represent patient variability in the template set while simultaneously maintaining a low false detection rate. A new method of the TF matched filter is proposed that halves the template set required by approximating the templates with a more general ambiguity domain function representation. This proposed method is also less sensitive to false detections when a larger reference set is used, as evidenced by the findings on both simulated and real neonatal EEG.

J	Subasi, A; Ercelebi, E				Subasi, A; Ercelebi, E			Classification of EEG signals using neural network and logistic regression	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; epileptic seizure; lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT); logistic regression (LR); muttitayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN)	WAVELET ANALYSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSFORM; DESIGN	Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in diagnostic classification. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform and classification using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. In epileptic seizure classification we used lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT) as a preprocessing method to increase the computational speed. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational toad of those algorithms that were based on classical wavelet transform (CWT). In this study, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers) the traditional statistical method based on Logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on ANN. Logistic regression as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used LBDWT coefficients of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or non-epileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying LBDWT in connection with MLPNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN based classifier was more accurate than the LR based classifier. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We recorded each patient's ACC or OFC electrocorticogram (ECoG) during the time period that the patient was awake and naturally asleep. We performed a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) power spectral analysis on each ECoG to examine its frequency component. We found that the ACC showed regular and continuous theta oscillation (5-7Hz) during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but not during slow wave sleep. Theta waves observed in REM sleep were not as distinct as those found in wakefulness. We also discovered that the orbitofrontal signals represented spectral peaks in the theta band only during wakefulness. This suggests the coexistence of theta oscillation in the ACC. Considering our previous observations of gamma and beta oscillations in the human hippocampus, we hypothesize that the human limbic system manifests two oscillatory activities. The results obtained in this study suggest that electrophysiological activity in the ACC could be related to particular psychological functions in wakefulness and in REM sleep. These results are useful in elucidating the human brain mechanism. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

Wavelet packet transformation is applied to extract different kinds of dynamic EEG rhythms accurately. This paper presents a wavelet packet entropy method in the processing of EEG signal. Relative wavelet packet energy and two kinds of wavelet packet entropy are calculated as the quantitative parameter to study the complexity of the EEG signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method excels the Wavelet decomposition in that it can isolate specific EEG and ERP rhythms more accurately. The proposed method is also useful for the processing of other non-stationary signals.

Methods: EEG was analyzed from sixteen patients, anesthetized with a fixed rate infusion of propofol (30 mg/kg/h). An artifact-purified EEG from electrode Fz referenced to the average of mastoid signals was filtered to consecutive 4 Hz frequency passbands with a filter bank. Signal envelope time-series were computed for all the passbands and studied as a function of the elapsed induction time t and as a function of the relative time r, which is t divided by the time of the LVC. Results: A frequency band specific biphasic activity pattern progressed from high towards low frequencies systematically and uniformly in the population studied when presented on the relative time scale r, irrespective of individual responses to the dosage. Conclusions: The grouping of the individual progression patterns on the r scale indicates a strong relation between the EEG spectral behavior and the LVC. Significance: EEG may provide phenomenological grounds for a continuous control variable of a sedative drug effect, even in between the discrete clinical end-points.

While a decrease in high frequency EEG activity is associated with a decrease in arousal in drug-free conditions, sedative benzodiazepines increase beta activity. Non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor modulators can increase beta activity as well. To further study the relationship between rat behavior and EEG under GABA(A) receptor modulation, EEG effects of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and zolpidem (2.5 mg/kg) were studied during different behaviors. Both drugs modulate the GABA(A) receptor, albeit that zolpidem shows alpha(1) subunit selectivity while diazepam is non-selective. A detailed analysis of rat open field behavior was made with a distinction of 25 behavioral elements. The EEG was segmented according to each behavioral element and a corresponding power spectrum calculated. Both diazepam and zolpidem increased EEG beta frequencies, characteristic for the benzodiazepines. However, the beta and gamma increase was specific for active behavior and not for inactivity. Interestingly, diazepam and zolpidem seemed to amplify, rather than dissociate, the relation between behavior and the EEG. It is hypothesized that the large increase in beta-3/gamma activity caused by diazepam and zolpidem is a compensatory mechanism that allows for behavioral activation, despite pharmacologically induced sedation.

We consider the pattern recognition as equivalent to EEG visual analysis and advance the template matching approach to the identification of the complexes in the signal. New type of epileptiform oscillation's complexes' template consists of generic complex and parameters of its deformations. The methodology of constructing these templates is proposed. Direct applicabilty of the proposed template creating methodology to adaptive classification of EEG complexes is highlighted. The performance of the template is evaluated with simulated and real EEG data. Experimental application of the template resulted in correct identification of 62 of 81 epileptiform oscillation's complexes from the sample signals with moderated number of false positive identifications.

Healthy subjects had clearly more time occupied by slow wave sequences in all night sleep. Closer examination revealed that the difference in the amount of slow wave sequence time between the groups was statistically significant only in the first NREM sleep episode. In other words, healthy subjects had more time with slow wave sequences in the first NREM sleep episode, where sleep pressure is supposed to be highest. The lower amount of slow wave sequences in the apnea patients might reflect the fragmented sleep of the patients, inhibiting cortical synchronization.

The underlying cortical sources and generating mechanisms are unknown. We performed a source localization analysis of SREDA with the aim of better understanding this unusual EEG pattern. Methods: Multiple spontaneous episodes of typical SREDA were recorded in a patient during continuous EEG monitoring. Additional SREDA episodes were induced by hyperventilation. Source localization was carried out using statistical non-parametric mapping (SNPM) of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: SNPM of both time- and frequency-domain LORETA revealed a widespread biparietal cortical origin of SREDA, the anatomical distribution of which included the parietal operculum and the known vascular watershed areas between anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Vigorous deep hyperventilation induced SREDA on three of four attempts. Mean duration of the hyperventilation-induced SREDA was approximately three times longer than spontaneous events. Conclusions: Investigations in this patient with typical SREDA revealed hyperventilation sensitivity and a posterior hemispheric source localization maximal in the parietal cortex bilaterally, in large part overlying the anatomical distribution of the vascular watershed areas. Significance: The source localization results and sensitivity to hyperventilation suggest some sort of association between cerebral vascular supply and SREDA, as originally proposed by Naquet et al.

Recently, the type-2 fuzzy logic systems (T2 FLSs) have been found effective in modeling uncertain data. This paper examines the potential of the T2 FLS methodology in devising an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). In particular, a T2 FLS has been designed to classify imaginary left and right hand movements based on time-frequency information extracted from the EEG with the short time Fourier transform (STFT). Robustness of the method has also been verified in the presence of additive noise. The performance of the classifier is quantified with the classification accuracy (CA). The T2 fuzzy classifier has been proven to outperform its type-1 (T counterpart on all data sets recorded from three subjects examined. It has also compared favorably to the well known classifier based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Possibly, electric stimulation of the caudate nucleus could produce epilepsy. In order to prove this point we delivered the acute tetanization (60 Hz, 2 s, 0.4-0.6 mA) into the rat right caudate putamen nucleus (ATRC) and examined bilateral neocortical EEG and hippocampal unit discharges in vivo. The results demonstrated that: (1) 80-280 Hz EEG ripples could be evoked bilaterally, and more stronger on the contralateral side. And the maximum amplitudes of the power spectra (mu V-2/Hz) have higher shifting variability among multiple contralateral EEG ripples. (2) The EEG ripples were coupled contralaterally with the hippocampal neuronal firing inhibition. (3) An episode of 10(-15) Hz EEG oscillations was ipsilaterally coupled with rhythmic hippocampal neuronal bursts. It suggested that the hemispheric reactions of neocortical EEG and hippocampal neuronal discharges are lateralized in response to the stimulation. It implies that the epileptic network activities were reorganized by the ATRC. Neocortical EEG ripples, called as seizure-like fast oscillations, were repetitively evoked by the ATRC.

Yet, we discovered the existence of time-invariant (above an essential time scale) partitioning of the brain activity into personal state-specific frequency bands. For that, we perform temporal and ensemble averaging of best wavelet packet bases from multielectrode electroencephalogram recordings. These personal frequency bands provide new templates for quantitative analyses of brain function, e.g., normal versus epileptic activity.

It is a current debate in cognitive neuroscience if an error-detection neural system is involved in behavioral control and adaptation. Such a system should generate error-specific signals, but their existence is questioned by observations that correct and incorrect reactions may elicit similar neuroelectric potentials. A new approach based on a time-frequency decomposition of event-related brain potentials was applied to extract covert sub-components from the classical error-related negativity (Ne) and correct-response-related negativity (Nc) in humans. A unique error-specific sub-component from the delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) frequency band was revealed only for Ne, which was associated with error detection at the level of overall performance monitoring. A sub-component from the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) was associated with motor response execution, but this sub-component also differentiated error from correct reactions indicating error detection at the level of movement monitoring. It is demonstrated that error-specific signals do exist in the brain. More importantly, error detection may occur in multiple functional systems operating in parallel at different levels of behavioral control. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, the relevant findings and ideas were surveyed from the body of literature.

Alpha and memory decline in older people. We wished to test if alpha-like EEG activity contributes to memory formation. Flicker can elicit alpha-like EEG activity. We tested if alpha-frequency flicker enhances memory in older people. Pariticpants aged 67 - 92 identified short words that followed 1 s of flicker at 9.0 Hz, 9.5 Hz, 10.0 Hz, 10.2 Hz, 10.5 Hz, 11.0 Hz, 11.5 Hz or 500 Hz. A few minutes later, we tested participants' recognition of the words ( without flicker). Results: Flicker frequencies close to 10 Hz ( 9.5 - 11.0 Hz) facilitated the identification of the test words in older participants. The same flicker frequencies increased recognition of the words more than other frequencies ( 9.0 Hz, 11.5 Hz and 500 Hz), irrespective of age. Conclusion: The frequency-specificity of flicker's effects in our participants paralleled the power spectrum of EEG alpha in the general population. This indicates that alpha-like EEG activity may subserve memory processes. Flicker may be able to help memory problems in older people.

This technique is based on the concept of generalized entropy of a given probability distribution, known as the Renyi entropy that allows defining the set of generalized fractal dimensions of encephalogram (EEG) and determining fractal spectra of encephalographic signals. Unlike the Fourier spectra, the spectra of fractal dimensions contain information of both frequency and amplitude characteristics of EEG and can be used together with well-accepted techniques of EEG analysis as an enhancement of the latter. Powered by volume visualization of the brain activity, the method provides new clues for understanding the mental processes in humans. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we demonstrate that a novel rhythm that Occurs at the border between the theta and alpha range of frequencies (10-12 Hz) can also be recorded from these structures. This rhythm (referred to here as "flutter") appears to be of non-theta origin as it can occur simultaneously with theta and it does not display the phase inversion across the hippocampus that characterizes theta activity. Flutter is observed in locomoting rats that are foraging for food reward in a familiar environment. Flutter disappears when rats are placed into a novel (although visually identical) environment, even though their foraging behavior does not appear to be altered. It is, at the present time, unclear what function flutter subserves. The presence of flutter may relate to a particular motivational state of the animal or to a particular type of information processing.

Could orienting attention to a selective point in time influence the alpha rhythms as a function of the SHORT vs. LONG foreperiod? Stronger selective attentional modulations were predicted for the SHORT than LONG condition. EEG data from 54 channels were "depurated" from phase-locked visual evoked potentials and spatially enhanced by surface Laplacian estimation (i.e., final data analysis was conducted on 16 Subjects having a sufficient number of artifact-free EEG single trials). Low-band alpha rhythms (about 6-10 Hz) were supposed to be related to anticipatory attentional processes, whereas high-band alpha rhythms (10-12 Hz) would indicate task-specific visuo-motor processes. Compared to the LONG condition (foreperiod), the SHORT condition induced a quicker and stronger ERS at low-band alpha rhythm (about 6-8 Hz) over midline and bilateral prefrontal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal areas. In contrast, the concomitant high-band alpha (about 10-12 Hz) ERD/ERS showed no significant difference between the two conditions. In conclusion, temporal attention for a sub-second delay (800 ms) did modulate low-band alpha rhythm over large regions of both cortical hemispheres. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The investigation of the serial information processing of human brain is very important for designing brain computer interfaces. Since EEG signals have a good temporal resolution and can be recorded noninvasively from the scalp, EEG has been used as a basic tool of the brain-computer interface. In this study, we measured EEG signals when subjects view, memorize, and recall the simple visual stimuli with directional information. As a result of the frequency analysis for the EEG signals, we found the task-related power change in particular cortical area. Based on this result, we discussed the information processing in the human visual systems and the applicability of the brain computer interface.

The detection of arousals and the analysis of cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) support the evaluation of sleep fragmentation and instability. Sixteen polygraphic overnight recordings were visually inspected for conventional Rechtscaffen and Kales scoring, while arousals were detected following the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA). Three electroencephalograph (EEG) segments were associated to each event, corresponding to background activity, pre-arousal period and arousal. The study was supplemented by the analysis of time-frequency distribution of EEG within each subtype of phase A in the CAP. The arousals were characterized by the increase of alpha and beta power with regard to background. Within NREM sleep most of the arousals were preceded by a transient increase of delta power. The time-frequency evolution of the phase A of the CAP sequence showed a strong prevalence of delta activity during the whole A1, but high amplitude delta waves were found also in the first 2/3 s of A2 and A3, followed by desynchronization. Our results underline the strict relationship between the ASDA arousals, and the subtype A2 and A3 within the CAP: in both the association between a short sequence of transient slow waves and the successive increase of frequency and decrease of amplitude characterizes the arousal response.

EEG signals are assumed to be linear mixtures of source components, artifacts, etc. Therefore, a raw EEG data matrix can be factored into the product of two matrices, one of which represents the mixing matrix and the other the source component matrix. Furthermore, the components are sparse in the time-frequency domain, i.e., the factorization is a sparse factorization in the time frequency domain. It is a challenging task to estimate the mixing matrix. Our extensive analysis and computational results, which were based on many sets of EEG data, not only provide firm evidences supporting the above assumption, but also prompt us to propose a new algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix. After the mixing matrix is estimated, the source components are estimated in the time frequency domain using a linear programming method. In an example of the potential applications of our approach, we analyzed the EEG data that was obtained from a modified Sternberg memory experiment. Two almost uncorrelated components obtained by applying the sparse factorization method were selected for phase synchronization analysis. Several interesting findings were obtained, especially that memory-related synchronization and desynchronization appear in the alpha band, and that the strength of alpha band synchronization is related to memory performance.

The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behavior were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. It was demonstrated that EEG of patients with opioid dependence was characterized by (a) significant reorganization of brain oscillations with increase in the percentage of beta and mostly fast-alpha-rhythmic segments, (b) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha and beta brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for theta and polyrhythmic activity when compared with control subjects, and (c) right-sided dominance (significantly larger relative presence of particular spectral patterns in EEG channels of the right hemisphere). These effects were widely distributed across the cortex with the maximum magnitude in the occipital, right parietal, temporal, and frontal areas. Taken together the present study suggested (a) an allostatic state with neuronal activation, and (b) high sensitivity of the right hemisphere to adverse opioid effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Administration of hexamethonium and gallamine failed to elicit a detectable effect on HPC theta activity. However, the injection of atropine sulphate and pirenzepine abolished the theta rhythm recorded from HPC. This effect was reversible. A substantial difference in the recovery time course between frequency versus amplitude (muV) and power (muV(2)) of hippocampal theta was observed. While theta frequency exhibited a rapid reappearance with a shallow slope, the power and amplitude showed a gradual recovery with a steeper slope. The injection of carbachol into posterior hypothalamus (PH) produced almost a continuous HPC theta with increased power. These results demonstrate that cholinergic (M1) receptors localised in the posterior area of the hypothalamus are engaged in mechanisms responsible for generating hippocampal theta oscillations in the freely behaving cat. The contribution of posterior hypothalamic region to HPC theta frequency and amplitude is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An omitted-stimulus paradigm induced the expectancy of the painful stimulation at the left hand. In the experimental condition, the painful stimulation was associated with a visual go/no-go task triggering right-hand movements. Two control conditions manipulated the painful sensorimotor interaction variable. Compared with the control conditions, the expectancy of the painful sensorimotor interaction increased the high-band alpha EEG oscillations over the right primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the nociceptive stimuli and, to a lesser extent, over the centroparietal midline. These findings suggest that concomitant painful stimuli and simple sensorimotor go/no-go demands affect anticipatory activity as revealed by alpha ERD.

The popularity of imaging techniques for detection and diagnosis of possible AD stems from the relative ease with which neurological markers can be converted to visual markers. However, due to the expense of specialized experts and equipment involved in the use of imaging techniques, a subject of significant research interest is detecting markers in EEGs obtained from AD patients. In this article, the authors present a state-of-the-art review of models of computation and analysis of EEGs for diagnosis and detection of AD. This review covers three areas: time-frequency analysis, wavelet analysis, and chaos analysis. The vast number of physiological parameters involved in the poorly understood processes responsible for AD yields a large combination of parameters that can be manipulated and studied. A combination of parameters from different investigation modalities seems to be more effective in increasing the accuracy of detection and diagnosis.

Typical EEG instrumentation settings used are low pass filtering at 75Hz and paper recording at 100V/cm and 30mm/s for 10-20 minutes over 8-16 simultaneous channels. A commonly encountered problem in clinical practice during EEG recording is the 'blanking' of the EEG signal due to blinking of the user's eyes. Eye-blinks and movements of the eyeballs produce electrical signals that are collectively known as Ocular Artifacts and these are 10-100 times stronger than the EEG Signal which is being recorded. The effective filtering of these Ocular artifacts is extremely difficult owing to the fact that their frequency spread (1Hz - 50Hz) is observed to be overlapping with that of the EEG. Another major drawback of the existing frequency based de-noising techniques is that they require continuous recording of the Electrooculargram(EOG) signals as well. Recently, Stationary Wavelet Transform(SWT) of the corrupted EEG signal has been used to de-noise it. In this paper, we present a novel and simple technique for the detection and subsequent de-noising of these Ocular Artifacts using HAAR wavelets of high orders. A comprehensive Error Analysis has been carried out, both in the time domain based artifact detection as we]] as the frequency domain based SWT de-noising of EEG. This procedure has also got the advantage of being highly artifact selective and so we have applied it to detect and de-noise Epileptic EEG Signals.

Using short sliding time windows, a set of features is computed from the data. The feature set includes time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear features. Discriminant analysis is used to determine the best seizure-detecting features among them. The findings suggest that the best results can be achieved by using a combination of features from the linear and nonlinear realms alike. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design: Active waking (AW), quiet sleep (QS), and paradoxical sleep (PS) of adult male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) on their daytime sleep were compared. Participants: Ten WKY Interventions: All rats had electrodes implanted for polygraphic recordings. One week later, a 6-hour daytime sleep-wakefulness recording session was performed. Measurements and Results: A scatterplot analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave magnitude (0.5-4 Hz) and heart rate variability (HRV) was applied in each rat. The EEG slow-wave-RR interval scatterplot from all of the recordings revealed a propeller-like pattern. If the scatterplot was divided into AW, PS, and QS according to the corresponding EEG mean power frequency and nuchal electromyogram, the EEG slow wave-RR interval relationship became nil, negative, and positive for AW, PS, and QS, respectively. A significant negative relationship was found for EEG slow-wave and high-frequency power of HRV (HF) coupling during PS and for EEG slow wave and low-frequency power of HRV to HF ratio (LF/HF) coupling during QS. The optimal time lags for the slow wave-LF/HF relationship were different between PS and QS. Conclusions: Bradycardia noted in QS and PS was related to sympathetic suppression and vagal excitation, respectively. The EEG slow wave-HRV scatterplot may provide unique insights into studies of sleep, and such a relationship may delineate the sleep-state-dependent fluctuations in autonomic nervous system activity.

In this study, influence of uncertainty on alpha-delta anticorrelation and delta-beta coupling was studied in 39 subjects (27 females) aged 19 to 30 years who also filled out the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. A measure of alpha-delta anticorrelation showed trait-like propertied being uniformly higher in high trait anxiety subjects independent of experimental manipulation. Contrariwise, delta-beta coupling appeared only in anxiogenic situation both in high and low anxiety subjects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, the relationship between noninvasive measurements of electrical activity and metabolism remains largely undefined. To understand better these relations, cerebral activity was measured simultaneously with electroencephalography (EEG) and positron emission tomography using [(18)f]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (PET-FDG) in 12 normal human subjects during rest. Intracerebral distributions of current density were estimated, yielding tomographic maps for seven standard EEG frequency bands. The PET and EEG data were registered to the same space and voxel dimensions, and correlational maps were created on a voxel-by-voxel basis across all subjects. For each band, significant positive and negative correlations were found that are generally consistent with extant understanding of EEG band power function. With increasing EEG frequency, there was an increase in the number of positively correlated voxels, whereas the lower a band (8.5-10.0 Hz) was associated with the highest number of negative correlations. This work presents a method for comparing EEG signals with other more traditionally tomographic functional imaging data on a 3-D basis. This method will be useful in the future when it is applied to functional imaging methods with faster time resolution, such as short half-life PET blood flow tracers and functional magnetic resonance imaging.

The different tradeoffs between time-frequency resolution, interference, and range are examined with reference to the suitability of each for use in analyzing ripple data. An unbiased approach is taken to characterizing ripple rhythms uniquely by determining the parameter choices in which its behaviour is most distinct from baseline activity. Mixture distribution analysis of the two components generated from correlating frequency behaviour allows a clear method for determining the distinctiveness of ripple-like rhythms given a particular parameter choice.

Time-frequency microstructure and statistical significance of ERD and ERS	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	PROGRESS IN BRAIN RESEARCH		English	Review						time-frequency energy density; matching pursuit (MP); statistical significance of ERD/ERS; multiple comparisons; false discovery rate	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MATCHING PURSUIT; GAMMA-BAND; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DICTIONARIES; PLANE	ERD and ERS were introduced as the time courses of the average changes of energy in given frequency bands. These curves are naturally embedded in the time-frequency plane. Time-frequency density of signals energy can be estimated by means of a variety of transforms. In general, resolution of these methods depends on a priori choices of parameters regulating the tradeoff between the time and frequency resolutions. As an exception, adaptive time-frequency approximations adapt resolution to the local structures of the analyzed signal. Matching pursuit (MP) algorithm is a reliable implementation of this approach. Its application to the event-related EEG allows for a detailed presentation of the time-frequency microstructure of changes of the average energy density, as well as calculation of high-resolution maps of ERD/ERS in the time-frequency plane. However, even with such a detailed picture of the signal energy changes, their significance remains an open issue. Owing to a stochastic character of the EEG, a visible increase or decrease of energy can occur due to a pure chance or a phenomenon unrelated to the event. For a proper estimation of the statistical significance of ERD/ERS, that is, the average changes of signals energy density in relation to the reference period, we must take into account possibly non-normal distributions of energy, and, especially, the problem of multiple comparisons appearing in hypotheses related to different frequency bands and time epochs. This chapter presents and discusses a complete framework for high-resolution estimation of the ERD/ERS microstructure in the time-frequency regions, revealing statistically significant changes.

The frequency plain 1-1.5 Hz double left right arrow 3.5-4.5 Hz was used as the region-of-interest. QPC rhythms with a frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz were found in all neonates (n = 6). It can be demonstrated that the QPC rhythm of the TA is generated by a pattern-spanning time-variant phase-locking process characterising early functional interactions in the immature brain.

The technique is based on an adaptive time-frequency analysis of EEG signals computed using local discriminant bases (LDB) derived from local cosine packets (LCP). In an offline step, the EEG data obtained from the C-3/C-4 electrode locations of the standard 10/20 system is adaptively segmented in time, over a non-dyadic grid by maximizing the probabilistic distances between expansion coefficients corresponding to left and right hand movement imagery. This is followed by a frequency domain clustering procedure in each adapted time segment to maximize the discrimination power of the resulting time-frequency features. Then, the most discriminant features from the resulting arbitrarily segmented time-frequency plane are sorted. A principal component analysis (PCA) step is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This reduced feature set is finally fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The online step simply computes the reduced dimensionality features determined by the offline step and feeds them to the linear discriminant. We provide experimental data to show that the method can adapt to physio-anatomical differences, subject-specific and hemisphere-specific motor imagery patterns. The algorithm was applied to all nine subjects of the BCI Competition 2002. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm varied between 70% and 92.6% across subjects using just two electrodes. The average classification accuracy was 80.6%. For comparison, we also implemented an adaptive autoregressive model based classification procedure that achieved an average error rate of 76.3% on the same subjects, and higher error rates than the proposed approach on each individual subject.

Rhinal-hippocampal coupling during declarative memory formation: Dependence on item characteristics	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						declarative memory; depth EEG; gamma activity; phase synchronization; medial temporal lobe; hippocampus	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PHASE-LOCKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; COHERENCE; PREDICTS; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Lesion and imaging studies have demonstrated that encoding and retrieval of declarative memories, i.e. consciously accessible events and facts, depend on operations within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus, two substructures of the medial temporal lobe. Analysis of intracranially recorded EEG in presurgical epilepsy patients revealed that successful memory formation is accompanied within one second by a transient enhancement and later decrease of Rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization in the gamma range, as well as enhanced connectivity in the low-frequency range. In these studies, words with a high frequency of occurrence were used as stimulus material. Here, we re-examined these effects in another group of 10 presurgical epilepsy patients, this time not only for high-frequency, but also for low-frequency words. For successfully memorized compared to later forgotten high-frequency words we again observed an early phase coupling and later decoupling within the gamma range, as well as enhanced coupling within the sub-gamma range. However, for remembered as compared to forgotten low-frequency words clear synchronization increases were only observed for the delta band, but not for the gamma band. Our data suggest, that broadband Rhinal-hippocampal coupling including the gamma range only occurs, when significant semantic associations are processed within rhinal cortex, as is the case for high-frequency words.

An evaluation was performed on three previously proposed EEG segmentation methods in order to determine which method is most suited to neonatal EEG analysis. The three methods evaluated are spectral error measurement (SEM), generalised likelihood ratio (GLR) and non-linear energy operator (NLEO). A windowed version or NLEO was also tested in an attempt to minimise the effect or any temporary transients on the segmentation algorithm. The results from the segmentation algorithm were compared with the time-frequency distribution or the original signal to determine the appropriateness or the segments. It was round that GLR was the most appropriate segmentation method, and that the windowed version of the NLEO method performed better than the non-windowed version, both of which are less computationally expensive than the other methods.

The analysis of the long-term monitored epileptiform EEG presents characteristic problems for the implementation of BSS techniques because the ongoing EEG has time varying frequency content which can be both slowly varying and yet also include short bursts of neurophysiologically meaningful activity. Since statistically based BSS methods rely on sample-estimates, which generally require larger window sizes, these methods may extract neurophysiologically uninformative components over short data segments. Here we show that BSS techniques using signal time structure succeed in extracting neurophysiologically meaningful components where their statistical counterparts fail. To this end we use an algorithm that extracts linear mixtures of nonstationary sources, without pre-whitening, through joint diagonalisation of a number of windowed, lagged cross-covariance matrices. We show that this is extremely useful in tracking seizure onset in the epileptiform EEG.

EEG oscillations and recognition memory: Theta correlates of memory retrieval and decision making	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						theta; EEG oscillations; recognition memory; decision making; working memory; gamma	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; GAMMA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SERIAL POSITION; ALPHA-BAND; TASK; BRAIN; NAVIGATION; RESPONSES; LOAD	Studies of memory retrieval have identified electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of a test item's old-new status, reaction time, and memory load. In the current study, we used a multivariate analysis to disentangle the effects of these correlated variables. During retrieval, power of left-parietal theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations increased in proportion to how well a test item was remembered, and theta in central regions correlated with decision making. We also studied how these oscillatory dynamics complemented event-related potentials. These findings are the first to demonstrate that distinct patterns of theta oscillations can simultaneously relate to different aspects of behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The key hardware components include slew-rate limited preamplifiers to prevent saturation of the EEG system due to TMS. The protocol involves artifact subtraction to isolate the electrophysiological signals from residual TMS-induced contaminations. The TMS compatibility of the protocol is illustrated with examples of two data sets demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in the single-pulse TMS design, as well as during repetitive TMS. Our data show that both high-amplitude potentials evoked by visual checkerboard stimulation and low-amplitude steady-state oscillations induced by auditory click-trains can be retrieved with the present protocol. The signals recorded during TMS perfectly matched control EEG responses to the same visual and auditory stimuli. The main field of application of the present protocol is in cognitive neuroscience complementing behavioral studies that use TMS to induce transient, 'virtual lesions'. Combined EEG-TMS techniques provide neuroscientists with a unique method to test hypothesis on functional connectivity, as well as on mechanisms of functional orchestration, reorganization, and plasticity.

It was hypothesized that these measures would reveal the engagement of local and increasingly complex cortical networks as a function of task specificity and complexity. Results indicated regionally increased neuronal signalling as a function of task complexity at frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions, although more robust task-related changes in EEG-indices of activation were derived over the left hemisphere. Both linear and non-linear indices of synchronization among EEG signals recorded from over different brain regions were consistent with the notion of more "local" processing for the number comparison task. Conversely, multiplication tasks were associated with a widespread pattern of distant signal synchronizations, which could potentially indicate increased demands for neural networks cooperation during performance of tasks that involve a greater number of cognitive operations.

Typical EEG instrumentation settings used are low pass filtering at 75Hz and paper recording at 100muV/cm and 30mm/s for 10 to 20 minutes over 8 to 16 simultaneous channels. A commonly encountered problem in clinical practice during EEG recording is the 'blanking' of the EEG signal due to blinking of the user's eyes. Eve-blinks and movements of the eyeballs produce electrical signals that are collectively known as Ocular Artifacts and these are 10 to 100 times stronger than the EEG signal which is being recorded. The effective filtering of these Ocular artifacts is extremely difficult owing to the fact that their frequency spread (1Hz-50Hz) is observed to be overlapping with that of the EEG. Another major drawback of the existing frequency based denoising techniques is that they require continuous recording of the Electrooculargram (EOG) signals as well. In this paper, we present a novel and simple technique for the detection and subsequent de-noising of these ocular artifacts using Haar wavelets of high orders. A comprehensive error analysis has been carried out, both in the time domain based artifact detection as well as the frequency domain based de-noising of EEG. This procedure has also got the advantage of being highly artifact selective and so we have applied it to detect and de-noise Epileptic EEG signals.

The process accounting for the fm theta increase during working memory was separated from 71-channel data by clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fm theta component scalp maps were consistent with their generation in or near dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. From trial to trial, theta power of fm theta components varied widely but correlated moderately with theta power in other frontal and left temporal processes. The weak mean increase in frontal midline theta power with increasing memory load, produced entirely by the fm theta components, largely reflected progressively stronger theta activity in a relatively small proportion of trials. During presentations of letter series to be memorized or ignored, fm theta components also exhibited 1215 Hz low-beta activity that was stronger during memorized than during ignored letter trials, independent of letter duration. The same components produced a brief 3-Hz burst 500 ms after onset of the probe letter following each letter sequence. A new decomposition method, log spectral ICA, applied to normalized log time/frequency transforms of fm theta component Memorize-letter trials, showed that their low-beta activity reflected harmonic energy in continuous, sharppeaked theta wave trains as well as independent low-beta bursts. Possibly, the observed fm theta process variability may index dynamic adjustments in medial frontal cortex to trial-specific behavioral context and task demands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However with respect to the signal character, the developed approach is suitable for analysis of sleep and newborn EEG too. EEG signal can be analysed both in time and frequency domains. In time domain the basic descriptive quantities are general and central moments of lower orders, in frequency domain the most frequently used method is Fourier transform. For segmentation, combination of non-adaptive and adaptive segmentation has been used. The approach has been tested on real sleep EEG recording for which the classification has been known. The core of the developed system is the training set on which practically depends the quality of classification. The training set containing 319 segments classified into 10 classes has been used for classification of the 2hour sleep EEG recording. For classification, algorithm of nearest neighbour has been used. In the paper, the issues of development of the training set and experimental results are discussed.

Genetic variation of individual alpha frequency (IAF) and alpha power in a large adolescent twin sample	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; alpha rhythm; IAF; alpha power; heritability; twin study	EEG-ALPHA; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MEMORY PROCESSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; TIME; IQ; HERITABILITY; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS	To further clarify the mode of genetic transmission oil individual alpha frequency (IAF) and alpha power. the extent to which individual differences in these alpha indices are influenced by genetic factors were examined in a large sample of adolescent twins (237 MZ, 282 DZ pairs; aged 16). EEG was measured at rest (eyes closed) from the right occipital site, and a second EEG recording for 50 twin pairs obtained approximately 3 months after the initial collection, enabled ail estimation of measurement error. Analyses confirmed a strong genetic influence on both IAF (h(2)=0.81) and alpha power (h(2)=0.82). and there was little support for non-additive genetic (dominance) variance. A small but significant negative correlation (-0.18) was found between IAF and alpha power, but genetic influences oil IAF and alpha power were largely independent. All non-genetic variance was due to unreliability. with no significant variance attributed to unique environmental factors. Relationships between the alpha and IQ indices were also explored but were generally either non-significant or very low. The findings confirm the high heritability for both IAF and alpha power, they further suggest that the mode of genetic transmission is due to additive genetic factors. that genetic influences oil the underlying, neural mechanisms of alpha frequency and power are largely specific. and that individual differences in alpha activity are influenced little by developmental plasticity and individual experiences.

J	Le Van Quyen, M; Amor, F; Rudrauf, D				Le Van Quyen, Michel; Amor, Frederique; Rudrauf, David			Exploring the dynamics of collective synchronizations in large ensembles of brain signals	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Article						phase synchronization; large-scale brain dynamics; time-frequency analysis; EEG-MEG	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SEIZURES; WAVELET; MEG	Developing methods characterizing the dynamics of synchronization in large ensemble of electromagnetic brain signals has become an important issue. In this article, we review a recently introduced method for analyzing multivariate phase synchronization in brain signals. The approach is based on the equivalence between phase locking and frequency locking in narrow band signals, which allows tracking multivariate phase synchronization in the time-frequency domain as periods of common frequency among multiple channels. The method is illustrated with simulations of multivariate phase dynamics in coupled oscillators and real multichannel electro- and magnetoencephalographic data recorded prior and during epileptic seizures. The reviewed results support the relevance of this method in the context of brain synchronization, in particular to track transient collective dynamics fluctuating in time, frequency and space.

The GEPR-9 exhibits acoustically triggered generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and often times the EEG, recorded with conventional techniques, has resulted in data with imbedded movement artifact. For noise-free video-EEG recordings, we used a previously developed system that consists of a head connector with a FET prearnplifier and battery, signal conditioning device (5000x gain, 1 Hz-100 Hz filters), A/D converter and video/PC-PC/video computer boards for recording image data. Each animal was implanted with three monopolar/referential electrodes chosen among the following areas: cortex, inferior colliculus, reticular formation and caudal medulla. The video-EEG data were quite similar for all recorded animals: (1) basal desynchronized EEG before sound stimulus; (2) increase in EEG frequency after stimulus and before seizure onset; (3) high-amplitude polyspikes during massive myoclonic thrusts with or without a very fast running episode; (4) an electrodecremental response during tonic extension; (5) wave and spike complex during forelimb and hindlimb tonic rigidity and posttonic clonus; (6) low-amplitude EEG during postictal depression. Time sequenced spectral analysis also highlights the epileptiform EEG pattern during seizure with high reproducibility between animals. While testing seizure naive GEPR-9s, there was a clear evolution from modest epileptiform EEG activity on the first acoustic stimulation to progressively higher amplitude, duration and frequency epileptiform EEG activity throughout seizure repetition.

Trained users can move the cursor in one or two dimensions. The primary goal of this research is to provide a new communication and control option for people with severe motor disabilities. Currently, cursor movements in each dimension are determined 10 times/s by an empirically derived linear function of one or two EEG features (i.e., spectral bands from different electrode locations). This study used offline analysis of data collected during system operation to explore methods for improving the accuracy of cursor movement. The data were gathered while users selected among three possible targets by controlling vertical [i.e., one-dimensional (1-D)] cursor movement. The three methods analyzed differ in the dimensionality of the cursor movement [1-D versus two-dimensional (2-D)] and in the type of the underlying function (linear versus nonlinear). We addressed two questions: Which method is best for classification (i.e., to determine from the EEG which target the user wants to hit)? How does the number of EEG features affect the performance of each method? All methods reached their optimal performance with 10-20 features. In offline simulation, the 2-D linear method and the 1-D nonlinear method improved performance significantly over the 1-D linear method. The 1-D linear method did not do so. These offline results suggest that the 1-D nonlinear or the 2-D linear cursor function will improve online operation of the BCI system.

Visual inspection of physiological signals to detect the arousal events is inconvenient and time-consuming work. The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic algorithm to detect the arousal events. We proposed the automatic method to detect arousals based on time-frequency analysis and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using a single channel sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). The performance of our method has been assessed using polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of nine patients with sleep apnea, snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). By the proposed method, we could obtain sensitivity of 87.92% and specificity of 95.56% for the training sets, and sensitivity of 75.26% and specificity of 93.08% for the testing sets, respectively. We have shown that proposed method was effective for detecting the arousal events.

The different algorithms published so far required individual manual adjustment or have been based on limited decision criteria. In this study, we developed an artificial neural networks-(ANN-)aided method for automated detection of artefacts and EEG suppression periods, 72 hr EEG recorded before, during and after anaesthesia with propofol have been evaluated. Selected parameterized patterns of 0.25 s length were used to train the ANN (22 input, 8 hidden and 4 output neurons) with error back propagation. The detection performance of the ANN-aided method was tested with processing epochs between 1 to 10 s. Related to examiner EEG evaluation, the average detection performance of the method was 72% sensitivity and 80% specificity for artefacts and 90% sensitivity and 92% specificity for EEG suppression. The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio with automated artefact processing was 1.39 times for the spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95) and 1.89 times for the approximate entropy (ApEn). We conclude that ANN-aided preprocessing provide an useful tool for automated EEG evaluation in anaesthesiological applications.

The cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of delta waves at the cortical and thalamic levels are well documented, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate in the mouse that the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor beta determines the contribution of delta oscillations to the steep EEG. Thus, retinoic acid signaling, which is involved in the patterning of the brain and dopaminergic pathways, regulates cortical synchrony in the adult.

In this paper we propose a temporal evidence accumulation framework to enhance classification of AAR features. The results for a single subject, using 280 trials, indicate distinct improvements over a conventional method of temporal classification. We illustrate how the framework is applicable to AAR features, as well as to wavelet features as reported in [13]. These findings put the two time-frequency features on equal footing for comparison in this context.

The EEG signals were recorded using 61 active electrodes located on the scalp while the subjects perceived a single picture. LGB EEG signals occur with jittering latency of above 280 ins and are not time-locked to the triggering stimuli. Therefore, LGB EEG could only be computed from single trials of EEG signals and the common method of averaging across trials to remove undesired background EEG (i.e. noise) is not possible. Here, principal component analysis has been used to extract single trials of EEG signals. Zero phase Butterworth filter and Parseval's time-frequency equivalence theorem were used to compute the LGB EEG features. These features were then classified by backpropagation and simplified fuzzy ARTMAP NNs into different categories that represent the individuality of the subjects. The results using a tenfold cross validation scheme gave a maximum classification of 97.33% when tested on 800 unseen LGB EEG features from 40 subjects. This pilot investigation showed that the method of identifying the individuality of subjects using NN classification of LGB EEG features is worth further study.

Within sessions the PCPs are found to be stable, as reflected by a relatively low coefficient of variability, and between sessions the PCPs are highly reproducible. Finally, test-retest reliability of subject's PCPs shows a dependency on task, being higher for the memory task, and in particular for the encoding stage. It was Suggested that these findings support and strengthen the superposition principle where integrative brain functions are manifested in the superposition of distributed multiple oscillations.

We performed a magnetoencephalography study measuring brain activity in response to visual stimuli. Using a measure termed the phase-preservation index we investigated the phase of oscillatory alpha activity (8-13 Hz) before and after the stimulus. We found that in single trials the alpha oscillations after visual stimuli preserve their phase relationship with respect to the phase before the stimuli. This finding argues against phase-resetting of ongoing oscillations as being responsible for visually evoked responses. The event-related field can be explained primarily by stimulus-locked activity in the theta band that is absent before the stimulus. These findings suggest that different neuronal events are responsible for generating the ongoing oscillations and the visually evoked responses.

However, the generation mechanism of event-related responses remains unclear, hindering our ability to formulate viable theories of neural information processing. Event-related responses are assumed to be generated either (1) separately of ongoing, oscillatory brain activity or (2) through stimulus-induced reorganization of ongoing activity. Here, we approached this issue through examining single-trial auditory MEG data in humans. We demonstrate that phase coherence over trials observed with commonly used signal decomposition methods (e.g., wavelets) can result from both a phase-coherent state of ongoing oscillations and from the presence of a phase-coherent event-related response which is additive to ongoing oscillations. To avoid this problem, we introduce a method based on amplitude variance to establish the relationship between ongoing oscillations and event-related responses. We found that auditory stimuli do not give rise to phase reorganization of ongoing activity. Further, increases in spectral power accompany the emergence of event-related responses, and the relationship between spectral power and the amplitude of these responses can be accounted for by a linear summation of the event-related response and ongoing oscillation with a stochastically distributed phase. Thus, on the basis of our observations, auditory event-related responses are unique descriptors of neural information processing in humans, generated by processes separate from and additive to ongoing brain activity.

J	Durka, PJ				Durka, PJ			Adaptive time-frequency parametrization of epileptic spikes	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								Adaptive time-frequency approximations of signals have proven to be a valuable tool in electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis and research, where it is believed that oscillatory phenomena play a crucial role in the brain's information processing. This paper extends this paradigm to the nonoscillating structures such as the epileptic EEG spikes, and presents the advantages of their parametrization in general terms such as amplitude and half-width. A simple detector of epileptic spikes in the space of these parameters, tested on a limited data set, gives very promising results. It also provides a direct distinction between randomly occurring spikes or spike/wave complexes and rhythmic discharges.

Therefore, knowing the characteristics of VEPs is of fundamental importance for adequate design of a signal detector. Usually, the signal is modeled as a steady-state VEP (ssVEP) consisting of the fundamental frequency and the higher harmonics., while ignoring the information contained in its transients (tVEP). We propose here to characterize both tVEP and ssVEP by chirplet time-frequency representation of VEP signal using a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. Compared to the time-frequency analysis with short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) and linear-prediction-coding (LPC) method, MP with chirplet shows not only clear characteristics of ssVEP, but a clear spindle-like time-frequency component of tVEP as well, which is not obvious in the other two methods.

Thorough electrophysiologic evaluation yields information that allows for tailored surgical therapy in many cases, and thus improves treatment outcome. In recent years, fast activity (> 60-80 Hz) has been investigated for its diagnostic value in addition to well-known patterns such as epileptic transients. It was shown that these high frequency oscillations are highly specific for epileptic network function and might provide valuable information for localization of epileptic networks and understanding of their mechanisms. In this review, an overview of the electrophysiologic characteristics, putative cellular and network mechanisms in epilepsy is given. Recent studies are reviewed and interpreted in the context of a common hypothetical model. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

One task named baseline involves relaxing and thinking of nothing in particular and the other task named multiplication involves mentally multiplying two 2-digit integers. First, the EEG signals are pre-processed using Independent Component Analysis for removal of artifacts. Then, a time-frequency representation of the signals is generated, from which wavelet-based texture features are extracted for classification. The texture features are fed into a three-layer neural network classifier trained by the backpropagation algorithm. A classification rate of 96% is obtained for the dataset examined. The entire classification system has been implemented in the LabVIEW graphical programming environment providing a user-friendly interface to alter and monitor various parameters of the neural network classifier.

Methods: Heart rate and sleep EEG signals were recorded in 8 healthy young men. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and EEG sleep recordings. Synchronization likelihood was computed over the first 3 non-rapid eye movement-rapid eye movement sleep cycles between normalized high frequency of RR intervals (RRI) and all electroencephalographic frequency bands. Comparison to surrogate data of different types was used to attest statistical significance of the coupling between RRI and EEG power bands and its linear or non-linear character. Results: Synchronization likelihood values were statistically greater than univariate surrogate synchronization for all sleep bands both at the individual and the group levels. With reference to multivariate surrogates, synchronization values were statistically greater at the group level and, in a majority of cases, for individual comparison except for alpha and beta bands. Conclusions: While all electroencephalographic power bands are linked to normalized high frequency RRI band, this interdependency is non-linear for delta, theta and alpha bands. Significance: Non-linear description is required to capture the full interdependent dynamics of HRV and sleep EEG power bands. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This paper presents a new approach to detect depth of anaesthesia by using recurrence quantification analysis of electroencephalogram(EEG) and artificial neural network(ANN). The EEG recordings were collected from consenting patient prior to incision during isoflurane anaesthesia of different levels. The four measures of recurrence plot were extracted from each of eight-channel EEG time series. Prediction was made by means of ANN. The system was able to correctly classify purposeful responses in average accuracy of 87.76% of the cases.

As yet, there is no established means to integrate the analysis of the combined data set. Recognizing that the hemodynamically convolved time-varying EEG spectrum, S, is intrinsically multidimensional in space, frequency, and time motivated us to use multiway Partial Least-Squares (N-PLS) analysis to decompose EEG (independent variable) and fMRI (dependent variable) data uniquely as a sum of "atoms". Each EEG atom is the outer product of spatial, spectral, and temporal signatures and each fMRI atom the product of spatial and temporal signatures. The decomposition was constrained to maximize the covariance between corresponding temporal signatures of the EEG and fMRI. On all data sets, three components whose spectral peaks were in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands appeared; only the alpha atom had a significant temporal correlation with the fMRI signal. The spatial distribution of the alpha-band atom included parieto-occipital cortex, thalamus, and insula, and corresponded closely to that reported by Goldman et al. [NeuroReport 13(18) (2002) 2487] using a more conventional analysis. The source reconstruction from EEG spatial signature showed only the parieto-occipital sources. We interpret these results to indicate that some electrical sources may be intrinsically invisible to scalp EEG, yet may be revealed through conjoint analysis of EEG and fMRI data. These results may also expose brain regions that participate in the control of brain rhythms but may not themselves be generators. As of yet, no single neuroimaging method offers the optimal combination of spatial and temporal resolution; fusing fMRI and EEG meaningfully extends the spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity of each method.

J	Nikulin, VV; Brismar, T				Nikulin, VV; Brismar, T			Long-range temporal correlations in electroencephalographic oscillations: Relation to topography, frequency band, age and gender	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						long-range temporal correlations; oscillations; EEG; complexity; human	SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; SCALING BEHAVIOR; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; HANDEDNESS; AMPLITUDE; DYNAMICS	Presence of long-range temporal correlations in neuronal oscillations is thought to be beneficial for a reliable transfer of information in neuronal networks. In the present study long-range temporal correlations in electroencephalographic (EEG) neuronal oscillations were characterized with respect to their topography, frequency-band specificity (alpha and beta oscillations), gender and age. EEG was recorded in 91 normal subjects (age 20-65 years) in a resting condition. The amplitude of ongoing alpha and beta oscillations was extracted with band-pass filtering and Hilbert transform, and long-range temporal correlations were analyzed with detrended fluctuation analysis. The topography of long-range temporal correlations was comparable for alpha and beta oscillations, showing largest scaling exponents in the occipital and parietal areas. This topography was partially similar to that of the power distribution and a weak positive correlation was observed between long-range temporal correlations and power of neuronal oscillations. Long-range temporal correlations were stronger in alpha than beta oscillations, but only in a few electrode locations in the left hemisphere. In both frequency bands long-range temporal correlations were stronger in males than in females and were largely unaffected by the age of the subjects. It is hypothesized that the idling state of the occipital areas in the closed-eyes condition may explain both large power values and pronounced long-range temporal correlations in this region.

Methods: Sixteen normal healthy subjects were included in this study. Each subject underwent one poly somnographic night recording; sleep stages were scored following standard criteria. Subsequently, each CAP A phase was detected in all recordings, during NREM sleep, and classified into 3 subtypes (At, A2, and A3). The same channel used for the detection of CAP A phases (C3/A2 or C4A1) was subdivided into 2-s mini-epochs. For each mini-epoch, the corresponding CAP condition was determined and power spectra calculated in the frequency range 0.5-25 Hz. Average spectra were obtained for each CAP condition, separately in sleep stage 2 and SWS, for each subject. Finally, the first 6 h of sleep were subdivided into 4 periods of 90 min each and the same spectral analysis was performed for each period. Results: During sleep stage 2, CAP A subtypes differed from NCAP periods for all frequency bins between 0.5 and 25 Hz; this difference was most evident for the lowest frequencies. The B phase following A1 subtypes had a power spectrum significantly higher than that of NCAP, for frequencies between I and I I Hz. The B phase after A2 only differed from NCAP for a small but significant reduction in the sigma band power; this was evident also after A3 subtypes. During SWS, we found similar results. The comparison between the different CAP subtypes also disclosed significant differences related to the stage in which they occurred. Finally, a significant effect of the different sleep periods was found on the different CAP subtypes during sleep stage 2 and on NCAP in both sleep stage 2 and SWS. Conclusions: CAP subtypes are characterized by clearly different spectra and also the same subtype shows a different power spectrum, during sleep stage 2 or SWS. This finding underlines a probable different functional meaning of the same CAP subtype during different sleep stages. We also found 3 clear peaks of difference between CAP subtypes and NCAP in the delta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges which might indicate the presence of 3 frequency components characterizing CAP subtypes, in different proportion in each of them. The B component of CAP differs from NCAP because of a decrease in power in the sigma frequency range. Significance: This study shows that A components of CAP might correspond to periods in which the very-slow delta activity of sleep groups a range of different EEG activities, including the sigma and beta bands, while the B phase of CAP might correspond to a period in which this activity is quiescent or inhibited.

This is achieved based on the so-called sonification of the mental states of humans, captured by Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) recordings. Two time-frequency signal decomposition techniques, the Bump Modelling and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), are used to map the EEG recordings onto musical scores. This auditory feedback proves to have extremely high potential in the development of on-line BCI interfaces. Examples based on the responses from visual stimuli support the analysis.

The analysis provides distinct state descriptions (patient invariant characterization) of the seizure states. This characterization enables seizure detection before onset with sufficient time to warn the individual or execute actions to abort the seizure formation. Clinically classified segments of intracranial EEG data obtained from epileptic patients are separated into training and testing sets. The powers in various frequency bands are calculated as the state-discriminating features for each EEG segment. The mean power in the various frequency bands is calculated based on the training set data and a new system theoretic model, the Fuzzy Measure Theoretic Quantum Approximation of an Abstract System (FMQAS), is then used to develop system measures between the various frequency bands and the states. These system measures provide state descriptions of the transition into a seizure state (preictal), the seizure state (ictal), and tire state immediately following a seizure (postictal). Finally, an FMQAS-based classifier is developed to individually analyze the features from short time segments of EEG. The FMQAS-based classifier shows evidence of seizure activity in advance of visual EEG manifestation and also functions well as a seizure detector for both the training and the testing datasets; with low indication of seizure activity during the postictal periods where the time to a seizure onset is greater than ten minutes.

Aversive white noise (unconditioned stimulus) was paired with two exemplars of /ba/ (conditioned stimulus, CS+) occurring near the category boundary of a 10-item /ba/-da/ continuum. Two corresponding /da/ syllables served as the CS- and indicated absence of white noise. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants passively listened to the stimuli. Prior to the EEG session and after intermittent conditioning, participants were asked to identify the syllables in a categorical perception task. Analysis of time-locked electrocortical data revealed amplitude modulations of the N2 (248-312 ms) component as a function of acquired stimulus properties (CS+ versus CS-). Over right hemisphere regions, negativity was specifically enhanced for the CS+ during intermittent conditioning. During extinction, this conditioning effect was paralleled by findings in the time-frequency domain, showing greater oscillatory activity in the gamma-band (25-40 Hz) range, 80-120 ms following onset of the CS+ compared with CS-. A similar pattern emerged in a later time segment of 400-600 ms (30-45 Hz). Aversive conditioning was not reflected in superior categorical perception performance. Our data indicate that electrocortical correlates of speech syllable perception are susceptible to changes induced by contingencies. Physiological differences were not manifest in behavioral advantage for a specific stimulus, i.e., the CS+, however. We conclude that training speech categorization by merely enhancing motivational relevance is not effective for conveying behavioral improvement.

Participants were instructed to remember noun pairs embedded in sentences, with sentences grouped into two temporally distinct lists. At test, in response to noun probes, participants made old/new, followed by source (i.e., list) judgments. Lower band alpha electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during recognition and source retrieval epochs was analyzed using spatial covariance analysis [Hum. Brain Mapp. 2 (1994) 79; J.R. Moeller, C. Ghez, A. Antonini, M.F. Ghilardi, V Dhawan, K. Kazumata, D. Eidelberg, Brain networks of motor behavior assessed by principal component analysis, in: R.E. Carson, M.E. Daube-Witherspoon, P. Herscovitch (Eds.), Quantitative Functional Brain Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography, Academic, San Diego, 1998]: significant activation patterns were found in source retrieval epochs. For young subjects, the regional covariance pattern involved coactivation of right anterior and left posterior electrode sites. Source retrieval performance was predicted by the subject difference in pattern expression between epochs involving correct and incorrect source attribution. The older adults also exhibited significant coactivation of the right anterior and left posterior electrode sites. However, no compensatory activation sites were identified for these elders who performed near chance in source retrieval. In this regard, we replicated the main functional difference between good and poor performing elders reported in a recent O-15 PET study of source retrieval in young and older subjects [Neuroimage 17 (2002) 1394]. These alpha band and O-15 PET findings complement the age group differences found in the time-domain (ERP) analysis of our EEG data [Psychol. Aging 14 (1999) 390]. We suggest that spatial covariance analyses of spectral EEG and MEG data will reveal new information about functional brain activity relevant to normal aging. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The time constant of the amplifier hardware was set to 3.2 s in order to enable recordings that equal to a high pass filter cut off at 0.05 Hz. Burst episodes were selected from the EEGs of 5 post asphyctic full term neonates. The episodes were analysed visually using different montages and subjected to power spectrum analysis. Powers in two bands were estimated; 0-1 and 1-4 Hz, designated very low-and low-frequency activity, respectively (VLFA, LFA). Results: In all infants, VLFA coinciding with the burst episodes could be detected. The duration of the VLFA was about the same as that of the burst episode i.e., around 4 s. The activity was most prominent over the posterior regions. In this small material, a large amount of VLFA neonatally seemed to possibly be related to a more favourable prognosis. Conclusions: VLFA can be recorded from post asphyctic full term neonates using EEG equipment with lowered cut off frequency for the high pass filter. Significance: VLFA normally disregarded due to filtering, is present in the EEG of sick neonates and may carry important clinical information.

J	Leung, LS; Shen, BX				Leung, LS; Shen, BX			Glutamatergic synaptic transmission participates in generating the hippocampal EEG	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						theta rhythm; gamma rhythm; medial septum; NMDA receptors; AMPA receptors	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FREELY MOVING RAT; RHYTHMICAL SLOW ACTIVITY; THETA-FIELD ACTIVITY; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-RHYTHMS; BEHAVING RAT; IN-VITRO	The participation of ionotropic glutamatergic synapses in the generation of hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) of behaving rats has not been systematically studied. in this study, field potentials in hippocampal CA1 were recorded following injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and ei-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, or vehicle control, either into the lateral ventricles or directly into the hippocampus or the medial septum. Intraventricular (i.c.v.) AMPA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3,dione (DNQX, 5-10 mug) decreased the commissural evoked potential and the amplitude of the hippocampal EEG, including the theta rhythm. Theta frequency was decreased by 10 mug, but not 5 jig DNQX i.c.v. Unilateral intrahippocampal injection of DNQX (5 jig) only decreased the amplitude, but not the frequency, of the theta rhythm near the site of injection, without affecting theta amplitude or frequency at the opposite hippocampus. Other than theta, the large irregular activity (with a delta frequency peak at 1-2 Hz) and gamma EEG (30-100 Hz) were also decreased by i.c.v. and intrahippocampal injections of DNQX. Intrahippocampal injection of NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV, 2.5 mug) decreased the amplitude of the theta rhythm and, less consistently, the gamma EEG. The frequency of the theta rhythm and the peak of the commissural evoked potential were not significantly affected by intrahippocampal D-APV injection. Medial septal injections of D-APV or D,L-APV (2.24 mug in 0.4 mul), but not DNQX (110 mug in 0.4 mul), decreased the amplitude of the hippocampal theta significantly, but theta frequency was not significantly affected. It is concluded that both NMDA and AMPA receptors in the hippocampus are involved in generating the amplitude of the hippocampal EEG of theta and gamma frequencies, while NMDA receptors in the medial septum are involved in controlling the amplitude of theta and gamma EEG in the hippocampus. Excitatory glutamatergic synaptic currents, activated by afferents from the entorhinal cortex and CA3, are suggested to participate in hippocampal EEG activities. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Neuro-oscillations were recorded by high-density 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were required to perform two tasks: simple tapping of the index finger and thumb and a complex Luria finger apposition task. Both tasks were performed unimanually and bimanually. There were no significant group differences in the task-related power (TRPow) within alpha 1 (mu1) or in beta 1 frequencies (beta 1). In contrast, there were significant group differences in the alpha 2 (mu2) and beta 2 frequencies (beta 2). Patients had less desychronisation than controls at the electrodes covering the central regions of the scalp. Alpha 2 and beta 2 frequencies have been associated with task-specific sensorimotor integration and motor function, respectively. This activity difference in patients with Parkinson's disease may be due to deficits in sensorimotor integration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings reflect different oscillatory activities during slow wave sleep (stages 2 and 3-4 of the sleep-waking cycle), namely delta oscillations (< 4 Hz), sleep spindles and K complexes. These activities are essentially generated by the activity of the thalamo-cortical relay neurons, the neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus and by the neurons in the cerebral cortex. Development. The combination of the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the thalamic and cortical neurons, together with their synaptic connections, are responsible for the generation of these oscillations. Extra or intracellular recordings of these neurons during spontaneous or anaesthetic-induced sleep show how these neurons change their electrical activity during slow sleep due to the hyperpolarisation of their membrane potential. Thus, the thalamic neurons lower their response to sensory stimuli and filter this information towards the cerebral cortex. Glial cells also contribute to the generation of the delta waves seen in the EEG and oscillate synchronously with the cortical neurons. In addition, the oscillations of this neuronal and glial network is linked to important changes in the concentration of certain ions in the extracellular space; for instance, the K+ and Ca2+ concentration oscillates synchronously with the neuronal and the glial activity. Conclusions. The oscillations in the EEG, which are slower than those observed in the waking state or in paradoxical sleep, play a fundamental role in processing the information handled by the central nervous system and filter the irrelevant information towards the cerebral cortex.

In techniques of time-domain and frequency-domain analysis (short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform) assumptions concerning linearity, stationarity, and templates are made about the brain signals. In the time-frequency component analyser (TFCA), the assumption is that the signal has one or more components with non-overlapping supports in the time-frequency plane. In this study, the TFCA technique was applied to ERPs. TFCA determined and extracted the oscillatory components from the signal and, simultaneously, localized them in the time-frequency plane with high resolution and negligible cross-term contamination. The results obtained by means of TFCA were compared with those obtained by means of other commonly used techniques of ERP analysis, such as bilinear time-frequency distributions and wavelet analysis. It is suggested that TFCA may serve as an appropriate tool for capturing the localized ERP components in the time-frequency domain and for studying the intricate, frequency-based dynamics of the human brain.

The measures are organized in two categories: correlation measures, such as autocorrelation and mutual information at specific lags and new measures derived from oscillations of the EEG time series, such as mean oscillation peak and mean oscillation period. All measures are computed on successive segments of multichannel EEG windows selected from early, intermediate and late preictal states from four epochs. Hypothesis tests applied for each channel and epoch showed good discrimination of the preictal states and allowed for the selection of optimal measures. These optimal measures, together with other standard measures (skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent) formed the feature set for feature-based clustering and the feature-subset selection procedure showed that the best preictal state classification was obtained with the same optimal features.

In the method, features were computed from the Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) signals recorded from 61 electrodes while subjects perceived a picture. Here, two modifications have been proposed to improve the classification performance: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and background EEG effects from the VEP signals and normalization. Two classifiers were used: Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP (SFA), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The experimental results using 800 VEP signals from 20 subjects with leave-one-out cross validation strategy showed that PCA and normalization improved the classification performance for both the classifiers. The best classification performance of 95.25% obtained using the improved method shows that 40 Hz EEG oscillations are suitable for use as biometrics.

Sampling EEG at 950 Hz, they established an HFE bandwidth of interest ranging from 100-475 Hz. We extend their work by applying discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of HFE signals sampled at 1000 Hz and partitioned into spectral bands along specific frequency ranges for the assessment of sleep-wake state transition, sleep, and active cognitive engagement. Methods: There were 13 volunteers (6 men, 7 women, 30 +/- 3 yr) who participated in a 40-h sleep-deprivation study, during which time they performed multiple cognitive tasks. EEG, in synchrony with other physiological signals, was collected at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. EEG and task performance results from two volunteers are discussed in this preliminary analysis of the C3-C4 region data. Spectral components obtained from DFT are delineated into five main frequency bands: low, (LFB, 1-15 Hz); intermediate (IFB, 16-50 Hz); and 3 high frequency bands: HFBI (51-100 Hz); HFB2 (101-200 Hz); and HFB3 (201-500 Hz) for analysis purposes. Results: LFB in the 1-15 Hz range at 0.40 spectrum proportion indicated declining alertness; LFB above 0.50 signals transition to sleep; and LFB at 0.70 indicates Stage 2/3 sleep. HFB3 in the 201-500 Hz range at 0.25 and above was a marker of cognitive function and/or capacity. Conclusions: HFE may provide a quantitative measure of cognitive function capacity. LFB may provide a measure for awake, asleep, or awake-sleep transition, and HFB3 an estimate of cognitive task engagement. HFE may be applied for electroencephalographic monitoring of cognitive performance.

The method is called local singular spectrum analysis (local SSA). It is based on a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to clusters of the multidimensional signals obtained after embedding the signals in their time-delayed coordinates. The decomposition of the multidimensional signals in each cluster is achieved by relating the largest eigenvalues with the large amplitude artefact component of the embedded signal. Then by reverting the clustering and embedding processes, the high-amplitude artefact can be extracted. Subtracting it from the original signal a corrected EEG signal results. The algorithm is applied to segments of real EEG recordings containing paroxysmal epileptiform activity contaminated by large EOG artefacts. We will show that the method can be applied also in parallel to correct all channels that present high-amplitude artefacts like ocular movement interferences or high-amplitude low frequency baseline drifts. The extracted artefacts as well as the corrected EEG will be presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

These reciprocal relations are emphasized when a visual stimulus is degraded, forcing the perceiver to fill the missing information in, based on internal representations. The neural mechanisms by which internal representations facilitate visual perception are still unclear. Here we investigated the role of EEG oscillations in the gamma band, thought to reflect the elaboration of internal visual representations, in the experience-based perception of visual scenes. Twelve subjects were trained with degraded images of natural scenes. EEG was recorded while they performed a detection task on trained and untrained degraded stimuli. Non-phase-locked gamma band responses in a large frequency spectrum (55-85 Hz) were observed around 200 ms post-stimulus onset at posterior sites, and were larger when subjects reported an accurate perception based on previous experience. These results suggest that mid-latency gamma oscillations in the visual cortex underlie the experience-based perception of visual scenes. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Since there has been no study on nonstationary time series, we apply MDC and MDP to such time series using a short-time analyzing window. In this paper, we deal with an artificial multivariate time series, similar to an electroencephalogram (EEG), for numerical simulation. First, MDC and MDP are defined. Next, the artificial time series is analyzed using these methods. Finally, we consider whether these methods can be applied to nonstationary or weakly stationary time series. The production model for the artificial time series contains four characteristic structures: information flow rises, information flow dissolves, delay time of information flow varies, and center frequency of a source signal varies. As a result, the information flow in a multivariate artificial time series can be visualized by using MDC and MDP with a short-time analyzing window.

This toolbox can describe the power spectrum, cross wavelet transform, coherence, bi-coherence, cross phase angle and phase synchronization of two neuronal oscillations. Through a case study of focus epilepsy model, a linear and nonlinear correlation between the neuronal oscillations in the CA1 and CA3 of rat hippocampus are computed. The results show that the tool can be directly applied to analyze and quantify the instantaneous interaction of two neuronal oscillations, which could be a helpful tool to analyze and understand the mechanism of epileptic seizure in EEG recordings.

Synchronization of neural responses in the beta-band (15-30 Hz) and gamma-band range (30-80 Hz) has been implicated as a possible neural substrate for dysfunctional coordination in schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the electroencephalography ( EEG) activity in 19 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, edition IV criteria, diagnosis of schizophrenia and 19 healthy control subjects during a Gestalt perception task. EEG data were analyzed for phase synchrony and induced spectral power as an index of neural synchronization. Schizophrenia patients were impaired significantly in the detection of images that required the grouping of stimulus elements into coherent object representations. This deficit was accompanied by longer reaction times in schizophrenia patients. Deficits in Gestalt perception in schizophrenia patients were associated with reduced phase synchrony in the beta-band (20-30 Hz), whereas induced spectral power in the beta-band (40-70 Hz) was mainly intact. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia patients are impaired in the long-range synchronization of neural responses, which may reflect a core deficit in the coordination of neural activity and underlie the specific cognitive dysfunctions associated with the disorder.

These brain oscillations have been studied extensively in the resting electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as in the underlying evoked oscillations that make up the event-related potentials (ERPs). There are several approaches to elucidate the possible mechanisms of these brain oscillations. One approach is to look at the neurophysiology and neurochemistry involved in generating and modulating these oscillations. Another more recent approach is to examine the genetic underpinnings of these neural oscillations. It is proposed that the genetic underpinnings of these oscillations are likely to stem from regulatory genes which control the neurochemical processes of the brain, and therefore influence neural function. Genetic analyses of human brain oscillations may identify genetic loci underlying the functional organization of human neuroelectric activity. Brain oscillations represent important correlates of human information processing and cognition. They represent highly heritable traits that are less complex and more proximal to gene function than either diagnostic labels or traditional cognitive measures. Therefore these oscillations may be utilized as phenotypes of cognition and as valuable tools for the understanding of some complex genetic disorders. Genetic loci that have been recently identified regarding both resting and evoked brain oscillations involving the GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems of the brain are discussed. It is concluded that the advent of genomics and proteomics and a fuller understanding of gene regulation will open new horizons on the critical electrical events so essential for human brain function.

The electroencephalographic (EEG) is often used to verify the influence of music on human brain activity. In this study, we used frequency distribution analysis and the independent component analysis (ICA) to analyze to discover the EEG responses of subjects with different musical signal stimuli. It is expected that some features on EEG can be demonstrated to reflect the different musical signal stimuli. The EEG of six healthy volunteers listening different music was recorded. We used International 10-20 System to get 19 channels of EEG signal. Musical signal stimuli are metal music, sonata music and the favorite music selected by subjects. Spectra analyses based on Fourier transform were applied to obtain the alpha, beta, gamma and theta band power of EEG signal under different music stimuli. We used the power at each band of each channel as the features of EEG. The correlation of the features between different situations and subjects was used to show which channel display the difference of EEG signals. Besides, ICA was applied to assist us in the process of isolating noise components and to provide cues to explain the functions of different brain areas in point of neurology. The result showed that some independent components obtained from ICA can demonstrate more significant difference for different music. The features composed of spectral power of each band are very similar in listening metal music, but showed less similarity in listening sonata music. Hence, the response of EEG to sonata is more meaningful and metal music may induce same effect for different subjects. T3 and Pz are the channels with relatively lower correlation under different music stimuli. Therefore, the locations of T3 and Pz of brain may play an important role in feeling music.

Brain electrical source analysis (BESA) is applied to create a discrete multiple source model. This model is used as a source montage to transform the recorded data from sensor level into brain source space. This provides source waveforms of the modeled brain regions as a direct measure for their activities on a single trial basis. The source waveforms are transformed into time-frequency space using complex demodulation. Magnitude-squared coherence between the brain sources reveals oscillatory coupling between sources. This procedure allows one to separate the time-frequency content of different brain regions even if their activities severely overlap at the surface. Thus, source coherence overcomes problems of localization and interpretation that are inherent to coherence analysis at sensor level. The principle of source coherence is illustrated using an EEG recording of an error-related negativity as an example. In this experiment the subject performed a visuo-motor task. Source coherence analysis revealed dynamical linking between posterior and central areas within the gamma-band around the time of button press at a post-stimulus latency of 200-300 ms.

From 98 consenting patient experiments, 98 distinct EEG recordings were collected prior to incision during isoflurane anaesthesia of different levels. The seven measures of recurrence plot were extracted from each of four-channel EEG time series. Prediction was made by means of ANN. Training and testing the ANN used the 'leave-one-out' method. The prediction was tested by monitoring the responses to incision. The system was able to correctly classify purposeful responses in average accuracy of 92.86% of the cases. This method is also computationally fast and acceptable real-time clinical performance was obtained.

How muscle fatigue influences these two types of cell populations, however, is unknown. Because the phasic neurons are only active briefly before the task but the tonic ones are active continuously throughout the task, we hypothesized that fatigue would have a less effect on cortical signals during the preparation phase (representing phasic discharge) than that during the sustained phase (representing tonic discharge). Eight participants performed 200 handgrip maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) with simultaneous recordings of scalp electroencephalographic (EEG), handgrip force, and finger flexor surface electromyographic (EMG) signals. Power spectrograms of the EEG during the preparation and sustained phases were analyzed in each of the five 40-trial blocks, with data from the first block representing a condition of moderate fatigue and the last, severe fatigue. Movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) was derived by trigger-averaging 40 EEG epochs in each block. The power of all EEG frequencies did not alter significantly during the preparation phase but decreased significantly during the sustained phase of the contraction. The MRCP negative potential (NP) related to motor task preparation only showed minimal changes. These results suggest that MVC-induced fatigue has differential effects on cortical signals during motor task preparation compared to its execution and maintenance. The signals of the two phases may represent activities of the two cortical cell populations previously found by animal studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The time course of visual word recognition as revealed by linear regression analysis of ERP data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						visual word recognition; lexical decision; word frequency; lexicality; LSA; source estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORTHOGRAPHIC SIMILARITY; NEUROMAGNETIC EVIDENCE; LEXICAL ACTIVATION; SEMANTIC MEMORY; HIGH-FREQUENCY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; FORM AREA; BRAIN; LENGTH	EEG correlates of a range of psycholinguistic word properties were used to investigate the time course of access to psycholinguistic information during visual word recognition. Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word-pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ins after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ins. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages (> 200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.

Methods: Local coherence was derived from continuous EEG recordings from closely spaced (1 cm) chronically implanted extra-dural electrodes over the tight hemisphere in five fetal baboons (Papio sp.). A ratio of high to low frequency EEG band power (14-18 Hz to 4-7 Hz), was used to characterize EEG power cycling. Results: Data were obtained within a developmental window (137-151 days; term similar to 175 days) during which fetal EEG power cycling becomes increasingly well-organized. During this period ultradian oscillations in local coherence with periods of similar to 1 h developed in parallel with EEG power cycling of approximately the same periods. However, the cross-correlation and phase relationship between local coherence and power oscillations were variable. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cycles in cortical synchrony develop in parallel with fetal power cycles, but are not tightly coupled to them. Significance: Coherence provides a direct measure of cortical network dynamics not possible with univariate EEG measures such as spectral power. Reported here are the first measurements of local coherence in the developing fetal brain. Local coherence is studied with the long-term goal of monitoring the development of cortical network activity. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: The functional interactions between the different EEG channels during the nocturnal seizures were analyzed by means of the so-called synchronization likelihood (SL). SL is a measure of the dynamical interdependencies between a time series (EEG channel) and one or more other time series. In contrast to coherence, SL measures linear as well as non-linear interdependencies and it can do so as a function of time, making it suitable for non-stationary time series. Results: The main result of our single-patient study is the demonstration of a significant hyper-synchronization during NFLE seizures in the 8-12 Hz band which seems to be stopped by an increase in synchronization in the 0.5-4 Hz band, towards the end of each ictal episode. Conclusions: We suggest that a self-inhibitin complex mechanism might be responsible for the termination of ictal episodes which might take place at the level of the cortical layers and might involve mainly pyramidal neurons. Significance: This study shows that advanced EEG analysis methods can help the current understanding of ictal manifestations of NFLE. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: The method of the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) is a frequency-domain approach, based on a multivariate autoregressive modeling of time series and on the concept of Granger causality. Since the spreading of the potential from the cortex to the sensors makes it difficult to infer the relation between the spatial patterns on the sensor space and those on the cortical sites, we propose the use of the DTF method on cortical signals estimated from high resolution EEG recordings, which exhibit a higher spatial resolution than conventional cerebral electromagnetic measures. The simulation study was followed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results obtained for different levels of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and temporal length, as they have been systematically imposed on simulated signals. The whole methodology was then applied to high resolution EEG data recorded during a visually paced finger movement. Results: The statistical analysis performed returns that during simulations, DTF is able to estimate correctly the imposed connectivity patterns under reasonable operative conditions, i.e. when data exhibit a SNR of at least 3 and a length of at least 75 s of non-consecutive recordings at 64 Hz of sampling rate, equivalent, more generally, to 4800 data samples. Conclusions: Functional connectivity patterns of cortical activity can be effectively estimated under general conditions met in any practical EEG recordings, by combining high resolution EEG techniques, linear inverse estimation and the DTF method. Significance: The estimation of cortical connectivity can be performed not only with hemodynamic measurements, by using functional MRI recordings, but also with modem EEG recordings treated with advanced computational techniques.

However, problems in technique of recording the DC-potential in the neocortex of humans and waking animals substantially restrict the possibilities of studying functional consequences of the SD. In this article, the EEG pattern was studied in detail at the moment of the SD development. Specific features were revealed, which make it possible to detect the SD without recording shifts of the DC-potential. At the moment of the SD arrival, the interhemispheric balance drastically disturbs because of a strong decrease in the high-frequency activity. By the time indices, the course of the suppression of the gamma1 and gamma2 EEG frequencies is the most reliable symptom of the SD wave development. The EEG spectral power in the delta band increases with a certain delay in reference to the deep depression of the high-frequency activity and is, in essence, an SD aftereffect. The found EEG signs of an SD wave can substantially simplify the identification of this phenomenon both in experiment and clinical conditions in certain pathological states of the brain.

J	Kim, KH; Kim, JH				Kim, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Ja Hyun			Analysis of induced gamma-band activity in EEG during visual perception of Korean, English, Chinese words	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); gamma-band activity; Korean word; Chinsese characters; lateralization; visual word perception	ACTIVATION PATTERN; TIME-COURSE; MODULATION; ENGAGEMENT; RESPONSES; CORTEX; POWER; ERP	The oscillation of brain activities in the gamma-band is known to be a manifestation of the formation of neuronal assemblies that jointly constitute neural correlates of feature binding and conscious awareness. Visual word perception is a task that demands a considerable amount of cognitive resources and integration of information from multiple functionally connected neuronal circuits at various scales. Thus, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in gamma-band activity (GBA) would be observed during visual word perception. The purpose of this study was to examine whether meaningful increases in GBA occur during visual word perception and to explore similarities and differences in the amount and spatiotemporal GBA patterns while native Korean subjects perceive Korean, English, and Chinese words. We also aimed at identifying relationships between GBA increase and a behavioral measure such as response time. The results of power spectrum and time-frequency analyses showed that the increases in GBA were most significant in the prefrontal, frontal, and temporal sites, which are known to be relevant to visual word perception. The GBAs in the prefrontal and temporal sites were significantly correlated with response time. The differences in spatiotemporal patterns of GBA among languages were not prominent compared to inter-individual differences. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we proposed a new NMF algorithm with temporal smoothness constraint that aims to extract non-negative components that have meaningful physical or physiological interpretations. We propose two constraints and derive new multiplicative learning rules. Specifically, we apply the proposed algorithm, combined with advanced time-frequency analysis and machine learning techniques, to early detection of Alzheimer disease using clinical EEG recordings. Empirical results show promising performance.

The estimation scheme is based on classical covariance component estimation using restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). We have focused previously on the estimation of spatial covariance components under simple assumptions about the temporal correlations. Here we extend the scheme using temporal basis functions to place constraints on the temporal form of the responses. We show how the same scheme can estimate evoked responses that are phase-locked to the stimulus and induced responses that are not. For a single trial the model is exactly the same, In the context of multiple trials, however, the inherent distinction between evoked and induced responses calls for different treatments of the underlying hierarchical multitrial model. We derive the respective models and show how they can be estimated efficiently using ReML. This enables the Bayesian estimation of evoked and induced changes in power or, more generally, the energy of wavelet coefficients.

The purpose of this study was to test whether auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia patients reflect abnormalities in gamma and beta frequency oscillations and to investigate source. generators of these abnormalities. This theory was tested using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) source imaging. Twenty-five schizophrenia patients with treatment refractory AH, lasting for at least 2 years, and 23 schizophrenia patients with non-AH (N-AH) in the past 2 years were recruited for the study. Spectral analysis of the qEEG and source imaging of frequency bands of artifact-free 30 s epochs were examined during rest. AH patients showed significantly increased beta I and beta 2 frequency amplitude compared with N-AH patients. Gamma and beta (2 and 3) frequencies were significantly correlated in AH but not in N-AH patients. Source imaging revealed significantly increased beta (I and 2) activity in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left medial frontal gyrus in AH versus N-AH patients. These results imply that AH is reflecting increased beta frequency oscillations with neural generators localized in speech-related areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twelve normal subjects were measured two times with a test-retest interval of several days. Open- and closed-eyes conditions were used, representing different levels of arousal. The amplitude of the alpha and beta oscillations was extracted with bandpass filtering and the Hilbert transform. The long-range temporal correlations were quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis. Results: The amplitude dynamics of the alpha and beta oscillations demonstrated power-law long-range temporal correlations lasting for tens of seconds. These correlations were degraded in the open- compared to the closed-eyes condition. Test-retest statistics demonstrated that the long-range temporal correlations had significant reliability, which was greatest in the closed-eyes condition. Conclusions: The presence of long-range temporal correlations indicates that the amplitude of neuronal oscillations at a given time is dependent on the amplitude at times as remote in the past as tens of seconds. The reliability of long-range temporal correlations suggests that the mechanisms generating the amplitude fluctuations are not perturbed over several days. The systematic changes in the scaling exponents at different levels of arousal indicate that these changes occur on many time scales (5-80 s) as a result of modifications in the intrinsic dynamics of the neuronal oscillations. Significance: This study demonstrates that the dynamics of spontaneous neuronal oscillations possess long-range temporal correlations with properties suitable for functional and clinical studies.

Frequency-following and connectivity of different visual areas in response to contrast-reversal stimulation	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						visual system; magnetoencephalography; MEG; cross-correlation; temporal oscillations; pseudo steady-state	STEADY-STATE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PATTERN-REVERSAL; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; EEG RESPONSES; CORTEX; TRANSIENT; FIELD	The sensitivity of visual areas to different temporal frequencies, as well as the functional connections between these areas, was examined using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Alternating circular sinusoids (0, 3.1,8.7 and 14 Hz) were presented to foveal and peripheral locations in the visual field to target ventral and dorsal stream structures, respectively. It was hypothesized that higher temporal frequencies would preferentially activate dorsal stream structures. To determine the effect of frequency on the cortical response we analyzed the late time interval (220-770 ms) using a multi-dipole spatio-temporal analysis approach to provide source locations and timecourses for each condition. As an exploratory aspect, we performed cross-correlation analysis on the source timecourses to determine which sources responded similarly within conditions. Contrary to predictions, dorsal stream areas were not activated more frequently during high temporal frequency stimulation. However, across cortical sources the frequency-following response showed a difference, with significantly higher power at the second harmonic for the 3.1 and 8.7 Hz stimulation and at the first and second harmonics for the 14 Hz stimulation with this pattern seen robustly in area V1. Cross-correlations of the source timecourses showed that both low- and high-order visual areas, including dorsal and ventral stream areas, were significantly correlated in the late time interval. The results imply that frequency information is transferred to higher-order visual areas without translation. Despite the less complex waveforms seen in the late interval of time, the cross-correlation results show that visual, temporal and parietal cortical areas are intricately involved in late-interval visual processing.

First, we briefly discuss the current classification of different memory systems and their neuroanatomical correlates, focusing on episodic memory and evidence from lesion studies. We then survey both fMRI and iEEG studies of memory function. For each modality, we discuss its physiological basis, as well as point out key studies that have led to new insights regarding memory. Advantages and disadvantages of each brain mapping modality are addressed. Wherever appropriate, we point out implications these studies have for the treatment of patients with epilepsy. We conclude this review with further discussion regarding the potential for combining fMRI and iEEG techniques in future investigations of memory function. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, at present time it is possible to capture information about the temporal profile of coherence, which is particularly helpful in studying non-stationary, time-varying brain dynamics, like the Wavelet Coherence (WC). In this paper we propose a new approach of studying brain synchronization dynamics by extending the use of WC to include certain statistically significant (in terms of signal coherence) time segments, to study and characterize any disturbances present in the functional connectivity network of schizophrenia patients. Graph theoretical measures and visualization provide the tools to study the "disconnection syndrome" as proposed for schizophrenia. Specifically, we analyzed multichannel EEG data from twenty stabilized patients with schizophrenia and controls in an experiment of working memory (WM) using the gamma band (i.e., the EEG frequency of ca. 40 Hz), which is activated during the connecting activity (i.e., the "binding" of the neurons). The results are in accordance with the disturbance of connections between the neurons giving additional information related to the localization of most prominent disconnection.

The beta 3-subunit deficiency causes a failure of intrathalamic reticular nucleus inhibition, leading to abnormally synchronized thalamocortical oscillations. We postulated that this pathophysiology underlies the abnormal cortical EEG and triggers interictal spikes and seizures, but extrathalamic regions also contribute to interictal spikes and seizures, so that the EEG slowing should reveal an absence-like response profile, whereas spikes and seizures have dual responsiveness to absence and partial-seizure drugs. Methods: Recording electrodes were implanted over the parietal cortices of wild-type, heterozygotes, and homozygous null mice. In each experiment, EEG was recorded for 45 min, either drug or vehicle administered, and EEG recorded for another 3 h. Each EEG was scored for slow-wave activity, interictal spikes, and seizures by a reader blinded to treatments. Results: Interictal spiking and percentage of time in EEG slowing in heterozygotes were increased by the proabsence drug baclofen (GABA(B)-receptor agonist), whereas CGP 35348 (GABA(B)-receptor antagonist) had the opposite effect. The antiabsence drug ethosuximide markedly suppressed EEG slowing and interictal spiking in heterozygote and null mice. Broad-spectrum clonazepam and valproate were more effective on interictal spiking than on EEG slowing, and fosphenytoin suppressed only interictal spiking. Conclusions: The results suggest that this model of Angelman syndrome, although not expressing typical absence seizures, is characterized by hypersynchronous thalamocortical oscillations that possess absence-like pharmacologic responsiveness and promote EEG slowing, interictal spikes, and convulsive seizures.

Ocular motor involvement with West Nile virus is rare. Objective: To describe a patient with West Nile virus encephalitis that resulted in opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome with persistent ocular oscillation on electroencephalography during stage 2 sleep. Patient: A 53-year-old man who presented with viral prodrome followed by intense vertigo and encephalopathy. In addition to multifocal myoclonic jerks in the extremities, his eye movements were disrupted by bursts of high-frequency, conjugate ocular oscillations that occurred in random directions. Results: Electroencephalography showed eye movement artifacts during the awake state and stage 2 sleep. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome remained disabling 3 months after onset but markedly improved 8 months after onset. Conclusions: West Nile virus is another cause of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome that can occur in conjunction with encephalitis. The presence of an eye movement artifact on results of electroencephalography during stage 2 sleep should raise suspicion for opsoclonus.

We show that mutually consistent explanations and simulation of experimental data can be achieved for cortical gamma activity, synchronous oscillation, and the main features of the EEG power spectrum including the cerebral rhythms, and evoked potentials. These simulations include consideration of dendritic and synaptic dynamics, AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptors, and intracortical and cortical/subcortical interactions. The dynamic properties exhibited in the simulations, Hebbian synaptic modification regulated by a limited set of innate "reward" mechanisms, and infomax principles, can be combined to yield an explanation of elementary adaptive learning.

The cause of the differences is not clear. To investigate the differences between these two types of sleep, in this study, hypnotic drug diazepam (DZP) induced sleep was compared with the recovery sleep following sleep deprivation. Power spectral analysis was used to reveal the different EEG features of these two types of sleep. EEGs were recorded in rat occipital cortex with implanted electrodes under three vigilance states of waking, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Spectral powers of the EEG segments were evaluated in sub-bands of delta (0.5-4.0 Hz), theta (4.25-8.0 Hz), alpha (8.25-16.0 Hz), beta (16.25-25.0 Hz) and for total frequency range of 0.5-25.0 Hz. The data showed that both hypnotic drug DZP and sleep deprivation increased the time of SWS and REM sleep; however, DZP decreased low-frequency activity in SWS sleep, while sleep deprivation increased low-frequency activity in SWS sleep during recovery sleep. The decrease of low-frequency activity in DZP induced SWS sleep could result from the DZP inhibitory effects. The results suggest that increases of sleep evoked by different factors can have different features and the method of power spectral analysis is useful in revealing deep features of different types of sleep.

These patterns reflect alterations in the brain network synchrony. It is not clear why seizures undergo these dynamical changes and what mechanisms contribute to or cause these changes. In this work we use neural modeling studies to address these issues. We investigate the role of synaptic plasticity and nonsynaptic neuronal plasticity (firing frequency adaptation) in regulating pattern of neuronal network synchrony. We show that nonsynaptic neuronal plasticity (i.e. calcium dependent afterhyperpolarization in neurons) can regulate the frequency of the dominant rhythm in EEG while synaptic potentiation may be responsible for irregular bursting prior to seizure termination.

We examine the hypothesis that the dynamics of this process displays scale-free, self-similar properties. EEGs (19 channels, average reference, sample frequency 500 Hz) of 15 healthy subjects (10 men; mean age 22.5 years) were analyzed during eyes-closed and eyes-open no-task conditions. Mean level of synchronization as a function of time was estimated with the synchronization likelihood for five frequency bands (0.5-4, 4-8, 8-13, 13-30, and 30-48 Hz). Scaling in these time series was investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA analysis of global synchronization time series showed scale-free characteristics, suggesting neuronal dynamics do not necessarily have a characteristic time constant. The scaling exponent as determined with DFA differed significantly for different frequency bands and conditions. The exponent was close to 1.5 for low frequencies (delta, theta, and alpha) and close to 1 for beta and gamma bands. Eye opening decreased the exponent, in particular in alpha and beta bands. Fluctuations of EEG synchronization in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands exhibit scale-free dynamics in eyes-closed as well as eyes-open no-task states. The decrease in the scaling exponent following eye opening reflects a relative preponderance of rapid fluctuations with respect to slow changes in the mean synchronization level. The existence of scaling suggests that the underlying dynamics may display self-organized criticality, possibly representing a near-optimal state for information processing. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In a preliminary experiment, intense CO2 laser stimuli were delivered to the hand dorsum of five volunteers. The average amplitude of EEG epochs was estimated in the time-frequency (TF) domain using the continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMT). The result was used as a TF filter enhancing Adelta-nociceptor induced EEG responses. In a second experiment, eight other subjects were delivered laser stimuli with six intensities. The CMT of each EEG epoch was Computed. After applying the TF filter, amplitudes within a predefined interval were summed. Whether this sum predicted the occurrence of Adelta-nociceptor activation was tested using the reaction-time to discriminate between Adelta- or C-fibre mediated detection. Results showed that this method accurately identified single-trial EEG responses to Adelta-nociceptor activation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that variance in nonspatial attention and switches of attention toward target locations can account for variance in reaction times of neutral trials. Lateralized event-related potentials (ERPs) and changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands served as predictor variables in a single-trial logistic regression analysis to predict the direction of spatial attention in cued and neutral trials. The contingent negative variation (CNV) and nonlateralized changes in the alpha hand served as markers of nonspatial attention. The direction of attention in cued trials was reliably predicted from single-trial lateralized ERP components. In neutral trials, only evidence for nonspatial attention was found, indicated by increases in the CNV and decreases in alpha preceding targets to which responses were relatively fast.

Within a few minutes, a cable car facilitates an ascent from 1702 m to 2700 in above sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mmHg (as compared to 760 mmHg at sea level). In this study ten healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at 990 in and 2700 in in altitude. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green tight flashed (repeated 50 times). The corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. From the ECG heart rate and heart rate variability measures in the time and frequency domain were calculated.

This article presents applications of multivariate autoregression (MVAR) modeling for analyzing the interaction between EEG and EMG, which is challenging because of their different modalities. In contrast to previous research employing the WAR modeling by means of frequency-domain analysis, our approach emphasizes time-domain analysis. We examined one normal subject and one mirror-movement (MM) patient. The task was a weak isotonic contraction of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle in the normal subject, and the left extensor carpi radialis brevis in the MM patient. For each subject, three channels consisting of two EEG signals and one EMG signal were analyzed. The EMG signals were from the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices. By using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and by choosing the appropriate data length, the model order was determined in a stable fashion. Our results provided plausible information on EEG-EMG networks: (1) Information-transmission-delay time that seems physiologically appropriate, and (2) relative contribution from the ipsi- and contralateral corticospinal pathway, which is opposite in the normal subject in comparison to MM patients.

Cortical muscle coupling in Parkinson's disease (PD) bradykinesia	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION-SUPPLEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Congress on Parkinsons Disease and Related Disorders	JUN 05-09, 2005	Berlin, GERMANY				MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; PRECISION GRIP TASK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; DEPENDENT MODULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; TIME-SERIES; EEG-EMG; COHERENCE; NEURONS	Objectives: To determine if novel methods establishing patterns in EEG-EMG coupling can infer subcortical influences on the motor cortex, and the relationship between these subcortical rhythms and bradykinesia. Background: Previous work has suggested that bradykinesia may be a result of inappropriate oscillatory drive to the muscles. Typically, the signal processing method of coherence is used to infer coupling between a single channel of EEG and a single channel of rectified EMG, which demonstrates 2 peaks during sustained contraction: one, similar to 10 Hz, which is pathologically increased in PD, and a similar to 30 Hz peak which is decreased in PD, and influenced by pharmacological manipulation of GABA(A) receptors in normal subjects. Materials and methods: We employed a novel multiperiodic squeezing paradigm which also required simultaneous movements. Seven PD subjects (on and off L-Dopa) and five normal subjects were recruited. Extent of bradykinesia was inferred by reduced relative performance of the higher frequencies of the squeezing paradigm and UPDRS scores. We employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to determine EEG/EMG coupling. Results: Corticomuscular coupling was detected during the continually changing force levels. Different components included those over the primary motor cortex (ipsilaterally and contralaterally) and over the midline. Subjects with greater bradykinesia had a tendency towards increased similar to 10 Hz coupling and reduced -30 Hz coupling that was erratically reversed with L-dopa. Conclusions: These results suggest that lower similar to 10 Hz peak may represent pathological oscillations within the basal ganglia which may be a contributing factor to bradykinesia in PD.

We developed a new wavelet transform that allows to obtain the time-frequency dynamics of the dominating rhythm during the discharges. SWD were analyzed pre- and post-administration of certain drugs. SWD recorded predrug demonstrate quite uniform time-frequency dynamics of the dominant rhythm. The beginning of the discharge has a short period with the highest frequency value (up to 15 Hz). Then the frequency decreases to 7-9 Hz and frequency modulation occurs during the discharge in this range with a period of 0.5-0.7 s. Specific changes of SWD time-frequency dynamics were found after the administration of psychoactive drugs, addressing different brain mediator and modulator systems. Short multiple SWDs appeared under low (0.5 mg/kg) doses of haloperidol, they are characterized by a fast frequency decrease to 5-6 Hz at the end of every discharge. The frequency of the dominant frequency of SWD was not stable in long lasting SWD after 1.0 mg/kg or more haloperidol: then two periodicities were found. Long lasting SWD seen after the administration of vigabatrin showed a stable frequency of the discharge. The EEG after Ketamin showed a distinct 5 s quasiperiodicity. No clear changes of time-frequency dynamics of SWD were found after perilamine. It can be concluded that the use of the modified Morlet wavelet transform allows to describe significant parameters of the dynamics in the time-frequency domain of the dominant rhythm of SWD that were not previously detected.

Heavily contaminated EEG signals are hard to analyse quantitatively and also are usually rejected for visual inspection by physicians, resulting in a considerable loss of collected information. The aim of this work was to develop a computer-based method of time series analysis for such EEGs. A method is presented for filtering those frequencies associated with muscle activity using a wavelet transform. One of the advantages of this method over traditional filtering is that wavelet filtering of some frequency bands does not modify the pattern of the remaining ones. In consequence, the dynamics associated with them do not change. After generation of a 'noise free' signal by removal of the muscle artifacts using wavelets, a dynamic analysis was performed using non-linear dynamics metric tools. The characteristic parameters evaluated (correlation dimension D(2) and largest Lyapunov exponent lambda(1)) were compatible with those obtained in previous works. The average values obtained were: D(2) = 4.25 and lambda(1) = 3.27 for the pre-ictal stage; D(2) = 4.03 and lambda(1) = 2.68 for the tonic seizure stage; D(2) = 4.11 and lambda(1) = 2.46 for the clonic seizure stage.

A time-frequency representation method was applied to EEG data in order to obtain stimulus related early evoked (phase-locked) gamma band activity (29-45 Hz) and was analyzed within a 0-150 ms time window range. Significant reduction of the early evoked gamma band response in the frontal and parietal regions during target stimulus processing was observed in HR subjects compared to LR subjects. Additionally, the HR group showed less differentiation between target and non-target stimuli in both frontal and parietal regions compared to the LR group, indicating difficulty in early stimulus processing, probably due to a dysfunctional frontoparietal attentional network. The results indicate that the deficient early evoked gamma band response may precede the development of alcoholism and could be a potential endophenotypic marker of alcoholism risk.

In this paper, we modified a model proposed by Wendling et al. [Wendling F, Bartolomei F, Bellanger JJ, Chauvel P. Epileptic fast activity can be explained by a model of impaired GABAergic dendritic inhibition. Eur J Neurosci 2002; 15:1499-508] to simulate EEG power spectral density (PSD) in some regions of interest (ROIs) during simple tasks (finger movement or working memory tests). The work consists of two subsequent stages: (1) in the first we evaluated the role of some model parameters (i.e., average gain of synapses and their time constants) in affecting power spectral density. This analysis confirmed the possibility to simulate various EEG rhythms (in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency ranges) by modifying just the time constants of the synapses. The position of the individual rhythms (i.e., the corresponding peaks in the PSD) can be finely tuned acting on the average gain of fast inhibitory synapses. This analysis suggested that a single neural mass model produces a unimodal spectrum. which can be finely adjusted, but cannot mimic the overall complexity of EEG in an entire cortical area. (2) Hence, in the second stage we built a model of a ROI by combining three neural mass models arranged in parallel. With this model, and using an automatic fitting procedure, we carefully reproduced the PSD of cortical EEG in several Rots during finger movement, and their temporal changes during a working memory task, by estimating nine parameters. The estimated parameters represent the excitation of each population (mean value and variance of exogenous input noise) and the average gain of fast inhibitory synapses. Cortical EEGs were computed with an inverse propagation algorithm, starting from measurement performed with a high number of electrodes on the scalp (46-96). Results show that the proposed model is able to mimic PSD of cortical activity acting on a few parameters, which represent external activation and short-time synaptic changes. This information may be exploited to reach a quantitative summary of electrical activity in ROIs during a task, and to derive information on connectivity, starting from non-invasive EEG measurements.

Studies on experimental animals have shown that this kind of early activity in cortical structures is composed of long-lasting, intermittent network events, which undergo a developmental decline that is closely paralleled by the maturation of GABAergic inhibition. In order to examine whether similar events occur in the immature human cortex, we performed direct current-coupled electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from sleeping preterm babies. We show now that much of the preterm EEG activity is confined to spontaneous, slow activity transients. These transients are characterized by a large voltage deflection that nests prominent oscillatory activity in several frequency bands covering the whole frequency spectrum of the preterm EEG (< 0.1-30 Hz). The slow voltage deflections had an amplitude of up to 800 mu V. Most of these 'giant' events originated in the temporo-occipital areas, with a maximum rate of about 8/min, and their occurrence as well as amplitude showed a decline by the time of normal birth. In age-matched fetal brain tissue, this decrease in the spontaneous activity transients was associated with a developmental up-regulation of the neuronal chloride extruder K+-Cl- cotransporter 2, a crucial molecule for the generation of inhibitory GABAergic Cl- currents. Our work indicates that slow endogenous activity transients in the immature human neocortex are mostly confined to the prenatal stage and appear to be terminated in parallel with the maturation of functional GABAergic inhibition.

J	Cvetkovic, D; Cosic, I				Cvetkovic, Dean; Cosic, Irena			Automated ELF magnetic field stimulation of the human EEG activity	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; HUMAN BRAIN; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; TIME	The automated tracking system was designed and developed with the goal to generate a consistent pattern of the extremely low frequency (ELF) or radio frequency (RF) magnetic field distribution around the human head. The automated tracking system consisted of mechanical, control software and hardware designs which all passed through a development process of refinement and operational performance of the robotic arm, the general user interface, communication, motor control and electromagnetic field computation. In this paper, the automated tracking system was utilised for the single-blind counter-balanced pilot study to investigate whether the human electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could be altered when stimulated by localised ELF magnetic field at the top-central human head region. The statistical results performed on the recorded EEG data revealed a significant difference between exposure and control, found in the Alphal EEG band (7.5-9.5 Hz) at the vertex head position, where magnetic field stimulation was applied at the Alphal frequency of 8.33 Hz. However, the post-hoc statistical Alpha adjustment analysis did not reveal any significant differences between exposure and control. We assume that the effect in the Alphal EEG findings is possibly related to 'synchronisation', 'induced rhythmic' and 'synchrony spread' theories of neuron firing rate after ELF magnetic field.

By the application of FES, noninvasive restoration of hand grasp function in a tetraplegic patient was achieved. The patient was able to induce bursts of beta oscillations by imagination of foot movement. These beta oscillations were recorded in a one EEG-channel configuration, bandpass filtered and squared. When this beta activity exceeded a predefined threshold, a trigger for the FES was generated. Whenever the trigger was detected, a subsequent switching of a grasp sequence composed of 4 phases occurred. The patient was able to grasp a glass with the paralyzed hand completely on his own without additional help or other technical aids.

Being entirely based on frequency analysis, i.e., on spectral properties of the signal, it is not possible to obtain any information about the temporal structure of coherence which is useful in the study of brain dynamics, for example. Extending the concept of coherence as a measure of linear dependence between realizations of a random process to the wavelet transform, this paper introduces a new approach to coherence analysis which allows to monitor time-dependent changes in the coherence between electroenecphalographic (EEG) channels. Specifically, we analyzed multichannel EEG data of 26 subjects obtained in an experiment on associative learning, and compare the results of Fourier coherence and wavelet coherence, showing that wavelet coherence detects features that were inaccessible by application of Fourier coherence.

C	Furstenau, N		Schmorrow, DD		Furstenau, N			Nonlinear dynamics model and simulation of spontaneous perception switching with ambiguous visual stimuli	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, VOL 11			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Augmented Cognition held in Conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	JUL 22-27, 2005	Las Vegas, NV				BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; OSCILLATIONS	A nonlinear dynamics recursive coupled attention - perception model of cognitive multistability is described and numerical simulations of the quasiperiodic reversals between perception states of ambiguous visual stimuli are presented. The perception state is treated as a macroscopic order parameter which is formalized as the phase variable of a recursive cosinuidal map with two control parameters mu = difference of meaning and G similar to attention. The mapping function is closely related to the neuronal mean field phase oscillator theory of temporal binding. Mean field interference with delayed phase feedback with gain - G, delay T, and damping time tau enables transitions between chaotic and limit cycle attractors representing the perception states. Quasiperiodic perceptual reversals are induced by attention satiation (fatigue) G(t) with time constant gamma. For tau/T << 1 the coupled attention - perception dynamics reproduces the experimentally observed Gamma-distribution of the reversal time statistics if a small noise term is added to the attention equation. Mean reversal times of typically 3 - 5 s as reported in the literature, are correctly predicted if the delay time T is associated with the delay of 40 ms between stimulus onset and primary visual cortex (V1) response. Numerically determined perceptual transition times of 4 - 5 T are in reasonable agreement with stimulus - conscious perception delay of 150 - 200 ms. Eigenfrequencies of the limit cycle oscillations as obtained from a linear stability analysis, are in the range of 10 - 100 Hz, in agreement with typical EEG frequencies.

Thus monitoring the state of brain involve notable characteristic. In this paper we propose a new neural network based technique to address those problems. We show that a feedforward, multi-layered neural network can conveniently capture the state of the brain in its connection weight-space, after a process of supervised training. The performance of the proposed method is investigated with the EEG signals associated with the state change of the brain, and also compared with a fast fourier transform (FFT)-based spectral estimation technique in spectral representation of a signal against time.

J	Hesse, CW; James, CJ				Hesse, CW; James, CJ			Tracking and detection of epileptiform activity in multichannel ictal EEG using signal subspace correlation of seizure source scalp topographies	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						blind source separation; independent component analysis; spatial topography; source tracking and detection; EEG analysis; epilepsy	SPIKE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; DISCHARGES; SYSTEM	Conventional methods for monitoring clinical (epileptiform) multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals often involve morphological, spectral or time-frequency analysis on individual channels to determine waveform features for detecting and classifying ictal events (seizures) and inter-ictal spikes. Blind source separation (BSS) methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA), are increasingly being used in biomedical signal processing and EEG analysis for extracting a set of underlying source waveforms and sensor projections from multivariate time-series data, some of which reflect clinically relevant neurophysiological (epileptiform) activity. The work presents an alternative spatial approach to source tracking and detection in multichannel EEG that exploits prior knowledge of the spatial topographies of the sensor projections associated with the target sources. The target source sensor projections are obtained by ICA decomposition of data segments containing representative examples of target source activity, e.g. a seizure or ocular artifact. Source tracking and detection are then based on the subspace correlation between individual target sensor projections and the signal subspace over a moving window. Different window lengths and subspace correlation threshold criteria reflect transient or sustained target source activity. To study the behaviour and potential application of this spatial source tracking and detection approach, the method was used to detect (transient) ocular artifacts and (sustained) seizure activity in two segments of 25-channel EEG data recorded from one epilepsy patient on two separate occasions, with promising and intuitive results.

Recordings from both hippocampal and neocortical depth electrodes were analyzed while six epileptic patients played a virtual taxi-driver game. During the game, the patients alternated between searching for passengers, whose locations were random, and delivering them to stores, whose locations remained constant. In both hippocampus and neocortex, theta increased during virtual movement in all phases of the game. Hippocampal and neocortical theta activity were also significantly correlated with each other, but this correlation did not differ between neocortex and hippocampus and within neocortical electrodes. Our findings demonstrate the existence of movement-related theta oscillations in human hippocampus, and suggest that both cortical and hippocampal oscillations play a role in attention and sensorimotor integration.

J	Rodin, E; Funke, M				Rodin, Ernst; Funke, Michael			Cerebral electromagnetic activity in the subdelta range	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetoelectroencephalography-EEG; subdelta frequencies; glia; respiration	MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	The frequency range between 0.1 and 0.9 Hz was investigated with magnetoelectroencephalography-EEG coregistration in 10 adult patients with epilepsy and five children with other neurologic conditions. In all instances, a dominant rhythm between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz could be observed in the waking and sleeping states. It showed a waxing and waning quality and was unrelated to eye opening or closing but increased in amplitude during sleep. The maximum was usually in the occipital areas but occasionally in the frontal regions. The rhythm was more persistent and better seen in the magnetoelectroencephalogram, but subdelta activity was also discernible in the EEG. The magnetoelectroencephalographic rhythmicity and frequency suggested possible respiration artifact. Two normal control subjects were therefore investigated by electroencephalography while respirations were monitored. A clear relation to respiration was established. It persisted during breath-holding, albeit at lower amplitude. Larger amplitude transients occurred before and at the cessation of breath-holding as well as hyperventilation. An observed frequency increase before voluntary hyperventilation suggests a relation to the readiness potential and event-related desynchronization as well as synchronization. Subdelta frequencies, which can be readily recorded without special DC amplifiers, provide additional information for clinical as well as research data. They may also be an interface between autonomic and voluntary functions, especially in regard to respiration.

Compare the classification ability of various time-frequency methods including FFT spectrogram, spectral edge frequency and bicoherence. Methods: 57 seizures from 10 epilepsy patients are used. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is trained and incrementally updated in a novel fashion. The speed and accuracy of the method is evaluated with different training parameters and time-frequency methods. Results: Training the PNN on a single seizure from each record offers better performance (sensitivity = 0.89 and false-positive-rate = 0.56/h) than 3 patient-independent seizure detection algorithms. The method is virtually unaffected by the settings of various training parameters. Training is very fast (0.9 s), and the accuracy improves as more examples are added incrementally (without retraining). The overall best time-frequency method was the FFT spectrogram. The bicoherence plus the FFT spectrogram was the best method on 4 records, improving the correlation from 0.111 to 0.940 on one and from 0.288 to 0.612 on another. Conclusions: The proposed method offers accurate, robust and virtually instantaneous training and incremental learning when applied to patient-dependent seizure detection. Significance: Accurate seizure detection can improve patient care in both the epilepsy monitoring unit and the intensive care unit. Future applications include patient-independent algorithms that continue to learn as new examples are encountered. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This paper presents a method based on the time-frequency analysis of the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) that continuously registers the alternation in physiological dominance of the two eyes. Two images flickered at different frequencies as the visual stimulator to left and right eyes respectively so that the response can be recovered from the EEG by time-frequency analysis. The physiological dominance of each eye as evidenced by the SSVEP record correlates well with the subjects' report of perceptual dominance. This electrophysiological method appears to be suitable for measuring rivalry in non-verbal human or animals.

The system uses a bundle of 16 optical fibers that both deliver light and capture its reemission. This bundle runs in parallel with a cable carrying EEG signals from 16 microelectrodes. Both data collection arrays terminate in a precisionmachined cap that is surgically attached to the skull. Free movement is enabled by suspending the cables with an elastic cord. Rats are also tracked with a video system so their behavior can be compared to hemodynamic and neural activity. Optical measurements are done with 760 and 830 nm laser diodes using a time-multiplexed, frequency-encoded illumination scheme at a source-switching speed of 68 Hz. EEG, optical and video data are all timestamped with the same clock, ensuring information synchrony. Automated optical system set-up and control is done with a LabVIEW interface that allows on-the-fly adjustment of gain, data integrity checks and system calibration, among other functionalities. EEG recording is done with a Neuralynx (Tucson, AZ) recording system. Collected optical data are converted to volumetric images either in real-time or offline. The integrated system includes comprehensive image formation, display and time-series analysis software suitable for processing data independently or in combination.

The intent was to determine how these measurements are related, and to what extent the ERPs might represent phase-locked changes in EEG rhythms. The experimental manipulations were the stimulus modality (auditory or visual), the discriminability of the target, and the presence or absence of distraction. The ERPs showed sensory-evoked potentials that were specific to the modality and a target-evoked P300 wave that was later in the visual modality than in the auditory, and later and smaller when the discrimination was more difficult. The averaged EEG spectrograms showed that targets increased the frontal theta activity, decreased posterior and central alpha and beta activity, and decreased the central gamma activity. The scalp topography of the changes in the alpha and beta activity indicated a posterior desynchronization specific for the visual task and occurring with both targets and standards and a more widespread desynchronization for targets in either modality. Increased phase synchronization occurred during the event-related potentials, but modeling demonstrated that this can be seen when an evoked potential waveform is simply added to the background EEG. However, subtracting the spectrogram of the average ERP from the average spectrogram of the single trials indicated that phase-resetting of the background EEG rhythms can occur during the ERP. The idea that the ERPs and the EEG rhythms "share generators" can explain these findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Estimation of short-time cross-correlation between frequency bands of event related EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						ERD; ERS; statistical maps; time-frequency energy density; extreme statistics	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; ALPHA	Simultaneous variations of the event-related power changes (ERD/ERS) are often observed in a number of frequency bands. ERD/ERS measures are usually based on the relative changes of power in a given single frequency band. Within such an approach one cannot answer questions concerning the mutual relations between the band-power variations observed in different frequency bands. This paper addresses the problem of estimating and assessing the significance of the average cross-correlation between ERD/ERS phenomena occurring in two frequency bands. The cross-correlation function in a natural way also provides estimation of the delay between ERD/ERS in those bands. The proposed method is based on estimating the short-time cross-correlation function between relative changes of power in two selected frequency bands. The cross-correlation function is estimated in each trial separately and then averaged across trials. The significance of those mean cross-correlation functions is evaluated by means of a nonparametric test. The basic properties of the method are presented on simulated signals, and an example application to real EEG and ECoG signals is given. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is aimed at a better performance than existing systems and at user tuneability. Methods: The system employs data filtering in multiple bands, spectral feature extraction, Bayes' theorem, and spatio-temporal analysis. The a priori information in Bayes' theorem was provided by 407 It of EEG from 19 patients having 152 seizures. Results: The testing data (19 patients, 389 h, 100 seizures, independent of the training data) yielded a sensitivity of 89.4%, a false detection rate of 0.22/h, and median delay time of 17.1 s when tuning was used, and 86%, 0.47/h and 16.2 s without tuning. Missed seizures were of short duration or had subtle seizure activity. False detections were caused by technical artefacts, non-epileptic large amplitude rhythmic bursts or very low amplitude activity. It was established that performance could easily be tuned. Results were also compared to the clinical system of Gotman (1990). Conclusions: The system offers a performance that is acceptable for clinical use. User tuneability allows for reduction in false detection with minimal loss to sensitivity. Significance: Epilepsy monitoring generates large amounts of recordings and requires intense observation. Automatic seizure detection and warning systems reduce review time and facilitate observation. We propose a method with high sensitivity and few false alarms.

Noninvasive analysis of the synchronization among cortical areas is possible if the electrical sources can be estimated by solving the electroencephalography inverse problem. Among various inverse algorithms, spatio-temporal dipole fitting methods such as RAP-MUSIC and R-MUSIC have demonstrated superior ability in the localization of a restricted number of independent sources, and also have the ability to reliably reproduce temporal waveforms. However, these algorithms experience difficulty in reconstructing multiple correlated sources. Accurate reconstruction of correlated brain activities is critical in synchronization analysis. In this study, we modified the well-known inverse algorithm RAP-MUSIC to a multistage process which analyzes the correlation of candidate sources and searches for independent topographies (ITs) among precorrelated groups. Comparative studies were carried out on both simulated data and clinical seizure data. The results demonstrated superior performance with the modified algorithm compared to the original RAP-MUSIC in recovering synchronous sources and localizing the epileptiform activity. The modified RAP-MUSIC algorithm, thus, has potential in neurological applications involving significant synchronous brain activities.

Effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields on electrocardiogram: Analysis with quadratic time-frequency distributions	2005 27TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-7	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2005	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Chinese Acad Engn Sci				Recently we have studied the effects of extremely low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields (ELF-PEMF) on the human biosignals. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) of seventeen healthy volunteers before and after the electromagnetic (EMF) exposure were recorded and analyzed. The root mean square (RMS) values of the recoded data were considered as comparison criteria. EEG results were shown that there were small variations in the brain electrical activity before and after exposure. The ECG power level was increased up to 1% for most of the subjects. In this paper, we further investigate the effects of the ELF-PEMF on the ECG signal using the hyperbolic T-distributions (HTD). This distribution was shown to be suitable for efficient amplitude and instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation of mono- and multicomponent FM signals. In this work, we introduce this distribution to the analysis of ECG signals. The simulation results show that the HTD have a good performance in the analysis of the ECG signals comparing with the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD). Moreover, the results show that there are small shift in the frequency-domain signal before and after EMF exposure.

The oscillations, referred to as slow-wave activity (SWA), reflect sleep need and sleep intensity. The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated. it is enhanced after sleep loss and declines during sleep. Animal studies suggested that sleep need is genetically controlled, yet the physiological mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show in humans that a genetic variant of adenosine deaminase, which is associated with the reduced metabolism of adenosine to inosine, specifically enhances deep sleep and SWA during sleep. In contrast, a distinct polymorphism of the adenosine A(2A) receptor gene, which was associated with interindividual differences in anxiety symptoms after caffeine intake in healthy volunteers, affects the electroencephalogram during sleep and wakefulness in a non-state-specific manner. Our findings indicate a direct role of adenosine in human sleep homeostasis. Moreover, our data suggest that genetic variability in the adenosinergic system contributes to the interindividual variability in brain electrical activity during sleep and wakefulness.

Being considered fragmented and poorly efficient, the adaptation night is discarded for data analysis. The present study aims to provide a quantitative and topographical EEG analysis of this phenomenon. Methods: Eight healthy subjects slept for two consecutive nights (adaptation (AD) and baseline (BSL)), and their polysomnography was visually scored and then submitted to spectral power analysis. Results: The results showed a decreased quality and quantity of first-night sleep as indicated by more stage I and intrasleep wake, paralleled by a reduced sleep efficiency and a longer sleep onset latency. On the other hand, EEG quantitative data showed a more complex and apparently paradoxical picture. An increase in delta power was observed, particularly over the central areas during the first night, paralleled by an increased power in beta bin frequencies solely at posterior scalp locations. Conclusions: These results have been interpreted as caused by, respectively, a reduced total sleep time during the adaptation night and a cortical hyperactivity, typical of psychophysiological insomnia. The present results confirm the need to exclude the laboratory sleep adaptation night from data analysis since it is not a reliable index of sleep on subsequent nights as regards both visual scoring and quantitative EEG analysis. Finally, regional differences between REM and NREM sleep have been confirmed. Significance: This is the first attempt to evaluate the FNE with a quantitative approach to the antero-posterior EEG topography, providing both a Hz-by-Hz and a classical EEG band-based analysis.

The aim was to identify signatures of enhanced brain activity when a reversal of the bistable Neckar cube figure is perceived by the subject. The results have shown high activity patterns in both time and frequency domains, in the pre-frontal cortex region, approximately 200 - 600 ms prior to the appearance of the readiness potential in the central cortex. From a methods perspective, this paper illustrates the applicability of such bilinear, global analysis techniques, to the study of brain data - particularly to characterize the time-frequency dynamics of brain electrical activity.

In one-hour sessions, 72-channel EEG was recorded while a healthy volunteer attempted to use a trackball to keep a drifting disc in a bulls-eye in the center of screen. Disc trajectory was converted into a moving measure of disc error. Local minima (perigees) indicated moments when the disc started to drift away from the center. Subject performance was indexed by root mean square disc error in a 20s epoch centered on each perigee, high error generally indicating drowsiness. Maximally independent EEG processes and their equivalent dipole source locations were obtained using the EEGLAB toolbox (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab). Component activations were epoched in 5s time intervals time locked to perigees. Following disk perigees during (drowsy) periods of high disk error, significant spectral changes were observed. One of the 70 independent components was located in or near primary visual cortex. During periods of poor (drowsy) performance, it had increased mean tonic alpha/theta activity, with a further phasic alpha/theta increase following perigees [1, 2]. At the same time, low alpha activity of a second component located in or near cingulate gyrus increased, and 10-30 Hz EEG activity of a third component in the left somatomotor cortex increased briefly. The alpha activity of the somatomotor component persisted through the following distance maximum. These spatiotemporal phenomena were consistently observed across three sessions within subjects. Thus, event-related EEG brain dynamics can be detected and modeled in a continuous behavioral task without impulsive event onsets.

With the advent of recording techniques, new evidence is emerging on the neuronal populations and wiring in the neocortex. A main challenge is to relate the EEG generation mechanisms to the underlying circuitry of the neocortex. In this paper, we look at the principal intrinsic properties of neocortical cells in layer 5 and their network behavior in simplified simulation models to explain the emergence of several important EEG phenomena such as the alpha rhythms, slow-wave sleep oscillations, and a form of cortical seizure. The models also predict the ability of layer 5 cells to produce a resonance-like neuronal recruitment known as the augmenting response. While previous models point to deeper brain structures, such as the thalamus, as the origin of many EEG rhythms (spindles), the current model suggests that the cortical circuitry itself has intrinsic oscillatory dynamics which could account for a wide variety of EEG phenomena.

A prerequisite for this synchronisation is that stimuli are capable of affecting (resetting) the phase of brain oscillations. Such a change in the phase of brain waves is also assumed to underlie the '' Berger effect '': when observers open their eyes, the amplitude of EEG oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) decreases significantly. This finding is usually thought to involve a desynchronisation of activity in different neurons. For functional interpretations of brain oscillations in the visual system, it therefore seems to be crucial to find out whether or not the phase of brain oscillations can be affected by visual stimuli. To answer this question, we investigated whether alpha waves are generated by a linear or a nonlinear mechanism. If the mechanism is linear - in contrast to nonlinear ones - phases cannot be reset by a stimulus. It is shown that alpha-wave activity in the EEG comprises both linear and nonlinear components. The generation of alpha waves basically is a linear process and flash-evoked potentials are superimposed on ongoing alpha waves without resetting their phase. One nonlinear component is due to light adaptation, which contributes to the Berger effect. The results call into question theories about brain-wave function based on temporal correlation or event-related desynchronisation.

Hippocampal glutamate concentration predicts cerebral theta oscillations during cognitive processing	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; theta; oscillator; oscillation; hippocampus; glutamate	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; HUMAN BRAIN-METABOLITES; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; WORKING-MEMORY; FIELD POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; GRANULE CELLS; IN-VIVO; EEG; RHYTHM	Rationale: Brain waves reflect collective behavior of neurons and provide insight into distributed network processing. Frontal and hippocampal theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) were linked to cognitive tasks and animal studies have suggested an involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in integrative frontal-hippocampal processing. Human evidence for such relationships is lacking. Methods: Here, we studied the associations between glutamate concentrations in the hippocampal region, measured by a 3-T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and EEG theta activity during an auditory target detection paradigm. Results: A robust relationship between hippocampal glutamate and frontal theta activity during stimulus processing was found. Moreover, frontal theta oscillations were related to response speed. Conclusions: The results suggest a functional coupling between the frontal cortex and hippocampal region during stimulus processing and support the idea of the hippocampus as a neural rhythm generator driven by glutamatergic neurotransmission. These preliminary data show, for the first time, a relationship between in vivo measured glutamate and basic cerebral information processing in humans.

Comparisons with a normal intracranial EEG were perforce from animals. Analytic phase and amplitude from the Hilbert transform gave the temporal resolution needed to resolve EEG spatiotemporal structure. The rest state revealed multiple overlapping patterns of high-frequency coherent oscillations resembling bubbles in boiling water. Bubble diameters gave estimates of the distances across the cortex over which the cortical oscillations were synchronized. Superimposed on these bubbles were large-sized epochs of phase locking with briefly constant frequency and high amplitude. These coordinated analytic phase differences occurred between short periods of high phase variance. The variance gave evidence for state transitions between transiently stable states with constant phase gradients. In sleep these phase patterns persisted with reduced amplitude, occasionally interrupted by long-lasting (similar to 1 s) epochs with no spatial textures in phase and amplitude despite a large increase in amplitude. Seizures had high amplitude 3/s spikes with steep spatial gradients. Onset occurred after pre-ictal reduction in bubble diameters as evidence for large-scale cortical disintegration preceding loss of stability. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Baser, E				Baser, E			Memory as the "whole brain work" - A large-scale model based on "oscillations in super-synergy"	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th World Congress of Psychophysiology of the International-Organization-of-Psychophysiology	SEP 18-23, 2004	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Int Org Psychophysiol		brain oscillations; memory; theta; alpha; gamma; matching; brain function; superbinding	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; RECORDED EEG-EPOGRAMS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; AUDITORY PATHWAY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEUROCOGNITIVE NETWORKS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COMBINED DYNAMICS	According to recent trends, memory depends on several brain structures working in concert across many levels of neural organization; memory is a constant work in progress." The proposition of a brain theory based on super-synergy in neural populations is most pertinent for the understanding of this constant work in progress. This report introduces a new model on memory basing oil the processes of EEG oscillations and Brain Dynamics. This model is shaped by the following conceptual and experimental steps: 1. The machineries of super-synergy in the whole brain are responsible for formation of sensory-cognitive percepts. 2. The expression "dynamic memory" is used for memory processes that evoke relevant changes in alpha, gamma, theta and delta activities. The concerted action of distributed multiple oscillatory processes provides a major key for understanding of distributed memory. It comprehends also the phyletic memory and reflexes. 3. The evolving memory, which incorporates reciprocal actions or reverberations in the APLR alliance and during working memory processes, is especially emphasized. 4. A new model related to "hierarchy of memories as a continuum" is introduced. 5. The notions of "longer activated memory" and "persistent memory" are proposed instead of long-term memory, 6. The new analysis to recognize faces emphasizes the importance of EEG oscillations ill neurophysiology and Gestalt analysis. 7. The proposed basic framework called "Memory in the Whole Brain Work" emphasizes that memory and all brain functions are inseparable and are acting as a "whole" in the whole brain. 8. The role of genetic factors is fundamental in living system settings and oscillations and accordingly in memory, according to recent publications. 9. A link from the "whole brain" to "whole body" and incorporation of vegetative and neurological system, is proposed, EEG oscillations and ultraslow oscillations being a control parameter.

For this purpose. we recorded a group of 25 female subjects who slept for at least two consecutive nights in the laboratory. The postsleep waking EEG was compared to the one recorded during the presleep wakefulness from four midline derivations (Fz-Al, Cz-Al, Pz-Al, Oz-Al). Results indicated that the first 10 min after awakening are characterized by an increase of EEG power in the low-frequency range (1-9 Hz) compared to the corresponding presleep waking period, and by a significant decrease of EEG power in the beta range (18-24 Hz). As regards topographic differences, the increase of EEG power upon awakening in the delta-theta range showed a parieto-occipital prevalence. Moreover, the occipital derivation showed a larger decrease of power in tile beta range as compared to the other derivations. In conclusion, the EEG substratum of the sleep offset period is characterized by a pattern of increased EEG power in the delta-theta and low-alpha bands, and of decreased power in the beta range. This pattern could be considered as the spectral EEG signature of the sleep inertia phenomenon. The state of postsleep EEG hypoarousal does not subside in the first 10-min period after awakening considered in the present analysis. Finally, according to our results, the more posterior scalp locations show stronger EEG signs of sleep inertia, and could be the last ones to properly wake up. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be relatively easily simplified and adapted to the current practice of the neuro-anaesthesia or neuro-intensive medicine. Since approximately 10 years, some extremely simplified devices have been introduced, but they allowed only inaccurate assessment because of their too global analysis of the brain function. The monitoring of the true digitised EEG, based on a simplified brain mapping montage combined to the analysis in the frequency and the time domains corresponds to a new investigation tool: the simplified EEG or sEEG, which can be included in our usual monitors or anaesthesia and intensive care machines. This new sort of monitoring could give us valuable information about, first, the control of the peroperative consciousness and the nociceptive or not afferent inputs due to surgical stimulations, and, second, the detection of several particular physiopathologic states during neuro-anaesthesia (brain ischaemia, non-convulsive epilepsy, cerebral protection...). These different theoretical and practical topics are reviewed to try to define the possible preliminary rules of the use of the sEEG. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

We sought to characterize the spatial relationship of cortical activity at different frequencies during the first sleep cycle, focusing on sleep stages 3 and 4 (slow wave sleep). Methods: Sleep EEGs were obtained at home from six adults using a portable recorder. Signal power and magnitude squared coherence were measured during the first sleep cycle. Spectra obtained from bipolar and common reference derivations were compared. Results: During slow wave sleep, signal power is highest in the delta frequency band and regional coherence below 5 Hz is broadly distributed. Although signal power in the alpha and sigma frequency bands is lower, peaks of regional coherence in those bands are similar to or higher than delta-band coherence. Regional coherence during slow wave sleep is differentially distributed with a 14 Hz component in central and posterior regions and a 10 Hz component in frontal and central regions. Conclusions: Ten and 14 Hz rhythms are an essential component of slow wave sleep. Significance: The interpretation of scalp EEG power and coherence spectra is limited by the lack of a satisfactory recording reference. However, conclusions can be made by comparing and contrasting results from both bipolar and common reference recordings. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Here, we investigate the neural processes by which information about the sensory context of a learning event is "bound" to the semantic representation of the to-be-encoded item. We present evidence that item-context binding during encoding is mediated by frontoposterior electroencephalographic (EEG) phase locking within and between hemispheres in the theta (4-8 Hz) band. During a task in which subjects encoded words in different font colors, later memory for the word was associated with sustained frontal theta activity and frontoposterior theta-band coherence, primarily within the left hemisphere. When the word-color association was later successfully retrieved, however, neurons synchronized their theta-band responses bilaterally in a more sustained fashion, particularly during the latter part of the stimulus epoch (>800 ms). Our results confirm the importance of functional coupling between frontal and posterior regions for successful encoding. One interpretation of these data is hemispheric contributions to item and context encoding may be asymmetric, with left hemisphere coherence facilitating semantic processing of an item and right hemisphere coherence facilitating processing of sensory context. Theta-band coherence may be an important mechanism by which brain networks exchange information during learning. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Clinically classified segments of intracranial EEG data obtained from epileptic patients were separated into training and testing sets. After the powers in various frequency bands were calculated as the state-discriminating features for each EEG segment, a system theoretic model-the Fuzzy Measure Theoretic Quantum Approximation of an Abstract System (FMQAS)-was employed to develop a classifier from only the training set data. For this problem, FMQAS relied on defining a bipartite network (see Fig. 1). An iterative procedure combined with a fuzzy intersection attributed weights, or system measures, to the arcs connecting nodes in the two sets. The system measures were then used to identify a subset of features associated with each EEG state. Lastly, an FMQAS-based classifier was developed to individually analyze the features from short time segments of EEG. When applied to EEG segments in the testing set, the FMQAS-based classifier shows evidence of seizure activity in advance of visual EEG manifestation and also functions well as a seizure detector. Further, the classifier does not indicate signs of seizure activity during interictal periods greater than ten minutes before a seizure onset.

The present study aimed at the evaluation of the cross-frequency phase synchronization between electroencephalographic alpha and beta oscillations. The amplitude and phase information were extracted from electroencephalograms recorded in 176 healthy human subjects using an analytic signal approach based on the Hilbert transform. The results reliably demonstrated the presence of phase synchronization between alpha and beta oscillations, with a maximum in the occipito-parietal areas. The phase difference between alpha and beta oscillations showed characteristic peaks at about 2 and -1 radians, which were common for many subjects and electrodes. A specific phase difference might reflect similarity in the organization and interconnections of the networks generating alpha and beta oscillations across the entire cortex. Beta oscillations, which are phase-locked to alpha oscillations-alpha-synchronous beta oscillations-were largest in the occipito-parietal area with a second smaller maximum in the frontal area, thus demonstrating a topography, which was different from the conventional alpha and beta oscillations. The strength of the alpha-synchronous beta oscillations was not exclusively defined by the amplitude of the alpha rhythm indicating that they represent a distinct feature of the spontaneous electroencephalogram, which allows for a refined discrimination of the dynamics of beta oscillations.

J	Cook, CM; Thomas, AW; Prato, FS				Cook, CM; Thomas, AW; Prato, FS			Resting EEG is affected by exposure to a pulsed ELF magnetic field	BIOELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						alpha waves; electromagnetic field; occipital; parietal	ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELD; LAND SNAIL; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CEPAEA-NEMORALIS; CELLULAR PHONES; BRAIN; SLEEP; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; MU	increasing number of reports have demonstrated a significant effect of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MFs) on aspects of animal and human behavior. Recent studies suggest that exposure to ELF MFs affects human brain electrical activity as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), specifically within the alpha frequency (8-13 Hz). Here we report that exposure to a pulsed ELF MF with most power at frequencies between 0 and 500 Hz, known to affect aspects of analgesia and standing balance, also affects the human EEG. Twenty subjects (10 males; 10 females) received both a magnetic field (MF) and a sham session in a counterbalanced design for 15 min. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that alpha activity was significantly higher over the occipital electrodes (O1, Oz, O2) [F-1,F-16 = 6.858; P =.01 9, eta(2) = 0.30] and marginally higher over the parietal electrodes (P3, Pz, P4) [F-1,F-16 = 4.25 1; P =.056, eta(2) = 0.21] post MF exposure. This enhancement of alpha activity was transient, as it marginally decreased over occipital [F-1,F-16 = 4.417; P =.052; eta(2) = 0.216] and parietal electrodes [F-1,F-16 = 4.244; P =.056; eta(2) = 0. 21] approximately 7 min after MF exposure compared to the sham exposure. Significantly higher occipital alpha activity is consistent with other experiments examining EEG responses to ELF MFs and ELF modulated radiofrequency fields associated with mobile phones. Hence, we suggest that this result may be a nonspecific physiological response to the pulsed MFs. Bioelectromagnetics 25:196-203, 2004. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods: Right-hand and left-hand movement imagination was studied in three subjects. The 10-channel Multivariate Autoregressive Model (MVAR) was fitted to EEG signals recorded from subsets of electrodes overlying central and related brain areas. By means of the Short-time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF) the propagation of brain activity as a function of frequency and time was found. Results: During imagery the relation between propagations in gamma and beta bands changed significantly for electrodes overlying sensorimotor areas, namely the increase in gamma was accompanied by the decrease in the beta hand. Conclusions: The hypothesis was put forward that these kinds of changes in flow of electrical brain activity are connected with the specific information processing.

The situation of uncertainty was associated with general increase in spectral power of all EEG bands, which was particularly pronounced in high-trait anxiety subjects. In low-trait anxiety subjects, association between delta and gamma power significantly increased when they had to expect bad news but did not change when they expected good news. In high-trait anxiety subjects, this association tended to increase in both cases. Higher baseline delta power predicted higher gamma power in the situation where a bad news was expected. These findings are discussed in terms of Gray and McNaughton's [The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-hippocampal System, second ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000] theory of anxiety and evolutionary interpretation linking delta oscillations with reward motivation [G.G. Knyazev, H.R. Slobodskaya, Personality trait of behavioral inhibition is associated with oscillatory systems reciprocal relationships, Int. J. Psychophysiol. 48 (2003) 247-261]. Increase of delta-gamma coupling in anxiogenic situation is interpreted to reflect higher cortical arousal, which appears in a frustrating situation in subjects with higher activity of "motivational" delta system.

Time-variant parametric estimation of transient quadratic phase couplings between heart rate components in healthy neonates	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article							BASIS-FUNCTION NETWORKS; TRACE ALTERNANT EEG; QUANTIFICATION; APPROXIMATION	The heart rate variability (HRV) can be taken as an indicator of the coordination of the cardiorespiratory rhythms. Bispectral analysis using a direct (fast Fourier transform based) and time-invariant approach has shown the occurrence of a quadratic phase coupling (QPC) between a low-frequency (LF: 0.1 Hz) and a high-frequency (HF: 0.4-0.6 Hz) component of the HRV during quiet sleep in healthy neonates. The low-frequency component corresponds to the Mayer-Traube-Hering waves in blood pressure and the high-frequency component to the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Time-variant, parametric estimation of the bispectrum provides the possibility of quantifying QPC in the time course. Therefore, the aim of this work was a parametric, time-variant bispectral analysis of the neonatal HRV in the same neonates used in the direct, time-invariant approach. For the first time rhythms in the time course of QPC between the HF component and the LF component could be shown in the neonatal HRV.

Previous results showed that in olfactory bulb (OB) of awake rats engaged in an olfactory learning, odour presentation produced a decrease of oscillations in gamma frequency range (60-90 Hz) associated with a power increase in beta frequency range (15-40 Hz). This response pattern was strongly amplified in trained animals. The aim of this work was twofold: whether learning also induces similar changes in OB target structures and whether Such OB response depends on its centrifugal inputs. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded through chronically implanted electrodes in the OB, piriform and enthorhinal cortices of freely moving rats performing in olfactory discrimination. Oscillatory activities characteristics (amplitude, frequency and time-course) were extracted in beta and gamma range by a wavelet analysis. First, we found that odour induced beta oscillatory activity was present not only in the OB, but also in the other olfactory structures. In each recording site, characteristics of the beta oscillatory responses were dependent of odour, structure and learning level. Unilateral section of the olfactory peduncle was made before training, and LFPs were symmetrically recorded in the two bulbs all along the acquisition of the learning task. Data showed that deprivation of centrifugal feedback led to an increase of spontaneous gamma activity. Moreover, under this condition olfactory learning was no longer associated with the typical large beta band. As a whole, learning modulation of the beta oscillatory response in olfactory structures may reflect activity of a distributed functional network involved in odour representation.

In this paper, a continuous wavelet transform is proposed to calculate the spectrum of scalp EEG data, the entropy and a scaleaveraged wavelet power are extracted to indicate the epileptic seizures by using a moving window technique. The tests of five patients with different seizure types show wavelet spectral entropy and scale-averaged wavelet power are more efficiency than renormalized entropy and Kullback_Leiler (K-L) relative entropy to indicate the epileptic seizures. We suggest that the measures of wavelet spectral entropy and scale-averaged wavelet power should be contained to indicate the epileptic seizures in a new EEG monitoring system.

Methods: Ten migraine patients were evaluated during the not-symptomatic phase and compared to seven age and sex matched controls. The dorsum of the right hand and the right supraorbital zone were stimulated by a painful CO, laser, in presence or in absence of a visual warning stimulus. An analysis time of 1 s after the stimulus was submitted to a time-frequency analysis by a complex Morlet wavelet and to a cross-correlation analysis, in order to detect the development of EEG changes and the most activated cortical regions. A parametric approach to measure predictability of short and noisy time series was applied, where time series were modeled by leave-one-out (LOO) error. Results: The averaged laser-evoked potentials features were similar between the two groups in the alerted and not alerted condition. A strong reset of the beta rhythms after the painful stimuli was seen for three groups of electrodes along the midline in patients and controls: the predictability of the series induced by the laser stimulus changed very differently in controls and patients. The separation was more evident after the warning signal, leading to a separation with P-values of 0.0046 for both the hand and the face. Discussion: As painful stimulus causes organization of the local activity in cortex, EEG series become more predictable after stimulation. This phenomenon was less evident in migraine, as a sign of an inadequate cortical reactivity to pain. Significance: The LOO method enabled to show in migraine subtle changes in the cortical response to pain. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The EEG of subjects performing an alternating runs [Rogers, R.D., Monsell, S., 1995. Costs of a predictable switch between simple cognitive tasks. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 124, 207-231] task-switching task was analyzed using event-related potentials, the lateralized readiness potential, instantaneous amplitude and the phase-locking value [Lachaux, J.P., Rodriguez, E., Martinirie, J., Varela, F.J., 1999. Measuring phase synchrony in brain signals. Human Brain Mapping 8, 194-208]. The two tasks differed in the relevant modality (visual versus auditory) and the hand with which responses were to be given. The mixture model [de Jong, R., 2000. An intention driven account of residual switch costs. In: Monsell, S., Driver, J. (Eds.), Attention and Performance XVII: Cognitive Control. MIT Press, Cambridge] was used to assign pre-stimulus switch probabilities to switch trials based on reaction time; these probabilities were used to create a fast-slow distinction between trials on both switch and hold trials. Results showed both time- and time-frequency-domain effects, during the intervals preceding stimuli, of switching versus maintenance, response speed of the upcoming stimulus, and response hand. Of potential importance for task-switching theory were interactions between reaction time by switch-hold trial type that were found for a frontal slow negative potential and the lateralized readiness potential during the response-stimulus interval, indicating that effective preparation for switch trials involves different anticipatory activity than for hold trials. Theta-band oscillatory activity during the pre-stimulus period was found to be higher when subsequent reaction times were shorter, but this response speed effect did not interact with trial type. The response hand of the upcoming task was associated with lateralization of pre-stimulus mu- and beta-band amplitude and, specifically for switch trials, beta-band phase locking.

J	McFarland, DJ; Cacace, AT				McFarland, DJ; Cacace, AT			Separating stimulus-locked and unlocked components of the auditory event-related potential	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Lake Ontario Hearing Meeting	JUN, 2003	Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY		Univ Rochester	event-related potentials; event-related synchronization; event-related desynchronization; phase; spectral dynamics	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; P300; DYNAMICS; EEG; VARIABILITY; LATENCY; ALPHA	A new method is evaluated for separating stimulus-locked and unlocked components of auditory event-related EEG activity. The new method uses a regression based subtraction procedure as a way to account for latency and amplitude variability within individual trials. It was applied using the oddball paradigm under conditions of active and passive listening and analyzed as spectral correlations (normalized differences) between post-stimulus epochs of standard, target or deviant stimulus conditions and silent prestimulus baseline activity. The regression-subtraction procedure accounted for a greater amount of variance than a method that uses linear subtraction alone. The major component of the response to auditory stimulation was an event-related synchronization in the delta and theta (24 Hz) frequency range. Event-related desynchronizations were also observed in the 10 Hz (alpha/mu) and in the 20-30 Hz (beta) frequency range. The regression based subtraction procedure provides better separation of stimulus-locked and unlocked components of event-related EEG activity then linear subtraction alone. Stimulus-locked and unlocked components show different patterns and topographies of effects related to attention and active discrimination. Studying both stimulus-locked and unlocked components of event-related EEG reactivity in the frequency domain provides a more comprehensive account of dynamic brain activity subserving auditory information processing.

During all stages of registration, Taylor Manifest Anxiety and Spielberger state anxiety (SA) and trait anxiety (TA) scores were positively related to alpha and negatively to delta relative power with these relations being independent of cortical site. Within-subject estimate of the strength of reciprocal relationship between alpha and delta oscillations (alpha-delta anticorrelation, or ADA) was positively related to trait anxiety and depression. Three minutes after an alarming event (unexpected loud sound), a further increase of alpha power was observed. In low-anxiety subjects, this increase was mostly associated with fast alpha (alpha 3), whereas in high-anxiety ones, it was mainly linked to slow alpha (alpha 2). SA mediated relationship between TA and EEG power, while ADA and alpha band reactivity showed trait-like features being associated with TA even after accounting for SA. These findings are interpreted as an indication of higher vigilance and higher reactivity of alpha system in anxious individuals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sample consisted of 42 volunteer participants (between 19 and 37 years of age with at least 9 years of education). There were 22 females and 20 males. Data were collected under the oddball paradigm. Auditory stimulation (10 ms r/f time, 50 ms duration, 65 dB SPL) consisted of target (2000 Hz; p=.20) stimuli that occurred randomly within a series of standard stimuli (1000 Hz; p=.80). Gamma responses were studied in the amplitude frequency characteristics, in the digitally filtered event-related potentials (f-ERPs) and in the distributions which were obtained using the recently developed time-frequency component analysis JFCA) technique. Participants were classified into G+ and G- groups with a criterion of full agreement between the results of an automated gamma detection technique and expert opinion. The 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA on f-ERPs and 2 x 2 x 2 multivariate ANOVA on TFCA distributions showed the main effect of gamma status and gender as significant, and the interaction between gamma status and gender as nonsignificant. Accordingly, individual difference in gamma status is a reliable phenomenon, but this does not depend on gender. There are conflicting findings in the literature concerning the effect of gender on ERP components (N100, P300). The present study showed that if the gamma status is not included in research designs, it may produce a confounding effect on ER-P parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modifications of EEG Related to Repeated Static Grasp Efforts Developed by the Hand in Humans	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; rhythms; spectral power; coherence; muscle effort; grasp; fatigue		The characteristics of EEG recorded before, in the course, and after three sequential static grasp efforts developed by the right hand were analyzed in 14 healthy volunteers of both sexes, 19 to 56 years old. The grasps were 3 min long, and intervals between the sequential trials were 5 min long. The mean intensity was, as a rule, the greatest in the first trial and decreased, because of fatigue, in the second and third trials. In the course of the grasp effort, significant (P <= 0.05) or close to significant decreases in the spectral power were observed in all trials within the alpha2 subrange in some frontal, central, and central/temporal leads. This reaction of desynchronization of alpha2 oscillations probably reflects activation of the sensorimotor cortical zones. Within the above period, the power of alpha2 oscillations increased in the occipital leads. In a few leads of the frontal group, the powers of delta, theta1, theta2, and alpha1 oscillations increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the course of the first trial. Such reaction was not observed in the second and third trials, while the powers of delta and alpha1 ranges increased in the occipital sites (P < 0.05). The powers of delta and theta oscillations increased, as compared with the control values, after the second and third grasps. Such specific EEG modifications in sequential trials can be related to the actions of a novelty factor in the first trial and a fatigue factor in the subsequent trials. The coherence coefficient (CC) of alpha and beta oscillations for symmetric leads usually increased in the course of the grasp. This effect reached a significance level (P < 0.05) for alpha2 oscillations in central, posterotemporal, parietal, and occipital pairs. The CC for beta2 oscillations increased in both temporal lead pairs. A drop in the interhemisphere coherence was more typical of the delta and theta1 ranges. Therefore, changes in the CC values show that the structure of interhemisphere interaction undergoes modifications with the development of the grasp static efforts.	[Garkavenko, V.

Methods: Using video subdural EEG sampled at 1 kHz, we studied a 14-year-old boy with asymmetric epileptic spasms of possible left frontal origin. We identified HFOs, then analyzed and localized their distributions by MBFA. We correlated HFO distribution to clinical spasm intensity. Results: Ictal subdural EEG recorded HFOs at 60-150 Hz lasting 0.3-4 s. MBFA showed extensive but noncontiguous distribution of HFOs predominantly over the left frontal and temporal regions. HFOs began and became quasiperiodic before manifestation of clinical spasms. As clinical spasms intensified, HFOs persisted in regions where they initiated subclinically but were of higher frequency and greater power than HFOs in other regions. We performed cortical resections over the left frontal and temporal regions with predominant HFOs. Six months after surgery, the patient remained seizure free. Conclusions: HFOs were present over the ictal onset zone during epileptic spasms. Periodic spasms in this patient had the characteristics of partial seizures. Significance: We show that HFOs occurred over the cerebral cortex during epileptic spasms, and we suggest that these focal cortical HFOs triggered the spasms.

The large variance in magnitude of motor evoked responses has forced clinicians to perform many trials and average the results to find a repeatable value for motor threshold. Our objective is to investigate the source of the variance in amplitude. Four clinically healthy adult males participated in an EEG and EMG during transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex, 100% motor threshold, 0.1 Hz. Per our hypothesis, a significant negative correlation of .22 was found between the amplitude of the motor evoked potential and the power in the high alpha frequency band during the pre-stimulus period (p <.001). In addition, a significant positive correlation of .17 was found between the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and the gamma band (p <.001). The strongest correlation of .27 (p <.001) was found between the MEP amplitude and the ratio of the power in the low gamma to high alpha band. We conclude that the gamma to alpha power ratio may be a useful indicator of cortical excitability.

Studies employing these advanced techniques revealed that synchronization of oscillatory responses in the beta- and gamma-band is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, routing of signals across distributed cortical networks, sensory-motor integration, working memory, and perceptual awareness. Here, we review evidence that certain brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's are associated with abnormal neural synchronization. The data suggest close correlations between abnormalities in neuronal synchronization and cognitive dysfunctions, emphasizing the importance of temporal coordination. Thus, focused search for abnormalities in temporal patterning may be of considerable clinical relevance.

However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions are interconnected. The concept of brain connectivity plays a central role in the neuroscience, and different definitions of connectivity, functional and effective, have been adopted in literature. While the functional connectivity is defined as the temporal coherence among the activities of different brain areas, the effective connectivity is defined as the simplest brain circuit that would produce the same temporal relationship as observed experimentally among cortical sites. The structural equation modeling (SEM) is the most used method to estimate effective connectivity in neuroscience, and its typical application is on data related to brain hemodynarnic behavior tested by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whereas the directed transfer function (DTF) method is a frequency-domain approach based on both a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling of time series and on the concept of Granger causality. This study presents advanced methods for the estimation of cortical connectivity by applying SEM and DTF on the cortical signals estimated from high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, since these signals exhibit a higher spatial resolution than conventional cerebral electromagnetic measures. To estimate correctly the cortical signals, we used a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual MRI, a distributed source model and a regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. Before the application of SEM and DTF methodology to the cortical waveforms estimated from high-esolution EEG data, we performed a simulation study, in which different main factors (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and simulated cortical activity duration, LENGTH) were systematically manipulated in the generation of test signals, and the errors in the estimated connectivity were evaluated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical analysis returned that during simulations, both SEM and DTF estimators were able to correctly estimate the imposed connectivity pattems under reasonable operative conditions, that is, when data exhibit an SNR of at least 3 and a LENGTH of at least 75 s of nonconsecutive EEG recordings at 64 Hz of sampling rate. Hence, effective and functional connectivity patterns of cortical activity can be effectively estimated under general conditions met in any practical EEG recordings, by combining high-resolution EEG techniques and linear inverse estimation with SEM or DTF methods. We conclude that the estimation of cortical connectivity can be perfomed not only with hemodynamic measurements, but also with EEG signals treated with advanced computational techniques.

EEG complexity can be estimated using measures derived from nonlinear dynamic systems theory. Variations in such measures have been shown to be associated with normal individual differences in cognition and some neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the increasing use of EEG complexity measures for the study of normal and abnormal brain functioning, little is known about genetic and environmental influences on these measures. Using the pointwise dimension (PD2) algorithm, this study assessed heritability of EEG complexity at rest in a sample of 214 young female twins consisting of 51 monozygotic (MZ) and 56 dizygotic (DZ) pairs. In MZ twins, intrapair correlations were high and statistically significant; in DZ twins, correlations were substantially smaller. Genetic analyses using linear structural equation modeling revealed high and significant heritability of EEG complexity: 62-68% in the eyes-closed condition, and 46-60% in the eyes-open condition. Results suggest that individual differences in the complexity of resting electrocortical dynamics are largely determined by genetic factors. Neurophysiological mechanisms mediating genetic variation in EEG complexity may include the degree of structural connectivity and functional differentiation among cortical neuronal assemblies.

The current trend on sleep analysis focuses on its dynamic organization described in the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) paradigm. This paradigm looks to the EEG microstructure, gives attention to the short duration EEG phenomena instead of the traditional global view of fixed epochs of 20 or 30 seconds, heralded by the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) classification. The CAP paradigm not only cares about the short duration events but also models its periodic activity, providing thus, important information on EEG synchrony modulation in the sleep process. These periodic activities are characterized by repeated spontaneous and or evoked EEG Activations or transient responses (A phases), at intervals up to one minute emerged from the Background activity (B phases). In a previous work we proposed an automatic detector and classifier of A phases in sleep EEG, where wavelet transforms is used to analyze the sleep EEG signal in the time-frequency domain, in order to separate the signal power in different and physiologically relevant frequency bands. The CAP A phases characteristics described in the classification Atlas is used in the design of the structure and the starting set of parameters of the detector and classifier. The objective of this work is to use genetic algorithm to tune the parameters of the detector and classifier. Excerpts of all night sleep recordings of a group of volunteers are used in the tuning and testing. Results are compared with visual and other automatic classification.

We use examples from an audiovisual attention-shifting task performed by young and old subjects to illustrate the power of ICA to resolve subtle differences between evoked responses in the two age groups. Preliminary analysis of these data using ICA suggests a loss of task specificity in independent component (IC) processes in frontal and somatomotor cortex during post-response periods in older as compared to younger subjects, trends not detected during examination of scalp-channel event-related potential (ERP) averages. We discuss possible approaches to component clustering across subjects and new ways to visualize mean and trial-by-trial variations in the data, including ERP-image plots of dynamics within and across trials as well as plots of event-related spectral perturbations in component power, phase locking, and coherence. We believe that widespread application of these and related analysis methods should bring EEG once again to the forefront of brain imaging, merging its high time and frequency resolution with enhanced cm-scale spatial resolution of its cortical sources.

They furthermore provide a rich description of time-varying frequency content of a signal, that is useful for the problem of blind source separation (BSS). We present and explore a multispectral decorrelation approach, whereby linear mixtures of sources with unique time-frequency signatures are separated, without pre-whitening, through joint diagonalisation of wavelet sub-band covariance matrices. Compared with BSS algorithms using temporal decorrelation only, wavelet BSS works well for stationary and non-stationary synthetic mixtures, with stable performance as the number of sources increases. Combined with conventional wavelet analysis and filtering techniques, wavelet BSS offers an integrated, versatile and efficient framework for analysing non-stationary multichannel signals in general, with promising results when applied to multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) data.

Spectrum entropy based on Shannon entropy can be taken as a measure of signal or system complexity. Use for reference, wavelet entropy measures built on wavelet analysis can signify the complexity of unsteady signal or system in both time domain and frequency domain. Beginning with the thought of Information mergence and post-analysis in this paper, fundamental definitions of wavelet entropy measure are discussed, calculation methods including wavelet energy entropy, wavelet time entropy, wavelet singular entropy, wavelet time frequency entropy, wavelet average entropy and wavelet distance entropy are put forward, and their physical meanings are analyzed. Considering wavelet entropy measure applied wen in field of EEG signal and mechanical fault diagnosis, the potential and approach that it is applied in transmission line fault detection and identification are analyzed.

Comparable to theata, a load dependent increase in power can be observed during retention and increased evoked activity during retrieval. During retrieval attempts theta behaves like a traveling wave spreading from anterior to posterior sites. During actual retrieval, however, evoked upper alpha becomes transiently nested in theta. We suggest that theta reflects working memory functions whereas upper alpha may be important for the reactivation of long-term memory codes in short-term memory.

In animal models, these rhythms occur coherently with synchronized activity in the thalamus. However, the mechanisms of this thalamic activity are unknown. Here we show that, in slices of the lateral geniculate nucleus maintained in vitro, activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR1 a induces synchronized oscillations at alpha and theta frequencies that share similarities with thalamic alpha and theta rhythms recorded in vivo. These in vitro oscillations are driven by an unusual form of burst firing that is present in a subset of thalamocortical neurons and are synchronized by gap junctions. We propose that mGluR1a-induced oscillations are a potential mechanism whereby the thalamus promotes EEG alpha and theta rhythms in the intact brain.

Faced with the difficult of visually detecting HFOs in large amounts of intracranial EEG data, it is necessary to develop an automated process. This paper presents Teager Energy as a method of finding HFOs. Teager energy is an ideal measure because unlike conventional energy, it takes into account the frequency component of the signal as well as signal amplitude. This greatly aids in the dissection of HFOs out of the noise and other signals contained in the EEG. Therein, Teager energy analysis is able to detect highfrequency, low-amplitude components that conventional energy measurements would miss.

Isobolic analyses were performed to describe the interactions. Unfortunately, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the interaction of both drugs on the spike and wave discharge activity because the effect of diazepam was shown to be dominant. Only vigabatrin decreased the behavioural activity, whereas there was a trend towards a decrease after diazepam. All treatments dose dependently increased the power in the beta frequency band. Unfortunately, the dose ratio was not optimal to describe the interaction. The theta peak frequency was dose dependently decreased after all treatments. There was a synergistic interaction between the two drugs on this variable. These data support both the idea that an increase in power in the beta frequency band can serve as a biomarker for GABAergic inhibition and the suggestion that clinically effective anxiolytics decrease the theta peak frequency. Furthermore, we show that on different variables, there might be different optimal dosage combinations, which might complicate the clinical application of polytherapy. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) not only facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories, but in humans, SWS is also accompanied by a pronounced endogenous transcortical DC potential shift of negative polarity over frontocortical areas. To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA/cm(2)) repeatedly ( over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories ( word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories ( mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs ( p < 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS. Mood was improved both after tDCS during sleep and during wake intervals. tDCS increased sleep depth toward the end of the stimulation period, whereas the average power in the faster frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) was reduced. Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity < 3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue ( expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories.

Methods: EEGs were recorded from 8 X 8 high-density arrays fixed on primary sensory cortices of rabbits trained to discriminate CS with reinforcement (CS +) from those without (CS -). EEG frames were located with a pragmatic information index, H,. The spatial patterns of the first 3 frames on each of 37-40 trials were measured by the square of 64 analytic amplitudes from the Hilbert transform to give points in 64-space. The questions were asked: Did the frames from CS + trials and CS - trials differ within each sequential group? Did the 3 frames differ from each other (form 3 clusters of points)? Results: EEG frames that were identified by high H, had AM patterns that could be classified with respect to CS + and CS - well above chance levels. Two stages of correct frame classification occurred on each trial: 40-130 ms after CS onset with a gamma carrier frequency, and 450-550 ms with a beta carrier frequency. Peak power in the beta frames was double that in gamma frames, and mean pattern surface area of beta frames was nearly 4-fold greater. Conclusions: Under the impact of a CS on a sensory neocortex, the background EEG activity reorganized in sequential frames of coordinated activity, first local and modality-specific, thereafter global. Significance: The size, texture and duration of these AM patterns indicate that spatial patterns of human beta frames may be accessible with high-density scalp arrays for correlation with phenomenological reports by human subjects.

A high-resolution EEG study of the HERA model	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PREFRONTAL ACTIVATION; LAPLACIAN ESTIMATE; ERD PATTERNS; ALPHA BAND	Many recent neuroimaging studies of episodic memory have indicated an asymmetry in prefrontal involvement with the left prefrontal cortex more involved than the right in encoding, the right more than the left in retrieval (hemispheric encoding and retrieval asymmetry, or HERA model). In this electroencephalographic (EEG) high-resolution study, we studied brain rhythmicity during a visual episodic memory (recognition) task. The theta (4-6 Hz), alpha (6-12 Hz) and gamma (28-48 Hz) oscillations were investigated during a visuospatial long-term episodic memory task including an encoding (ENC) and retrieval (RET) phases. During the ENC phase, 25 figures representing interiors of buildings ("indoor") were randomly intermingled with 25 figures representing landscapes ("landscapes"). Subject's response was given at left ("indoor") or right ("landscapes") mouse button. During the RET phase (I h later), 25 figures representing previously presented "indoor" pictures ("tests") were randomly intermingled with 25 figures representing novel "indoor" ("distractors"). Again, a mouse response was required. Theta and alpha EEG results showed no change of frontal rhythmicity. In contrast, the HERA prediction of asymmetry was fitted only by EEG gamma responses, but only in the posterior parietal areas. The ENC phase was associated with gamma EEG oscillations over left parietal cortex. Afterward, the PET phase was associated with gamma EEG oscillations predominantly over right parietal cortex. The predicted HERA asymmetry was thus observed in an unexpected location. This discrepancy may be due to the differential sensitivity of neuroimaging methods to selected components of cognitive processing. The strict relation between gamma response and perception suggests that retrieval processes of long-term memory deeply impinged upon sensory representation of the stored material.

In random order, the subjects were orally administered a pharmaceutical dose of 1600 mg SAMe a nutraceutical dose of 400 mg SAMe and placebo, each over a period of 15 days, with wash-out periods of 2 weeks in between. EEG recordings, psychometric tests and evaluations of tolerability and side effects were carried out 0, 1, 3 and 6 h after drug administration on days 1 and 15. Multivariate analysis based on MANOVA/Hotelling T-2 tests of quantitative EEG data demonstrated significant central effects of SAMe as compared with placebo after acute, subacute and superimposed drug administration of both the nutraceutical and the pharmaceutical dose. EEG changes induced by SAMe were characterized by an increase in total power, a decrease in absolute and relative power in the delta/theta and slow alpha frequencies, an increase in absolute and relative power in the alpha-2 and beta frequencies as well as an acceleration of the alpha centroid and the centroid of the total power spectrum. The delta/theta and the beta centroid showed variable changes over time. The dominant alpha frequency was accelerated, the absolute and relative power in the dominant alpha frequency attenuated after SAMe as compared with placebo. These acute and subacute pharmaco-EEG findings in elderly subjects are typical of activating antidepressants. Time-efficacy calculations showed that acute oral administration of SAMe in both the nutraceutical and the pharmaceutical dose induced the pharmacodynamic peak effect in the first hour with a subsequent decline. The 3rd and 6th hours still showed a significant encephalotropic effect after the 1600 mg dose. The maximum EEG effect was noted after 2 weeks of oral administration of both 1600 mg/die and 400 mg/die. The superimposed dose induced significant encephalotropic effects in the 3rd hour after 400 mg and in the 3rd and 6th hours after 1600 mg as compared with pre-treatment. Dose-efficacy calculations showed that the pharmaceutical dose of 1600 mg had a more pronounced effect on the CNS than the nutraceutical dose of 400 mg, with both doses being superior to placebo. Psychometric tests concerning noopsychic and thymopsychic measures as well as critical flicker fusion frequency generally demonstrated a lack of differences between SAW and placebo, which reflects a good tolerability of the drug in elderly subjects. This was corroborated by the findings on side effects, pulse and blood pressure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

The aim of the present EEG study was to probe the cerebellar role in the control of such SSAER. For this purpose, we investigated changes in SSAERs due to transient disruption of the cerebellar hemisphere by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). SSAERs to click-trains of three different frequencies in the gamma-band (32, 40 and 47 Hz) were recorded from 45 scalp electrodes in six healthy volunteers immediately after 1-Hz rTMS and compared to baseline SSAERs assessed prior to magnetic stimulation. Cerebellar rTMS contralateral to the stimulated ear significantly reduced the amplitude of steady-state responses to 40-Hz click-trains and showed a tendency to reduce the amplitude to 32-Hz click-trains. No effects were observed for 47-Hz click-trains, nor for magnetic stimulation of the cerebellum ipsilateral to auditory stimulation or after sham stimulation. Our results suggest that interference with cerebellar output by rTMS modifies functional activity associated with cortical auditory processing. The finding of maximum effects on 40-Hz SSAERs provides support to the notion that the cerebellum is part of a distributed network involved in the regulation of cortical oscillatory activity and points at some frequency-specificity for the control of auditory-driven neuronal oscillations.

When applying multivariate time series analysis techniques to neural signals, detection of directed relationships, which can be described in terms of Granger-causality, is of particular interest. Partial directed coherence has been introduced for a frequency domain analysis of linear Granger-causality based on modeling the underlying dynamics by vector autoregressive processes. We discuss the statistical properties of estimates for partial directed coherence and propose a significance level for testing for nonzero partial directed coherence at a given frequency. The performance of this test is illustrated by means of linear and non-linear model systems and in an application to electroencephalography and electromyography data recorded from a patient suffering from essential tremor.

Extended BSI for continuous EEG monitoring in carotid endarterectomy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; carotid surgery; endarterectomy; extended brain symmetry index; sBSI; tBSI	BRAIN SYMMETRY INDEX; OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT; FREQUENCY; PREVENTION; STENOSIS; PATIENT; STROKE	Objective: Carotid endarterectomy is a common procedure as a secondary prevention of stroke, and is often performed with selective shunting. Although various EEG parameters have been proposed to determine if the brain is at risk during carotid artery clamping, the common procedure is still the visual assessment of the EEG. Here, we propose an extension to the previously described brain symmetry index (BSI) (van Putten M, Peters J, Mulder S, de Haas J, Bruijninckx C, Tavy D. A brain symmetry index (BSI) for online EEG monitoring in carotid endarterectomy. Clin Neurophysiol 2004, 115(5), 1189-94.], as an additional quantitative criterion for shunt need in carotid endarterectomy. Methods: An extension of the Brain Symmetry Index was implemented to capture both spatial (hemispheric) (sBSI) and temporal changes (tBSI) in the EEG. In this pilot study, the method is exemplified by simulation and by application to EEG records from 25 patients who underwent a carotid endarterectomy. Results: Simulations show that hemispheric asymmetry is captured by changes in sBSI, only, while temporal symmetry changes, not due to changes in hemispheric asymmetry, are reflected by changes in tBSI. Combinations of changes induced changes in both parameters. This was confirmed by analysis 25 EEG records. Unilateral EEG changes during test-clamping are reflected by Delta sBSI > 0.05, diffuse changes by Delta tBSI > 0.02 and combinations by simultaneous changes in both features. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we present a doublet of quantitative EEG features, that in principle detects any change in the spectral characteristics of the EEG, decomposing the changes into a measure that captures spatial symmetry changes (sBSI), and a measure that quantifies diffuse temporal changes, that are not due to changes in spatial symmetry (tBSI). Both features are normalized with values ranging from [0-1], and can easily be implemented on-line to support the visual analysis of the EEG in the decision for selective shunting. Significance: Quantitative real-time EEG analysis will assist in the EEG interpretation for selective shunting in carotid endarterectomy.

Recovering EEG brain signals: Artifact suppression with wavelet enhanced independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG recordings; artifacts; independent component analysis; wavelet transform; spectral coherence	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EYE-MOVEMENT; SEPARATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECORDINGS; REMOVAL; ICA; ALGORITHM	Independent component analysis (ICA) has been proven useful for suppression of artifacts in EEG recordings. It involves separation of measured signals into statistically independent components or sources, followed by rejection of those deemed artificial. We show that a "leak" of cerebral activity of interest into components marked as artificial means that one is going to lost that activity. To overcome this problem we propose a novel wavelet enhanced ICA method (wICA) that applies a wavelet thresholding not to the observed raw EEG but to the demixed independent components as an intermediate step. It allows recovering the neural activity present in "artificial" components. Employing semi-simulated and real EEG recordings we quantify the distortions of the cerebral part of EEGs introduced by the ICA and wICA artifact suppressions in the time and frequency domains. In the context of studying cortical circuitry we also evaluate spectral and partial spectral coherences over ICA/wICA-corrected EEGs. Our results suggest that ICA may lead to an underestimation of the neural power spectrum and to an overestimation of the coherence between different cortical sites. wICA artifact suppression preserves both spectral (amplitude) and coherence (phase) characteristics of the underlying neural activity.

Interactions of gamma and theta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during memory processes	2006 IEEE 14TH SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2			Turkish	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 14th Signal Processing and Communications Applications	APR 16-19, 2006	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE			BAND ACTIVITY; WAVELET ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	Human subjects typically keep about 7 +/- 2 items in short-term memory (STM). A theoretical neuronal model has been proposed to explain this phenomenon with physiological parameters of brain oscillations in the gamma and theta frequency range, i.e. roughly 30-80 and 4-8 Hz, respectively. In that model, STM capacity equals the number of gamma cycles (e.g. 25 ms for 40 Hz), which fit into one theta cycle (e.g. 166 ms for 6 Hz). The model is based on two assumptions: 1) theta activity should modulate gamma activity and 2) the theta/gamma ratio should correlate with human STM capacity. The first assumption is supported by electrophysiological data showing that the amplitude of gamma oscillations is modulated by the phase of theta activity. However, so far this has only been demonstrated for intracranial recordings. We analyzed human event-related EEG oscillations recorded in a memory experiment in which 13 subjects perceived known and unknown visual stimuli. The paradigm revealed event-related oscillations in the gamma range, which depended significantly on the phase of simultaneous theta activity. Our data are the first scalp-recorded human EEG recordings revealing a relationship between the gamma amplitude and the phase of theta oscillations, supporting the first assumption of the abovementioned theory. Interestingly, the involved frequencies revealed a 7:1 ratio. However, this ratio does not necessarily determine human STM capacity. Since such a correlation was not explicitly tested in our paradigm, our data is not conclusive about the second assumption. Instead of theta phase modulating gamma amplitude, it is also conceivable that focal gamma activity needs to be downsampled to theta activity, before it can interact with more distant brain regions.

In addition, findings for increased limbic activation due to reduced cortical inhibition have recently been acquired. To get further insights into these mechanisms, the cur-rent study investigated whether CSC-ct would decrease as a function of increased slow (SW) or fast wave (FW) activity. Methods: Resting state EEG recordings were obtained from 46 healthy, right-handed participants. CSC-ct was quantified by computing cross-frequency correlations between the power in the slow and fast frequency range. CSC-ct was compared between groups with relatively low and high SW activity and groups with relatively low and high FW activity. Results: Relatively reduced SW, but not FW activity was associated with a significant coupling between slow and fast frequency EEG. Furthermore, relatively enhanced resting state SW activity was paralleled by slow and fast frequency EEG decoupling. Conclusions: These findings are in line with the notion that increased subcortical drive can go accompanied by reduced CSC-ct. Significance: Cross-frequency EEG analyses might provide a unique approach to obtain novel insights into cortico-subcortical interactions in relation to affective and cognitive behavior.

Methods: We integrated multiple band frequency analysis and brain-surface topographic maps of HFOs from ictal subdural EEG (SDEEG) recordings. We used SDEEG to record partial seizures consisting of right-arm jerks with secondary generalization in a 17-year-old right-handed girl. We selected 20-s EEG sections that included preclinical seizure recordings. We averaged the HFO power between 60 and 120 Hz for 25 selected electrodes, made topographic maps from these averaged powers, and superimposed the maps on the brain-surface image. We filmed consecutive HFO maps at a 10-ms frame rate. Results: Before clinical seizure onset, high-power HFOs emerged at the superior portion of the left precentral gyrus, then appeared in the middle of the left postcentral gyrus, and subsequently reverberated between both regions as well as the posterior portion of the left postcentral gyrus. Right-arm extension and facial grimacing started as the HFO power decreased. As generalized tonic-clonic seizures evolved, HFO power increased but remained within the central region. Conclusions: Topographic movies of intracranial HFOs on the brain surface allow visualization of the dynamic ictal changes in neocortical epilepsy.

Here, we investigated whether the grouping influence of slow oscillations extends to hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW) activity thought to underlie memory replay processes during SWS. The prefrontal surface EEG and multiunit activity (MUA), along with hippocampal local field potentials (LFP) from CA1, were recorded in rats during sleep. Average spindle and ripple activity and event correlation histograms of SPWs were calculated, time-locked to half-waves of slow oscillations. Results confirm decreased prefrontal MUA and spindle activity during EEG slow oscillation negativity and increases in this activity during subsequent positivity. A remarkably close temporal link was revealed between slow oscillations and hippocampal activity, with ripple activity and SPWs being also distinctly decreased during negative half-waves and increased during slow oscillation positivity. Fine-grained analyses of temporal dynamics revealed for the slow oscillation a phase delay of approximately 90 ms with reference to up and down states of prefrontal MUA, and of only approximately 60 ms with reference to changes in SPWs, indicating that up and down states in prefrontal MUA precede corresponding changes in hippocampal SPWs by approximately 30 ms. Results support the notion that the depolarizing surface-positive phase of the slow oscillation and the associated up state of prefrontal excitation promotes hippocampal SPWs via efferent pathways. The preceding disfacilitation of hippocampal events temporally coupled to the negative slow oscillation half-wave appears to serve a synchronizing role in this neocorticohippocampal interplay.

The system consists of three main components: 1) a library of input and output procedures, 2) a database storing additional information about location in a storage system, 3) a user interface for selecting data for analysis, choosing programs for analysis, and distributing computing and output data on cluster nodes. The system allows for processing multichannel time series data in multiple binary formats. The description of data format, channels and time of recording are included in separate text files. Definition and selection of multiple channel montages is possible. Epochs for analysis can be selected both manually and automatically. Implementation of a new signal processing procedures is possible with a minimal programming overhead for the input/output processing and user interface. The number of nodes in cluster used for computations and amount of storage can be changed with no major modification to software. Current implementations include the time-frequency analysis of multiday, multichannel recordings of intracranial EEG of epileptic patients as well as evoked response analyses of repeated cognitive tasks.

Relations between hippocampal network free oscillations and theta activity	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Review						hippocampus; theta activity; SPW waves; rat	FREQUENCY; MODEL; RAT	The relations between the component of the hippocampal network free oscillations. i.e.. sharp potential waves (SPW) and the theta component of the hippocampal EEG are considered. It is commonly accepted that. in the course of changes from the state corresponding to a weak activation of the hippocampal network in the theta rhythm by the septum through the state corresponding to a medium activation to the state of a high activation. the inverse dependence between the magnitudes of these components in the EEG spectra takes place. However. our work shows that this dependence can be deranged in the rat EEG during quiet wakefulness that corresponds to the medium activation of the hippocampal network in theta rhythm. It was also shown that the RF stimulation can evoke abnormal signals with well-pronounced theta activity against the background of a considerable SPW component. This phenomenon demonstrates a possibility of a strong derangement of the dependence. which is. as a rule, observed under the natural conditions. The hypothesis concerning the organization and regulation of the investigated components of the hippocampal EEG is proposed.

EEG power analysis was performed by both conventional fixed frequency band and adjusted frequency band based on individual alpha frequency (IAF) in 16 drug-naive patients before and after drug administration. In the theta bands determined by both conventional fixed band and IAF methods, the EEG power after treatment was larger than that before treatment. In addition, there was a correlation between EEG power and clinical drug response evaluated by changes in BPRS score. With regard to this correlation, IAF methods showed no apparent advantage over methods using conventional fixed frequency bands. Conventional quantitative EEG analysis can still serve as a useful tool for the assessment of short-term outcome of drug treatment. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

This article reviews the literature on the alterations of gamma oscillations (about 30-80 Hz) during the course of neuropsychiatric disorders and relates them to a model for the functional role of these oscillations for memory matching. The synchronous firing of neurons in the gamma-band has been proposed to bind multiple features of an object, which are coded in a distributed manner in the brain, and is modulated by cognitive processes such as attention and memory. In certain neuropsychiatric disorders the gamma activity shows significant changes. In schizophrenic patients, negative symptoms correlate with a decrease of gamma responses, whereas a significant increase in gamma amplitudes is observed during positive symptoms such as hallucinations. A reduction is also observed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), whereas an increase is found in epileptic patients, probably reflecting both cortical excitation and perceptual distortions such as deja vu phenomena frequently observed in epilepsy. ADHD patients also exhibit increased gamma amplitudes. A hypothesis of a gamma axis of these disorders mainly based on the significance of gamma oscillations for memory matching is formulated.

This cue enables the subject to anticipate the forthcoming stimulus, initiating neural processes subserving the future perception and processing of the target stimulus and the motor preparation of the associated response action. It has recently been suggested that neuronal activity before such an anticipated target stimulus could be associated with modulations in neuronal synchronization and oscillatory activity. Here we recorded electrical brain activity whilst subjects performed a choice reaction time task, in which one of the stimuli could be predicted with 90% certainty. We show that the prediction of a forthcoming stimulus was associated with an increase in gamma oscillations overlying occipital areas and a decrease in beta oscillations overlying sensorimotor cortex before the stimulus was presented. We suggest that these regionally specific modulations in oscillatory activity reflect the establishment of neural networks that are 'primed' for the future processing of the forthcoming predictable visual stimulus.

The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is elicited through the superposition of the delta (1 - 3 Hz) and theta (3 - 7 Hz) band oscillatory responses. The cholinergic neurotransmitter system has a key function in modulating excitatory postsynaptic potentials caused by glutamate, and therefore influences P300 generation and the underlying oscillatory responses. Here we report significant linkage and linkage disequilibrium between target case frontal theta band, visual evoked brain oscillations and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from the cholinergic muscarinic receptor gene (CHRM2) on chromosome 7. We also demonstrate significant linkage disequilibrium between CHRM2 SNPs and target case parietal delta band visual evoked oscillations (LD P<0.001). These findings were not observed for the equivalent non-target case data, suggesting a role for the CHRM2 gene in higher cognitive processing in humans. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using a measure of phase-ordered beta and gamma EEG oscillations in response to painful electric stimulation, we recently found that somatosensory event-related phase-ordered gamma oscillations (38-42 Hz), elicited by the onset of painful stimuli over Cz scalp site, were linearly related to pain perception. In the present study, 38 subjects were engaged in a painful stimulus detection task using an oddball paradigm. This task was performed under a condition in which subjects were required simply to count the number of target stimuli (pain condition) and under another condition in which subjects were required to produce an obstructive mental imagery of painful stimulus perception (obstructive imagery). Only EEG responses to standard stimuli were analyzed in this study. Correlation analysis of sweeps for each individual revealed brief intervals of phase ordering of EEG patterns in the beta and gamma bands. The frequencies of interest were the betal (26-30 Hz), beta2 (30-34 Hz), gammal (3438 Hz), gamma2 (38-42 Hz) and gamma3 (42-46 Hz) bands. Obstructive imagery treatment., compared to pain condition, significantly reduced pain perception. This reduction was paralleled by significant decreases of evoked phase-ordered gamma2 and gamma3 patterns over Cz scalp site. Phase-ordered oscillations at Cz scalp site, for both gamma2 and gamma3 bands, significantly predicted pain ratings during pain condition. Phase-ordered oscillation scores, obtained for these gamma bands over parietal and frontal scalp sites, resulted the best predictor of pain ratings during obstructive imagery. This study provides evidence for the role of gamma oscillations in the subjective experience of pain. Further, it has provided support for the view that pain reduction during obstructive mental imagery is the product of an inhibitory process involving frontal and parietal cortical regions.

Concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory startle reflex were recorded from 19 healthy controls during Pulse-Alone and Prepulse+Pulse trials with 60, 120, and 240 ms prepulse-pulse intervals. Compared to Pulse-Alone trials significant PPI of the startle reflex occurred on all Prepulse+Pulse trials and a significant startle latency reduction occurred on 60 and 120 ms Prepulse+Pulse trials. The largest evoked potentials to auditory stimuli occurred at fronto-central locations. PPI of theta oscillations occurred at frontal, central, and parietal locations. These results suggest that PPI functions not only as sensory-motor gating but also as sensory-cognitive gating since theta oscillations are involved in control of cognitive processes. Absence of significant correlations between PPI of the startle reflex and of theta oscillations at all electrode locations indicates that the two processes may be controlled by different neural mechanisms.

J	Raj, ABM; O'Callaghan, M; Knowles, TG				Raj, ABM; O'Callaghan, M; Knowles, TG			The effects of amount and frequency of alternating current used in water bath stunning and of slaughter methods on electroencephalograms in broilers	ANIMAL WELFARE			English	Article						animal welfare; chicken; EEG; electrical stunning; frequency; slaughter	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS	The effectiveness of electrical water both stunning of 172 individual broilers for 1 s with a constant root mean square (RMS) current of 100, 150 or 200 mA, delivered using a variable voltage/constant current stunner with 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1400 Hz sine wave alternating current (AC), followed by slaughter using a unilateral or ventral neck-cutting procedure, was evaluated. A binary logistic regression of broilers showing epileptiform activity or not following stunning showed that both the electrical frequency (Hz) and RMS current (mA) had a significant effect on the probability of the electroencephalogram (EEG) manifestation. The univariate analysis of variance showed that the time to the onset of less than 10% of the pre-stun relative power contents was significantly affected only by the interaction between electrical frequency and slaughter method. A similar analysis of variance of the time to reach less than 10% of the pre-stun total power content showed slaughter method, RMS current the slaughter method/frequency interaction and the RMS current/frequency interaction to be either significant or approaching significance. Based on these results it is recommended that effective water bath stunning of broilers with a minimum constant current of 100, 150 and 200 mA could be achieved with electrical frequencies of up to 200, 600 and 800 Hz, respectively. In addition, It is likely that electrical frequencies of above 800 Hz would have required a minimum current of greater than 200 mA to induce epileptiform activity in the EEGs of broilers.

Rear-view mirror use, driver alertness and road type: An empirical study using EEG measures	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						rear-view mirror; driver alertness; road type; EEG measures	EYE FIXATIONS; VISUAL-SEARCH; EXPERIENCE; SLEEPINESS; WORKLOAD; FATIGUE	The use of rear-view mirrors has been suggested as a good behavioural indicator of driver alertness in traffic situations (Brookhuis, K. A., De Vries, G., & De Waard, D. (1991). The effects of mobile telephoning on driving performance. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 23(4), 309-316). In general terms, drivers look in the mirrors to find information and adapt their driving to traffic variations. This paper aims to analyse the links between time variations in alertness-measured from EEG activity data-and the frequency of rear-view mirror use in a group of drivers, both on motorways and conventional roads. The results point to a direct relationship between alertness level and mirror use in motorway driving, but an inverse association while driving on conventional roads. The comparison between the frequency of mirror-gazing and EEG activity between motorway and conventional roads shows a globally higher mirror use for motorway driving. These results are discussed on the basis of differences in the visual behaviour presumably required by each road type and their possible implications on driver's alertness level.

J	Coyle, D; Prasad, G; McGnnity, TM				Coyle, D; Prasad, G; McGnnity, TM			A time-frequency approach to feature extraction for a brain-computer interface with a comparative analysis of performance measures	EURASIP JOURNAL ON APPLIED SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; neuromuscular disorders; electroencephalogram; time-frequency methods; linear classification	TECHNOLOGY	The paper presents an investigation into a time-frequency (TF) method for extracting features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from subjects performing imagination of left- and right-hand movements. The feature extraction procedure (FEP) extracts frequency domain information to form features whilst time-frequency resolution is attained by localising the fast Fourier transformations (FFTs) of the signals to specific windows localised in time. All features are extracted at the rate of the signal sampling interval from a main feature extraction (FF) window through which all data passes. Subject-specific frequency hands are selected for optimal feature extraction and intraclass variations are reduced by smoothing the spectra for each signal by an interpolation (IP) process. The TF features are classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The FE window has potential advantages for the FEP to be applied in an online brain-computer interface (130). The approach achieves good performance when quantified by classification accuracy (CA) rate, information transfer (IT) rate, and Mutual information (MI). The information that these performance measures provide about a BCI system is analysed and the importance of this is demonstrated through the results.

Here, the brain responses of healthy subjects to auditory oddball paradigms, standard and deviant stimuli, recorded on an Fz electrode site were studied using a short-term version of the smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution (STSW) method. A smoothing kernel was designed to preserve the auto energy of the signal with maximum time and frequency resolutions. Analysis was conducted mainly on the time-frequency distributions (TFDs) of sweeps recorded during successive trials including the TFD of averaged single sweeps as the evoked time-frequency (ETF) brain response and the average of TFDs of single sweeps as the time-frequency (TF) brain response. Also the power entropy and the phase angles of the signal at frequency f and time t locked to the stimulus onset were studied across single trials as the TF power-locked and the TF phase-locked brain responses, respectively. TFDs represented in this way demonstrated the ERP spectro-temporal characteristics from multiple perspectives. The time-varying energy of the individual components manifested interesting TF structures in the form of amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) energy bursts. The TF power-locked and phase-locked brain responses provoked ERP energies in a manner modulated by cognitive functions, an observation requiring further investigation. These results may lead to a better understanding of integrative brain dynamics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Artifacts occurred in 12% of 200 hours of recording time sampled from a representative sample of 20 infants with neonatal encephalopathy. Artifacts derived from electrical or movement interference occurred with similar frequency; both types of artifacts influenced the voltage and width of the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram band. This is important knowledge especially if amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram is used as a selection tool for neuroprotection intervention studies.

Human EEG signals recorded during spell checking, downloaded from the BC1 Competition website, were pre-processed using a Wavelet Transform to remove the noise and to extract the low frequency content of the signal. Analysis of the signals was performed on the ensemble EEG and the task of the neural network was to identify positive and negative peaks of different shapes. The network has a time-warp invariance property, which means that an input linearly compressed or elongated in time is still recognisable by the network. This enabled the network to train on one peak shape and generalize it to recognise similarly shaped peaks. The neural network presented was trained on one epoch of filtered EEG and was tested on the remaining samples. A post hoc examination of the averaged evoked EEG signal pre-designated as target and non-target show a nadir in the non-target, but not in the target signals. A new supplementary template containing a nadir was therefore created and the effectiveness of this was tested on the ability of the network to correctly identify evoked EEG. After final testing 94.7% of the signals assigned as containing P300 by the paradigm used for the data on the website were correctly classified as P300s, and 83.7% of the non-P300s were also classified as non-P300s. The sensitivity of the technique, utilising the data from this paradigm was 94.7%, specificity 83.68%, and positive predictive value was 53.71%.

However, it is unclear how aging alters the progression of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and behavioral manifestations during status epilepticus. Methods: A repetitive low-dose kainate treatment protocol (2.5 mg/klg/h; i.p.) was used in this Study in conjunction with EEG and behavioral monitoring from freely behaving adult (78 months) and aged (22-25 months) Fischer 344 rats to assess the effects of aging on status epilepticus. Results: During kainate treatment, both groups exhibited an increase in EEG power that corresponded with the time Course of kainate treatment. However, visual inspection and spectral analysis revealed a reduction of the faster frequencies ( 12.5-35 Hz) in the EEGs of aged rodents. A similar progression of behavioral manifestations was observed in adult and aged rodents during kainate treatment, although the frequency of preseizure manifestations (e.g., wet-dog shakes; aged rats, 110 events/h vs. adults, 25 events/h; median values) was greater, and latency to onset for any given behavioral manifestation (e.g., class V seizures; aged median, 60 nun, vs. adult median, 145 min) was consistently shorter within the aged group. Conclusions: These data reveal that aged Fischer 344 rats exhibit altered EEG activity (reduction of higher frequencies) and clinical manifestations during kainate-induced status epilepticus. Taken together, these data indicate an age-related change in seizure onset and spread after exposure to glutamate analogues.

The system operates in near infrared (NIR) range of spectrum and allows functional brain monitoring to be done non-invasively. The detection system employs a photomultiplier and multi-channel scaler to detect and record emerging photons with sub-microsecond resolution (the effective collection time per curve point is - 200 ns). Localisation of the visual evoked potentials in the brain was done using knowledge obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) studies and previous frequency-domain optical NIR spectroscopic systems. The well-known approach of visual stimulation of the human brain, which consists of an alternating black and white checkerboard pattern used previously for the EEG study of neural responses, is applied here. The checkerboard pattern is synchronized with the multi-channel scaler system and allows the analysis of time variation in back-scattered light, at different stimulation frequencies. Slow hemodynamic changes in the human brain due to HbHbO(2) changes in the blood flow were observed, which is evidence of the system's capability to monitor these changes. Monocular visual tests were undertaken and compared with those done with an EEG system. In some subjects a fast optical response on a time scale commensurate with the neural activity associated with the visual cortex was detected. Future work will concentrate on improved experimental protocols and apparatus to confirm the existence of this important physiological signal.

J	Schwab, K; Eiselt, M; Schelenz, C; Witte, H				Schwab, K; Eiselt, M; Schelenz, C; Witte, H			Time-variant parametric estimation of transient quadratic phase couplings during electroencephalographic burst activity	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						quadratic phase coupling; time-variant parametric bispectrum; electroencephalographic burst activity; intensive care patients; neonates	SUPPRESSION PERIOD; EEG SIGNALS; BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; SEDATED PATIENTS; PATTERNS; QUANTIFICATION; INTERRELATIONS; FREQUENCY; SLEEP; BRAIN	Objectives: Electroencephalographic burst activity characteristic of burst-suppression pattern (BSP) in sedated patients and of burst-interburst pattern (BIP) in the quiet sleep of healthy neonates have similar linear and non-linear signal properties. Strong interrelations between a slow frequency component and rhythmic, spindle-like activities with higher frequencies have been identified in previous studies. Time-varying characteristics of BSP and BIP prevent a definite pattern-related analysis. A continuous estimation of the bispectrum is essential to analyze these patterns. Parametric bispectral approaches provide this opportunity. Methods: The adaptation of an AR model leads to a parametric bispectrum by using the transfer function of the estimated AR filter. Time-variant parametric bispectral approaches require an estimation of AR parameters which consider higher order moments to preserve phase information. Accordingly, a time-variant parametric estimation of the bispectrum was introduced. Data driven simulations were performed to provide optimal parameters. BSP (12 patients) and BIP (6 neonates) were analyzed using this novel approach. Results. Significant differences in the time course of burst pattern during BSP and burst-like pattern before the onset of ESP could be shown. A rhythmic quadratic phase coupling (period 10 sec) was identified during BIP in all neonates. Conclusion: Quadratic phase couplings during BSP increases in the time course depending on depth of sedation. The visually detected burst activity in BIP is only the temporarily observable EEG correlate of a hidden neural process. Time-variant bispectral approaches offer the possibility of a better characterization of underlying neural processes leading to improved diagnostic tools used in clinical routine.

J	Richardson, MP; Grosse, P; Allen, PJ; Turner, R; Brown, P				Richardson, Mark P.; Grosse, Pascal; Allen, Philip J.; Turner, Robert; Brown, Peter			BOLD correlates of EMG spectral density in cortical myoclonus: Description of method and case report	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; CONTINUOUS EEG; MOTOR CORTEX; TREMOR; ARTIFACT; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; CONTRACTION	The recording of electrophysiological data during BOLD fMRI is highly challenging but provides the opportunity to develop a more thorough account of brain function than either modality alone. To develop new techniques in this area has often required the study of pathological electrophysiological measures because such measures can be unusually strong (e.g., epileptic EEG spikes) and hence more easily detectable during fMRI than weaker normal phenomena. In this paper, we have studied pathologically strong EMG signals in a patient with cortical myoclonus. First, we studied the patient outside of scanning: The pathological corticospinal drive to muscle was concentrated over 6-30 Hz so that EMG components at higher frequency could be used to control for non-corticospinal contributions to the EMG during scanning. Additionally, there was very strong EMG-EMG and EMG-EEG coherence in this frequency band. Furthermore, analysis of spectral phase showed that this exaggerated coherence was produced by efferent drive from brain to muscle. Hence, the exaggerated peak in distal muscle EMG power spectrum reflected brain activity producing the efferent drive. Subsequently, we modified equipment and data analysis techniques previously developed for simultaneous EEG-fMRI to record polychannel EMG from distal upper limbs during simultaneous BOLD fMRI. After artefact reduction, the EMG recorded during fMRI retained the essential frequency and phase characteristics of EMG recorded outside of scanning. The BOLD signal was significantly correlated with time-varying 6- to 30-Hz power in a froutoparietal network compatible with the neurophysiological characteristics of our patient and compatible with prior hypotheses explaining the origin of cortical mynclonus.

Alpha EEG predicts visual reaction time	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha EEG; brain clock; neural encoding; perception; reaction time; synchronization	SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; CORTEX; AGE; CAT	Studies have suggested that consciousness is encoded discretely in time and synchronously in space of the brain. The present study was to model the alpha EEG as a brain clock to carry out the functions and to test whether the quality and rate of the oscillation could predict behavioral timing. Results showed that the alpha peak frequency was correlated with the conflict reaction time, and the selectivity was associated with the simple reaction time. These findings are consistent with previous reports and support the hypothesis that alpha EEG represents excitability cycles and may serves as a brain clock for spatial synchronization.

Baseline EEG with eyes open and closed was recorded in an undergraduate sample (N = 67). Cortical power in the a range was inversely related to dissociative symptoms as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale, while both delta and theta power where positively related to dissociation. However, sleep experiences, as indexed with the Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, were unrelated to resting EEG characteristics. We propose that suppression in the alpha band and raised levels of theta activity, which are typical for high dissociators, might help to explain why dissociative symptoms are accompanied by attentional and memory deficits.

These changes may be associated with alterations in brain electrical activity and in cognition. Methods: The sample included 9 methamphetamine-dependent subjects and 10 non-drug-using volunteers. Methamphetamine-dependent subjects were hospitalized for 4 days to document abstinence; non-drug-using volunteers were studied as outpatients. EEGs were recorded in the eyes-closed resting state, and absolute EEG power in each frequency band (0.5-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz, and 12-20 Hz) was measured using a fast Fourier transform. EEG power was log-transformed prior to analysis. Cognition was measured using computerized reaction time tasks. Results: Within the methamphetamine-dependent group only, increased theta quantitative EEG (QEEG) power correlated significantly with reaction time on tasks that were more difficult or that were degraded by fatigue. Increased theta QEEG power also correlated with reduced accuracy on a working memory task. Conclusions: Increased QEEG power in the theta band is associated with worse performance on reaction time tasks in the methamphetamine-dependent sample but not in the non-drug-using volunteers. Significance: Methamphetamine dependence is associated with pathological alterations in brain electrical activity and in cognitive performance. QEEG appears to provide a sensitive measure of methamphetamine-associated alterations in brain function. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The method is based on calculating independent component analysis (ICA) on electrophysiological multielectrode field potential measurements (MFPMs) in a running window. We have previously proposed a method for observing independently operating neural populations, i.e., functional populations (FUPOs) from MFPMs and outlined the concept, which is elaborated upon and extended in this paper, in order to facilitate analysis of functioning of the target brain area. In this paper, the pro)posed method is demonstrated with an example with three concurrent hippocampal measurements from an anesthetized rat brain. The proposed method can be applied in analysis of any recordings of neural networks in which contributions from a number of neural populations (NPs) are simultaneously recorded via a number of measurement points (MP's), as well in vivo as in vitro.

We hypothesized that the availability of a temporal representation in working memory would limit the extent of cortico-cortical coupling necessary to undertake a self-paced rhythmic movement. To this end we examined modulations in cortico-cortical interactions as determined by EEG coherence during a delay interval and subsequent movement reproduction. Right hand movement was initially paced by a metronome beat every 0.9 s, followed by a delay interval, after which hand movement was repeated in an unpaced manner. Movement reproduction after a long (22.5 s, corresponding to 25 movement cycles) compared to a short (5.4 s, corresponding to 6 movement cycles) delay interval was associated with an increased degree of functional coupling in the beta frequency band (12-30 Hz) of the left (movement-driving) hemisphere (F3-FC3, F3-C3 and F3-P3 connections) as well as mesial regions (FCz-FC3, FCz-C3 and Cz-FC3 connections) even though overall behavioral characteristics were not influenced. In addition, analysis of the EEG coherence in the delay period revealed a bilateral frontal network (F3-F4, F3-FC4, F4-FC3 and FC3-FC4 connections). Activity in the latter tended to be synchronized in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and was significantly less strong at 22.5 s than 5.4 s. These data suggest that working memory may be partly subserved by synchronization in a bilateral frontal network and may provide an intrinsic contextual influence that shapes the pattern of cortico-cortical interaction during a given task.

It is shown that the optimal pairing can be achieved by the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm known in graph theory as a solution to the optimal assignment problem. An advantage of the proposed pairing method is shown on data from electroencephalogram, which are blindly separated using the FastICA algorithm in a sliding time-window with the aim to study the time evolution of elements of the estimated mixing matrix.

The 20-Hz oscillations are coherent with contralateral EMG; in most studies those at 10 Hz are not. However, significant 10-Hz coherence has recently been reported in a group of epileptic patients, all of whom were taking the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (CBZ). In a double blind study, we investigated the effects of CBZ on corticomuscular coherence in eight healthy human subjects (all male). Subjects performed a precision grip task against an auxotonic load, whilst left sensorimotor EEG and EMGs from five muscles in the right hand and forearm were recorded. CBZ (100 mg) or a placebo was then given orally, and 6 h later subjects were re-tested. One week separated CBZ and placebo experiments in each subject. Coherence averaged across subjects and muscles during the hold phase of the task was maximal at 21 Hz; it increased significantly (P < 0.05, Z-test) by 89% after CBZ administration. This was significantly greater than a much smaller increase following placebo, which itself may reflect an effect of the time of day when experiments were performed. There was no significant approximately 10-Hz coherence either before or after CBZ administration. CBZ did not significantly alter EEG power at either 10 or 20 Hz. Recently, we showed that diazepam markedly increases the power of approximately 20-Hz motor cortical oscillations with little effect on coherence. We show here that CBZ raises coherence without altering EEG power. This pharmacological dissociation may indicate an important role for corticomuscular coherence in motor control.

When they appear in NREM sleep, arousal responses are not limited to a single EEG pattern but are part of a continuous spectrum of EEG modifications ranging from high-voltage slow rhythms to tow amplitude fast activities. The hierarchic features of arousal responses are reflected in the phase A subtypes of CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) including both slow arousals (dominated by the < 1 Hz oscillation) and fast arousals (ASDA arousals). CAP is an infraslow oscillation with a periodicity of 20-40 s that participates in the dynamic organization of steep and in the activation of motor events. Physiologic, paraphysiologic and pathologic motor activities during NREM, steep are always associated with a stereotyped arousal pattern characterized by an initial increase in EEG delta power and heart rate, followed by a progressive activation of faster EEG frequencies. These findings suggest that motor patterns are already written in the brain codes (central pattern generators) embraced with an automatic sequence of EEG-vegetative events, but require a certain degree of activation (arousal) to become visibly apparent. Arousal can appear either spontaneously or be elicited by internal (epileptic burst) or external (noise, respiratory disturbance) stimuli. Whether the outcome is a physiologic movement, a muscle jerk or a major epileptic attack will depend on a number of ongoing factors (steep stage, delta power, neuro-motor network) but all events share the common trait of arousal-activated phenomena.

J	Polunina, AG; Davydov, DM				Polunina, AG; Davydov, DM			EEG spectral power and mean frequencies in early heroin abstinence	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						abstinence; drug abuse; EEG; heroin; opiate	ADDICTS; ALCOHOL	The purpose of the present study was to investigate cumulative heroin effects on brain functioning by studying relationships among electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and mean frequencies and heroin abuse history. Eyes-closed resting EEG data were collected from the 19 monopolar electrode sites in 33 heroin abusers and 13 age-matched healthy volunteers. The mean age of the patients was 23.1 +/- 4.5 years, the duration of daily heroin abuse (DDRA) ranged from 4 to 44 months, the intravenous doses of heroin ranged from 0.04 to 1.00 g/day, the abstinence length ranged from 6 days to 4.5 months. General linear model (GLM) repeated measures procedure revealed a significant group effect on the distribution of the mean power spectrum between bands and mean frequencies in almost all analyzed derivations. Further analysis demonstrated that these intergroup differences were diversely related to at least three aspects of heroin-taking history. Frequency shifts in alpha2 range, most prominent in frontal and central derivations, were related to duration of daily heroin consumption. Slowing of alphal mean frequency, most prominent in central, temporal, and occipital derivations, was registered mainly in heroin addicts who abused high doses of the drug. Spectral power characteristics of brain electrical activities in our patient population were strongly predicted by abstinence length. The present results give grounds to suppose that chronic heroin-taking induces neuronal oscillation frequency changes, which may contribute to the development of antisocial trends and some semantic processes disturbances in these patients. Supplementary neurophysiological deficit is characteristic for heroin addicts who takes high doses of the drug, however, its relation to heroin abuse remains unclear. Pronounced desynchronization is observed in acute heroin withdrawal, and spectral power characteristics tend to normalize almost completely during several weeks of abstinence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We consider both the areas of functional activation (nodes) and the structural (DTI) and functional connections (I)CM) between them in real time (EEG, frequency analysis) as important tools in analyzing the network. The efficiency of network function involves the time course of activation of nodes and their connectivity to other areas of the network. We outline landmarks in the development of brain networks underlying executive attention from infancy and childhood. We use individual differences in network efficiency to examine genetic alleles that are related to performance. We consider how animal studies might be used to determine the genes that influence network development. Finally we indicate how training may aid in enhancing attentional networks. Our goal is to show the wide range of methods that can be used to suggest and analyze models of network function in the study of attention. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed algorithm combines the autoregressive (AR) model and the multirate system technique to divide the computation effort, the algorithm is based on an adaptive steepest descent algorithm to handle slow time drifting signals. The adaptive AR model provides an access to parameterized spectral representation, and the multirate technique partitions the signal into high frequency and low frequency sub-bands. The partitioning of the spectrum enables separate computation of the frequency sub-bands. The sub-band signal can then be concatenate to form a complete spectrum. The method than allows one to use smaller amount of memory to sequentially compute the frequency spectrum. The method is used on data from the MITBIH arrhythmia electrocardiography (ECG) database for verification.

It has therefore become increasingly important to understand the neurophysiological. processes underlying EEG activity, as well as to identify those features of brain activity that are essential for brain development. By integrating the existing literature from basic neuroscience to neonatal EEG, the present review proposes a simple, neurophysiologically and neuroanatomically based framework for neonatal EEG interpretation. This is composed of two developmental trajectories: one related to discrete spontaneous activity transients (SAT) and the other to the ongoing, apparently oscillatory EEG activity. This framework can readily be applied to clinical use. It may open novel avenues to automated analysis in EEG monitoring and, moreover, it may facilitate genuine translational research.

In this paper, we modified a model proposed by Wendling et al. [6] to analyze EEG power density in some cortical areas during a simple task (finger movement). The work consists of three subsequent stages: 1) in the first we performed a sensitivity analysis of the main model parameters (i.e., strength of inhibitory and excitatory synapses and their time constants) and evaluated their role in affecting power spectral density (PSD). This analysis confirmed the possibility to simulate various EEG rhythms by modifying just the strength and time constants of a few synapses. However, a single neural mass model produces a narrow frequency band, which cannot mimic the overall complexity of EEG in an entire cortical area. 2) Hence, in the second stage we built a model of a region of interest (ROI) by combining three neural mass models arranged in parallel. With this model, and using an automatic fitting procedure to establish parameter values, we carefully reproduced the PSD of cortical EEG in six ROIs during finger movement. Cortical EEGs were computed with an inverse propagation model, starting from measurement performed with 128 electrodes on the scalp. 3) In the third stage, we simulated how PSD in some ROIs can be modified, as a consequence of some hypothetical functional connectivity among the regions. Results show that the proposed model is able to mimic PSD of cortical activity acting on a few parameters only. The pattern of power spectra, however, is significantly modified by a functional connectivity among the ROIs. Knowledge obtained from the model may be exploited to derive information on functional connectivity, starting from non-invasive EEG measurements.

However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate with each other. In this study, advanced methods for the estimation of cortical connectivity from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are presented. These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual magnetic resonance images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. Determination of the priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated voxels) fMRI. We estimate functional cortical connectivity by computing the directed transfer function (DTF) on the estimated cortical current density waveforms in regions of interest (ROIs) on the modeled cortical mantle. The proposed method was able to unveil the direction of the information flow between the cortical regions of interest, as it is directional in nature. Furthermore, this method allows to detect changes in the time course of information flow between cortical regions in different frequency bands. The reliability of these techniques was further demonstrated by elaboration of high-resolution EEG and fMRI signals collected during visually triggered finger movements in four healthy subjects. Connectivity patterns estimated for this task reveal an involvement of right parietal and bilateral premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. This cortical region involvement resembles that revealed in previous studies where visually triggered finger movements were analyzed with the use of separate EEG or fMRI measurements.

During encoding of visual information higher theta amplitudes were observed in the right compared to the left hemisphere. Retrieval of visuospatial and verbal information elicited a more bilateral activation pattern. These effects were accompanied by theta coupling between dorsolateral prefrontal and right posterior temporal electrode sites during encoding. During retrieval prefrontal and bilateral temporo-parietal brain areas were coupled. These results support the idea of working memory functions being dependent on distributed prefrontal-temporal networks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using intracranial electrodes in humans, we investigated changes in topographic distribution of gamma power and local- and long-range gamma EEG coherence in neocortex and hippocampus during different cerebral states. We report significantly greater variability in gamma power across cortical regions during wakefulness than during either slow wave or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, local (within cortical regions) and long-range (between cortical regions) gamma coherence was significantly higher during wakefulness than during sleep, and functional gamma-range coupling between the neocortex and hippocampus was seen during wakefulness, but not during sleep.

Lesions of the vestibular system disrupt hippocampal theta rhythm in the rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							SPATIAL MEMORY DEFICITS; WHOLE-BODY ROTATIONS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; BRAIN-STEM; SUPRAMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; UNIT-ACTIVITY	The hippocampus has a major role in memory for spatial location. Theta is a rhythmic hippocampal EEG oscillation that occurs at similar to 8 Hz during voluntary movement and that may have some role in encoding spatial information. We investigated whether, as part of this process, theta might be influenced by self-movement signals provided by the vestibular system. The effects of bilateral peripheral vestibular lesions, made >= 60 days prior to recording, were assessed in freely moving rats. Power spectral analysis revealed that theta in the lesioned animals had a lower power and frequency compared with that recorded in the control animals. When the electroencephalography (EEG) was compared in epochs matched for speed of movement and acceleration, theta was less rhythmic in the lesioned group, indicating that the effect was not a result of between-group differences in this behavior. Blood measurements of corticosterone were also similar in the two groups indicating that the results could not be attributed to changes in stress levels. Despite the changes in theta EEG, individual neurons in the CA1 region of lesioned animals continued to fire with a periodicity of similar to 8 Hz. The positive correlation between cell firing rate and movement velocity that is observed in CA1 neurons of normal animals was also maintained in cells recorded from lesion group animals. These findings indicate that although vestibular signals may contribute to theta rhythm generation, velocity-related firing in hippocampal neurons is dependent on nonvestibular signals such as sensory flow, proprioception, or motor efference copy.

SL was measured for seven electrode pairs (F4-F3, C4-C3, P4-P3 for the analysis of interhemispheric SL and F4-C4, C4-P4, F3-C3, and C3-P3, for the analysis of intrahemispheric SL). During the A I CAP subtypes, SL tended to be highest between pairs of electrodes situated over different hemispheres; in particular, SL obtained from F4-F3 was the highest, followed by that of P4-P3. These results indicate that the transient high level of synchronization in the slow-wave EEG range, during the sleep At CAP subtypes, is a phenomenon involving mostly the anterior parts of the brain and is probably based on interhemispheric interactions, possibly mediated by transcallosal connections.

But, in audiogenic seizures (brainstem tonic-clonic seizures), the anticonvulsant activity of these nuclei is still controversial. In the present study we aimed to analyze the STR-SNPr-CS circuitry in the audiogenic seizures of Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR). Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from WARs under no treatment or injection with systemic (phenobarbital) or intracerebral (intranigral) drugs (muscimol and phenobarbital). The main EEG frequency oscillation of STR, SNPr and SC seen before, during and after audiogenic seizures or during seizure protection, was determinated with wavelet spectral analyses. This method allows the association between behavior and EEG (video-EEG). Audiogenic seizures last only for half a minute in average, suggesting that the interruptions of seizures are probably not due to exhaustion. Systemic phenobarbital caused an acute and dose-dependent behavioral and EEGraphic anticonvulsant effect both in WARs. The dose of phenobarbital 15 mg/kg protected animals almost completely, without side effects such as ataxia and sedation. In our data, this endogenous "natural" seizure blockade (or termination) seems to be similar to the "forced" seizure abolition, like the one caused by a systemic non-ataxic phenobarbital dose, because in both cases an intense decrease in the EEG main frequency oscillation can be seen in SNPr and SC. Intranigral phenobarbital or muscimol did not protect animals, and actually induced an increase in the main EEG frequency oscillation in SC. The main finding of the present study is that, in contrast to what is well believed about the incapacity to control audiogenic seizures by the striato-nigro-tectal circuitry, we collected here evidences that these nuclei are involved in the ability to block these seizures. However, the striato-nigro-tectal circuitry in WARs, a genetically developed strain, seems to have different functional mechanisms when compared with normal rats. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Brain oscillatory ERD/ERS responses of the 4- to 30-Hz EEG frequency bands were examined during lexical decision where the task is to identify whether the presented stimulus is a word or a pseudoword. Seven subjects performed the task with visual stimuli and twelve subjects with auditory stimuli. Visual stimuli elicited greater theta ERS responses as compared to the auditory stimuli. Both stimulus modalities elicited alpha and beta frequency ERD, these being greater for the auditory stimuli. Auditory stimuli elicited also later emerging beta ERS responses, absent for the visual stimuli. The lexicality effects (words vs. pseudowords) were greater for the auditory than for the visual stimuli. When studying brain oscillatory correlates of cognitive processing, the stimulus modality matters. Some effects may arise and some vanish depending on in which modality a cognitive experiment is being conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cortical oscillatory activity is proposed as a mechanism through which distributed neuronal networks may bind into coherent ensembles and coupling of oscillators is used as a tool to investigate modulations of cortical connectivity. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that, although the same brain network is involved in both real and imagined movements, the functional connectivity within the network differs. To do so, we measured interregional coupling, quantified using coherence between scalp EEG electrodes, during different periods of a prehension task during real and imagined movements. The results demonstrated a different pattern of coupling in the beta frequency range between electrodes overlying occipital and motor cortices during executed and imagined movements. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural networks during real and imagined movements are not identical.

However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [ current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1-4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4-10 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30-50 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient oscillatory activity allows auditory cortex to structure its temporal activity pattern so as to optimize the processing of rhythmic inputs.

Recent studies have shown that the cerebral cortex is susceptible to several changes during a learning process and that alterations in the brain's electrical patterns take place as a result of the acquisition of a motor skill and memory consolidation. In this context, subjects' brain electrical activity was analyzed before and after the motor task. EEG data were collected by a Braintech 3000 and analyzed by Neurometrics. For the statistical analysis, the behavioral variables "time" and "number of errors" were assessed by a one-way ANOVA. For the neurophysiological variable "Absolute Power", a paired t-Test was performed for each pair of electrodes CZ-C3/CZ-C4, in the theta and alpha frequency bands. The main results demonstrated a change in performance, through both behavioral variables ("time" and "number of errors"). At the same time, no changes were observed for the neurophysiological variable ("Absolute Power") in the theta band. On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in the alpha band in central areas (CZ-C3/CZ-C4). These results suggest an adaptation of the sensory-motor cortex, as a consequence of the typewriting training.

All-night polysomnographic recordings were obtained at home at 2 wk and at 2, 4, 6, and 9 mo after birth (analysis of 7 infants). Total sleep time and the percentage of quiet sleep or non-rapid eye movement sleep (QS/NREMS) increased with age, whereas the percentage of active sleep or rapid eye movement sleep (AS/REMS) decreased. Spectral power of the sleep EEG was higher in QS/NREMS than in AS/REMS over a large part of the 0.75- to 25-Hz frequency range. In both QS/NREMS and AS/REMS, EEG power increased with age in the frequency range <10 Hz and >17 Hz. The largest rise occurred between 2 and 6 mo. A salient feature of the QS/NREMS spectrum was the emergence of a peak in the sigma band (12-14 Hz) at 2 mo that corresponded to the appearance of sleep spindles. Between 2 and 9 mo, low-frequency delta activity (0.75-1.75 Hz) showed an alternating pattern with a high level occurring in every other QS/NREMS episode. At 6 mo, sigma activity showed a similar pattern. In contrast, theta activity (6.5-9 Hz) exhibited a monotonic decline over consecutive QS/NREMS episodes, a trend that at 9 mo could be closely approximated by an exponential function. The results suggest that 1) EEG markers of sleep homeostasis appear in the first postnatal months, and 2) sleep homeostasis goes through a period of maturation. Theta activity and not delta activity seems to reflect the dissipation of sleep propensity during infancy.

Electroencephalogram characteristics of autonomic arousals during sleep in healthy men	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						arousal; autonomic; delta waves; alpha waves; EEG	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PERIODIC LEG MOVEMENTS; PULSE TRANSIT-TIME; NERVE ACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; MARKERS; APNEA; NIGHT	Objective: Many sleep disorders involve frequent, brief arousals, not appreciated during conventional sleep stage scoring due to lack of electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization. We evaluated the temporal relation between heart rate (HR) changes, an index of autonomic activation, and EEG in seven healthy subjects during sleep. Methods: We identified bouts of tachycardia-bradycardia and performed spectral analysis of EEG during these. We also identified cortical arousals by the appearance of EEG alpha activity. This allowed us to dichotomize bouts of tachycardia-bradycardia by presence or absence of cortical arousal. Results: During non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, bouts with or without cortical arousal occurred with approximately equal frequency. Those with cortical arousals usually preceded onset of EEG changes. Those without cortical arousals were followed by increases in delta but not alpha power. EEG did not change during bouts in REM sleep. Conclusions: Capturing bouts of tachycardia-bradycardia is relatively easy via computerized algorithm. Bouts occur with cortical arousal or with slow wave synchronization suggestive of subcortical arousal. Thus, changes in HR may be useful index of arousal. Significance: These brief bursts of tachycardia-bradycardia are consistent with autonomic arousal. Such a measure may be among the first in a continuum of arousal ending with frank awakening.

The two oscillations that have received the most attention are the theta and the gamma rhythm. In this study, the functioning and properties of phase synchronization parameters for these two frequency bands estimated by means of Gabor expansion were demonstrated with simulations for the phase-locking index (PLI) and the 1:1 as well as n:m phase synchronization indices. In order to demonstrate the importance of phase synchronization phenomena for memory performance, power, PLI and the 1:1 as well as n:m phase synchronization indices were calculated for EEG data on verbal memory encoding. These parameters showed various dissociations for recalled versus not-recalled nouns. In particular, the calculation of phase synchronization among different frequencies either at the same electrode or at different electrodes provided a completely new picture of dynamic neuronal interaction accompanying memory processing.

On an average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2-25 Hz, and the dominant peak was shifted towards lower frequencies. Maximal differences appeared in the 7-9 Hz band in all electrodes. Frontal electrodes contributed most to this difference in the 13-15 Hz band. Bicoherence analysis suggests an enhanced coupling between theta (4-9 Hz) and beta (12-25 Hz) frequencies in patients. The subgroup of six patients free from centrally acting medication showed higher spectral power in the 2-18 Hz frequency range. On an individual basis, the combination of peak height and peak frequency discriminated between patient and control groups: discriminant analysis classified 87% of all subjects correctly. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT) we carried out follow-up for a subgroup of seven patients. Median pain relief was 70 and 95% after 3 and 12 months, respectively. The average EEG power of all seven patients gradually decreased in the theta band and approached normal values only after 12 months. The excess theta EEG power in patients and its decrease after thalamic surgery suggests that both EEG and neurogenic pain are determined by tightly coupled thalamocortical loops. The small therapeutic CLT lesion is thought to initiate a progressive normalization in the affected thalamocortical system, which is reflected in both decrease of EEG power and pain relief.

Five single-pulse TMS conditions were performed based on the individual resting motor threshold (RMT): (1) 80%; (2) 100%; (3) 120%; (4) 130%; and (5) sham. Simple self-paced movements of the right first finger were also executed. We evaluated the reactions to magnetic stimulation and movement conditions using event-related power and event-related coherence transformations of alpha and beta rhythms. Event-related power reflected regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies, while event-related coherence reflected the inter-regional functional coupling of oscillatory neural activity. The event-related power transformation revealed that the magnetic pulse modulated cortical oscillations within the first half second for both frequency ranges. For the alpha rhythm, threshold TMS induced a small decrease in the amplitude of EEG oscillations over the stimulation site, while for both rhythms, a progressive synchronization was observed as the intensity of TMS was increased in both hemispheres. Movement onset produced a greater bilateral decrease of power compared with the effects of a magnetic pulse. The event-related coherence revealed that TMS enhanced the electrode connectivity of both hemispheres. Additionally, it was more enhanced within the first 500 ms following stimulation and was seen only for the alpha frequency rhythm. The increase of functional connectivity between cortical areas was minor for magnetic stimulation conditions compared with that for finger movements. The single-pulse TMS over M1 partially modulated the motor cortex generators of oscillatory activity, while a simple active self-paced movement of the right first ringer induced greater cortex activation and coupling between cortical regions. We propose that finger movements impose higher functional demands on the motor system compared to artificial magnetic stimulation. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the human motor system may be based on network-like oscillatory cortical activity and might be modulated by brief electromagnetic sub- and suprathreshold pulses applied to M1, suggesting a phenomenon of resetting.

In inhibitory neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT), this rhythm is reflected as a slow ( < 1 Hz) oscillation of the membrane potential comprising stereotypical, recurring "up" and "down" states. Here we show that reducing the leak current through the activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with either trans-ACPD[(+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane- trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid] ( 50 - 100 mu M) or DHPG [( S)- 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] ( 100 mu M) instates an intrinsic slow oscillation in NRT neurons in vitro that is qualitatively equivalent to that observed in vivo. A slow oscillation could also be evoked by synaptically activating mGluRs on NRT neurons via the tetanic stimulation of corticothalamic fibers. Through a combination of experiments and computational modeling we show that the up state of the slow oscillation is predominantly generated by the "window" component of the T-type Ca2+ current, with an additional supportive role for a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation current. The slow oscillation is also fundamentally reliant on an I-h current and is extensively shaped by both Ca2+- and Na+- activated K+ currents. In combination with previous work in thalamocortical neurons, this study suggests that the thalamus plays an important and active role in shaping the slow ( < 1 Hz) rhythm during deep sleep.

Intracranial stereo electroencephalographic activity (SEEG; 256 Hz sampling rate) was recorded from hippocampus, and inferior (BA20) and middle (BA21) temporal cortex in four epilepsy patients. The repetitive events were represented by predicted imperative somatosensory stimuli (CNV paradigm) triggering hand movements ('repetitive visuomotor') or counting ('repetitive counting'). The non-repetitive events were 'rare' (P3 paradigm) somatosensory stimuli triggering hand movements ('non-repetitive visuomotor') or counting ('non-repetitive counting'). Brain rhythmicity was indexed by event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) of SEEG data, whereas the functional coupling was evaluated by spectral SEEG coherence between pairs of the mentioned areas. The frequency bands of interest were theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (32-46 Hz). Compared to the non-repetitive events, the 'repetitive visuomotor' events showed a significant beta and gamma ERS in the hippocampus and a significant theta ERD in the inferior temporal cortex. Furthermore, the 'repetitive visuomotor' events induced a task-specific significant gamma coherence among the examined areas. These results suggest that recency processes do modulate the magnitude and functional coupling of brain rhythmicity (especially gamma) in the human temporal cortex.

Methods: The traces of scalp ictal EEG of spasms temporally were expanded in 11 patients whose clinical diagnosis was symptomatic WS in six, cryptogenic WS in two, Aicardi syndrome in one, and symptomatic generalized epilepsy after WS in the remaining two. Time evolution of averaged power spectra of the ictal fast activity also was analyzed in each patient. Results: Rhythmic gamma activity with frequency ranging from 50 to 100 Hz was detected in a total of 345 of 537 spasms. Fast activity was seen bilaterally in nine patients, was lateralized to one hemisphere in another, and appeared independently on each hemisphere in the remaining infant with Aicardi syndrome. Power spectra showed a clear peak corresponding to spasm-associated gamma rhythm, with frequency centering similar to65 Hz and ranging from 51 to 98 Hz. The morphology and spectral characteristics of ictal gamma rhythm were completely different from those of muscle activity or alternating current (AC) artifacts. Conclusions: Spasm-associated gamma activity was clearly detected on the scalp. This observation may provide a clue to the pathophysiology of spasms.

In analysis of the electrical activity of the brain, coherence is a measure of the degree of synchrony between two or more regions of the brain with regard to their frequency values over a unit of time. Aims. To explore the functional alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD), by evaluating the behaviour of coherence over the whole spectrum of EEG frequencies. Patients and methods. We studied a group of 42 patients with AD, according to criteria of the NINCDS-ADRDA group. Partial coherence (e.g. between two derivations each time) was calculated within and between hemispheres, during a state of mental rest; the Z statistic was also determined by comparing the coherence values with the standard data for age, sex and functional state of the brain. Results. Significantly low coherence values were obtained for the frontal-central regions of the left hemisphere (LH) and for the occipital-parietal regions of the right hemisphere (RH) in the delta band The same localisations were carried out for the theta band, in addition to the centrotemporal and temporal regions of the LH The highest incoherence values were observed for the alpha and beta bands, more specifically in frontal-central and occipital-parietal derivations of the RH, and temporal derivations of the LH. Conclusions. Non-activated partial coherence acts as an indicator of the degree of functional disconnection between brain regions in AD. Studying activated coherence in these patients could contribute new elements to our knowledge about the functional disorders observed in this disease.

The KIII's are strongly biologically motivated models of neural organization and functioning at the mesoscopic level in the cortex of vertebrate brains. The present study focuses on the fixed point and the limit cycle attractors in KII's. It considers the eigenvalues of the linearized KII system and outlines the conditions under which it exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The derived conditions will be instrumental in tuning the parameters of the KIII models having sustained chaotic oscillations.

The proposed analysis method provides information on spatial extents of active neural populations, locations of the populations with respect to each other, population evolution, including merging and splitting of populations in time, and on time lag differences between the populations. In some cases,results of the proposed analysis may also be interpreted as independent information flows carried by neurons and neural populations. In this paper, a detailed description of the analysis method is given. The proposed analysis is demonstrated with an illustrative simulation, and with an exemplary analysis of an in vivo multichannel recording from rat hippocampus. The proposed method can be applied in analysis of any recordings of neural networks in which contributions from a number of neural populations or information flows are simultaneously recorded via a number of measurement points, as well in vivo as in vitro.

J	Guo, WS; Dai, M				Guo, Wensheng; Dai, Ming			Multivariate time-dependent spectral analysis using Cholesky decomposition	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						bootstrap; Cholesky decomposition; locally stationary time series; smoothing spline; spectral analysis	SERIES; MODELS; ANOVA	In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method to estimate the spectrum of a multivariate locally stationary process. The time-varying spectrum is assumed to be smooth in both time and frequency. In order to ensure that the final estimate of the multivariate spectrum is positive definite while allowing enough flexibility in estimating each of its elements, we propose to smooth the Cholesky decomposition of an initial spectral estimate and to reconstruct the final spectral estimate from the smoothed Cholesky elements. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure. The first stage approximates the locally stationary process by a piecewise stationary time series to obtain the local estimate of the time varying spectrum and its Cholesky decomposition on discrete time-frequency points. The second stage uses a smoothing spline ANOVA to jointly smooth each Cholesky element in both time and frequency, and reconstructs the final estimate of the time varying multivariate spectrum for any time-frequency point. The final estimate is a smooth function in time and frequency, has a global interpretation, and is consistent and positive definite. We show that the Cholesky decomposition of a time varying spectrum can be used as a transfer function to generate a locally stationary time series with the designed spectrum. This not only provides us flexibility in simulations, but also allows us to construct bootstrap confidence intervals on the time varying multivariate spectrum. A simulation is conducted to investigate its performance and an application to an EEG data set recorded during an epileptic seizure is used as an illustration.

EEGs were recorded in 33 subjects, and alpha (7.5-12.5Hz) and beta (15-25Hz) oscillations were extracted with the use of a modified wavelet transform. Power, peak frequency and phase synchronisation were evaluated for both types of oscillation. The average beta-alpha peak frequency ratio was about 1.9-2.0 for all electrode derivations. The peak frequency of beta activity was within 70-90 % of the 95 % confidence interval of twice the alpha frequency. A significant (p < 0.05) linear regression was found between beta and alpha power in all derivations in 32 subjects, with the slope of the regression line being approximate to 0.3. There was no significant difference in the slope of the line in different electrode locations, although the power correlation was strongest in the occipital locations where alpha and beta oscillations had the largest power. A significant 1:2 phase synchronisation was present between the alpha and beta oscillations, with a phase lag of about pi/2 in all electrode derivations. The strong frequency relationship between the resting beta and alpha oscillations suggests that they are generated by a common mechanism. Power and phase relationships were weaker suggesting that these properties can be modulated by additional mechanisms as well as be influenced by noise. A careful distinction between alpha-dependent and alpha-independent beta activity should be considered when making statements about the possible significance of genuine beta activity in different neurophysiological mechanisms.

Specifically, the proposal was assessed that enhancement of the low beta components sensorimotor rhythm (SMR: 12-15 Hz) and beta] (15-18 Hz) affect different aspects of attentional processing. Methods: Subjects (n = 25) were randomly allocated to training with either an SMR or betal protocol, or to a non-neurofeedback control group. Subjects were assessed prior and subsequent to the training process on two tests of sustained attention. The neurofeedback participants were also assessed on target P300 event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in a traditional auditory oddball paradigm. Results: Protocol-specific effects were obtained in that SNIR training was associated with increased perceptual sensitivity 'd prime' (d'), and reduced omission errors and reaction time variability. Beta1 training was associated with faster reaction times and increased target P300 amplitudes, whereas no changes were evident in the control group. Conclusions: Neurofeedback training of SMR and betal band components led to significant and protocol-specific effects in healthy subjects. The data can be interpreted as indicating a general attention-enhancing effect of SMR training, and an arousal-enhancing effect of betal training.

In the present study, a time-frequency coherence estimate using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) together with its confidence intervals are proposed to evaluate the correlation between two non-stationary processes. The approach is based on averaging over repeat trials. A systematic comparison between approaches using CWT and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out. Simulated data are generated to test the performance of these methods when estimating time-frequency based coherence. In contrast to some recent studies, we find that CWT based coherence estimates do not supersede STFT based estimates. We suggest that a combination of STFT and CWT would be most suitable for analysing non-stationary neural data. Tests are presented to investigate the time and frequency discrimination capabilities of the two approaches. The methods are applied to two experimental data sets: electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (EMG) during wrist movements in a healthy subject, and local field potential (LFP) and surface EMG recordings during resting tremor in a Parkinsonian patient.

This review is concerned with current knowledge on these state transitions, focusing primarily on those findings that allow the integration of data at cellular Level. with spectral time-course data at the encephalographic (EEG) Level. At the cellular Level it has been proposed that, under the influence of circadian and homeostatic factors, transitions between wake and steep may be determined by mutually inhibitory interaction between steep-active neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area and wake-active neurons in multiple arousal. centres. These two fundamentally different behavioural states are separated by the steep onset and the steep inertia periods each characterised by gradual changes in which neither true wake nor true steep patterns are present. The results of sequential spectral analysis of EEG data on moves towards and away from deep steep are related to findings at the cellular level on the generating mechanisms giving rise to the various NREM oscillatory modes under the neuromodulatory control of brainstem-thalamic activating systems. And there is substantial evidence at cellular level that transition to and from REM steep is governed by the reciprocal interaction between cholinergic REM-on neurons and aminergic REM-off neurons located in the brainstem. Similarity between the time-course of the REM-on neuronal activity and that of EEG power in the high beta range (similar to18-30 Hz) allows a tentative parallelism to be drawn between the two. This review emphasises the importance of the thalamically projecting brainstem activating systems in the orchestration of the transitions that give rise to state progression across the steep-wake cycle.

To elicit a response in the visual cortex, subjects were exposed to flicker frequencies varying from 1 to 25Hz (1Hz steps, eyes closed). Extending the standard view to compare magnitudes of the evoked neuronal to the evoked vascular response, we additionally investigated modulations of alpha-power, a marker of "background" EEG activity. The results show two discrepancies between the electrophysiological and vascular response: ( 1) VEP and alpha-power exhibit a discontinuous peak when stimulating at the individual alpha-frequency (IAF) (similar to 10-11 Hz), indicating resonance between background oscillations and evoked response; this is not mirrored by the vascular response. ( 2) The vascular response, in contrast, steadily increases up to a maximum at 7-8 Hz and slightly decreases with higher frequencies. This continuous frequency dependence is partly reflected by the decrease in alpha-power up to frequencies of 8-9 Hz and a slight increase in alpha-power beyond the IAF resonance. Although indicating an inverse relationship between alpha-power and vascular response, the frequency dependence of the evoked response does not show such a correlation. Thus, electrophysiological resonance between an individual's alpha-frequency and isofrequent stimulation is not mirrored by the vascular response. Also, spontaneous background EEG activity is an important modulator of the vascular response magnitude. We discuss these deviations from a simple one-to-one translation between evoked potential and vascular response amplitude in the light of questions concerning synchronization, attenuation, and induction of background oscillations such as the alpha-rhythm.

Spatiotemporal patterns were sought of oscillations in the beta and gamma ranges. The techniques required for preprocessing EEGs in search of global patterns were diametrically opposed to those needed for localization of modular EEG signals. Frames were found in the form of intermittent spatial patterns of phase and amplitude modulation (AM and PM) of carrier waves in beta and gamma ranges that served to classify EEG frames with respect to CSs. A model based on the intentional action-perception cycle is proposed to complement the information processing model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cantero, JL; Atienza, M				Cantero, JL; Atienza, M			The role of neural synchronization in the emergence of cognition across the wake-sleep cycle	REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review						brain oscillations; sleep neural synchrony; functional connectivity; cognition; dreaming; consciousness; humans	HUMAN REM-SLEEP; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN NAVIGATION; CELL ASSEMBLIES; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; NEURONAL RESPONSES; CORTICAL NETWORKS	Searching for the neural code underlying consciousness and cognition is one of the most important activities in contemporary neuroscience. Research with neuronal oscillations at the level of single-neuron, local cell assemblies, and network system have provided invaluable insights into different mechanisms of synaptic interactions involved in the emergence of cognitive acts. A cognitive neuroscience of conscious experience is gradually emerging from behavioral and neuroimaging studies, which can be successfully complemented with the quantitative EEG findings discussed here. This review is an attempt to highlight the value of state-dependent changes in human neurophysiology for a better understanding of the neurobiological substrate underlying those aspects of cognition drastically affected by sleep states. Recent advances related to synchronization mechanisms potentially involved in brain integration processes are discussed, emphasizing the value of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings at determining local and large-scale dynamics in the human brain. Evidence supporting the critical role of state-dependent synchrony in brain integration comes mainly from studies on the theta and gamma oscillations across the wake-sleep continuum, as revealed by human intracranial recordings. This review blends results from different levels of analysis with the firm conviction that state-dependent brain dynamics at different levels of neural integration can provide a deeper understanding of neurobiological correlates of consciousness and sleep functions.

If oscillators with non-identical internal frequency are coupled they generate a great variety of periodic and chaotic rhythmic patterns. Sonfication of these patterns suggests their characterization in terms of polyrhythms: each oscillatory unit subdivides "measures" of equal or varying length differently. For the case of two coupled oscillators the organization of these polyrhythms is exemplified as a function of the internal frequency ratio and the coupling strength. Some sonification strategies are presented which aid to detect complex rhythmic relationships between oscillators. The results may be of importance for the analysis of complex multivariate time series like human EEG.

While some studies have found effects of various cognitive processes on this signal, such effects could not be replicated in other studies. Accordingly, some authors have claimed that evoked gamma-band activity reflects merely sensory functions. To resolve these conflicting positions, we conducted a target detection experiment in which the feature that defined the target could be distributed over a large or a small part of the entire stimulus. Only targets covering a larger area of the entire stimulus evoked stronger gamma-band activity than standards although the over-all stimulus size was identical for all stimuli. This increase in evoked activity resulted from stronger oscillatory power and not exclusively from stronger phase-locking. In contrast, N1 and P3 amplitudes were larger for target stimuli irrespective of the distribution of the relevant stimulus feature. These results are consistent with the notion that early gamma-band activity is generated by feature-selective neural assemblies the activity of which can in fact be modulated by top-down processes. This interaction, however, may be only detectable in scalp-recorded EEG if it affects a sufficient number of neural assemblies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The current study compares different frequency activities in offspring of alcoholics (OA) and in normal control subjects (NC) to examine whether the OA group exhibits any abnormality in oscillatory activity while performing a Go/NoGo task. Methods: The S-transform algorithm was employed to decompose the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals into different time-frequency bands, and the oscillatory responses in the P300 time window (300-700 milliseconds) were statistically analyzed in both groups. Results: The OA group manifested significantly decreased activity in delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), and alpha1 (8-9 Hz) bands during the NoGo condition, as well as reduced delta and theta activity during the Go condition. This reduction was more prominent in the NoGo than in the Go condition. Conclusions: The decreased response in delta, theta, and alpha1 oscillations, especially during the NoGo condition in high-risk individuals, is perhaps suggestive of cognitive and neural disinhibition and may serve as an endophenotypic marker in the development of alcoholism and/or other disinhibitory disorders.

The search to identify the dynamic connectivity of brain signals within different frequency bands, in order to uncover the transient cooperation between different brain sites, converges at the potential of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models and their derived parameters. In fact, MVAR parameters provide a whole battery of so-called coupling measures including classic coherence (COH), partial coherence (pCOH), imaginary part of coherence (iCOH), partial-directed coherence (PDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and full frequency directed transfer function (ffDTF). All of these approaches have been developed to quantify the degree of coupling between different EEG recording positions, with the specific aim to characterize the functional interaction between neural populations within the cortex. This work addresses the application of MVAR models to event-related brain processes, including different statistical approaches, and reviews most relevant findings in the expanding field of coupling analysis. Finally, we present several examples of coupling patterns associated with certain types of movement imagery.

In the hippocampus in vitro these oscillations can occur in the absence of pyramidal neuronal somatodendritic compartments and are temporally correlated with on-going, persistent gamma frequency oscillations. Their occurrence in the hippocampus is dependent on gap-junctional communication and it has been suggested that these high frequency oscillations originate as collective behaviour in populations of electrically coupled principal cell axonal compartments. Here we demonstrate that the superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex can also generate high frequency oscillations associated with gamma rhythms. During persistent gamma frequency oscillations high frequency oscillations occur with a high bispectral coherence with the field gamma activity. Bursts of high frequency oscillations are temporally correlated with both the onset of compound excitatory postsynaptic potentials in fast-spiking interneurones and spikelet potentials in both pyramidal and stellate principal neurones. Both the gamma frequency and high frequency oscillations were attenuated by the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone. These data suggest that high frequency oscillations may represent the substrate for phasic drive to interneurones during persistent gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex.

ERPs are low-frequency events that are usually obscured in single trial analysis. To visualize these signals; most of the reliable solutions at the present time use the ensemble averages of many single trials. In this paper, a wavelet-based method called Statistical Coefficient Selection (SCS) is used for the extraction of ERPs from EEG signals. Unlike other wavelet-based denoising methods, the current method does not focus on the wavelet coefficients of the signal itself. Instead, it selects the coefficients based on the statistical study of trials from training data set. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed SCS method in extracting ERPs in comparison with other filtering approaches.

The normal gating of the P50 response to the second stimulus (S2) is impaired in many schizophrenic patients. Various in vitro and in vivo evoked potential paradigms have shown that a stimulus evokes early gamma frequency oscillation, which is followed by beta frequency oscillation. The gamma-to-beta shift in response to the first stimulus (SI) in the paired-click paradigm may contain critical electrophysiological signals that modulate the S2 suppression. The results of the present study showed that post-S1 beta frequency response was inversely correlated to the S2 P50 response in patients with schizophrenia.

Although EEG measured SSR has been studied in children, the developmental course of the magnetic SSR is unknown. Methods: Sixty-nine healthy subjects ranging in age from 5 to 52 years participated in a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) study. Stimuli were monaural 500 ms duration click trains with a 25 ms inter-click interval. Contralateral magnetic responses for both hemispheres were recorded with a 37-channel MEG system. Responses were averaged and examined using wavelet-based time-frequency analysis. Source analyses were also conducted on a subset of the data. Results: Gamma power from 200 to 500 ms post-stimulus onset was computed and was significantly related to subject age in both hemispheres. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed for the anterior-posterior SSR source locations, suggestive of asymmetry similar to that previously described for the SSR and other auditory evoked magnetic field components. Conclusions: The 40 Hz power findings are generally consistent with previous EEG studies of steady state responses in children showing agerelated changes in the 40 Hz SSR. Significance: Age-related changes in the strength of the magnetic 40 Hz SSR may continue to develop well beyond early childhood, which should be taken into consideration in planning future studies using adolescents and young adults.

Methods: EEGs were recorded at high spatial resolution from a 1 X 1 cm 8 X 8 electrode array on the right inferior temporal gyrus of a patient undergoing preoperative monitoring for epilepsy surgery. Cosines were fitted to EEG segments to measure frequency and phase and compute location, size, latency, phase velocity, duration, and recurrence rate of radially symmetric spatial patterns called phase cones. The Hilbert transform was also used to get high temporal resolution. Results: In the awake state, the power spectral density (PSD) showed power-law decrease in log power with log frequency at 1/f(alpha), alpha similar to 2, but with peaks in the standard empirical ranges. The phase in beta and gamma ranges had spatial gradients in conic form. Resetting of these stable spatial patterns of phase cones was spatially coincident at intermittent discontinuities ('phase slip') recurring at theta rates. Cones had half power diameters from 2 to 50+ mm; their durations had power-law distributions with values ranging from 6 to 300+ ms depending on length of the analysis window. In slow wave sleep PSD decreased at 1/f(alpha), alpha similar to 3,with loss of beta-gamma spectral peaks and diminished or absent oscillations and spatiotemporal phase structure. Conclusions: Spatiotemporal structures in awake human and rabbit EEG showed striking similarities. The only clear differences were ascribable to differing scales of measurement. These fine spatiotemporal structures of EEG were diminished or lost in slow wave sleep. Significance: The fine structure indicates that neocortical stability is sustained at self-organized criticality; that synaptic input in the awake state drives neocortex away from criticality causing beta-gamma oscillations in re-stabilizing 'neural avalanches'; and that diminished input in slow wave sleep allows return toward criticality but with some added risk of instability and seizure.

To study these patterns, we used the Gabor atom density (GAD) which is a measure of complexity of a signal. It is based on the time-frequency decomposition obtained by the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. The GAD/MP method was applied to EEG data recorded from intracranial electrodes in patients with intractable epileptic seizures. Seizures analyzed include partial and generalized tonic-clonic events. GAD analyses show that this complexity measure can facilitate the identification of temporal patterns of propagation of epileptic seizures. Local measure of GAD complexity can be an indicator of regional propagation and therefore be a key to identify critical moments in seizure evolution that could be useful in the developing interventions for seizure control.

The results show that good perceptual but not memory performance is related to low alpha amplitudes. In addition, we found that large phase resetting in the alpha band, and enhanced early components in the ER-P are related to good performance in the discrimination task. The conclusion of this study is that in contrast to memory performance which is related to large resting alpha activity low alpha amplitudes are an indicator for good perceptual performance.

The development of human cognitive state monitoring system for the drivers to prevent accidents behind the steering wheel has become a major focus in the field of safety driving. It requires a technique that can continuously monitor and estimate the alertness level of drivers. The difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and the interference of, the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. An adaptive alertness estimation methodology based on electroencephalogram, power spectrum analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and fuzzy neural network (FNNs) models is proposed in this paper or continuously monitoring driver's drowsiness level with concurrent changes in the alertness level. A novel adaptive feature selection mechanism is developed for automatically selecting effective frequency bands of ICA components for realizing an on-line alertness monitoring system based on the, correlation analysis between the time-frequency power spectra of ICA components and the driving errors defined as the deviation between the center of the vehicle and the cruising lane in the virtual-reality driving environment. The mechanism also provides effective and efficient features that can be fed into ICA-mixture-model-based self-constructing FNN to indirectly estimate driver's drowsiness level expressed by approximately and predicting the driving error.

However, the factors that influenced such EEG alterations remain unclear. The authors evaluated the correlation between QEEG alterations that occurred during IFN-alpha treatment and the age of 98 patients with chronic hepatitis C. These patients underwent blind, prospective, and serial quantitative EEG examinations. IFN-alpha was administered intramuscularly at 9 x 10(6) IU daily for the first 4 weeks and then three times per week for the next 20 weeks. Serial EEGs were obtained before, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 2 to 3 days after the treatment. The absolute powers of each frequency band at different stages of the treatment were determined by QEEG. The ages of the patients were classified into five groups: 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and greater than or equal to60 years. The relationship between the alterations in power values and age was statistically evaluated. As the age of the patients increased, the alterations in power values for the slow waves, alpha 2, and fast waves during IFN-alpha treatment became more remarkable, and significant (repeated-measure analysis of variance; P < 0.0001). The alterations of EEG occurring during IFN-alpha treatment were marked in older patients.

AD has been shown to be associated with abnormal generation of spontaneous electromagnetic activity. We investigated whether the cortical generation of spontaneous brain oscillations in MCI shows changes resembling those observed in AD. A minimum current estimates algorithm was applied to identify cortical sources of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) spontaneous brain oscillations in male MCI patients with a clear memory disorder and in healthy elderly controls. This data was subsequently compared to a male subsample of AD patients from an earlier study. While there were clear oscillatory abnormalities in AD patients, there was no evidence of significant changes in the alpha source distribution in MCI patients as compared to healthy controls. Deficits in the distribution of oscillatory sources in the resting state are thus likely to occur at later stages of cognitive impairment than MCI. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data from 7 different laboratories that had been obtained for routine diagnostic evaluations on 7 different EEG instruments and stored on compact disks were investigated. Since the instruments do not filter the data at input, ultra slow activity down to 0.01 Hz is currently being recorded but the attenuation factor is instrument dependent. Nevertheless, relevant clinical information is potentially available in these data and needs to be explored. Several examples in regard to epilepsy are presented. Determination of seizure onset may depend on the frequencies that are examined. The use of appropriate filter settings and viewing windows for the clinical question to be answered is stressed. Differentiation between simple and complex spike wave discharges, as well as spread of spikes, can readily e achieved by expanding the time base to 1 or 2 seconds and placing a cursor on the peak of the negative spike. Latencies in the millisecond range can then become apparent. EEGs co-registered with MEG should be evaluated with the same software in order to allow an adequate assessment of the similarities and differences between electrical and magnetic activity. An example of a comparison of EEG, planar gradiometers and magnetometers for an averaged spike is shown.

The present study used a rat neocortical brain slice EEG preparation to investigate excitatory synaptic mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced burst suppression activity. Excitatory synaptic mechanisms associated with burst suppression activity were probed using glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX and APV), GABA receptor antagonists, and simultaneous whole cell patch clamp and microelectrode EEG recordings. Clinically relevant concentrations of thiopental (50-70 mu M), propofol (5-10 mu M) or isoflurane (0.7-2.1 vol%, 0.5-1.5 rat minimum aveolar concentration (MAC), 200-700 mu M) evoked delta slow wave activity and burst suppression EEG patterns similar to in vivo responses. These effects on EEG signals were blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (8.6 mu M) or APV (50 mu M). Depolarizing intracellular bursts (amplitude = 34.7 +/- 4.5 mV; half width = 132 +/- 60 ms) always accompanied EEG bursts, and hyperpolarization increased intracellular burst amplitudes. Barrages of glutamate-mediated excitatory events initiated EEG bursting activity. Glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents were significantly depressed by higher anesthetic concentrations that depressed burst suppression EEG activity. A GABA(A) agonist produced a similar EEG effect to the anesthetics. It appears that anesthetic effects at both glutamate and GABA synapses contribute to EEG patterns seen during anesthesia.

Here we studied the concentration-dependent effect of halothane on gamma (20-60 Hz) power of event-related potentials (ERP) in rat primary visual cortex. ERP to light flashes repeated at 5-s intervals was recorded with chronically implanted, bipolar, intracortical electrodes at selected steady-state halothane concentrations between 0 and 2%. gamma-Band power was calculated for 0-1000, 0-300 and 300-1000 ms post-stimulus periods and corresponding prestimulus (PS) periods. Multitaper power spectral analysis was used to estimate gamma power from both single-trial and average ERP in order to differentiate between phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced) gamma activities. Significant PS gamma power was present at all halothane concentrations. Flash elicited an increase in gamma power that lasted up to 1 s poststimulus at all halothane concentrations. Halothane at intermediate concentrations (0.5-1.2%) augmented both PS and ERP gamma power two to four times relative to the waking baseline. gamma Power was not different between waking and deeply anesthetized (2%) levels. gamma Power reached maximum, as predicted by a Gaussian fit of power-concentration data, at halothane concentration (0.86%) similar to the concentration (0.73%) that abolished the righting reflex, a behavioral index of loss of consciousness. Evoked, i.e. stimulus-locked, gamma power was present during the first 300 ms poststimulus but not later, and was approximately 50% of single-trial ERP gamma power. Single-trial gamma power was present also at 300-1000 ms poststimulus, reflecting ERP not phase-locked to the stimulus. In summary, these observations suggest that (1) gamma activity is present in states ranging from waking to deep halothane anesthesia, (2) halothane does not prevent the transfer of visual input to striate cortex even at surgical plane of anesthesia, and (3) anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness, as reflected by the loss of righting reflex, is not correlated with a reduction in gamma power. Variance with other studies may be due to an underestimation of gamma power by ERP signal averaging as compared with single-trial analysis. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The method of the Directed Trans er Function (DTF) is a frequency-domain approach to this problem, based on a multivariate autoregressive modeling of time series and on the concept of Granger causality. So far, all the connectivity estimations performed on cerebral electromagnetic signals were computed between signals gathered from the electric or magnetic sensors. However, the spreading of the potential from the cortex to the sensors makes it difficult to infer the relation between the spatial patterns on the sensor space and those on the cortical sites. In this pap. er we propose the use of the DTF method on cortical signals estimated from high resolution EEG recordings, which exhibit a higher spatial resolution than conventional cerebral electromagnetic measures. As main contributions of this work, we present the results of a wide simulation study, aiming to evaluate performances of DTF application on this kind of data, and a statistical analysis (via the ANOVA, analysis of variance) of the results obtained for different levels of Signal to Noise Ratio and temporal length, as they have been systematically imposed on simulated signals. Finally, we provide an application to the estimation of cortical connectivity from high resolution EEG recordings related to finger tapping movements.

The EEG apparatuses with inkwriting pens recording on paper are incapable of giving us trustworthy tracings beyond 80/sec. With the introduction of digital EEG machines, the exploration of the 60 to 1000 Hz range has already begun in the past few years (but, strangely enough, had been in use during the pioneer age when short photographic EEG recordings were made). The new wave of ultrafast recording began in the domain of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). In the field of EEG (strictly speaking), research work started very recently. Ultrafast EEG activity promises new insights into the electrophysiological basis of epileptic phenomena. Activities from 150- to 500/sec have been noted in recent studies (including personal work). Faster frequencies (5001 000/sec) are likely to play a major role in the electrophysiology of neurocognition and motor initiation. Such EEG-based neurocognitive studies will provide us with in-real-time data and thus outperform PET scanning and functional MRI. Even ultrafast EEG activity has its limitation, which appears to lie around 1000/sec. Faster frequencies (1000-3000 Hz) - recorded mainly with cathode ray oscillography - are probably incompatible with the shortest duration of true field potentials and might be nothing but "neuronal chatter.".

The 62-channel EEG was recorded in control (n=21) and high anxiety (HA, n=18) non-patient individuals. Results showed that in HA subjects, the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) was associated with stronger right-sided parieto-temporal theta-1 (4-6 Hz) and beta-1 (12-18 Hz) activity, whereas increased non-emotional arousal (eyes open, viewing neutral movie clip) was marked by persisting favored right hemisphere beta-1 activity. In turn, viewing aversive movie clip by the HA group led to significant lateralized decrease of the right parieto-temporal beta-1 power, which was initially higher in the emotionally neutral conditions. The EEG data suggests that asymmetrical parieto-temporal theta-1 and beta-1 EEG activity might be better interpreted in terms of Gray's BAS and BIS theory. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Current methods are based on the estimation of the stability of the phase difference between pairs of signals over a time window, within successive frequency bands. This paper introduces a new approach to study the dynamics of brain synchronies, Frequency Flows Analysis (FFA). It allows direct tracking and characterization of the nonstationary time-frequency dynamics of phase synchrony among groups of signals. It is based on the use of the one-to-one relationship between frequency locking and phase synchrony, which applies when the concept of phase synchrony is not taken in an extended 'statistical' sense of a bias in the distribution of phase differences, but in the sense of a continuous phase difference conservation during a short period of time. In such a case, phase synchrony implies identical instantaneous frequencies among synchronized signals, with possible time varying frequencies of synchronization. In this framework, synchronous groups of signals or neural assemblies can be identified as belonging to common frequency flows, and the problem of studying synchronization becomes the problem of tracking frequency flows. We use the ridges of the analytic wavelet transforms of the signals of interest in order to estimate maps of instantaneous frequencies and reveal sustained periods of common instantaneous frequency among groups of signal. FFA is shown to track complex dynamics of synchrony in coupled oscillator models, reveal the time-frequency and spatial dynamics of synchrony convergence and divergence in epileptic seizures, and in MEG data the large-scale ongoing dynamics of synchrony correlated with conscious perception during binocular rivalry.

Spectral F-test power evaluation in the EEG during intermittent photic stimulation	ARQUIVOS DE NEURO-PSIQUIATRIA			English	Article						EEG; intermittent photic stimulation; photic driving; spectral F test; quantitative analysis	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CHILDREN	Intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) is an important functional test, which can induce the photic driving in the electroencephalogram (EEG). It is capable of enhancing latent oscillation's manifestations not present in the resting EEG. However, for adequate quantitative evaluation of the photic driving, these changes should be assessed on a statistical basis. With this aim, the sampling distribution of spectral F test was investigated. On this basis, confidence limits of the SIFT-estimate could be obtained for different practical situations, in which the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of epochs used in the estimation may vary. The technique was applied to the EEG of 10 normal subjects during IPS, and allowed detecting responses not only at the fundamental IPS frequency but also at higher harmonics. It also permitted to assess the strength of the photic driving responses and to compare them in different derivations and in different subjects.

MP-SS voltage, frequency and duration characteristics were investigated for the amplitude threshold (AT) that maximized yield between test sensitivity and specificity. Parameter distribution curves were also built for correctly detected (true positive) and false-positive events. For sleep stage 2, MP reached 80.6% sensitivity and specificity for an AT value of 58.8. For all stages together, 81.2% sensitivity and specificity were reached for an AT value of 46.6. Specificity curves were adequate for all stages; sensitivity was lower for S3+4. Sigma frequency range activity with atypical characteristics was detected within REM sleep. Prevalence indexes obtained with MP were much higher than visual prevalence indexes for all stages; similar voltage, frequency and duration distribution curves were obtained for true positive and false positive events. For this sample of young male healthy subjects, the free-ware MP algorithm showed satisfactory performance for SS defection in sleep stage 2 as reported earlier, acceptable performance in sleep stages 3+4, although with lowered sensitivity, and sigma frequency range activity within REM sleep that needs better understanding. Within NREM sleep, correspondence between the MP automatic and the visual method was supported. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: A polysomnography was performed on 16 healthy young men and 19 healthy middle-aged men across the first 3 NREM-REM cycles. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram recordings. High Frequency (HFnu) of HRV as well as the maximum of cross-spectrum, coherency, gain and phase shifts between HFnu and delta sleep EEG power band were compared between both groups. Results: Young men experienced more deep sleep than middle-aged men (P < 0.001). In middle-aged subjects, HFnu was lower than the HFnu of their younger counterparts (P < 0.001), but they showed similar increases during NREM sleep and similar decreases during REM sleep as the young subjects. Cross-spectrum values, coherency, gain and phase shifts between HFnu and delta were identical between the two groups. Modifications in HFnu show parallel changes and precede changes in delta EEG band by a similar leads of 11 +/- 6 min in young men and 9 7 min in middle-aged men (P = 0.23). Conclusions: Reduced changes in the respective influence of the cardiac sympathetic and vagal activity and delta EEG activity with progressive aging do not alter the relationship and phase difference between changes in the relative predominant cardiac vagal activity and delta power in middle-aged men. Significance: Interaction between the cardiac sympathetic and vagal activity with delta EEG activity is maintained in middle-aged men.

We aimed to determine the effects of sleep stage and wakefulness on these responses to ascertain whether a common pattern of EEG and HR activation takes place. Methods: The time course of EEG spectral activity and FIR variability associated with PLM was analysed in 13 patients during light NREM sleep, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness. The same analysis was also conducted for PLM without MA occur-ring in stage 2. Results: A significant EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) activation was found associated with PLM during sleep, but not during wakefulness. While in light NREM sleep, an increase in delta and theta bands was detected before the PLM onset, in REM sleep the EEG activation occurred simultaneously with the PLM onset. Moreover, during stage I and REM sleep, alpha and fast frequencies tended to remain sustained after the PLM onset. In contrast, during wakefulness, a small and not significant increase in cerebral activity was present, starting at the PLM onset and persisting in the post-movement period. A typical pattern of cardiac response was present during NREM and REM sleep, the autonomic activation being lesser and prolonged during wakefulness. Conclusions: We conclude that the EEG and HR responses to PLM differ between sleep stages and wakefulness with lesser changes found during wakefulness. Significance: These findings suggest that specific sleep state-dependent mechanisms may underlie the occurrence of PLM. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The frequency of the response, which follows the frequency of stimulation, is maximal at a stimulus rate of 40 Hz for auditory stimuli. The exact cause of these maximal responses is not known, although some authors have suggested that they might be related to the 'working frequency' of the auditory cortex. Testing of the responses to different frequencies of stimulation may be lengthy if a single frequency is studied at a time. Our aim was to develop a fast technique to explore the oscillatory response to auditory stimuli, using a tone modulated in amplitude by a sinusoid whose frequency increases linearly in frequency ('chirp') from 1 to 120 Hz. Methods: Time-frequency transforms were used for the analysis of the evoked responses in 10 subjects. Also, we analyzed whether the peaks in these responses were due to increases Of amplitude or to phase-locking phenomena, using single-sweep time-frequency transforms and inter-trial phase analysis. Results: The pattern observed in the time-frequency transform of the chirp-evoked potential was very similar in all subjects: a diagonal band of energy was observed, corresponding to the frequency of modulation at each time instant. Two components were present in the band, one around 45 Hz (30-60 Hz) and a smaller one between 80 and 120 Hz. Inter-trial phase analysis showed that these components were mainly due to phase locking phenomena. Conclusions: A simultaneous testing of the amplitude-modulation-following oscillatory responses to auditory stimulation is feasible using a tone modulated in amplitude at increasing frequencies. The maximal energies found at stimulation frequencies around 40 Hz are probably due to increased phase-locking of the individual responses.

We investigate this question in a memory task in which human subjects had to retrieve a verbal label in response to the presentation of a picture. The results show that (i) evoked oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha and beta range undergo a significant phase resetting and (ii) become synchronized in absolute phase during small time windows that (iii) coincide with the latencies of the P1-N1 complex.

Research on the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of mild traumatic brain injury is reviewed with an emphasis on details that may pertain to EEG or QEEG and their interpretation. Research reports on EEG and QEEG in mild traumatic brain injury are reviewed in this setting, and conclusions are drawn about general diagnostic results that can be determined using these tests. QEEG strengths and weaknesses are reviewed in the context of factors used to determine the clinical usefulness of proposed diagnostic tests. Clinical signs, symptoms, and the pathophysiologic axonal injury and cytotoxicity tend to clear over weeks or months after a mild head injury. Loss of consciousness might be similar to a non-convulsive seizure and accompanied subsequently by postictal-like symptoms. EEG shows slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and increased diffuse theta slowing, which may revert to normal within hours or may clear more slowly over many weeks. There are no clear EEG or QEEG features unique to mild traumatic brain injury. Late after head injury, the correspondence is poor between electrophysiologic findings and clinical symptoms. Complicating factors are reviewed for the proposed commercial uses of QEEG as a diagnostic test for brain injury after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. The pathophysiology, clinical symptoms and electrophysiological features tend to clear over time after mild traumatic brain injury. There are no proven pathognomonic signatures useful for identifying head injury as the cause of signs and symptoms, especially late after the injury.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is all autoimmune disease that affects different systems and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). It has been suggested that about 40% of the cases of neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) develop before SLE is diagnosed or at the same time it is being carried out, and 63% appear during the first year following diagnosis. Aims. The aim of this study was to check the hypothesis that the electroencephalogram (EEG) may be sensitive to the damage to the CNS in children with SLE in whom there is still no clinical evidence of NPSLE. Patients and methods. EEG recordings were performed in 30 children with a diagnosis of SLE with or without signs of a neuropsychiatric syndrome. The results of the EEG were evaluated visually and analysed quantitatively. Results. The visual inspection of the EEG showed the presence of alterations in 44.5% of the children with SLE and in 76.9% of those with NPSLE. There were significant differences in Student's t test (p = 0.0055) between the two groups for the analysis of the broadband spectral measurements. The narrow band analysis revealed a significant increase it? the theta and delta frequencies in children with SLE as compared to standard values, whereas in children with NPSLE significant differences were found in the fast bands in frontal regions. Conclusions. Spectral analysis of the narrow band could help to confirm diagnoses of NPSLE, while anomalies in the slow bands could be an early marker of damage to the CNS although there are still no symptoms of the disease.

EEG parameters can be used as indicators of cortical activation. To find temporal and spatial relation between circulatory and bioelectric phenomena, we used combined EEG and TCD measurements during cognitive experiments. Bilateral BFV in the MCAs and 16-channel scalp EEG were recorded during mental arithmetic (MA) and verbal fluency (VF) tests in 12 healthy volunteers. Temporal profile of BFV, heart rate (H R), EEG central frequency (CF), relative alpha power (r alpha p), and laterality index (Li) for BFV and CF were statistically analysed. During mental effort, BFV changes showed a reproducible pattern, which was different in MA and VF tests. The Li-BFV correlated with handedness in 9/12 subjects (75 %) in the VF, and in 6/12 subjects (50 %) in the MA test. Significant correlation was found between Li-BFV and Li-CF during VF (r(2) = 0.69). Li was more indicative for the hemispheric dominance in the VF than in the MA test. During VF test, correlation between HR and BFV was significant in 7/12 subjects. CF and rap provide real time assessment of the functional state of the brain tissue during cognition. The correlation between CF and BFV during mental activity suggests a short latency neurogenic and a long latency, supposedly chemical regulation of regional blood flow. Parallel analysis of EEG and flow parameters increases the confidence of determining hemispheric dominance and provides an alternative to study physiological consequences of cognitive processes.

A mental rotation task was per formed before and after upper alpha and theta NFT Only those subjects who were able to increase their upper alpha power (responders) per formed better on mental rotations after NFT. Training success (extent of NFT-induced increase in upper alpha power) was positively correlated with the improvement in cognitive performance. Furthermore, the EEG of NFT responders showed a significant increase in reference upper alpha power (i.e. in a time interval preceding mental rotation). This is in line with studies showing that increased upper alpha power in a prestimulus (reference) interval is related to good cognitive performance.

In the present experiments, we evaluated the efficacy of the recently developed selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist PNU-282987 on hippocampal theta oscillation in anaesthetized rats. This compound shows high affinity for the rat alpha 7 nAChRs (Ki = 26 nM) but a negligible activity at other nAChRs. Systemic administration of PNU-282987 significantly enhanced the power (by 40%) of hippocampal theta oscillation induced by electrical stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation. In contrast, the amnesic and muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine significantly decreased the power (by 68%) of the stimulation-induced theta oscillation. Given the connection between hippocampal theta oscillation and cognitive processes, it is proposed that precognitive actions of alpha 7 nAChR agonists could be mediated, at least in part, by modulation of hippocampal oscillatory activity.

This work investigates the relationship by combining EEG and fMIRI measures of the strong increase in beta frequency power following movement, the so-called post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). The time course of the PMBR, as measured by EEG, was included as a regressor in the fMRI analysis, allowing identification of a region of associated BOLD signal increase in the sensorimotor cortex, with the most significant region in the postcentral sulcus. The increase in the BOLD signal suggests that the number of active neurons and/or their synaptic rate is increased during the PMBR. The duration of the BOLD response curve in the PMBR region is significantly longer than in the activated motor region, and is well fitted by a model including both motor and PMBR regressors. An intersubject correlation between the BOLD signal amplitude associated with the PMBR regressor and the PMBR strength as measured with EEG provides further evidence that this region is a source of the PMBR. There is a strong intra-subject correlation between the BOLD signal amplitude in the sensorimotor cortex during movement and the PMBR strength as measured by EEG, suggesting either that the motor activity itself, or somatosensory inputs associated with the motor activity, influence the PMBR. This work provides further evidence for a BOLD signal change associated with changes in neuronal synchrony, so opening up the possibility of studying other event-related oscillatory changes using fMRI.

In recent studies, the importance of developing driver fatigue countermeasure devices has been stressed, in order to help prevent driving accidents and errors. Although numerous physiological indicators are available to describe an individual's level of alertness, the EEG signal has been shown to be one of the most predictive and reliable, since it is a direct measure of brain activity. In the present study multichannel EEG data that were collected from 20 sleep-deprived subjects during real environmental conditions of driving are presented for the first time. EEG data's annotation made by two independent Medical Doctors revealed an increase of slowing activity and an acute increase of the alpha waves 5-10 seconds before driving events. From the EEG data that were collected, the Relative Band Ratio (RBR) of the EEG frequency bands, the Shannon Entropy, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Entropy were estimated for each one second segment. The mean values of these measurements were estimated for 5 minutes periods. Analysis revealed a significant increase of alpha waves relevant band ratios (RBR), a decrease of gamma waves RBI; and a significant decrease of KL entropy when the first and the last 5-min periods were compared. A rapid decrease of both Shannon and K-L entropies was observed just before the driving events. Conclusively, EEG can assess effectively the brain activity alterations that occur a few seconds before sleeping/drowsiness events in driving, and its quantitative measurements can be used as potential sleepiness indicators for future development of driver fatigue countermeasure devices.

Hjorth- and Barlow-based feature extraction procedures (FEPs) are investigated along with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification. These are well-known nonparametric FEPs but their simplicity prevents them from matching the performance of more complex FEPs. Neural time-series prediction preprocessing (NTSPP) has been shown to enhance the separability of both time- and frequency-based features and is used in this work to improve the applicability of these FEPs. NTSPP uses a number of prediction modules (PMs) to perform mi-step ahead prediction of EEG time-series recorded whilst subjects perform motor imagery-based mental tasks. Depending on the PMs, the NTSPP framework normally requires subject-specific parameters to be predefined. In this work each PM is a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN). The SOFNN has a self-organizing structure and good nonlinear approximation capabilities however; a number of parameters must be defined prior to training. This is problematic therefore the practicality of a general set of parameters, previously selected via a sensitivity analysis (SA), is analyzed. The results indicate that a general set of NTSPP parameters may provide the best results and therefore a fully nonparametric BCI may be realizable.

Part 4: Neural frame simulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Hilbert transform; neural frame; noise (1/f); phase slip; simulated EEG; spatial power spectral density (PSDX); volume conduction	NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; GAMMA EEGS; PHASE; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; METASTABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION	Objective: To develop a method for simulating background EEG based on the premise that the self-organized activity from synaptic interaction among populations Of neurons creates Sustained fluctuations that can be modeled with the filtered output of a random number generator. Methods: The logarithm of the amplitude of activity was weighted in accordance with 1/f, the log frequency in both temporal (PSDT) and spatial (PSDx) power spectral densities. The activity was spatially smoothed by volume conduction. Further deviation from full randomness was by sustained spatial coherence averaging 25% of total power. The departure from the background state to an active state, as seen in the awake EEG, was Simulated by adding segments that were 90% correlated while attenuating by 50% the uncorrelated background activity in those segments. Spatial amplitude modulation was imposed on the correlated noise to create signals that simulated AM patterns. Results: The statistical properties of the EEG that were replicated (Freeman, 2004a,b, 2005) included the PSDT, PSDX, point spread function (PSF), partitioning of the variance with PCA, and the percentages of correct classification of AM patterns. Conclusions: The origin of background EEG was traced to self-sustaining mutual excitation among pyramidal cells creating stable noise that was filtered by self-organized criticality to give l/f(2) PSD, by inhibitory feedback to give oscillations in the classic clinical bands, and by Volume conduction to give smoothing. The essential chance that identified a frame in EEG was transient synchrony by phase transition among cortical populations in beta and gamma bands of the PSDT. Significance: This simulation can provide test data with which to optimize techniques for noninvasively extracting information from the EEG for diagnosis and treatment evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders and for operation by paraplegics of prosthetic devices.

Brain activity of males decreased with the level of general intelligence, whereas an opposite pattern of brain activity was observed in females. This difference was most pronounced in the upper-alpha band which is related to semantic memory processes. It was further found that highly intelligent males displayed greater decoupling of frontal brain areas, whereas highly intelligent females showed more coupling between frontal and parietal/occipital brain areas. Similar, but less significant differences were observed for the two area scores of strategic and experiential emotional intelligence. It appears that males and females have different resting EEG correlates of IQ. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As with any other source reconstruction method, a set of a prim, assumptions are made so that a solution to the inverse problem can be obtained (e.g., Baillet et al., 2001). The main assumption behind the beamformer approach is that no two distant cortical areas generate coherent local field potentials over long time scales; it has been shown empirically (Hillebrand el al., 2005; Singh el al., 2002) that this is a reasonable assumption set. We argue on the basis of anatomical and electrophysiological data why the beamformer assumption set, although simplistic, may indeed be quite plausible. We also illustrate when the assumptions might fail and make suggestions for improvements in the beamformer implementations. We conclude that beamforming is an exciting new approach to MEG source reconstruction that could provide another stepping stone on the route towards an appropriate assumption set with which to non-invasively image the brain.

Previous studies suggested that synchronization likelihood analysis in theta-band frequency might be a sensitive method to identify early alterations of neuronal networks in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We report here a longitudinal study of 24 MCI patients with theta event-related synchronization (ERS) analysis during the n-back working memory task and neuropsychological follow-up after 1 year. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and logistic regression to assess the relationship between cognitive decline and theta ERS. Results: Upon follow-up, 13 MCI patients showed progressive MCI and 11 remained stable. In both groups, the phasic increase in theta amplitude after stimulus presentation did not depend on working memory load and electrode sites. Progressive MCI cases displayed significantly lower theta ERS power over all electrode sites compared to stable MCI cases. Theta ERS was significantly related to the cognitive outcome explaining 15.5% of its variability. In terms of MCI classification, the best combination of sensitivity and specificity was 0.87 and 0.60, respectively, with an area under the corresponding receiver operating characteristic curve reaching 76%. Conclusions: The present data indicate that a decrease in the early phasic theta ERS power during working memory activation may predict cognitive decline in MCI. This phenomenon is not related to working memory load but may reflect the presence of early deficits in directed attention-related neural circuits in MCI. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Brain signals and the cholinergic and GABAergic systems, in vivo and in vitro evidence from studies on the retina, or the "gamma band" oscillations in neuron membrane potential/spiking rate and neuronal assemblies are examples in this respect. However, spontaneous and stimulus-event-related signals at any location and time point reflect brain state conditions that depend on neuromodulation, neurotransmitter interaction, hormones (e.g., glucocorticois, ACTH, estrogens) and neuroendocrine interaction at different levels of complexity, as well as on the spontaneous or experimentally-induced changes in metabolism (e.g., glucose, ammonia), blood flow, pO2, pCO2, acid/base balance, K activity, etc., that occur locally or systemically. Any of these factors can account for individual differences and/or changes over time that often are (or need to be) neglected in pharmaco-EEG studies or are dealt with statistically and by controlling the experimental conditions. As a result, the electrophysiological effects of neuroactive drugs are to an extent non-specific and require adequate modeling and precise correlation with independent parameters (e.g., drug kinetics, vigilance, hormonal profile or metabolic status, etc.) to avoid biased results in otherwise controlled studies.

Effect of gravity on human spontaneous 10-Hz electroencephalographic oscillations during the arrest reaction	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha rhythm; arrest reaction; microgravity; EEG	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN VESTIBULAR CORTEX; ALPHA-RHYTHM; REFERENCE FRAMES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; VISUAL INFORMATION; EEG; STIMULATION	Electroencephalographic oscillations at 10Hz (alpha and mu rhythms) are the most prominent rhythms observed in awake, relaxed (eye-closed) subjects. These oscillations may be considered as a marker of cortical inactivity or an index of the active inhibition of the sensory information. Different cortical sources may participate in the 10-Hz oscillation and appear to be modulated by the sensory context and functional demands. in microgravity, the marked reduction in multimodal graviceptive inputs to cortical networks participating in the representation of space could be expected to affect the 10-Hz activity. The effect of microgravity on this basic oscillation has heretofore not been studied quantitatively. Because the alpha rhythm has a functional role in the regulation of network properties of the visual areas, we hypothesised that the absence of gravity would affect its strength. Here, we report the results of an experiment conducted over the course of 3 space flights, in which we quantified the power of the 10-Hz activity in relation to the arrest reaction (i.e., in 2 distinct physiological states: eyes open and eyes closed). We observed that the power of the spontaneous 10-Hz oscillation recorded in the eyes-closed state in the parieto-occipital (alpha rhythm) and sensorimotor areas (mu rhythm) increased in the absence of gravity. The suppression coefficient during the arrest reaction and the related spectral perturbations produced by eye-opening/closure state transition also increased in on orbit. These results are discussed in terms of current theories on the source and the importance of the alpha rhythm for cognitive function. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mechanisms underlying this decline are poorly understood. One index that has been found to predict performance on memory tests is alpha peak frequency, the peak of spectral alpha power of the EEG. Activity in the alpha band has been also associated with higher cognitive functions including attention and anticipation and has been shown to slow with age. Few studies. however, have examined whether there might be a relationship between WM decline and alpha peak frequency The present study specifically investigated this relationship. Digit span was used as the index of WM function. The study made use of 550 normal subjects aged between 11 and 70 years in the Brain Resource International Database. The data were acquired from six laboratories located in the USA (2), Europe (2) and Australia (2). Forward and reverse digit span were found to be lower in older relative to younger age groups. Spontaneous alpha peak frequency slowed with age and more so at anterior than posterior sites. Frontal alpha peak frequency was found to be a significant predictor of reverse digit span, with each 1 Hz increase in frequency associated with a 0.21 increase in reverse digit span score and this was independent of age, indicating a positive relationship between alpha peak frequency and working memory performance.

Electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG-MEG), which provide full head coverage measurements of the human brain activity, can potentially satisfy those needs. Nevertheless, EEG-MEG signals reflects the integration of separately generated brain processes on the scalp that typically overlap in space and give rise to Spurious phase-locking between their signals. Moreover, current phase synchronization measures do not have a sufficient time resolution to capture very brief periods of phase locking between brain signals, because of their dependence on a window of time integration. We present here a new, non-invasive technique for characterizing the phase synchronization between brain regions at high spatial and ternporal resolution. An efficient inverse problem algorithm was used to estimate, from the MEG signals and with the help of the anatomical MRI, the corresponding intracramal brain sources on the cortical surface. The synchronization analysis was then directly performed on the cortex by the characterization of common instantaneous frequencies between groups of cortical sources which preserve a fine temporal resolution. The proposed method was illustrated by its application to MEG data recorded during absence seizures in two epileptic patients. The technique visualizes local and short-lasting synchronization patterns leading to the seizure, thus providing new potential for understanding non-invasively the origin of epileptic discharges.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of one night of sleep deprivation on waking EEG. Experimental protocol consisted of recording electroencephalographic data from eleven healthy young subjects before (baseline) and after (time 2) one night of sleep deprivation. A natural log transformation was carried out and showed a significant increase in theta T6 (p=0.041), O2 (p=0.018) and OZ (p=0.028); and delta T6 (p=0.043) relative power; and a decrease in alpha Fp1 (p=0.040), F3 (p=0.013), Fp2 (p=0.033), T4 (p=0.050), T6 (p=0.018), 02 (p=0.011) and Oz (p=0.025) and beta (p=0.022) absolute power. These outcomes show that the EEG power spectra, after sleep deprivation, exhibit site-specific differences in particular frequency bands and corroborate for the premise of local aspects of brain adaptation after sleep deprivation, rather than global.

The proposed method employs wavelet-transformed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data and uses anatomical MRI to constrain the current locations to the cortical mantle. In addition, the locations of the sources can be further confined with the help of functional MRI (fMRI) data. As a result, we obtain spatiotemporal maps of spectral power and phase relationships. As an example, we show how the phase locking value (PLV), that is, the trial-by-trial phase relationship between the stimulus and response, can be imaged on the cortex. We apply the method to spontaneous, evoked, and driven cortical oscillations measured with MEG. We test the method of combining MEG, structural MRI, and fMRI using simulated cortical oscillations along Heschl's gyrus (HG). We also analyze sustained auditory gamma-band neuromagnetic fields from MEG and fMRI measurements. Our results show that combining the MEG recording with fMRI improves source localization for the non-noise-normalized wavelet power. In contrast, noise-normalized spectral power or PLV localization may not benefit from the fMRI constraint. We show that if the thresholds are not properly chosen, noise-normalized spectral power or PLV estimates may contain false (phantom) sources, independent of the inclusion of the fMRI prior information. The proposed algorithm can be used for evoked MEG/EEG and block-designed or event-related fMRI paradigms, or for spontaneous MEG data sets. Spectral spatiotemporal imaging of cortical oscillations and interactions in the human brain can provide further understanding of large-scale neural activity and communication between different brain regions.

The amplitude envelope of these oscillations fluctuates intermittently and was recently reported to exhibit power-law decay of the autocorrelation for hundreds of seconds. This indicates that the underlying networks are in a dynamic state resembling the self-organized critical state known to exist in many complex systems. Based on the mechanism of how correlations emerge in these systems, we hypothesized that the physiological basis of long-range power-law correlations is the buildup of a memory of past activity by a continuous modification of the network's functional connectivity by the ongoing oscillations. In this framework, exogenous perturbations of ongoing oscillations would degrade or abolish this dynamic network memory We investigated the sensitivity of the temporal correlations in sensorimotor 10- and 20-Hz oscillations to median nerve stimulation that is known to have immediate effects on ongoing oscillations. Our results show that the amplitude fluctuations of these oscillations were effectively modulated by the somatosensory stimuli but still exhibited long-range temporal correlations and power-law scaling behaviour. The magnitude of the temporal correlations was, however, attenuated and the power-law exponents were decreased. This implies that the stimuli indeed degraded the network's memory of its past.

J	Bhattacharya, J; Petsche, H				Bhattacharya, J; Petsche, H			Phase synchrony analysis of EEG during music perception reveals changes in functional connectivity due to musical expertise	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						phase synchrony; EEG; functional connectivity; cortical network; oscillations; music	OSCILLATORY NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; BRAIN DYNAMICS; THETA; ALPHA; COHERENCE; RESPONSES	Differences in functional and topographical connectivity patterns between two groups, musicians and non-musicians, during attentively listening to three different pieces of music and to a text of neutral content, were presented by means of EEG phase synchrony analysis in five standard frequency bands: delta (< 4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (> 30 Hz). The degree of phase synchrony or phase coherence between EEG signals was measured by a recently developed index, which is more suitable than classical indices, like correlation or coherence, when dealing with nonlinear and nonstationary signals like EEG. Comparing the music listening task to rest or control condition, musicians showed increase in phase synchrony over distributed cortical areas, both near and distant, in delta, and most conspicuously in gamma frequency band, whereas non-musicians showed enhancement only in delta band. Further, the degree of phase synchrony in Musicians was reduced during listening to text as compared to listening to music. Comparing the two groups during the listening tasks, the clear-cut difference was found in gamma band phase synchrony, which was significantly stronger in musicians while listening to every chosen piece of music, yet no large difference between these two groups was found while listening to the chosen text. Musicians also showed stronger higher order inter-frequency phase synchrony between delta band oscillations in anterior regions and gamma band oscillations in posterior regions. In addition, consistent left hemispheric dominance, in terms of the strength of phase synchrony, was observed in musicians while listening to music, whereas right hemispheric dominance was observed in non-musicians. These results suggest that professional training in music is able to elicit context-sensitive functional connectivity between multiple cortical regions resulting in different listening strategies to music.

Herein, we present the EEG recordings from these structures in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE). Methods: Three men (ages 41-43 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of MB-MTT in RE. Previous evaluations had demonstrated a low likelihood of successful response to medication or resective surgery. DBS macroelectrodes were bilaterally implanted within the MB-MTT under general anesthesia and their location checked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We obtained a surface-depth EEG for a 2- to 4-day period, including monitoring of the cardiorespiratory and mnemonic functions. Results: The background pattern of EEG recorded from MB-MTT was low-amplitude (usually < 25 mu v for MB and < 20 mu v for MTT) waves with a variable combination of theta-beta rhythms. In two patients, pseudoperiodic slow spikes were unilaterally recorded with or without clinical signs. For one patient, several focal ictal discharges were recorded in the right MB without scalp EEG changes. Conclusions: The analysis of our depth EEG revealed that the theta-beta pattern represents the predominant physiologic profile of MB. Paroxysmal epileptiform discharges can be observed in human MB. These data supplement those available from animal observations.

Paradoxically, online continuous functional monitoring in the neonate has traditionally focused on cardiorespiratory variables rather than cerebral function. Electrophysiological brain activity, as reflected by electroencephalogram (EEG), is well established as a tool for providing information about the current functional and metabolic state of the brain and the occurrence of epileptic seizure episodes. In neonatal care, EEG has been used extensively for estimation of the degree of cerebral maturation in preterm infants and for detection of abnormal patterns indicating focal and global cerebral lesions [1-3]. In the neonatal setting, as well as in intensive care in general, the EEG has been recorded intermittently, at best serially rather than continuously. Performing a full multichannel EEG in a newborn requires specialized technical skill in securing correct electrode positioning and impedances, as well as identification of extracerebral biologic and nonbiologic artifact sources. Interpretation of neonatal EEG is considered among clinical neurophysiologists a demanding task that must consider the specific EEG features related to different gestational age, activity state, and medication. The main disadvantage with intermittent conventional EEG during neonatal care is the difficulty in discriminating emerging trends of development of the electrocerebral activity over hours and days. If possible at all, it takes special skills not usually available in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to identify long-term changes of EEG patterns. To have an impact on intensive care, monitoring of the electrocortical activity should have a continuous, simple recording setup and a small number of recording electrodes. Furthermore, EEG features that are immediately relevant for clinical decisions should be continuously available at the bedside and easily interpreted by the attending physician day and night. Such techniques have been applied for a long time in intensive care and anesthesia. It has also been used in neonatal monitoring, usually derived from a spectral analysis by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and presented as compressed spectral arrays (CSA) or spectral edge frequency (SE) [4].

MEG is superior to EEG in localization of interictal epileptiform activity: Pro	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						magnetoencephalography; scalp-EEG; interictal epileptiform activity; localization; source modeling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; EXPERIMENTAL TESTS; IMPLANTED SOURCES; 80-200 HZ; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EPILEPSY; ACCURACY; BRAIN; ELECTRODES	Both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG), with a time resolution of 1 ms or less, provide unique neurophysiologic data not obtainable by other neuroimaging techniques. MEG and EEG have often been compared to each other now although the two are complementary. Now that MEG has emerged as a mature clinical technology, it is worthwhile to compare the relative strengths of each for the localization of interictal epileptiform activity and to describe the strength's of MEG relative to EEG in the localization of interictal epileptiform activity. The sources of MEG and EEG signals will first be reviewed. Issues relevant to solving the forward problem and the inverse problem in MEG and EEG will be addressed followed by a comparison of research concerning the detection and localization of interictal epileptiform activity by MEG and EEG. The emphasis will be upon techniques and software routinely used in clinical applications but some emerging areas of MEG research which are entering clinical practice will also be reviewed. Significance: MEG is a new noninvasive neurophysiologic technique which provides unique information for the clinical evaluation of patients with epilepsy, revealing aspects of neuronal function that previously could only be obtained by invasive EEG monitoring, and giving a new window for research of neuronal activity.

The monopolar EEGs of three groups of seven neonates (preterm, term and older term) were recorded during active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) from electrodes Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, C3, C4, O1 and O2. The existence of changes between groups and sleep states in the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta bands and in the dimensional complexity of these electrodes was tested. Additionally, the nonlinearity of the EEG in each electrode and situation was analyzed. The results of the spectral measures show an increment of the power in the low frequency bands from AS to QS and with the PMA, which can be mainly traced on central and temporal electrodes. This change is shown as well by the dimensional complexity, which also presents the greatest differences in the central derivations. Moreover, the signals show evidence of nonlinearity in almost all the groups and situations, although a dynamic change from nonlinear to linear character is apparent in the central electrodes with increased PMA. As a result, it is concluded that nonlinear analysis methods provide a clear portrait of the integrated brain activity that complements the information of spectral analysis in the characterization of the brain development and-the sleep states in neonates.

Synchronization in the alpha frequency range is taken to be a marker of cognitive inactivity, active inhibition of sensory information, or a means of inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas. Here we propose all alternative interpretation which posits that higher alpha power during reference interval signifies higher readiness of alpha system to information processing. Predictions derived from the inhibition and alertness hypotheses were tested during presentation of acoustic stimuli (tone 1000 Hz) and neutral words to 30 males (18-25 years) with different levels of trait anxiety. Oil the whole, predictions derived from the inhibition theory were not confirmed and findings more corresponded to the alertness hypothesis. High-anxiety subjects showed higher alpha power during reference interval simultaneously with higher magnitude of event-related desynchronization and higher amplitude of phase-locked alpha responses. These findings are discussed in terms of functional significance of alpha band synchronization and desynchronization. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Arai, J; Natsume, K				Arai, J; Natsume, K			The properties of carbachol-induced beta oscillation in rat hippocampal slices	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						beta oscillation; theta-like activities; hippocampal slice; carbachol; bicuculline; frequency; modulation	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; INDUCED EEG-THETA; IN-VITRO; CHOLINERGIC INDUCTION; OLFACTORY-BULB; GUINEA-PIG; HZ BANDS; MODULATION; RHYTHMS; AREA	The rhythmical and pharmacological properties of carbachol-induced beta oscillation were Studied using rat hippocampal slices. With the application of 30 mu M carbachol, beta-range oscillations with frequencies of 13-20 Hz were recorded from the CA3 region. An AMPA receptor antagonist, CNQX, diminished the oscillations. An NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, significantly suppressed the pre-established beta oscillations. The pre-application of APV blocked the start of the carbachol-induced beta oscillations. When bicuculline (BIC), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, was applied to the pre-established beta oscillations, the frequency decreased to the theta-range. When 5 mu M BIC was applied with 30 mu M carbachol, the beta oscillations did not start; instead, theta-like activities were induced. It has been reported that carbachol in hippocampal slices can induce theta-like activities, which are not modulated by BIC, while BIC's facilitating the start of the activities. The results of the present study suggest that the GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory transmission modulates the beta oscillation and that the transmission is needed for the start process of the oscillations. Therefore, the start and generation mechanisms of carbachol-induced beta oscillation will be different from those of carbachol-induced theta-like activities.

Seizures were characterized by head turning to the left and clonic jerking of the left arm, suggesting a right frontal epileptogenic region. Interictal EEG showed occasional runs of independent nonlateralized slow activity in the delta band with right frontocentral dominance and had no lateralizing value. Ictal scalp EEG had no lateralizing value. Ictal scalp EEG suggested right-sided central slow activity preceding some seizures. Structural 3-T MRI showed no abnormality. There was no clear epileptiform abnormality during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We therefore modeled asymmetrical EEG delta activity at 1-3 Hz near frontocentral electrode positions. Significant blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the right superior frontal gyrus correlated with right frontal oscillations at 1-3 Hz but not at 4-7 Hz and with neither of the two frequency bands when derived from contralateral or posterior electrode positions, which served as controls. Motor fMRI activations with a finger-tapping paradigm were asymmetrical: they were more anterior for the left hand compared with the right and were near the aforementioned EEG-correlated signal changes. A right frontocentral perirolandic seizure onset was identified with a subdural grid recording, and electric stimulation of the adjacent contact produced motor responses in the left arm and after discharges. The fMRI localization of the left hand motor and the detected BOLD activation associated with modeled slow activity suggest a role for localization of the epileptogenic region with EEG-fMRI even in the absence of clear interictal discharges.

These reactions appeared in different cortical areas in response to differentiating signals under conditions of both adequate and erroneous responses. The EEG power of such reactions was several times lower as compared to responses to positive signals, mainly, at the expense of the frequencies in the band of 90-225 Hz (the power of which was higher than that of the traditional band of 1-30 Hz and the gamma band of 30-80 Hz). The frequency composition of EEG reactions accompanying adequate responses was defined, mainly, by discrete subgroups of high-frequency components. During erroneous responses, the discrete structure of the corresponding EEG reactions was broken.

Methods: Two groups of subjects, young (mean age 22.5 years) and older (mean age 58.3 years) were studied with a four-choice reaction time task. Response-related potentials (RRPs) to correct and error responses were decomposed by means of wavelet transform. Time-frequency (TF) components of correct and error responses were identified. Effects of aging were evaluated for the phase-locked TF power at FCz. Results: (1) Error-related potentials in both groups were characterized by phase-locked activity from the delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) frequency band that was error-specific and was significantly enhanced for errors. (2) In contrast to young adults, no pronounced phase-locked theta (4-7 Hz) RRP components were generated at FCz for either correct or error responses, nor did the theta power manifest any sensitivity to error processing in older subjects. Conclusion: In older subjects, RRPs at FCz do not contain a theta TF component, thus, demonstrating that the frequency content of error-related potentials changes with aging. A common error-specific delta component is present in the two age groups, but its reactivity is significantly reduced and delayed with aging. These qualitative and quantitative differences between young and older subjects may reflect a functional suppression of the underlying frontomedial structures involved in performance and movement monitoring.

Here, we investigated experience-dependent changes in daytime sleep EEG activity after declarative learning of unrelated word pairs. At weekly intervals, 13 young male volunteers spent three 24 h sessions in the laboratory under carefully controlled homeostatic and circadian conditions. At approximately midday, subjects performed either one of two word-pair learning tasks or a matched nonlearning control task, in a counterbalanced order. The two learning lists differed in the level of concreteness of the words used, resulting in an easier and a more difficult associative encoding condition, as confirmed by performance at immediate cued recall. Subjects were then allowed to sleep for 4 h; afterward, delayed cued recall was tested. Compared with the control condition, sleep EEG spectral activity in the low spindle frequency range and the density of low-frequency sleep spindles (11.25-13.75 Hz) were both significantly increased in the left frontal cortex after the difficult but not after the easy encoding condition. Furthermore, we found positive correlations between these EEG changes during sleep and changes in memory performance between pre-nap and post-nap recall sessions. These results indicate that, like during nocturnal sleep, daytime sleep EEG oscillations including spindle activity are modified after declarative learning of word pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that the nature of the learning material is a determinant factor for sleep-related alterations after declarative learning.

The utility of these neuroelectric measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric genetics is evaluated. Methods: This article reviews the main findings of EEG and ERP abnormalities in alcoholics, offspring of alcoholics at high risk to develop alcoholism and the electrophysiological effects of alcohol on high risk compared to low-risk offspring. It highlights findings using EROs, a fast developing tool in examining brain function and cognition. It also reviews evidence of genetic findings related to these electrophysiological measures and their relationship to clinical diagnosis. Results: Many of these abnormal neuroelectric measures are under genetic control, may precede the development of alcoholism, and may be markers of a predisposition toward the development of a spectrum of disinhibitory conditions including alcoholism. Genetic loci underlying some neuroelectic measures that involve neurotransmitter systems of the brain have been identified. Conclusions: Quantitative neuroelectric measures (EEG, ERPs, EROs) provide valuable endophenotypes in the study of genetic risk to develop alcoholism and related disorders. Significance: Genetic studies of neuroelectric endophenotypes offer a powerful strategy for identifying susceptibility genes for developing psychiatric disorders, and provide novel insights into etiological factors.

To investigate the role of the corpus callosum in interhemispheric EEG synchronization, coherence spectra were computed in mice with congenital callosal dysgenesis (131) under baseline conditions and after 6-h sleep deprivation, and compared with the spectra of a control strain (C57BL/6). In B1 mice coherence was lower than in controls in all vigilance states. The level of coherence in each of the three totally acallosal mice was lower than in the mice with only partial callosal dysgenesis. The difference between 131 and control mice was present over the entire 0.5-25 Hz frequency range in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep), and in all frequencies except for the high 8 and low 0 band (3-7 Hz) in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and waking. In control mice, sleep deprivation induced a rise of coherence in the A band of NREM sleep in the first 2 h of recovery. This effect was absent in Ell mice with total callosal dysgenesis and attenuated in mice with partial callosal dysgenesis. In both strains the effect of sleep deprivation dissipated within 4 h. The results show that EEG synchronization between the hemispheres in sleep and waking is mediated to a large part by the corpus callosum. This applies also to the functional changes induced by sleep deprivation in NREM sleep. In contrast, interhemispheric synchronisation of 0 oscillations in waking and REM sleep may be mediated by direct inter-hippocampal connections. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In our sensorimotor integration task, observers responded to a weak rectangular gray-level signal presented to their right eyes by pressing and releasing a button whenever they detected an increment followed by a decrement in brightness. Signal detection performance was optimized by presenting randomly-changing-graylevel noise separately to observers' left eyes using a mirror stereoscope. We measured brain electrical activity at the scalp by electroencephalograph (EEG), calculated the instantaneous phase for each EEG signal, and evaluated the degree of large-scale phase synchronization between pairs of EEG signals. Dynamic synchronization-desynchronization patterns were observed and we found evidence of noise-enhanced large-scale synchronization associated with detection of the brightness changes under conditions of noise-enhanced performance. Our results suggest that behavioral stochastic resonance might arise from noise-enhanced synchronization of neural activities across widespread brain regions.

During the expectancy of pain, concurrent cognitive demands were superimposed. The aim was to investigate the effects on primary sensorimotor and central midline areas of the competition among concurrent attentional processes related to cognition and pain expectancy, as indexed by behavioral performance and EEG data. A main issue was whether cognitive performance decreases, due to a re-allocation of attentional resources on primary sensorimotor and midline areas for the anticipation of pain. Behavioral results showed no differences in the cognitive (working memory) performance during the expectancy of nonpainful versus painful stimulations. In parallel, anticipatory event-related potentials (ERPs) were negligible in line with a low emotional reactivity/alertness as revealed by heart rate deceleration (HRD), skin conductance response (SCR), and low-band (6-10 Hz) alpha EEG oscillations. In contrast, high-band alpha EEG oscillations (10-12 Hz) over the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex decreased more during the expectancy of painful compared to nonpainful stimuli, in line with an increased anticipatory preparation of the somatosensory channel. These findings provide further evidence on the fact that attentional processes at the basis of cognition can be defended by the anticipation of pain, at least when the incoming painful stimuli are repetitive and predictable. This happens even if the brain increases preparatory processes of the specific sensory channel to be targeted by the painful stimulus. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Artefact-free epochs of spindle activation were selected from the electroencephalograms of opiate-dependent patients undergoing rapid opiate detoxification. Power spectral analysis and source localization using low-resolution-brain-electromagnetic-tomography (LORETA(Key)) were performed. Results: Sinusoidal rhythms with waxing and waning amplitudes appeared afte r propofol-induced narcosis but no direct correlations could be determined between individual dosage and characteristic spindle attributes. The power maximum stood midline over the cortical areas, especially around C,. We calculated a peak frequency of 14(+/- 1.2) Hz. Motor fields, particularly in the frontal, parietal, and various cingulate areas, were found to be the primary sources of spindle oscillations in the cortex. Conclusions: The frequent occurrence of these localized spindle sources demonstrates the preference for motor fields. Spindle oscillations observed during propofol-induced narcosis were similar in frequency and shape to those observed in natural sleep. Significance: The results lend support to models that postulate a close link between the motor system and the organization of behavior. In addition, spindle rhythms under propofol bore some resemblance to spindle types which occur during sleep. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In a lexical decision task, response times to words with high-frequency first syllables were longer than those to words with low-frequency first syllables and resulted in more negative event-related potentials (ERPs) in an early time window from 190 ms to 280 ms and in the N400 component. The onset of the observed first syllable-frequency effect was prior to the onset of the effect of lexicality (i.e., the first reliable differentiation in ERP waveforms in response to words and pseudowords, a potential marker of lexical access). The present study's results support Barber et al.'s [Neuroreport 15 (2004) 545] notion of the prelexical nature of the first syllable-frequency effect by (A) providing evidence for electrophysiological correlates of first syllable-frequency in another, non-Romance orthography (i.e., German), (B) relating the onset of the first syllable-frequency effect to the onset of the lexicality effect and (C) strengthening this pattern of results by means of a novel item-based analysis of ERP data. Implications of the prelexical nature of the inhibitory first syllable-frequency effect for computational models of reading, specifically for Ans et al.'s [Psychol.

Specifically, the debate lies in whether ERPs arise due to the contribution of a fixed-polarity and fixed-latency superimposed neuronal activity to background electroencephalographic oscillations (evoked model) and/or due to a partial phase synchronization of the ongoing EEG (oscillatory model). The participation of the two mechanisms can be explored by the spectral power modulation and phase coherence of scalp EEG rhythms, respectively. However, an important limitation underlies their measurement: the fact that ail added neural activity will be relatively phase-locked to stimulus, thus enhancing both spectral power and phase synchrony measures and making the contribution of each mechanism less clear-cut. This would not be relevant in the case that an increase in phase concentration was not accompanied by any concurrent spectral power modulation, thus opening the way to an oscillatory-based explanation. We computed event-related spectral power modulations and phase coherence to an auditory repeated-stimulus presentation paradigm with tone intensity far from threshold (90 dB SPL), in which N1 decreases its amplitude (N1 gating) as an attenuation brain process. Our data indicate that evoked and oscillatory activity could contribute together to the non-attenuated NI, while NI to repeated stimuli could be explained by partial phase concentration of scalp EEG activity without concurrent power increase. Therefore, our results show that both increased spectral power and partial phase resetting contribute differentially to different ERPs. Moreover, they show that certain ERPs could arise through reorganization of the phase of ongoing scalp EEG activity only. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It has been assumed that this decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep consolidation reflects an age-related attenuation of the sleep homeostatic drive. To test this hypothesis, we measured sleep EEG characteristics (i.e., SWA, sleep spindles) in healthy older volunteers in response to high (sleep deprivation protocol) and low sleep pressure (nap protocol) conditions. Despite the fact that the older volunteers had impaired sleep consolidation and reduced SWA levels, their relative SWA response to both high and low sleep pressure conditions was similar to that of younger persons. Only in frontal brain regions did we find an age-related diminished SWA response to high sleep pressure. On the other hand, we have clear evidence that the circadian regulation of sleep during the 40 h nap protocol was changed such that the circadian arousal signal in the evening was weaker in the older study participants. More sleep occurred during the wake maintenance zone, and subjective sleepiness ratings in the late afternoon and evening were higher than in younger participants. In addition, we found a diminished melatonin secretion and a reduced circadian modulation of REM sleep and spindle frequency-the latter was phase-advanced relative to the circadian melatonin profile. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that age-related changes in sleep are due to weaker circadian regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Our data suggest that manipulations of the circadian timing system, rather than the sleep homeostat, may offer a potential strategy to alleviate age-related decrements in sleep and daytime alertness levels.

This characteristic has been associated with corresponding differences in circadian sleep propensity. In this study, quantitative analysis of the sleep EEG in antero-posterior derivations was used to test the hypothesis that morning and evening types differ not only in the circadian aspect of sleep regulation but also in the homeostatic aspect. Morning types and evening types (six men and six women per group, aged 19-34 years) were selected using the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. They were studied by polysomnography according to their preferred sleep schedule. Spectral activity in four midline derivations (Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz) was calculated separately in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In NREM sleep, morning types showed a steeper decrease of slow-wave activity (SWA; 1-5 Hz) per sleep cycle in the fronto-central derivations and a steeper increase in 13-14 Hz activity in the parieto-occipital derivations than did evening types. Nonlinear regression analysis revealed that the exponential decay rate of relative values of SWA in NREM sleep was faster in morning than evening types, in the frontal derivation. In REM sleep, morning types showed a steeper decrease of high sigma (14-16 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) activities across the night in centro-parietal derivations than did evening types. These results show for the first time a clear difference between morning types and evening types in homeostatic sleep regulation.

J	Thatcher, RW; North, D; Biver, C				Thatcher, RW; North, D; Biver, C			EEG and intelligence: Relations between EEG coherence, EEG phase delay and power	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						qEEG; coherence; phase delays; intelligence; IQ	PARAMETERS; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; IQ	Objective: There are two inter-related categories of EEG measurement: 1, EEG currents or power and; 2, EEG network properties such as coherence and phase delays. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of these two different categories of EEG measurement to predict performance on the Weschler Intelligence test (WISC-R). Methods: Resting eyes closed EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations with a linked ears reference from 442 subjects aged 5-52 years. The Weschler Intelligence test was administered to the same subjects but not while the EEG was recorded. Subjects were divided into high IQ ( >= 120) and low IQ ( <= 90) groups. EEG variables at P < .05 were entered into a factor analysis and then the single highest loading variable on each factor was entered into a discriminant analysis where groups were high IQ vs. low.Q. Results: Discriminant analysis of high vs. low IQ was 92.81 - 97.14% accurate. Discriminant scores of intermediate IQ subjects (i.e. 90 < IQ < 120) were intermediate between the high and low IQ groups. Linear regression predictions of IQ significantly correlated with the discriminant scores (r = 0.818 - 0.825, p < 10-6). The ranking of effect size was EEG phase > EEG coherence > EEG amplitude asymmetry > absolute power > relative power and power ratios. The strongest correlations to IQ were short EEG phase delays in the frontal lobes and long phase delays in the posterior cortical regions, reduced coherence and increased absolute power. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with increased neural efficiency and increased brain complexity as positively related to intelligence, and with frontal lobe synchronization of neural resources as a significant contributing factor to EEG and intelligence correlations. Significance: Quantitative EEG predictions of intelligence provide medium to strong effect size estimates of cognitive functioning while simultaneously revealing a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of intelligence.

J	Rattenborg, NC				Rattenborg, NC			Evolution of slow-wave sleep and palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds: A hypothesis	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Review						slow oscillation; slow-wave; synaptic homeostasis; neocortex; hyperpallium; dorsal cortex	PIGEON COLUMBA-LIVIA; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; LIZARD CTENOSAURA-PECTINATA; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; CHICKEN GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; AVIAN AUDITORY THALAMUS; SEROTONIN NEURON SYSTEM; TURTLE VISUAL-CORTEX; GEOCHELONE-CARBONARIA; GENE-EXPRESSION	Mammals and birds are the only animals that exhibit rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS). Whereas the electroencephalogram (EEG) during REM sleep resembles the low-amplitude, high-frequency EEG of wakefulness, the EEG during SWS displays high-amplitude, slow-waves (1-4 Hz). The absence of similar slow-waves (SWs) in sleeping reptiles suggests that the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological traits necessary for the genesis of SWs evolved independently in the mammalian and avian ancestors. Advances in our understanding of comparative neuroanatomy and the genesis of mammalian SWs suggest that the absence of SWs in reptiles is due to limited connectivity within the pallium, the dorsal portion of the telencephalon that includes the mammalian neocortex, reptilian dorsal cortex and avian Wulst (hyperpallium), as well as the dorsal ventricular ridge in birds and reptiles and the mammalian claustrum and pallial amygdala. In mammals, the slow oscillation (< 1 Hz) of cortical neurons acts through reciprocal corticothalamic loops and corticocortical connections to synchronize the 1-4 Hz activity of thalamocortical neurons in a manner sufficient to generate SWs detectable in the EEG. Given the role that corticocortical (or palliopallial) connections play in the genesis of SWs in mammals, the degree of palliopallial connectivity might explain why birds show SWs and reptiles do not. Indeed, whereas the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium show extensive palliopallial connectivity, the reptilian pallium exhibits limited intrapallial connections. I thus propose that the evolution of SWs is linked to the independent evolution of extensive palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds. As suggested by experiments functionally linking SWs to performance enhancements, the palliopallial connections that give rise to SWs might also depend on SWs to maintain their efficacy.

This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.

EEG theta rhythm in infants and preschool children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; development; theta rhythm; sensorimotor rhythm; attention; emotions	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FOCAL ATTENTION; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA	Objective: To study behavioral correlates of theta oscillations in infants and preschool children. Methods: EEG was recorded during baseline (visual attention) and two test conditions-exploration of toys and attention to 'social' stimulation. Age specific frequency boundaries of theta and mu rhythms were assessed using narrow bin analysis of EEG spectra. Results: Theta spectral power increased whereas mu power decreased under test conditions in both age groups. In preschoolers theta rhythm increased predominantly over anterior regions during exploratory behavior and over posterior regions during attention to social stimulation. Theta frequency range changed with age from 3.6 to 5.6 Hz in infants to 4-8 Hz in children, and mu range from 6.4-8.4 Hz to 8.4-10.4 Hz. Conclusions: In early life, theta oscillations are strongly related to behavioral states with substantial attentional and emotional load. The scalp distribution of theta spectral power depends on age and behavioral condition and may reflect engagement of different brain networks in control of behavior. Significance: The findings contribute to the scanty knowledge about the developmental course of theta rhythm. Data on behavioral correlates of theta rhythm in early life may improve our understanding of cognitive and mental processes in healthy and neuropsychiatrically diseased children.

Analytic amplitude	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analytic amplitude; gamma EEG oscillations; Hilbert transform; information; order parameter; stability; synchrony	NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; OLFACTORY EEG; MULTICORTICAL PATTERNS; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; GAMMA EEGS; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS	Objective: To explain the neural mechanisms of spontaneous EEG by measuring the spatiotemporal patterns of synchrony among betagamma oscillations during perception. Methods: EEGs were measured from 8 X 8 (5.6 X 5.6 mm(2)) arrays fixed on the surfaces of primary sensory areas in rabbits that were trained to discriminate visual, auditory or tactile conditioned stimuli (CSs) eliciting conditioned responses (CRs). EEG preprocessing was by (i) bandpass filtering to extract the beta-gamma range (deleting theta-alpha); (ii) low-pass spatial filtering (not high-pass Laplacians used for localization), (iii) spatial averaging (not time averaging used for evoked potentials), and (iv) close spacing of 64 electrodes for simultaneous recording in each area (not sampling single signals from several areas); (v) novel algorithms were devised to measure synchrony and spatial pattern stability by calculating variances among patterns in 64-space derived from the 8 X 8 arrays (not by fitting equivalent dipoles). These methodological differences are crucial for the proposed new perspective on EEG. Results: Spatial patterns of beta-gamma EEG emerged following sudden jumps in cortical activity called 'state transitions'. Each transition began with an abrupt phase re-setting to a new value on every channel, followed sequentially by re-synchronization, spatial pattern stabilization, and a dramatic increase in pattern amplitude. State transitions recurred at varying intervals in the theta range. A novel parameter was devised to estimate the perceptual information in the beta-gamma EEG, which disclosed 2 - 4 patterns with high information content in the CS-CR interval on each trial; each began with a state transition and lasted similar to 0.1 s. Conclusions: The function of each primary sensory neocortex was discontinuous; discrete spatial patterns occurred in frames like those in cinema. The frames before and after the CS-CR interval had low content. Significance: Derivation and interpretation of unit data in studies of perception might benefit from using multichannel EEG recordings to define distinctive epochs that are demarcated by state transitions of neocortical dynamics in the CS-CR intervals, particularly in consideration of the possibility that EEG may reveal recurring episodes of exchange and sharing of perceptual information among multiple sensory cortices. Simultaneously recorded, multichannel beta-gamma EEG might assist in the interpretation of images derived by fMRI, since high beta-gamma EEG amplitudes imply high rates of energy utilization. The spatial pattern intermittency provides a tag to distinguish gamma bursts from contaminating EMG activity in scalp recording in order to establish beta-gamma recording as a standard clinical tool. Finally, EEG cannot fail to have a major impact on brain theory. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, sleep spindles were regarded as AM-FM signals modeled by six parameters. The instantaneous envelope (IE) and instantaneous frequency (IF) waveforms were estimated using four different methods, namely Hilbert Transform (HT), Complex Demodulation (CD), Wavelet Transform (WT) and Matching Pursuit (NIP). The six model parameters were subsequently estimated from the IE and IF waveforms. The average error, taking into account the error for each model parameter, was lowest for HT, higher but still less than 10% for CD and MP, and highest (greater than 10%) for WT, for three different spindle model examples. The amount of distortion induced by the use of a given method is also important; distortion was the greatest (0.4 see) in the case of HT. Therefore, in the case of real spindles, one could utilize CD and MP and, if the spindle duration is more than 1 sec, HT as well.

Here we show that the cannabinoids Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and CP55940 decreased the power of theta, gamma and ripple oscillations in the hippocampus of head-restrained and freely moving rats. These effects were blocked by a CB1 antagonist. The decrease in theta power correlated with memory impairment in a hippocampus-dependent task. By simultaneously recording from large populations of single units, we found that CP55940 severely disrupted the temporal coordination of cell assemblies in short time windows (< 100 ms) yet only marginally affected population firing rates of pyramidal cells and interneurons. The decreased power of local field potential oscillations correlated with reduced temporal synchrony but not with firing rate changes. We hypothesize that reduced spike timing coordination and the associated impairment of physiological oscillations are responsible for cannabinoid-induced memory deficits.

A cinematographic hypothesis of cortical dynamics in perception	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						beta-gamma EEG oscillations; cinematographic brain dynamics; chaotic itinerancy; field theory; phase transitions; pragmatic information; spatial EEG patterns	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; MULTICORTICAL PATTERNS; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; OLFACTORY EEG; GAMMA EEGS; SCALP EEG; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION	The aim of this study was to measure and classify spatial patterns in sensory cortical EEGs relating to conditioned stimuli (CSs) in order to test the hypothesis, based on clinical reports, that cortical dynamics is not continuous but operates in steps that resemble frames in a cinema. Recent advances in the application of the Hilbert Transform to intracranial recordings of the EEG in animals have revealed markers for repetitive phase transitions in neocortex at frame rates in the theta band. The frames were sought in multichannel EEGs that had been recorded from 8 x 8 high-density arrays that were fixed on primary sensory cortices of rabbits trained to discriminate visual, auditory or somatic conditioned stimuli with reinforcement (CS+) or without (CS-). Localization of frames in EEGs was by use of a new index, H-e(t), called "pragmatic information". Each spatial pattern was represented by a feature vector from the 64 analytic amplitudes at a maximal value of HQ) from the Hilbert transform and expressed as a 64 x 1 feature vector specifying a point in 64-space. Classification with respect to CS+/- was by calculation of Euclidean distances of points from centers of gravity of clusters after preprocessing by nonlinear mapping. Stable spatial patterns were found in the form of amplitude modulation (AM) of aperiodic waveforms that included all channels. The impact of a CS on a sensory neocortex reorganized background EEG into two types of sequential patterns of coordinated activity, initially local and modality-specific, later global. The initial stage of phase transitions required 3-7 ms. Large-scale cortical activity then reorganized itself repeatedly and reliably over relatively immense cortical distances within the cycle duration of the center frequency of oscillation. The size, texture, timing, and duration of the AM patterns support the hypothesis that these frames may provide the basis for multisensory percepts (Gestalts). (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Slow-waves in the olfactory system: an olfactory perspective on cortical rhythms	TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; NETWORK MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; SLEEP; NEURONS; EEG; CAT; FREQUENCY	Over the past few years, it has become clear that oscillatory dynamics of cortical networks are closely involved in sensory coding, attention, memory and sleep. Although most experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the neocortex, we believe that progress in understanding cortical oscillations can be advanced by also considering the olfactory system which shares many basic properties with the neocortex and shows similar oscillatory patterns. Besides offering the advantage of a greater experimental tractability, the olfactory cortex might prove to be instrumental in uncovering general functional principles of neocortical oscillations, by virtue of the potentially important role of olfaction during neocortical evolution. In this article, we illustrate how such an evolution-based comparative approach can provide novel insights into neocortical slow-wave sleep oscillations and their relationship to respiration.

The proposed technique is based on the analysis of a single-channel (frontal) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The wavelet coefficients calculated from the EEG are pooled into a statistical representation, which is then compared to two well-defined states: the awake state with normal EEG activity, and the isoelectric state with maximal cortical depression. The resulting index, referred to as the wavelet-based anesthetic value for central nervous system monitoring (WAV(CNS)), quantifies the depth of consciousness between these two extremes. To validate the proposed technique, we present a clinical study which explores the advantages of the WAV(CNS) in comparison with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), currently a reference in consciousness monitoring. Results show that the WAV(CNS) and BIS are well correlated (r = 0.969) during periods of steady-state despite fundamental algorithmic differences. However, in terms of dynamic behavior, the WAV(CNS) offers faster tracking of transitory changes at induction and emergence, with an average lead of 15-30 s. Furthermore, and conversely to the BIS, the WAV(CNS) regains its preinduction baseline value when patients are responding to verbal command after emergence from anesthesia. We conclude that the proposed analysis technique is an attractive alternative to BIS monitoring. In addition, we show that the WAV(CNS) dynamics can be modeled as a linear time invariant transfer function. This index is, therefore, well suited for use as a feedback sensor in advisory systems, closed-loop control schemes, and for the identification of the pharmacodynamic models of anesthetic drugs.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed from EEG recordings during two conditions (memory and control). Timing and source localization of different generators taking part in visual information processing and short-term memory encoding were estimated. The main generators of P I, NI, and P2 event-related potentials were estimated in the primary visual, lateral occipital and posterior temporal, and medial parietal regions of the cortex. Furthermore, from later ERP's related to encoding of stimuli in memory, subsequent activations were estimated in anterior regions of the left temporal and frontal cortex between 300 and 450 ms. Definition of few most activated areas in these simple tasks (source localization was obtained from distributed and dipolar fitting inverse solutions) could be used in construction of simple, relatively reliable brain source models. Based on these multiple source models, applying weighted linear inverse filters to the continuous data, useful source signals could be extracted for time-frequency, event-related (de)synchronization and coherence analysis. The observed event-related theta frequency synchronizations and alpha frequency desynchronizations were related to stimulus encoding. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Also analyzed were changes of visual evoked potentials (VEP) with DBS on and off. Methods: Eleven patients with advanced PD treated with bilateral DBS STN were examined after an overnight withdrawal of L-DOPA and 2 h after switching off the neurostimulators. All underwent clinical examination followed by resting EEG and VEP recordings, a procedure repeated after DBS STN was switched on. Results: With DBS switched on, the dominant EEG frequency increased from 9.44 +/- 1.3 to 9.71 +/- 1.3 Hz (P < 0.01) while its relative spectral power dropped by 11% on average (P < 0.05). Switching on the neurostimulators caused a decrease in the N70/P100 amplitude of the VEP (P < 0.01), which inversely correlated with the intensity of DBS (black-and-white pattern: P < 0.01; color pattern: P < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite artifacts generated by neurostimulators, the VEP and resting EEG were suitable for the detection of effects related to DBS STN. The acceleration of dominant frequency in the alpha band may be evidence of DBS STN influence on speeding up of intracortical oscillations. The spectral power decrease, seen mainly in the fronto-central region, might reflect a desynchronization in the premotor and motor circuits, though no movement was executed. Similarly, desynchronization of the cortical activity recorded posteriorly may by responsible for the VEP amplitude decrease implying DBS STN-related influence even on the visual system. Significance: Changes in idling EEG activity observed diffusely over scalp together with involvement of the VEP suggest that the effects of DBS STN reach far beyond the motor system influencing the basic mechanisms of rhythmic cortical oscillations.

Characterization of weak coupling between self-oscillation systems from short time series: Technique and applications	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG	A technique is developed for characterizing the coupling of self-oscillation systems from observable signals ( time series). The technique is based on the empirical modeling of phase dynamics in such systems and extended to the case of short time series and high noise levels. Corrections to the conventional estimates are introduced to eliminate their systematic errors, and formulas for the confidence intervals are derived. The effectiveness and applicability of the technique are demonstrated by numerical experiments and examples from neurophysiology and climatology: an increased influence of the pathological focus on adjacent brain regions is detected in the intracranial electroencephalograms of a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy as a precursor of a seizure, and the influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon on the North Atlantic Oscillation is revealed from the records of the climate indexes ( sea-surface temperature and atmospheric pressure).

J	Bernat, EM; Williams, WJ; Gehring, WJ				Bernat, EM; Williams, WJ; Gehring, WJ			Decomposing ERP time-frequency energy using PCA	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						time-frequency; wavelet; ERP; decomposition; method	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; DISTRIBUTIONS; EEG; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; AWAKE	Objective: Time-frequency transforms (TFTs) offer rich representations of event-related potential (ERP) activity, and thus add complexity. Data reduction techniques for TFTs have been slow to develop beyond time analysis of detail functions from wavelet transforms. Cohen's class of TFTs based on the reduced interference distribution (RID) offer some benefits over wavelet TFTs, but do not offer the simplicity of detail functions from wavelet decomposition. The objective of the current approach is a data reduction method to extract succinct and meaningful events from both RID and wavelet TFTs. Methods: A general energy-based principal components analysis (PCA) approach to reducing TFTs is detailed. TFT surfaces are first restructured into vectors, recasting the data as a two-dimensional matrix amenable to PCA. PCA decomposition is performed on the two-dimensional matrix, and surfaces are then reconstructed. The PCA decomposition method is conducted with RID and Morlet wavelet TFTs, as well as with PCA for time and frequency domains separately. Results: Three simulated datasets were decomposed. These included Gabor logons and chirped signals. All simulated events were appropriately extracted from the TFTs using both wavelet and RID TFTs. Varying levels of noise were then added to the simulated data, as well as a simulated condition difference. The PCA-TFT method, particularly when used with RID TFTs, appropriately extracted the components and detected condition differences for signals where time or frequency domain analysis alone failed. Response-locked ERP data from a reaction time experiment was also decomposed. Meaningful components representing distinct neurophysiological activity were extracted from the ERP TFT data, including the error-related negativity (ERN). Conclusions: Effective TFT data reduction was achieved. Activity that overlapped in time, frequency, and topography were effectively separated and extracted. Methodological issues involved in the application of PCA to TFTs are detailed, and directions for further development are discussed. Significance: The reported decomposition method represents a natural but significant extension of PCA into the TFT domain from the time and frequency domains alone. Evaluation of many aspects of this extension could now be conducted, using the PCA-TFT decomposition as a basis.

As a case study, the dynamics of heart rate variability during an orthostatic test is examined. In this method, the non-stationary signal is first modelled with a time-varying autoregressive model and the model parameters are estimated recursively with a Kalman smoother algorithm. The benefit of using the Kalman smoother is that the lag error present in a Kalman filter, as well as in all other adaptive filters, can be avoided. The spectrum estimates for each time instant are then obtained from the estimated model parameters. Statistics of the obtained spectrum estimates are derived using the error propagation principle. The obtained spectrum estimates can further be decomposed into separate components and, thus, the time variation of low- and high-frequency components of heart rate variability can be examined separately. By using the presented method, high resolution time-varying spectrum estimates with no lag error can be produced. Other benefits of the method are the straightforward procedure for evaluating the statistics of the spectrum estimates and the option of spectral decomposition.

These reactions were observed in different areas of the cortex during selective attention in response to positive conditioned stimuli. They immediately preceded strong blow with a paw on the pedal of feeding cup and taking the reward. The EEG power at these moments was 1.5-3 times higher than the baseline EEG power level in a prestimulus period. The high-frequency structure of corresponding EEG reactions comprised discrete individual spectral peaks both in traditional (1-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) ranges and higher-frequency components (80-200 Hz) as well. In some cases, the higher-frequency components (80-200 Hz) were most pronounced.

Gender differences in the EEG spatial parameters under study (linear spatial synchronization in the brain cortex, nonlinear spatial disorder, EEG coherence, and spectral power) were shown to be markedly less pronounced between the control groups (68 women and 85 men) than between the alcohol addicts. The obtained data allow us to explain the known fact of more serious and "malignant" character of alcoholism in women than in men in terms of neurophysiology. In alcoholics, the synchronization of low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta) was higher, whereas the synchronization of the higher-frequency spectrum part (betal and beta2) was lower in women than in men. This fact can be a neurophysiological basis of more progredient inhibitory-degenerative processes in women.

The distinct non-phase-locked gamma response was obtained in characteristic time window (200-400 ms) with clear-cut centro-parietal location. The strong coincidence between induced gamma oscillations and saccadic eye movements was revealed. We suggest that saccade-related gamma increase is another manifestation of the phenomenon known as presaccadic spike potential, which is commonly registered over parietal scalp leads at 10-20 ms prior to saccade onset. It is hypothesized that late non-phase-locked gamma synchronization mainly reflects activity of a system responsible for attentional tuning and motor planning/execution of saccadic eye movements.

They were instructed to shift their attention to either the left or right visual hemifield according to a cue, which could be valid or invalid. Thereafter, a peripheral target had to be evaluated. At posterior parietal brain areas early components of the event-related potential (P1 and N1) were higher when the cue had been valid compared with invalid. An anticipatory attention effect was found in EEG alpha magnitude at parieto-occipital electrode sites. Starting 200 ms before target onset alpha amplitudes were significantly stronger suppressed at sites contralateral to the attended visual hemifield than ipsilateral to it. In addition, phase coupling between prefrontal and posterior parietal electrode sites was calculated. It was found that prefrontal cortex shows stronger phase coupling with posterior sites that are contralateral to the attended hemifield than ipsilateral sites. The results suggest that a shift of attention selectively modulates excitability of the contralateral posterior parietal cortex and that this posterior modulation of alpha activity is controlled by prefrontal regions.

The sounds may often physically stand out from one another in their conjoined rather than simple features. This poses a particular challenge for the brain to detect which of these sounds are rare and, therefore, potentially important for survival. We recorded gamma-band (32-40 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations from the scalp of adult humans who passively listened to a repeated tone carrying frequent and rare conjunctions of its frequency and intensity. EEG oscillations that this tone induced, rather than evoked, differed in amplitude between the two conjunction types within the 56-ms analysis window from tone onset. Our finding suggests that, perhaps with the support of its non-phase-locked synchrony in the gamma band, the human brain is able to detect rare sounds as feature conjunctions very rapidly.

We tested whether age-related changes in sleep are a consequence of a weaker circadian arousal signal in the evening. Circadian rhythms and spectral components of the sleep EEG were investigated in 17 young (20-31 year) and 15 older (57-74 year) volunteers under constant posture conditions during a 40-h nap protocol (75/150 min sleep/wake schedule). Quantitative evidence for a weaker circadian arousal signal in aging arose from significantly more sleep occurring during the wake maintenance zone and higher subjective sleepiness ratings in the late afternoon and evening in the older group. In addition, we found a diminished melatonin secretion and a reduced circadian modulation of REM sleep together with less pronounced day-night differences in the lower alpha and spindle range of sleep EEG activity in the older group. Thus, our data indicate that age-related changes in sleep propensity are clearly related to a reduced circadian signal opposing the homeostatic drive for sleep. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and methods: Twenty patients, 10 with UARS and 10 with mild OSAS, were studied. A nocturnal polysomnogram was performed including measurement of respiratory variables and pulse transit time (PTT). According to the presence or absence of a PTT event indicative of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation, 148 events were extracted after having been randomly chosen in each represented sleep stage, with or without an electroencephalogram (EEG) arousal > 1.5 s. RR interval (RRI) in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, as well as heart rate variability, was calculated during 60 and 120 s, respectively. Period amplitude analysis (PAA) was applied for RR-interval analysis, and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was applied to perform HR variability analysis. Results: Visually scored EEG arousal was significantly associated with an increase in sympathetic index of heart rate, while PTT was associated with a drop in parasympathetic index, after the respiratory events. Patients with mild OSAS presented persistently shorter RRI when compared to patients with UARS. The latter also exhibited a significant decrease in parasympathetic index (High Frequency (HF)) at the termination of a respiratory event. Conclusion: The HF component was only significantly decreased in patients with UARS, which indicates a predominant involvement of the parasympathetic tone in patients with UARS in comparison to those with OSAS.

Working memory tasks are known to change functional connectivity, but it is unknown whether this increases the differences between AD, MCI and healthy controls. Our objective was to investigate the behavior of synchronization likelihood of multichannel EEG in AD, MCI and cognitively healthy controls, both at rest and during a working memory task. Methods: EEGs (200 Hz sample frequency, 21 channels, average reference) were recorded at rest as well as during a visual working memory task in 14 patients with AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (mean age 76.4; SD 13.6), 11 patients with MCI according to the criteria of Petersen (mean age 78.4; SD 6.4) and 14 with subjective memory complaints but no demonstrable memory disturbance (mean age 61.6; SD 26.6). The synchronization likelihood was computed over 19 channels, comparing each channel with all the other channels for the 0.5-4, 4-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12-30, 30-50 Hz frequency bands. Results: The synchronization likelihood was significantly decreased in the upper alpha (10-12) and beta (12-30) bands in AD compared to persons with subjective memory complaints. The working memory task scores strongly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. During the working memory task the synchronization likelihood was significantly higher in MCI compared to the control subjects in the lower alpha band (8 - 10 Hz). Conclusions: Decrease of beta band synchronization occurs in mild AD, both in a resting condition and during a working memory task. Significance: Decrease of beta band synchronization in mild AD is a robust finding. The present study confirms our findings in a different cohort of patients, using alternative frequency bands. The diagnostic value of the synchronization likelihood in AD and MCI needs to be further established. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The time-varying parameter estimation problem is solved by Kalman filtering along with a fixed-interval smoothing procedure. Kalman filter is an optimal filter in the mean square sense and it is a generalization of other adaptive filters such as recursive least squares or least mean square. Furthermore, by using the smoother the unavoidable tracking lag of adaptive filters can be avoided. Due to the properties of Kalman filter and benefits of the smoothing the time-frequency resolution of the presented Kalman smoother spectra is extremely high. The presented approach is applied to estimation of event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) dynamics of occipital alpha rhythm measured from three healthy subjects. With the Kalman smoother approach detailed spectral information can be extracted from single ERS/ERD samples.

The theory is based on principles according to which brain functions are represented by the oscillatory activity. Oscillatory activity in a given frequency band performs multiple functions since they vary on a number of response parameters. There is selective cooperation in the stimulated brain; this produces super-binding between neural populations and super-synergy in the whole brain. The concept of super-synergy thus includes super-binding and, additionally, entropy and the role of EEG-oscillations as control parameters in brain's responsiveness. In super-synergy, spatial integration occurs through the selective cooperation of brain structures. Temporal integration occurs in line with the principle of superposition of oscillations in which the comparative polarity and phase angle are critical for forming the function-specific configurations. Extension of the theory of whole-brain-work to cognitive processing proposes that there is a constant reciprocal activation within the subprocesses of attention, perception learning and remembering and this leads to an APLR-alliance. In such a context, all brain functions are inseparable, for instance, from memory function and, in turn, memory states have no exact boundaries along the time space; memory states thus evolve in the APLR-alliance. The theory claims that the reentry and the dynamic behavior of oscillations during the reciprocal activation in APLR-alliance are among the causal factors for brain dynamics and for cognition.

In the first part of this paper, basic information about analysis of such multichannel biomedical data is given. A short overview of important differences between single-channel, two-channel and multichannel data sets is presented and various coherence functions are reported. Causal relations between channels are investigated by means of the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and its dynamic version, the Short-Time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF). The introduced fort-nalisin was used to analyze 12-channel human electrocorticogram (ECoG) records. Preliminary results of a study of causal dependence in beta and gamma frequency bands in two patients performing a motor task are reported. Specific characteristics in activity propagation consistent for both subjects for different rhythms were found.

Twenty tonic-clonic secondary generalized epileptic records pertaining to eight patients have been analyzed. If the electromyographic activity is excluded the difference between the ictal and pre-ictal mean entropic values (DeltaH = (H-(ictal)) - (H(pre-ictal))) is negative in 95% of the cases (p<0.0001), and the mean complexity variation (DeltaC(W)((ictal))) - (C-W((pre-ictal)))) is positive in 85% of the cases (p = 0.0002). Thus during the seizure entropy diminishes while complexity grows. This is construed as evidence supporting the conjecture that an epileptic focus in this kind of seizures triggers a self-organized brain state (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Measurement of phase gradients in the EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						electroencephalogram; brain dynamics; phase gradient; auditory oddball; spatio-temporal waves	TRAVELING-WAVES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; THETA; NETWORKS; NUMBER; CORTEX	Previous research has shown that spatio-temporal waves in the EEG are generally of long spatial wavelength and form smooth patterns of phase gradients at particular time-samples. This paper describes a method to measure smooth phase gradients of long spatial wavelength in the EEG. The method depends on the global pattern of phase at a given frequency and time and is therefore robust to variations, over time, in phase-lag between particular sites. Phases were estimated in the EEG signal using wavelet or short time-series Fourier methods. During an auditory oddball task, phases across the scalp tend to fall within a limited circular range, a range that is not indicative of phase-synchrony nor waves with multiple periods. At times the phases tended to maintain a spatially and temporally ordered relationship. The relative phases were analysed using three phase gradient basis functions, providing a measure of the amount of variance explained, across the electrodes, by smooth changes in relative phase from a single minimum or single maximum. The data from 586 adult subjects were analysed and it was found that the probability of phase gradient events varies with time and frequency in the stimulus-locked average, and with task demands. The temporal extent of spatio-temporal waves was measured by detecting smoothly changing patterns of phase latencies across the scalp. The specific spatial pattern and timing of phase gradients correspond closely to the latency distributions of certain ERPs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG/MEG-based imaging studies have mostly relied on settings of evoked nociception. We report here the spontaneous presence of enhanced activations in the pain matrix of the patient group on the basis of continuous EEG and functional Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from 16 chronic neurogenic pain patients and 16 healthy controls. These overactivations occurred predominantly within the high theta (6-9 Hz) and low beta frequency ranges (12-16 Hz). Theta and beta overactivations were localized to multiple pain-associated areas, primarily to insular (IC), anterior cingulate (ACC), prefrontal, and inferior posterior parietal cortices, as well as to primary (SI), secondary (S2), and supplementary somatosensory (SSA) cortices. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT), we followed a subgroup of 6 patients. Twelve months after surgery, activation in cingulate and insular cortices was significantly reduced. The presence of rhythmic processes in multiple, partially overlapping areas of the cortical pain matrix concur with the concept of thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) that predicts increased thalamocortical low and high frequency oscillations ensuing from thalamic desactivation. These spontaneous, ongoing, frequency-specific overactivations may therefore serve as an anatomo-physiological hallmark of the processes underlying chronic neurogenic pain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These changes can be recorded through electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's disease in the time interval between the surgery and the internalization of the connections to the batteries. Both baseline activity and movement-related changes are different in the 'on' and 'off' medication motor states. In the 'off' state a low frequency activity in the alpha-beta range (8-25 Hz) that dominates the spectrum is interrupted during the movement, while in the 'on' state baseline frequencies are higher and a peri-movement gamma increase (70-80 Hz) is usually observed. Similar changes have been described with electrocorticographic recordings over the primary motor cortex but the gamma increase was only present during contralateral movements. We compared ipsi- and contralateral movement-related changes in STN activity, using a time-frequency analysis of the recordings obtained simultaneously in both STN and the scalp (electroencephalography) during right and left hand movements. The movement-related changes observed in the STN in the 'on' and the 'off' states were similar to those described previously in terms of predominant frequency bands, but we found bilateral changes in the STN during movements of either hand. A contralateral earlier start of the beta STN changes was mostly observed when the moving hand corresponded to the less-affected side, irrespective of hand dominance. These results suggest that movement-related activity in the STN has, by and large, a bilateral representation and probably reflects cortical input.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of a prospective on-line real-time seizure prediction algorithm in two patients from a common database. Methods: We previously demonstrated that measures of chaos and angular frequency, estimated from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded at critical sites in the cerebral cortex, progressively converge (i.e. become dynamically entrained) as the epileptic brain transits from the asymptomatic interictal state to the ictal state (seizure) (Iasemidis et al., 2001, 2002a, 2003a). This observation suggested the possibility of developing algorithms to predict seizures well ahead of their occurrences. One of the central points in those investigations was the application of optimization theory, specifically quadratic zero-one programming, for the selection of the critical cortical sites. This current study combines that observation with a dynamical entrainment detection method to prospectively predict epileptic seizures. The algorithm was tested in two patients with long-term (107.54 h) and multi-seizure EEG data B and C (Lehnertz and Litt, 2004). Results: Analysis from the 2 test patients resulted in the prediction of up to 91.3% of the impending 23 seizures, about 89 +/- 15 min prior to seizure onset, with an average false warning rate of one every 8.27 h and an allowable prediction horizon of 3 h. Conclusions: The algorithm provides warning of impending seizures prospectively and in real time, that is, it constitutes an on-line and real-time seizure prediction scheme. Significance: These results suggest that the proposed seizure prediction algorithm could be used in novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications in epileptic patients.

Two areas known to play a key role in visual object processing: the lateral occipital (LO) cortex and the fusiform gyrus. These areas consistently displayed large gamma oscillations during visual stimulus encoding, while other extrastriate areas remained systematically silent, across 14 patients and 291 recording sites scattered throughout extrastriate visual cortex. The lateral extent of the responsive regions was small, in the range of 5 mm. Induced gamma oscillations and evoked potentials were not systematically co-localized. LO and the fusiform gyrus displayed markedly different patterns of attentional modulation. In the fusiform gyrus, attention enhanced stimulus-driven gamma oscillations. In LO, attention increased the baseline level of gamma oscillations during the expectation period preceding the stimulus. Subsequent gamma oscillations produced by attended stimuli were smaller than those produced by unattended, irrelevant stimuli. Attentional modulations of gamma oscillations in LO and the fusiform gyrus were thus very different, both in their time-course (preparatory period and/or stimulus processing) and direction of modulation (increase or decrease). Our results thus suggest that the functional role of gamma oscillations depends on the area in which they occur.

In an earlier study [Sarnthein, J., Morel, A., von Stein, A., Jeanmonod, D., 2003. Thalamic theta field potentials and EEG: high thalamocortical coherence in patients with neurogenic pain, epilepsy and movement disorders. Thalamus Related Syst. 2, 231-238], we have investigated the slowing of EEG and the high thalamocortical coherence in the framework of thalamocortical dysrhythmia, the common underlying pathophysiology. The current study focuses on the effects of different cognitive conditions. When patients rested with eyes closed, a theta peak dominated the EEG spectra. The peak height was reduced upon opening the eyes, reminiscent of the classical alpha blocking. This peak reduction also appeared in the thalamic UP recording. When patients activated their working memory by counting backwards, the theta peak increased in scalp EEG or in the UP recorded in thalamic nuclei VA/VL. The coherence estimates between EEG and LFP ranged between 21% and 76% for different patients and cognitive conditions (mean: 50%). The involvement of both cortex and thalamus in working memory and the high thalamocortical coherence underline, in addition to cortico-cortical interactions, the importance of thalamocortical modules in the generation of higher cognitive functions.

Intracanial electrode recordings provide a high spatial resolution method for studying such oscillations during cognitive tasks. Recent work revealed sites at which oscillations in the theta range ( 4 - 12 Hz) could be gated by a working-memory task: theta power was increased at task onset and continued until task offset. Using a large data set that has now been collected ( 10 participants/ 619 recording sites), we have sufficient sampling to determine how these gated sites are distributed in the cortex and how they are synchronized. A substantial fraction of sites in occipital/parietal (45/157) and temporal (23/280) cortices were gated by the task. Surprisingly, this aspect of working-memory function was virtually absent in frontal cortex (2/182). Coherence measures were used to analyze the synchronization of oscillations. We suspected that because of their coordinate regulation by the working-memory task, gated sites would have synchronized theta oscillations. We found that, whereas nearby gated sites ( < 20 mm) were often but not always coherent, distant gated sites were almost never coherent. Our results imply that there are local mechanisms for the generation of cortical theta.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra of the primary motor (frontal) and somatosensory cortex (parietal) were recorded for three consecutive days. On a single day (day 2) the wheel was locked to prevent running. Wheel running correlated negatively with the frontal-parietal ratio of slow-wave activity (EEG power between 0.75 and 4.0 Hz) in the first 2 h after sleep onset (r = -0.60; P < 0.01). On day 2 frontal EEG power (2.25-8.0 Hz) in non-rapid eye movement sleep exceeded the level of the previous day, indicating that the diverse behaviors replacing wheel-running elicited more pronounced regional EEG differences. The frontal-parietal power ratio of the lower frequency bin (0.75-1.0 Hz) in the first 2 h of sleep after dark onset correlated positively with the duration of the preceding waking (r = 0.64; P < 0.001), whereas the power ratio in the remaining frequencies of the delta band (1.25-4.0 Hz) was unrelated to waking. The data suggest that in mice EEG power in the lower frequency, corresponding to the slow oscillations described in cats and humans, is related to local sleep homeostasis.

Methods: EEG responses to median nerve stimulation were recorded from 8 normal adult subjects during baseline or action-observation conditions. Analysis was performed by convolution of the EEG with a family of wavelets. Results: Decreased power in the mu and beta bands characterized the EEG following median nerve stimulation until 500 ms post-stimulus, followed by increased amplitudes ('rebound') of both rhythms. Execution of movement, observation of object-directed movement and observation of somatosensory stimulation all caused a decreased rebound of the beta rhythm whereas observation of aimless thumb movement did not. Conclusions: Wavelet analysis of the EEG extracted similar features reported in previous studies using bandpass filtering with respect to the activation state of the motor cortex during action observation. Further, our results show that observation of somatosensory stimulation alone is sufficient to cause significant modulation of motor cortex activity. Significance: These results add further details as to what stimuli can activate the human mirror neuron system and the analytical techniques used may be useful for future studies of clinical populations such as autistic patients.

Setting and Patients: Ten patients with RLS and 10 healthy control subjects were investigated. Postmovement beta oscillations (event-related synchronization, ERS) induced by movement of the right index finger were measured by electroencephalography and analyzed. Results: We found differences between patients and controls for ERS values at electrode positions C3 and Cz. At C3, the lower beta band ERS (14-20 Hz) in the RLS group was 101.2% compared with 27.5% in the control group (P < .05); in the upper beta band, (20-32 Hz) the findings were 97.8% and 29.0%, respectively, for the RLS and control groups (P < .01). At electrode Cz, no significant difference could be found in the lower beta band, but, for the upper beta band, patients showed signifi- cantly higher values than did the healthy control subjects (68.5% vs 25.6%, P < .05). Conclusions: We interpret these findings as a higher need for motor-cortical inhibition in RLS patients due to an increased level of excitation by motor-cortex activation and input from neighboring functionally interrelated cortical areas (hand and foot region). These results reveal new potentially important findings of the neurophysiologic and pathophysiologic origin of primary RLS.

Later, Krause et al. reported of distinct ERD/ERS responses during an auditory memory task: the encoding of acoustic material elicited alpha-frequency ERS whereas retrieval or recognition of the same stimulus material evoked alpha ERD. The research group of Krause and co-workers has published several reports on acoustically evoked ERD/ERS responses utilizing various cognitive tasks and diverse stimuli. Recently, also clinical studies have been initiated. This chapter reviews, summarizes, and discusses the findings on cognition- and memory-related ERD/ERS responses specifically in the auditory stimulus modality.

We performed experiments on 26 subjects with a strategy consisting of two types of stimulations: (1) the picture of an elder anonymous lady (unknown face) and (2) the picture of the subject's own grandmother (known face). The subjects were healthy, young people between the ages of 15-32 years. Data were analyzed by means of amplitude frequency characteristics and digital filtering. Our results show the significant role of beta response in face recognition and the differentiation of known and unknown faces. Furthermore, this report supports our former view that the presentation of grandmother face evokes selectively distributed multiple oscillations in the brain.

Effects of Bemitil on the Activity of Noradrenergic and Serotonergic Brainstem Neurons and on EEG of Awake Cats	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aminergic systems; locus coeruleus; nuclei raphe; noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons; brainstem; bemitil		In experiments on five awake cats, we studied the effects of bemitil, a drug possessing psychostimulatory, antidepressive, and actoprotector properties (peroral introduction, 50 mg/kg), on the activity of neurons of the aminergic cerebral systems. Eleven noradrenergic (NA-ergic) neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and 11 serotonergic (ST-ergic) neurons of the nuclei raphe (NR) were examined. A control experimental series was carried out on 8 NA-ergic neurons of the LC and 8 ST-ergic neurons of the NR. Bemitil was found to exert opposite effects on the impulse activity of NA-ergic and ST-ergic brainstem neurons; it suppressed impulsation of LC neurons and increased the spiking frequency of NR neurons within certain time intervals after its introduction. Analysis of EEG showed that bemitil decreased the spectral power of the delta and theta activities, which was accompanied by behavioral relaxation.	[Kolotilova, O. I.; Pavlenko, V. B.; Kulichenko, A.

These events do not cause behavioral awakening, but can lead to excessive day time sleepiness. These brief arousalls or microarousals (MAs) can be identified on a standard polysomnograin as a transient abrupt change of frequency, typically in the alpha and extended beta (16-40 Hz) bands. In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically detect MAs. The method is based on using the ideas of segmentation, spectral feature extraction and the identification of EEG epochs containing MA with statistical methods and decisional rules. Full-night EEG recordings from two patients are used to present some initial performance results. For this analysis, the MA events are independently scored by three experienced sleep experts. Results show the method to be promising; however, due to the large inter-scorer variations it may be necessary to tailor the detection threshold to address the varying scorer preferences (address the sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs).

The data were analyzed by means of a short-time directed transfer function (SDTF) based on a multivariate autoregressive model. The signals from the right (or left) hemisphere were processed simultaneously (not pairwise), which is crucial for obtaining a correct picture of EEG activity transmissions. The pattern of propagation in the beta band involved for both tasks a decrease of the propagation from the motor areas during the execution of the movement - less pronounced in the case of imagination. The performance of the motion was mainly connected with a short outburst of gamma activity from the hand sensorimotor areas. In case of imagination the gamma outflow lasted longer and concerned larger brain areas.

Therefore, EEG coherence during the processing of subject-subject (SS)- and more complex subject-object (SO)-relatives was computed using ail adaptive fitting approach of bivariate auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models which enabled the continuous calculation of coherence in the course of sentence processing with a high frequency resolution according to the dynamic changes of the EEG signals. Coherence differences between sentence types were observed in the theta (4-7 Hz), beta-1 (13-18 Hz) and gamma (30-34 Hz) frequency ranges, though emerging during the processing of different parts of these sentences: gamma differences were evident mainly during the relative clause while theta and beta-l differed significantly following the end of the relative clause. These findings reveal no simple one to one map between EEG frequencies and cognitive operations necessary for sentence comprehension. Instead, they indicate a complex interplay and dynamic interaction between different EEG frequencies and verbal working memory, episodic memory, attention, morpho-syntactic and semantic-pragmatic analyses, which though distinct often co-occur.

EEG signals were recorded from high-density 8x8 (5.6x5.6 mm) arrays fixed on the surfaces of primary sensory areas in rabbits trained to discriminate visual, auditory, or tactile conditioned stimuli. EEG preprocessing was by (i) band pass filtering to extract the beta-gamma range (deleting theta-alpha); (ii) low-pass spatial filtering (not high-pass Laplacians used for localization), (iii) spatial averaging (not time averaging used for evoked potentials); (iv) close spacing of electrodes for simultaneous recording in each area (not sampling single signals from several areas); (v) calculating variances among patterns in 64-space derived from the 8x8 arrays (not by fitting equivalent dipoles). These methodological differences were essential to reveal discontinuities in cortical activity: "state transitions". Each transition began with an abrupt phase re-setting, followed sequentially by resynchronization, stabilization of a spatial pattern of amplitude, and dramatic increase in global pattern amplitude. State transitions recurred at irregular intervals in the theta range. An estimate of perceptual information in the beta-gamma EEG disclosed 2 to 3 patterns with high information content in each trial that began with a state transition, lasted similar to0.1 s, and recurred at theta rates.

It is unknown whether these changes are associated with a gradual shift in location and frequency of existing sources or rather with the involvement of a new set of oscillators. We addressed this question by applying source modeling (minimum current estimates, NICE) to spontaneous alpha activity recorded with a 306-channel MEG system from eleven non-medicated AD patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and twelve age-matched controls during the eyes-closed session. AD patients had predominant lower alpha band sources in the temporal regions, whereas in the controls, robust alpha sources were found near the parieto-occipital sulcus. Activation within the parieto-occipital region was significantly weaker, and activation in the right temporal area was significantly enhanced in the AD patients. These results suggest an increased temporal-lobe contribution coinciding with parieto-occipital deficits. We propose that NICE, which provides simultaneous mapping of several oscillatory sources, might be useful for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities associated with AD in combination with other neuropsychological and neurological measures.

In 62 participants (32 introverts and 30 extraverts), we measured the extent of Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in the EEG during performance of a short-term memory (i.e., temporary maintenance of information) and a more complex working memory task (i.e., temporary maintenance and active manipulation of information). The results indicate that during performance of both tasks, introverts display a larger amount of ERD than extraverted individuals. Moreover, the present E effects largely match previous studies as to the restriction of these effects to lower EEG frequency ranges (approx. 4-8 Hz). Topographical analyses show that the E effects are primarily present over (right-hemi spheric) frontal and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two groups of individuals (high intelligent M-IQ = 128, and average intelligent M-IQ = 93), solved two memory tasks while their EEG was recorded. The data were analyzed with the ERD/ERS method and low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). In the upper alpha band high intelligent individuals displayed more desynchronization than did average intelligent individuals. In the theta band a minor but reverse effect was observed. The LORETA analysis indicated that average intelligent individuals displayed much higher signal to noise ratios (SNR) than did high intelligent individuals. The EEG source location for the high intelligent group was more anterior, whereas for the average intelligent group a more posterior EEG source location was observed. The findings were explained in the light of the neural efficiency model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intracortical and cortico-cortical contributions	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						primary motor cortex; dorsal premotor cortex; oscillations; excitability; plasticity	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; REPETITIVE TMS; AREAS; MOVEMENTS; PREMOTOR; ARM; CONNECTIVITY	We investigated the properties of the neural response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the human primary motor cortex. Consistent with our previous findings, single pulses of TMS induce a characteristic negative deflection at 45 ms (N45) and a transient oscillation in the beta frequency-range (15-30 Hz), as measured using electroencephalograpy (EEG). Here we show the relative specificity of the beta oscillation and the N45; both are stronger when elicited by stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex, as compared with stimulation over the dorsal premotor cortex. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the beta responses to single pulses of TMS and show that the responses are highly phaselocked to the TMS pulses within single subjects; this phaselocking is similar from subject to subject. A single pulse of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex thus appears to reset the ongoing oscillations of the neurons, bringing them transiently into synchrony. Finally, we examine the effect of local or distal modulation of the excitability of the primary motor cortex on the beta oscillation and the N45 in response to single-pulse TMS. We applied low-frequency subthreshold repetitive TMS either over the primary motor cortex (local modulation) or, on a separate day, over the dorsal premotor cortex (distal modulation). The modulation was evaluated with single suprathreshold test pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex before and after the subthreshold low-frequency rTMS. We recorded the EEG response throughout the testing session, i.e. to both the subthreshold and the suprathreshold pulses. After repetitive TMS applied over the primary motor cortex, but not the dorsal premotor cortex, the amplitude of the N45 in response to suprathreshold pulses tended to decrease (not significant), and subsequently increased (significant); neither type of repetitive TMS affected the amplitude of the beta oscillation. We conclude that (1) the N45 depends on circuits intrinsic to the primary motor cortex; (2) the beta oscillation is specific to stimulation of the primary motor cortex, but is not affected by modulation of either cortical area and; (3) the beta oscillatory response to pulses of TMS arises from resetting of ongoing oscillations rather than their induction.

Methods: Consecutive patients having TAS induced by intermittent photic stimulation were included in the study. All clinical parameters, EEG, and video-EEG data were assessed during the long-term follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 10.0 software. Results: Nine female and two male patients with a mean age at onset of 14 +/- 5.9 years (range, 7-27 years) and with a mean follow-up of 9 7 +/- 56 years had photosensitive TASs. They constituted 7.64 % of absence epilepsies and 0.4 % of all patients seen in our tertiary center. The seizures were usually subtle and had a reported frequency of 1 to 9 times daily. Seven patients were clinically photosensitive and reported that some of their TASs were induced by photic stimuli in daily life. All patients also had spontaneous TASs, and four of them had generalized tonic-clonic seizures. EEG results did not show any distinctive features when compared with those of other cases with TASs. Remission could not be achieved in five patients with antiepileptic drug treatments, and we always observed relapses after drug discontinuation or dose reduction in the remaining six cases in remission. Spontaneous remission did not occur even in the five patients older than 30 years.

Animals Twenty-nine 2-year-old red deer (Cervus elaphus) stags weighing 1.06-1.31 kg each were used in this study. Stags were carrying immature growing antler suitable for commercial harvest. Materials and methods Anaesthesia was induced using propofol (8.25 +/- 1.28 mg kg(-1)) and ketamine (2.18 +/- 0.15 mg kg(-1)) and maintained with halothane in oxygen. End-tidal halothane (FE'-HAL), expired CO2 tension (PE'CO2), SpO(2), EEG, ECG, and direct arterial blood pressures were recorded continuously. Respiratory rate and somatic responses were recorded at specific time points. After stabilization of anaesthesia (FE'HAL was approximately 0.8%) baseline data were recorded. Stags were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups; control, local anaesthesia, or compression band. One antler was removed 4 minutes after the application of treatment. Electroencephalographic responses to application of treatment and antler removal were analysed using area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Mean AUC was compared between groups using ANOVA, and when significant differences were found, groups were compared post hoc with two-tailed t-tests. Significance levels were set at p <= 0.05. Results Median frequency (F-50) was increased during antler removal in the control group and during both application and antler removal in the compression group. In the lidocaine group, F50 was decreased during both application and antler removal. Spectral edge frequency (F-95) was increased during the antler removal period in the control group and during both application and antler removal in the compression group. In the lidocaine group, F95 was decreased in the application time period. Total EEG power (P-tot) was decreased in the removal period in the control group. In the compression group, P-tot was decreased in the removal period. In the lidocaine group, P-tot was decreased in the application period. There were no significant differences in EEG variables between antler removal in the control group and application of compression (p = 0.19-0.96). Conclusions These data suggest that lidocaine 'ring block' of the antler pedicle provides adequate analgesia for velvet antler removal. The use of antler pedicle compression bands represents a noxious stimulus in its own right and is not as protective as lidocaine 'ring block' against the noxious stimulus of surgical antler removal. Clinical relevance Compression of the antler pedicle has been recommended as an alternative to lidocaine 'ring block' for velvet antler removal. The results of this study suggest that antler pedicle compression is noxious. In addition, antler pedicle compression offers less effective analgesia than lidocaine 'ring block'.

Homeostatic behavior of fast Fourier transform power in very low frequency non-rapid eye movement human electroencephalogram	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; homeostasis; delta; nap	EXTENDED SLEEP; DELTA; OSCILLATION; PATTERNS; NAPS	Basic research shows that the physiological and molecular mechanisms of very low frequency (< 1 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) waves of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep differ from those of the higher (1-4 Hz) delta frequencies. Human studies show that the across-NREM period dynamics of very low frequency and 1-4 Hz EEG also differ. These differences and the reported failure of very low frequency EEG power to increase after a night of total sleep deprivation raise the question of whether very low frequency EEG shows the other homeostatic properties established for higher delta frequencies. Here we tested the relation of very low frequency EEG power density to prior waking duration across a normal day and whether these low frequencies meet another criterion for homeostatic sleep EEG: conservation of power across a late nap and post-nap sleep. Data from 19 young adults recorded in four separate sessions of baseline, daytime nap and post-nap sleep were analyzed. Power density in very low frequency NREM EEG increased linearly when naps were taken later in the day (i.e. were preceded by longer waking durations). In the night following an 18:00 h nap, very low frequency power was reduced by roughly the amount of power in the nap. Thus, very low frequency EEG meets two major homeostatic criteria. We hypothesize that these low frequencies reflect the executive rather than the functional processes by which NREM sleep reverses the effects of waking brain activity. (c) 2006 IBRO.

We present a method for simultaneous estimation of source location and orientation parameters and cross-spectral parameters to overcome these problems. Different estimators are evaluated for their performance. From a simulation study, we conclude that the estimators derived from the maximum-likelihood procedure have good statistical properties with moderate sample sizes, whereas those obtained from the generalized least squares procedure are biased and give poor-quality standard errors. The method is illustrated with visually evoked field data, with inconclusive results.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Omega-3 supplementation on some cognitive and physiological parameters in healthy subjects. Materials and methods Subjects were tested at the beginning of the experiment and after 35 days. In this period they were supplemented with Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A group was supplemented with olive oil (placebo). Tests involving different types of attention were used, i.e. Alert, Go/No-Go, Choice and Sustained Attention. For each test, the reaction time, the event-related potentials by electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electromyography (EMG) of the forefinger flexor muscle were recorded. The Profile of Mood States test (POMS) was also administered. Results Blood analyses showed that after Omega-3 supplementation the arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio (AA/EPA) was strongly reduced. The mood profile was improved after Omega-3 with increased vigour and reduced anger, anxiety and depression states. This was associated with an effect on reactivity with a reduction of reaction time in the Go/No-Go and Sustained Attention tests. The latency of EMG activation was concomitantly reduced in the same tests plus Choice. An EEG frequency shift towards the theta and alpha band were recorded in all the tests after Omega-3. Conclusion Omega-3 supplementation is associated with an improvement of attentional and physiological functions, particularly those involving complex cortical processing. These findings are discussed in terms of the influence of Omega-3 on the central nervous system.

Methods: Quantitative EEG (frequency analysis, absolute and relative powers of the four classical bands) was assessed in 191 male alcoholic patients admitted in our facility for detoxification process. All underwent psychiatric, medical and neurological examination prior to the EEG recording, in search for specific clinical or paraclinical findings. The presence or absence of relevant clinical features was codified as nominal dichotomic variables to be related to specific QEEG features. Results: Only 7 patients had normal QEEG. The most frequent alteration (81 cases) was decreased power in slow (delta and theta) bands with a concurrent increase in beta band, followed by decreased power only in slow bands (33), increase only in beta band (29), decrease in both slow and alpha bands without beta alterations (28), decrease only in alpha band (6) and others. Alterations in slow and beta bands were uncorrelated. However, a significant correlation was found between decreased power in slow bands and cortical atrophy as revealed by MRI (especially in patients with early onset of alcoholism), time elapsed from the beginning of alcoholic habits (but only in younger or early onset subjects) and in a lesser degree arterial hypertension, but neither with age nor any other clinical or psychiatric feature. On the other hand, increased power in beta band correlated mainly with the use of benzodiazepines, sensoperceptual alterations (hallucinations, illusions), clinical seizures and family history of alcoholism. The effects of those variables were strongly interrelated. Conclusions: Decreased power in slow bands in alcoholic patients may be an indicator of brain atrophy or chronic brain damage, while increase in beta band is related to medication use, family history of alcoholism, hallucinations and seizures, suggesting a state of cortical hyperexcitability. Significance: This study show the relation of specific QEEG alterations to certain clinical features found in alcoholics, in a further attempt to elucidate the semiological value of those alterations in individual patients.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) during the place recognition task was compared with the EEG during a control task, which had the same motor demands but did not require place recognition. in the place recognition task, the rat was passively transported on the periphery of a circular rotating arena, operant responses (lever pressing in Experiment 1 and licking in Experiment 2) emitted in a 60 reward sector of the arena trajectory were reinforced. As expected the theta rhythm was observed during "voluntary" movements such as walking and lever pressing. During walking and lever pressing, when prominent theta was observed, the frequency increased within the first 10 min of a session. When the rats were not moving, during licking or staying motionless, both the theta amplitude and frequency were lower compared with the EEG during walking. There were no correlations between any theta characteristics and cognitive demand of the tasks. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The 10 and 20 Hz ERD differentiate weak and strong somatosensory stimuli but not fine intensity gradations, and the ipsilateral ERD is especially sensitive to habituation. Stimulus anticipation, motor imagery, action viewing as well as voluntary movements modulate the stimulus-related changes of cortical oscillations. Noxious laser stimuli, selectively activating A delta and/or C fibers, and innocuous warm and cold Stimuli are associated with 10 and 20 Hz ERD but not with the post-stimulus 20 Hz ERS suggesting that the post-stimulus ERS is only related to neuronal transmission in the lemniscal system. It is proposed that phase-unlocked cortical oscillations modulate the preparedness of a particular sensory channel for upcoming somatosensory processing.

So far, there has been limited success in assigning a unitary basic function to these oscillations, and critics have raised the argument that they could just be an epiphenomenon of neural processing. We propose a new framework that relates gamma oscillations observed in human, as well as in animal, experiments to two underlying processes: the comparison of memory contents with stimulus-related information and the utilization of signals derived from this comparison. This model attempts to explain early gamma-band responses in terms of the match between bottom-up and top-down information. Furthermore, it assumes that late gamma-band activity reflects the readout and utilization of the information resulting from this match.

Bilateral intracerebroventricular infusion of nomifensine (9 mug in each ventriculus) produced an increase in both the rate of firing and the theta modulation of medial septal neurons; the theta power of the hippocampal EEG also augmented. The degree of neuronal theta stability (time constant of damping, TO) significantly increased. The frequency of rhythmic bursts in the neuronal firing also substantially elevated. The amplitude, regularity and frequency of theta waves in the hippocampal EEG also increased. The antagonist haloperidol (12.5 mg) caused the opposite effect. The theta acivity of medial septal neurons and the theta power of the hippocampal EEG decreased after haloperidol injection. Theta rhythmicity of septal neurons significantly diminished, the rate of rhythmic bursts in the neuronal firing also decreased, although not substantially. The theta amplitude and regu-larity in the hippocampal EEG also decreased. Effects of both drugs built up rapidly and then gradually attenuated. Nomifensine infusion against the background of exposure to haloperidol provoked neither increasing neuronal firing rate, nor elevating theta activity. These finding suggest that dopaminergic system produces activation of the septohippocampal system in situations that require selective attention to functionally important information.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between resting EEG and the ERP components in two groups of healthy subjects with different levels of performance in a highly demanding selective visual attention task. Young adults were classified according to the amount of their correct responses in the task, into high (HP; averaged hits (AH): 86%) and low performance groups (LP; AH: 59%). EEG was recorded during rest, prior to task performance and absolute (AP) and relative power (RP), as well as inter-(rTER) and intrahemispheric (rTRA) correlation were calculated. ERPs during task performance were also obtained and their amplitude and latency measures were assessed. Results showed that individuals with better behavioral performance had a higher synchronization between both hemispheres during rest as well as higher amplitude and shorter latencies of N2 and P3. Principal Component Analysis revealed that alpha2 AP and RP were inversely related to P2 and N2 latency. Higher values of alpha1 and alpha2 rTER were clustered with higher P3 amplitude and shorter reaction time. In conclusion, the differences in the cortical organization of HP and LP at rest (EEG) seem to be associated to the way the brain reacts during information processing (ERPs). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To develop a potential method to quantify signs of cortical responsiveness in persistent vegetative state (PVS) we quantified gamma range EEG in association with conjugate slow ballistic eye movements (SBEM). Methods: The EEG and the simultaneous electro-oculogram were recorded in 14 (8F/6M) PVS patients. Clinical scoring was based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Coma Rating Scale (CRS). The Wavelet Transform, followed by Hilbert transform was applied to the EEG and gamma power distribution was quantified relative to the timing of an eye movement. We correlated the clinical and the neurophysiological measures. Results: Gamma activity was present in all PVS patients. Its power was modulated in association with eye movements only in less severely affected patients, with minimum power prior to, and maximum power during the eye movement. In severely affected patients there was no evidence of a temporal relationship between gamma power and the phase of the eye movement. Conclusions: Detecting changes in the time course of gamma power in relation to conjugate ballistic eye movements provides a quantitative neurophysiological method for prospective longitudinal studies to explore if the preservation of this CNS function relates to the potential for recovery in PVS patients.

J	Murakami, S; Okada, Y				Murakami, Shingo; Okada, Yoshio			Contributions of principal neocortical neurons to magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography signals	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							INHOMOGENEOUS VOLUME CONDUCTOR; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MAGNETIC EVOKED FIELDS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; GUINEA-PIG; ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; SURFACE-POTENTIALS; DENDRITES; CELLS	A realistically shaped three-dimensional single-neuron model was constructed for each of four principal cell types in the neocortex in order to infer their contributions to magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. For each cell, the soma was stimulated and the resulting intracellular current was used to compute the current dipole Q for the whole cell or separately for the apical and basal dendrites. The magnitude of Q is proportional to the magnetic field and electrical potential far from the neuron. A train of spikes and depolarization shift in an intracellular burst discharge were seen as spikes and an envelope in Q for the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells. The stellate cells lacked the envelope. As expected, the pyramidal cells produced a stronger Q than the stellate cells. The spikes produced by the layer V pyramidal cells (n = 4) varied between -0.78 and 2.97 pA m with the majority of the cells showing a current toward the pia (defined as positive). The basal dendrites, however, produced considerable spike currents. The magnitude and direction of dipole moment are in agreement with the distribution of the dendrites. The spikes in Q for the layer V pyramidal cells were produced by the transient sodium conductance and potassium conductance of delayed rectifier type; the conductances distributed along the dendrites were capable of generating spike propagation, which was seen in Q as the tail of a triphasic wave lasting several milliseconds. The envelope was similar in magnitude (-0.41 to -0.90 pA m) across the four layer V pyramidal cells. The spike and envelope for the layer II/III pyramidal cell were 0.47 and -0.29 pA m, respectively; these values agreed well with empirical and theoretical estimates for guinea pig CA3 pyramidal cells. Spikes were stronger for the layer IV spiny stellate (0.27 pA m) than the layer III aspiny stellate cell (0.06 pA m) along their best orientations. The spikes may thus be stronger than has been previously thought. The Q for a population of stellate cells may be weaker than a linear sum of their individual Q values due to their variable dendritic geometry. The burst discharge by pyramidal cells may be detectable with MEG and EEG when 10 000-50 000 cells are synchronously active.

When sleep is sufficient, Sl is moderate, and produces few or no deficit. When it is associated with prior sleep deprivation, SI shows dose-dependent negative effects on cognitive performance, especially when subjects have been awaken in slow wave sleep (SWS). In the present study, spectral analysis was applied during the last 10 min before and the first 10 min after awakening, and during I h after awakening while subjects performed the Stroop test. Seventeen subjects were divided into a Control group who slept 8 h, and a Sleep Deprived group who slept only 2 It. The results show that performance was normal in the Control group, whereas reaction time was increased during the first half hour and error level during the second half hour in the Sleep Deprived group. Spectral analysis applied on the waking EEG during the whole test session showed that alpha activity was increased in both groups, but theta power only in the Sleep Deprived group. There was a high positive correlation in sleep deprived subjects between delta power during the last 10 min of sleep and subsequent performance decrement in speed and accuracy. Comparison of individual records showed a high positive correlation between spectral power before and after awakening in the Control group (generally in the sense of an increased frequency band), but no correlation was found in the Sleep Deprived group who exhibited a rather disorganized pattern. We discuss these results in terms of incoherence in the EEG continuity during sleep offset after prior sleep loss, which could partly account for the performance decrement observed during Sl in sleep deprived subjects.

Both the oscillatory patterning and the synchronization of responses are enhanced with arousal and attention or when the electroencephalogram is activated by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Here we show with intracortical application of cholinergic antagonists that the enhancement of gamma oscillations and response synchronization is mediated by acetylcholine and muscarinic receptors. We demonstrate further that coapplication of cholinergic agonists with synchrony-inducing light stimuli causes a lasting increase in the probability that the stimulated cells engage in gamma oscillations and response synchronization. These changes develop slowly over tens of minutes and then persist for many hours. Thus, cholinergic modulation plays a crucial role both in the fast, state-dependent facilitation of gamma oscillations and response synchronization and in use-dependent long-term modifications of cortical dynamics that favor synchronization of responses in the gamma-frequency range.

To determine if gamma power is unique to picrotoxin spindles or is an integral part of physiological and pathological spindling activity we analysed and compared the strength and brain distribution of gamma EEG power during 4 spindling activities in the rat. Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from rats with chronically implanted electrodes during natural sleep, barbiturate anaesthesia, during naturally occurring absence epilepsy spike and wave discharges and following the systemic application of picrotoxin. Spectral analysis was applied off-line to compare the strength and brain distribution of gamma EEG power during the 4 spindling activities. Results: Each spindle type contained significantly different levels of gamma power. Gamma power was significantly increased over background levels during picrotoxin spindles, slightly increased during absence spindles, slightly decreased during sleep spindles and significantly suppressed during barbiturate spindles Conclusions: Changes in the power of gamma frequencies during spindle types suggest that gamma frequencies are neither the cause of nor an integral part of a spindle. They appear to be correlated with levels of consciousness and may contribute to the process of epileptogenesis. Significance: The findings are consistent with high frequency EEG activity being related to seizure-tendency. (c) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

To this end, we recorded EEG and local field potentials (LFPs) from macroelectrodes inserted into the subthalamic nucleus area (SA) in nine awake patients following functional neurosurgery for PD. Patients were studied after overnight withdrawal of medication. Coherence between EEG and SA LFPs was apparent in the theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), lower beta (14-20 Hz) and upper beta (21-32 Hz) bands, although activity in the alpha and upper beta bands dominated. Theta coherence predominantly involved mesial and lateral areas, alpha and lower beta coherence the mesial and ipsilateral motor areas, and upper beta coherence the midline cortex. SA LFPs led EEG in the theta band. In contrast, EEG led the depth LFP in the lower and upper beta bands. SA LFP activity in the alpha band could either lead or lag EEG. Thus there are several functional sub-loops between the subthalamic area and cerebral cortical motor regions, distinguished by their frequency, cortical topography and temporal relationships. Tuning to distinct frequencies may provide a means of marking and segregating related processing, over and above any anatomical segregation of processing streams.

Hippocampal slow oscillation: A novel EEG state and its coordination with ongoing neocortical activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						synchrony; state; sleep; memory; urethane; non-REM	FREELY MOVING RAT; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; NUCLEUS-REUNIENS-THALAMI; SOURCE DENSITY ANALYSIS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; IN-VIVO MICRODIALYSIS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; REM-SLEEP; CEREBRAL ACTIVATION	State-dependent EEG in the hippocampus (HPC) has traditionally been divided into two activity patterns: theta, a large-amplitude, regular oscillation with a bandwidth of 3-12 Hz, and large-amplitude irregular activity (LIA), a less regular signal with broadband characteristics. Both of these activity patterns have been linked to the memory functions subserved by the HPC. Here we describe, using extracellular field recording techniques in naturally sleeping and urethane-anesthetized rats, a novel state present during deactivated stages of sleep and anesthesia that is characterized by a prominent large-amplitude and slow frequency (<= 1 Hz) rhythm. We have called this activity the hippocampal slow oscillation ( SO) because of its similarity and correspondence with the previously described neocortical SO. Almost all hippocampal units recorded exhibited differential spiking behavior during the SO as compared with other states. Although the hippocampal SO occurred in situations similar to the neocortical SO, it demonstrated some independence in its initiation, coordination, and coherence. The SO was abolished by sensory stimulation or cholinergic agonism and was enhanced by increasing anesthetic depth or muscarinic receptor antagonism. Laminar profile analyses of the SO showed a phase shift and prominent current sink-source alternations in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1. This, along with correlated slow oscillatory field and multiunit activity in superficial entorhinal cortex suggests that the hippocampal SO may be coordinated with slow neocortical activity through input arriving via the temporo-ammonic pathway. This novel state may present a favorable milieu for synchronization-dependent synaptic plasticity within and between hippocampal and neocortical ensembles.

Oscillatory brain activity in the human EEG during indirect and direct memory tasks	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						human EEG; induced gamma band response; oscillations; indirect memory; direct memory	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; VISUAL CONTRAST STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Up to today, the neuronal bases of activating and establishing a memory trace are not well understood. Several findings point towards the idea that the activation of an engram is mirrored in induced oscillatory bursts in the gamma frequency range (> 20 Hz; induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). In the present study, we further investigated this hypothesis. Volunteers performed two tasks on repeated pictures of familiar and unfamiliar objects. They either made a familiarity decision with repetition being task irrelevant (indirect memory task), or a recognition judgment with repetition being task relevant (direct memory task). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analyses by investigating other brain responses known to be modulated by mnemonic manipulations, namely, evoked gamma oscillations, lower frequency oscillations, and event-related potentials (ERPs). The results obtained for the indirect task replicated previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs for repeated familiar stimuli and an increase of iGBRs for repeated unfamiliar objects. These effects might be linked to the 'sharpening' of a cell assembly representing a familiar object and to the formation of a new object representation for unfamiliar stimuli, respectively. In contrast, the direct task revealed no repetition-related modulations of iGBRs. Thus, modulations of iGBRs are not a mere automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing but might rather mirror changes within cortical object representation according to use-dependent plasticity principles.

Synchronization of action potential discharges provides a link between large-scale EEG recordings and cellular plasticity mechanisms. Here, we focus on the role of neuronal synchronization in different frequency domains for the subsequent stages of memory formation. Recent EEG studies suggest that synchronized neural activity in the gamma frequency range (around 30-100 Hz) plays a functional role for the formation of declarative long-term memories in humans. On the cellular level, gamma synchronization between hippocampal and parahippocampal. regions may induce LTP in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. In order to encode spatial locations or sequences of multiple items and to guarantee a defined temporal order of memory processing, synchronization in the gamma frequency range has to be accompanied by a stimulus-locked phase reset of ongoing theta oscillations. Simultaneous gamma and theta-dependent plasticity leads to complex learning rules required for realistic declarative memory formation. Subsequently, consolidation of declarative memories may occur via replay of newly acquired patterns in so-called sharp wave-ripple complexes, predominantly during slow-wave sleep. These irregular bursts induce longer lasting forms of synaptic plasticity in output regions of the hippocampus and in the neocortex. In summary, synchronization of neural assemblies in different frequency ranges induces specific forms of cellular plasticity during subsequent stages of memory formation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show hippocampal energy fluctuations often exhibit long-range temporal correlations with power-law scaling. In most cases this scaling behavior persisted on time scales in excess of 10 minutes, the maximum duration we could detect with our recording durations. During these epochs we find that the energy fluctuations exhibit long-range correlations over a broad frequency range (0.5-100 Hz) with greater persistence of the correlations in the lower frequency bands (0.5-30 Hz) than the higher (30-100 Hz). The correlation in hippocampal energy fluctuations is characterized by a bias for energy fluctuations to be followed by similar magnitude fluctuations over all energy scales, i.e. large fluctuations begets large fluctuations and small begets small.

Frontal theta event-related synchronization: comparison of directed attention and working memory load effects	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						working memory; EEG; event-related synchronisation; theta oscillations; attention	POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EEG; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; TASK; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIONS	Early studies showed that long-term encoding and retrieval of new information is associated with modulation of the theta rhythm. More recently, changes in theta power amplitude over frontal electrode sites were reported during working memory, yet their relative significance in regard to attentional and memory processes remains unclear. Event-related synchronisation responses in the 4-7.5 Hz theta EEG frequency band was studied in 12 normal subjects performing four different tasks: two working memory tasks in which load varied from one (1-back task) to two (2-back task) items, an oddball detection (attention) task and a passive fixation task. A phasic theta increase was observed following stimulus apparition on all electrode sites within each task, with longer culmination peak and maximal amplitude over frontal electrodes. Frontal theta event-related synchronization (ERS) was of higher amplitude in the 1-back, 2-back and detection tasks as compared to the passive fixation task. Additionally, the detection task elicited a larger frontal and central theta ERS than the 2-back task. By analyzing theta ERS characteristics in various experimental conditions, the present study reveals that early phasic theta response over frontal regions primarily reflects the activation of neural networks involved in allocation of attention related to target stimuli rather than working memory processes.

To report our experience in the surgical treatment of temporal-lobe epilepsy. Patients and methods. An analysis was performed of the outcomes of 137 patients submitted to surgery between 1990 and 2001, with a follow-up of more than two years. A study was conducted of the percentages of successful detection by the different complementary tests - MRI, EEG interictal SPECT video-EEG with foramen ovale electrodes (FOE), neuropsychological study (NPS) - and the precision with which they reported the epileptogenic focus. Results and conclusions. Successful surgical outcomes (Engel grades I-H): 73.4%. No surgical mortality occurred, although some mild, reversible morbidity was observed. Surgical outcomes were not affected by sex, age, age of onset and the length of time the patient had had the disease, or the frequency of the seizures. No association was found between seizures in the immediate post-operative period and a poorer long term control of the epilepsy. MR images were normal in 25% of patients; in these cases the surgical outcomes (Engel grades I-II at two years: 62%) were significantly poorer than in cases of tumours/cavernomas (86%); RMI studies of other types of lesions gave intermediate results (72%). With respect to the capacity of the different tests to lateralise/locate the epileptogenic focus, video-EEG-FOE proved to be the best, followed by MRI, SPECT EEG and NPS.

Automatic correction of artifact from single-trial event-related potentials by blind source separation using second order statistics only	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); automatic artifact correction; blind source separation (BSS); second order statistics (SOS); independent component analysis (ICA); higher order statistics (HOS)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REMOVAL; EEG	Event-related potentials (ERP) are in general masked by various kinds of artifacts. To attenuate the effects of artifacts, various schemes have been introduced, such as epoch rejection, electro-oculogram (EOG) regression and independent component analysis (ICA). However, none of the existing techniques can automatically remove various kinds of artifacts from a single ERP epoch. EOG regression cannot handle artifacts other than ocular ones. ICA incorporating higher order statistics (HOS) normally requires data with large number of time samples in order that the solution is robust. In this paper we blindly separate the multi-channel ERP into source components by estimating the correlation matrices of the data. Since only second order statistics (SOS) is involved, the process performs well at the single epoch level. Automatic artifact identification is performed in the source domain by introducing objective criteria for various artifacts. Criteria are based on time domain signal amplitude for blink and spurious peak artifact, scalp distribution of signal power for eye movement artifact and power distribution of frequency components for muscle artifact. The correction procedure can be completed by removing the identified artifactual sources from the raw multi-channel ERP. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in freely moving TN-R-/- and wild-type control mice, focusing on the hippocampal CA1 field and cerebral cortex. TN-R-/- mice expressed normal high-frequency oscillations (ripples) in CA1 and only a slight reduction of peak theta frequency. In contrast, their hippocampal gamma oscillations were significantly enhanced in amplitude. Also, the amplitude of the cortical EEG of TN-R-/-mice was increased over a wide frequency range. The amplitude of cortical and, to a lesser degree hippocampal, AEPs was clearly enhanced in TN-R-/- mice. In addition, response habituation to repeated sound stimuli was significantly attenuated in TN-R-/-mice. These findings indicate that tenascin-R is involved in the regulation of certain inhibitory mechanisms in the intact brain. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is well documented that anxiolytic drugs diminish septo-hippocampal oscillatory theta activity contributing to their either therapeutic or unwanted side effects. In the present experiments we applied a combination of computational and physiological techniques to explore the functional role of GABA(A) receptors in theta oscillation. In electrophysiological experiments extracellular single unit recordings were performed from medial septum/ diagonal band of Broca with simultaneous hippocampal (CA1) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from anesthetized rats. Neurotransmission at GASA(A) receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the GABA(A) receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator FG-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited, whereas FG-7142 enhanced theta oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal EEG theta activity. In parallel to these experimental observations, a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal GABA neuron model with a CA1 hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of GABA(A) transmission, and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of GABA(A) receptors. In addition, computational findings indicated different roles of distinctively located GABA(A) receptors in theta generation. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These patterns may cause different types of EEG, which may dynamically change during the temporal evolution of seizure. It is generally assumed that these epileptic patterns may originate in a network of strongly interconnected neurons, in cases when excitation dominates over inhibition. The aim of this work is to use a neural network of integrate and fire neurons to analyze which parameter alterations (either at the neural level or at the level of synapses) may induce network instability and epileptic-like discharges. A signal representative of EEG is simulated by summing the membrane potential changes of all neurons. Model simulations show that an increase in the strength and in spatial extension of excitatory synapses vs. inhibitory synapses and/or an increase in the relative refractory period, may determine sustained patterns of uncontrolled activity, which propagate along the network. These propagating waves may have a different shape and frequency, depending on the particular parameter set used during the simulations and on initial random conditions. The resulting model EEG signals include isolated or repeated bursts, high-frequency low-amplitude waves or larger oscillations with lower frequency. A derangement in a few parameters of the model causes the transition from one pattern to another, thus generating a highly non-stationary signal which resembles that observed during intracortical EEG measurements in epilepsy. The obtained results may help to elucidate the mechanisms at the basis of some epileptic discharges, and to relate rapid changes in EEG patterns, often observed during seizure, with the underlying alterations at the neural and network levels.

The first task was the same in the two series: subjects had to evaluate size relationship between two closely spaced circles. The second task successively presented in trials of the first series consisted in the recognition of words/pseudowords, and in the second series, subjects had to localize a target letter in a matrix. It was assumed that the cognitive performance in the first series predominantly involved the ventral visual system, whereas during task performance in the second series, predominant involvement of the ventral and dorsal visual systems alternated. Multichannel EEG fragments recorded prior to the presentation of the task pairs were analyzed. Analysis of variance of the EEG spectral power revealed the generalized significant effect of the factor of the second task in the pair for delta band and lower beta subband, the power being higher in the first series. Factor brain hemisphere had a significant effect for the alpha band in the occipital area, the spectral power being lower in the left hemisphere for both experimental series. The task X hemisphere interaction was significant in the temporal cortical areas for the EEG power in alpha2 band, i.e., the predominant involvement of the ventral visual system was associated with stronger asymmetry of alpha2 rhythm and lower spectral power in this band in the left temporal area. Thus, the character of the forthcoming cognitive activity was shown to be reflected in spatio-frequency characteristics of the preceding EEG.

J	De Pascalis, V; Cacace, I; Massicolle, F				De Pascalis, V; Cacace, I; Massicolle, F			Perception and modulation of pain in waking and hypnosis: functional significance of phase-ordered gamma oscillations	PAIN			English	Article						pain; hypnosis; analgesia; subjective experience; EEG gamma oscillations; 40-Hz	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LOW HYPNOTIZABLE SUBJECTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES; HUMAN BRAIN; INTENSITY; ANTICIPATION; RESPONSES; EEG	Somatosensory event-related phase-ordered gamma oscillations (40-Hz) to electric painful standard stimuli under an odd-ball paradigm were analyzed in 13 high, 13 medium, and 12 low hypnotizable subjects during waking, hypnosis, and post-hypnosis conditions. During these conditions, subjects received a suggestion of Focused Analgesia to produce an obstructive hallucination of stimulus perception; a No-Analgesia treatment served as a control. After hypnosis, a post-hypnotic suggestion was given to draw waking subjects into a deep hypnosis with opened eyes. High hypnotizables, compared to medium and low ones, experienced significant pain and distress reductions for Focused Analgesia during hypnosis and, to a greater extent, during post-hypnosis condition. Correlational analysis of EEG sweeps of each individual revealed brief intervals of phase ordering of gamma patterns, preceding and following stimulus onset, lasting approximately six periods. High and medium hypnotizable subjects showed significant reductions in phase-ordered gamma patterns for Focused Analgesia during hypnosis and post-hypnosis conditions; this effect was found, however, more pronounced in high hypnotizable subjects. Phaseordered gamma scores over central scalp site predicted subject pain ratings across Waking-Pain and Waking-Analgesia conditions, while phase-ordered prnma scores over frontal scalp site predicted pain ratings during post-hypnosis analgesia condition. During waking conditions, this relationship was present in high, low and medium hypnotizable subjects and was independent of stimulus intensity measures. This relationship was unchanged by hypnosis induction in the low hypnotizable subjects, but not present in the high and medium ones during hypnosis, suggesting that hypnosis interferes with phase-ordered gamma and pain relationship.

J	Tsujimoto, T; Shimazu, H; Isomura, Y				Tsujimoto, T; Shimazu, H; Isomura, Y			Direct recording of theta oscillations in primate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							FRONTAL MIDLINE-THETA; SELF-PACED HAND; RHESUS-MONKEY; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MENTAL ACTIVITY; HUMAN-BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG	Recent evidence has suggested that theta-frequency (4-7 Hz) oscillations around the human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and frontal cortex-that is, frontal midline theta (Fm theta) oscillations-may be involved in attentional processes in the brain. However, little is known about the physiological basis of Fm theta oscillations because invasive study in the human is allowed in only limited cases. In the present study, we developed a monkey model for Fm theta oscillations and located the generators of theta waves using electrodes implanted in various cortical areas. Monkeys were engaged in a self-initiated hand-movement task with a waiting period. The theta power in area 9 (the medial prefrontal cortex) and area 32 (the rostral ACC) was gradually increased from a few seconds before the movement and reached a peak immediately after the movement. When the movement was rewarded, the theta power attained a second peak, whereas it swiftly decreased in the unrewarded trials. Theta oscillations in areas 9 and 32 were coherent and phase locked together. This theta activity may be associated with "executive attention" including self-control, internal timing, and assessment of reward. It is probably a homologue of human Fm theta oscillations, as judged from the similar localization, corresponding frequency, and dependency on attentional processes. The monkey model would be useful for studying executive functions in the frontal cortex.

To examine where in the brain the scale-specific information is integrated, we mapped the neural assemblies engaged in interhemispheric coupling with electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence and blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal. During similar EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, our subjects viewed centrally presented bilateral gratings of different SF (0.25-8.0 cpd), which either obeyed Gestalt grouping rules (iso-oriented, IG) or violated them (orthogonally oriented, OG). The IG stimuli (0.5-4.0 cpd) synchronized EEG at discrete beta frequencies (beta1, beta2) and increased BOLD (0.5 and 2.0 cpd tested) in ventral (around collateral sulcus) and dorsal (parieto-occipital fissure) regions compared with OG. At both SF, the beta1 coherence correlated with the ventral activations, whereas the beta2 coherence correlated with the dorsal ones. Thus distributed neural substrates mediated interhemispheric integration at single SF. The relative impact of the ventral versus dorsal networks was modulated by the SF of the stimulus.

With this, a BCI provides a new non-muscular communication channel, which can be used to assist patients who have highly compromised motor functions. The Graz-BCI uses motor imagery and associated oscillatory EEG signals from the sensorimotor cortex for device control. As a result of research in the past 15 years, the classification of ERD/ERS patterns in single EEG trials during motor execution and motor imagery forms the basis of this sensorimotor-rhythm controlled BCI. The major frequency bands of cortical oscillations considered here are the 8-13 and 15-30 Hz bands. This chapter describes the basic methods used in Graz-BCI research and outlines possible clinical applications.

J	Robinson, PA; Rennie, CJ; Rowe, DL; O'Connor, SC				Robinson, PA; Rennie, CJ; Rowe, DL; O'Connor, SC			Estimation of multiscale neurophysiologic parameters by electroencephalographic means	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						electrophysiology; biophysics; biological physics; neurophysiology; anatomy; methods; modeling	UNDERLYING SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC CURRENTS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RETICULARIS THALAMI; NEURONAL ACTIVITIES; ALPHA RHYTHMS; DYNAMICS; NUCLEUS; MODEL; MECHANISMS	It is shown that new model-based electroencephalographic (EEG) methods can quantify neurophysiologic parameters that underlie EEG generation in ways that are complementary to and consistent with standard physiologic techniques. This is done by isolating parameter ranges that give good matches between model predictions and a variety of experimental EEG-related phenomena simultaneously. Resulting constraints range from the submicrometer synaptic level to length scales of tens of centimeters, and from timescales of around 1 ms to 1 s or more, and are found to be consistent with independent physiologic and anatomic measures. In the process, a new method of obtaining model parameters from the data is developed, including a Monte Carlo implementation for use when not all input data are available. Overall, the approaches used are complementary to other methods, constraining allowable parameter ranges in different ways and leading to much tighter constraints overall. EEG methods often provide the most restrictive individual constraints. This approach opens a new, noninvasive window on quantitative brain analysis, with the ability to monitor temporal changes, and the potential to map spatial variations. Unlike traditional phenomenologic quantitative EEG measures, the methods proposed here are based explicitly on physiology and anatomy. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This is the C-t value (t = 5 h) of exposure at which the EEG becomes significantly different from that resulting from air exposure of the same animals. The LOAELs for effects on the EEG in vehicle- and pyridostigmine-pretreated marmosets appeared to be 0.2 and 0.1 mg min m(-3), respectively. Comparatively, the latter LOAEL values are at least an order of magnitude lower than the previously established LOAEL for miosis and only 2-5 times higher than the lowest observable effect level (LOEL) of bound sarin in blood. The second aim of the study was to analyse the EEG of the same marmosets again during a 5-h exposure to air 1 year after exposure to sarin vapour. All the marmosets still demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) EEG differences. In most vehicle-pretreated marmosets the energy (muV(2)) per EEG band was higher than that observed 1 year earlier, which might indicate that neurons had become more sensitive to excitation. This phenomenon was less pronounced in pyridostigmine-pretreated animals. Visual examination of the EEG records revealed clear bursts of alpha frequencies (ca. 9 Hz), resembling sleep-spindles, that were present more frequently in both groups of exposed marmosets than in naive animals. These late changes in spindle oscillation might be the result of changes in the cholinergic system due to exposure to sarin vapour 1 year previously. In conclusion, EEG abnormalities persisting for more than 1 year may occur in humans during long-term (5 h) exposure to subclinical levels of sarin that are not detectable by the currently fielded alarm systems.

This treatment induces a non-convulsive status epilepticus and acute lesion of CA1. CA3c and hilar neurons, followed by a latent phase with ongoing ipsilateral neuronal degeneration. Spontaneous local seizures mark the onset of the chronic phase, In striking contrast, the ventral hippocampus and the contralateral side remain structurally Unaffected and seizure-free. In this study, functional and neurochemical alterations of the contralateral side were Studied to rind candidate mechanisms underlying the lack of a mirror focus in this model of TLE. A quantitative analysis of simultaneous, bilateral EEG recordings revealed a significant decrease of theta oscillations ipsilaterally during the latent phase and bilaterally during the chronic phase. Furthermore, the synchronization of bilateral activity. which is very high in control, was strongly reduced already during the latent phase and the decrease was independent of recurrent seizures. immunohistochemical analysis performed in the contralateral hippocampus of kainate-treated mice revealed reduced calbindin-labeling of CA1 pyramidal cells; down-regulation of CCK-8 and up-regulation of NPY-labeling in mossy fibers, and a redistribution of galanin immunoreactivity. These changes collectively might limit neuronal excitability in CA1 and dentate gyrus. as well as glutamate release from mossy fiber terminals. Although these functional and neurochemical alterations might not be causally related, they likely reflect long-ranging network alterations underlying the independent evolution of the two hippocampal formations during the development of an epileptic focus in this model of TLE.

Neuronal processing, however, involves simultaneous oscillations in various frequency bands. The mechanisms involved in the integration of such spectrally distributed processing have remained enigmatic. We demonstrate, using magnetoencephalography, that robust cross-frequency phase synchrony is present in the human cortex among oscillations with frequencies from 3 to 80 Hz. Continuous mental arithmetic tasks demanding the retention and summation of items in the working memory enhanced the cross-frequency phase synchrony among alpha (similar to 10 Hz), beta (similar to 20 Hz), and gamma (similar to 30-40 Hz) oscillations. These tasks also enhanced the "classical" within-frequency synchrony in these frequency bands, but the spatial patterns of alpha, beta, and gamma synchronies were distinct and, furthermore, separate from the patterns of cross-frequency phase synchrony. Interestingly, an increase in task load resulted in an enhancement of phase synchrony that was most prominent between gamma- and alpha-band oscillations. These data indicate that cross-frequency phase synchrony is a salient characteristic of ongoing activity in the human cortex and that it is modulated by cognitive task demands. The enhancement of cross-frequency phase synchrony among functionally and spatially distinct networks during mental arithmetic tasks posits it as a candidate mechanism for the integration of spectrally distributed processing.

Scoring rules of Recht-schaffen and Kates (RK) are normally used in 30 s epochs for scoring wakefulness (SO) and steep stages (S1, S2, S3, S4 and REM). One daytime sleepiness test is Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) where the subject is instructed to stay awake under soporific circumstances. We analyzed 17 of 40 minute MWT recordings using linear and lion linear analysis to study vigilance fluctuations beyond 30 s RK scoring. Using adaptive epoch lengths with minimum epoch duration of 2 seconds a total of 768 wake-steep and sleep-wake transitions were used to study change in fractal dimension (FD) in sleep onset and in following awakenings. Time domain fractal dimension was calcutated using Higuchi algorithm (kmax=8, 16) for 2 seconds before and 2 seconds after each sleep onset and awakenings. Ratios of dimensions were calculated. Using kmax=8: For sleep onset (S0-S1) transitions fractal dimension changed from 1.28 +/- 0.08 to 1.32 +/- 0.09 and fractal dimension ratio was 1.03 +/- 0.07 and for steep-wake (SI-SO) transitions ratio was 1.00 +/- 0.06. Using kmax=16: For sleep onset (S0-S1) transitions fractal dimension changed from 1.52 +/- 0.09 to 1.52 +/- 0.10 and fractal dimension ratio was 1.00 +/- 0.05 and for steep-wake (S1-S0) transitions ratio was 1.04 +/- 0.06. Findings using kmax=8 are in contradiction of lower frequencies (theta activity of S1) resulting in lower FD than higher frequencies (alpha activity of S0). Our results indicate that fractal dimension could be used as all auxiliary parameter in computer assisted steep onset detection.

Growth hormone-releasing hormone and corticotropin-releasing hormone enhance non-rapid-eye-movement sleep after sleep deprivation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM			English	Article						event history analysis; recovery sleep; cortisol; peptides	EEG POWER SPECTRA; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ENDOCRINE ACTIVITY; SECRETION; GHRH; SOMATOSTATIN; CORTISOL; DEPRESSION; RATS; TIME	The neuropeptides growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulate sleep and nocturnal hormone secretion in a reciprocal fashion, at least in males. GHRH promotes sleep and GH and inhibits hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) hormones. CRH exerts opposite effects. In women, a sexual dimorphism was found because GHRH impairs sleep and stimulates HPA hormones. Sleep deprivation (SD) is the most powerful stimulus for inducing sleep. Studies in rodents show a key role of GHRH in sleep promotion after SD. The effects of GHRH and CRH on sleep-endocrine activity during the recovery night after SD are unknown. We compared sleep EEG, GH, and cortisol secretion between nights before and after 40 h of SD in 48 normal women and men aged 19-67 yr. During the recovery night, GHRH, CRH, or placebo were injected repetitively. After placebo during the recovery night, non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) increased and wakefulness decreased compared with the baseline night. After GHRH, the increase of NREMS and the decrease of wakefulness were more distinct than after placebo. Also, after CRH, NREMS increased higher than after placebo, and a positive correlation was found between age and the baseline-related increase of slow-wave sleep. REMS increased after placebo and after GHRH, but not after CRH. EEG spectral analysis showed increases in the lower frequencies and decreases in the higher frequencies during NREMS after each of the treatments. Cortisol and GH did not differ between baseline and recovery nights after placebo. After GHRH, GH increased and cortisol decreased. Cortisol increased after CRH. No sex differences were found in these changes. Our data suggest that GHRH and CRH augment NREMS promotion after SD. Marked differences appear to exist in peptidergic sleep regulation between spontaneous and recovery sleep.

By using a combination of videorecording and radiotelemetry, this experiment addressed the question of whether such behaviours are associated with de-arousal. In each of 2 years, 3 female chickens had radiotelemetry devices (Data Sciences) implanted surgically at 12 weeks of age, for measuring putative physiological indices of arousal (heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, telencephalic EEG). Subsequently, when caged individually and moving freely, they were monitored over 2 days when their daily food ration (60 g pellets provided at 0900 h) was all eaten in < 10 min. Their behaviour (nine categories) and arousal indices were recorded in every minute during the photoperiod (0700 to 1900 h), using special computer software for videorecording (Noldus) and radiotelemetry (Dataquest LabPRO) analyses. Most time was spent in behaviour categories stand, push bar and feeder directed. Heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and relative powers in delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency bands of the EEG power spectrum were all highest during feeder directed, whereas heart rate, temperature and delta EEG were all lowest during stand. Judging from significant correlation coefficients between times spent in different behaviours and corresponding physiological variables, across the day, and between ranked mean values of the 6 birds, other trends were also evident. For example, total time spent in all (non-food directed) oral behaviours was related positively to an index of de-arousal (slow wave EEG) and negatively to an index of arousal (heart rate). Collectively, however, these results provide apparently conflicting evidence of both arousal and de-arousal being associated with every behaviour analysed. This conclusion is explicable if abnormal behaviours are related to arousal in a homeostatic way [Savory, C.J., Kostal, L. Temporal patteming of oral stereotypies in restricted-fed fowls: 1.

Methods: Pairs of tungsten electrodes (50 mu m O/D) were implanted bilaterally under anesthesia at symmetrical points in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions of anterior and posterior hippocampi and entorhinal cortex of adult Wistar rats. Stimulating electrodes were placed in the right angular bundle and KA was injected into the right posterior CA3 area of hippocampus after 1 week of baseline EEG recording. Beginning 24 h after injection, electrographic activity was recorded with video monitoring for seizures every day for 8 h/day for 60 days. Results: Seventy percent of seizures started locally in the DG ipsilateral to injection, with an increase in frequency of interictal EEG spikes (hypersynchronous type, HYP), and 26% of seizures started with a decrease of EEG amplitude with parallel increase in frequency (low-voltage fast type, LVF). During HYP seizures, a significant increase was observed in amplitude of beta-gamma range frequencies, ripple frequency, and fast ripple (FR) frequency, whereas during LVF seizure, an increase was noted only in the beta-gamma range. In all cases but one, an EEG wave preceded ripple and FR oscillations. Before seizure onset, the amplitude of DG-evoked responses to single pulses decreased, whereas the amplitude of the response to the second pulse delivered at 30-ms interval increased. Conclusions: If ripple and FR oscillations indicate the seizure-generating neuronal substrate, these areas must be small and widespread, so that the probability of recording from them directly is very low. The decreased response to electrical stimulation before seizures could indicate a protective inhibitory mechanism that contains or prevents seizure occurrence. The presence of decreased paired-pulse suppression could indicate a network predisposition to follow an external input with a certain frequency.

The aim of the study was to explore EEG correlates of MMGF-induced imagery. In a screening phase, seven 'high-responders' were selected by frequency and quality of their reported hallucinatory experience in MMGF. Each of these subjects then participated in three MMGF sessions (45 min) with simultaneous 19 channel EEG recordings and indicated occurrences of imagery by pressing a button. Relative spectral power changes during percept formation (30 s preceding subjects' reports) with respect to intra-individual baselines (no-imagery EEG) were analysed. At the beginning of the 30-s 'image formation' period alpha was slightly reduced than in the 'no-imagery' periods. This was followed by increased power in the higher alpha frequency band (10-12 Hz) which then declined in a monotonic fashion. This decline in higher alpha power was accompanied by increased power in the beta frequency bands. Throughout the image formation period there was a steady decline in power of low frequency alpha (8-10 Hz). Correlations between descriptors of subjective experience and EEG power changes were evaluated in terms of their global average magnitude and variability in time. Results indicate that the acceleration of alpha activity is a nonspecific effect of MMGF. In contrast, the tri-phasic profile of faster alpha activity seems to be a specific correlate of the retrieval and transformation of memory content in ganzfeld imagery. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

By wavelet based time-frequency analysis, we showed that two distinct neuromagentic responses corresponding to stimulus frequency and its time delayed first harmonic were found in control subjects, whereas no harmonic response was obtained for the patient. We applied a battery of methods (sample entropy measuring signal complexity and index of smoothness measuring determinism) based on nonlinear dynamical system theory in conjunction with bootstrapping surrogate analysis. The results suggested that a significant nonlinear structure was evident in the MEG signals for control subjects, whereas nonlinearity was not detected for the patient. In addition, the couplings between distant cortical regions were found to be greater for control subjects. The important role of combinational chromatic sensitivity in sustained cortical excitation was also confirmed. These findings lead to the hypothesis that the healthy human brain is most likely equipped with significantly nonlinear neuronal processing reflecting an inherent mechanism defending against hyper-excitation to chromatic flickering stimulus, and such nonlinear mechanism is likely to be impaired for a patient with photosensitive epilepsy.

Averaged across all cortical sites, spectral power was treated as a complex measure dependent on both the number of active alpha oscillators and the degree of their synchrony. Averaged across all electrode pairs, squared coherence was treated as a global measure of alpha synchrony. The relationship between state anxiety and baseline alpha power was mostly mediated by alpha synchrony. During transition through experimental settings, the dynamics of alpha2 and alpha3 power was mostly accounted for by changes of these sub-bands' synchrony. The synchrony-independent power component demonstrated linear trends implying that, during the experiment, the number of active alpha oscillators linearly decreased in subjects with low state anxiety and linearly increased in subjects with high state anxiety. These findings are discussed in terrns of alpha synchronization as an active process, allowing dynamic regulation of alpha system preparedness for processing of external stimuli.

It is based on documented findings, rational theory, and the research and clinical experience of the authors. While considering general issues of physiology, learning principles, and methodology, it focuses on the treatment of epilepsy with sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) training, arguably the best established clinical application of EEG operant conditioning. The basic research literature provides ample data to support a very detailed model of the neural generation of SMR, as well as the most likely candidate mechanism underlying its efficacy in clinical treatment. Further, while more controlled clinical trials would be desirable, a respectable literature supports the clinical utility of this alternative treatment for epilepsy. However, the skilled practice of clinical neurofeedback requires a solid understanding of the neurophysiology underlying EEG oscillation, operant learning principles and mechanisms, as well as an in-depth appreciation of the ins and outs of the various hardware/software equipment options open to the practitioner. It is suggested that the best clinical practice includes the systematic mapping of quantitative multi-electrode EEG measures against a normative database before and after treatment to guide the choice of treatment strategy and document progress towards EEG normalization. We conclude that the research literature reviewed in this article justifies the assertion that neurofeedback treatment of epilepsy/seizure disorders constitutes a well-founded and viable alternative to anticonvulsant pharmacotherapy.

It has also been suggested that absence epilepsy spike and wave discharges may be generated by a similar mechanism. In addition, we have previously reported a possible thalamocortical origin of the EEG spindling rhythmic discharges associated with myoclonic jerks in the picrotoxin rat model of primary generalised epilepsy. To investigate whether pathological and physiological brain, rhythms have common mechanisms of generation, we analysed four electroencephalographic (EEG) spindling activities in the rat. These were the non-convulsive spindle discharges induced by picrotoxin (picrotoxin spindles), naturally occurring absence epilepsy spike and wave discharges (absence spindles), spindle discharges during natural sleep (sleep spindles) and spindling activity that occurs under barbiturate anaesthesia (barbiturate spindles). We used power spectral analysis to define and compare the strength and brain distribution of EEG power during the spindling activities in 12 forebrain and 7 brainstem regions. There were brain-wide differences in power for each of the different spindle types with the pathological rhythms of the epilepsics containing more power than the physiological rhythms. There were also similar differences in the expression of spindles related to the region examined and no thalamic emphasis. These results provide evidence for a similar regional EEG power distribution for all four types of spindling activity and thus for the different spindles being expressions of a single phenomenon.

Differences in general mental ability have been associated with event-related neural activity patterns of the wakeful working brain or physical, chemical and electrical brain features measured during wakeful resting conditions. Recent evidences suggest that specific sleep electroencephalogram oscillations are related to wakeful cognitive performances. Our aim is to reveal the relationship between non-rapid eye movement sleep-specific oscillations (the slow oscillation, delta activity, slow and fast sleep spindle density, the grouping of slow and fast sleep spindles) and general mental ability assessed by the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (RPMT). The grouping of fast sleep spindles by the cortical slow oscillation in the left frontopolar derivation (Fp1) as well as the density of fast sleep spindles over the right frontal area (Fp2, F4), correlated positively with general mental ability. Data from those selected electrodes that showed the high correlations with general mental ability explained almost 70% of interindividual variance in RPMT scores. Results suggest that individual differences in general mental ability are reflected in fast sleep spindle-related oscillatory activity measured over the frontal cortex.

A non-invasive method to monitor the functioning of the autonomous nervous system consists in heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes on HRV after an asphyxia experiment in rots, using several linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear parameters (approximate entropy, SD1 and SD2 indices derived from Poincare plots). Methods:The experiments involved the study of HRV changes after cardiac arrest (CA) resulting from 5 min of hypoxia and asphyxia, followed by manual resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation. 5 min stationary periods of RR intervals were selected for further analysis from 5 rots in following distinct situations: 1) baseline, 2) 30 min after CA, 3) 60 min after CA, 4) 90 min after CA, 5) 120 min after CA, 6) 150 min after CA. The ANS contribution has been delineated based on time and frequency domain analysis. Results and Conclusions: The results indicate that the recovery process following the asphyxia cardiac arrest reflects the impaired functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Both linear and nonlinear parameters track the different phases of the experiment, with an increased sensitivity displayed by the approximate entropy (ApEn). After 150 min the ApEn RRI parameter recovers to its baseline value. The results forward the ApEn as a more sensitive parameter of the recovery process following the asphyxia.

J	de Arcangelis, L; Perrone-Capano, C; Herrmann, HJ				de Arcangelis, L; Perrone-Capano, C; Herrmann, HJ			Self-organized criticality model for brain plasticity	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							NEURONAL AVALANCHES; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERNS; MEMORY; NOISE	Networks of living neurons exhibit an avalanche mode of activity, experimentally found in organotypic cultures. Here we present a model that is based on self-organized criticality and takes into account brain plasticity, which is able to reproduce the spectrum of electroencephalograms (EEG). The model consists of an electrical network with threshold firing and activity-dependent synapse strengths. The system exhibits an avalanche activity in a power-law distribution. The analysis of the power spectra of the electrical signal reproduces very robustly the power-law behavior with the exponent 0.8, experimentally measured in EEG spectra. The same value of the exponent is found on small-world lattices and for leaky neurons, indicating that universality holds for a wide class of brain models.

S	Bastiaansen, M; Hagoort, P		Neuper, C; Klimesch, W		Bastiaansen, Marcel; Hagoort, Peter			Oscillatory neuronal dynamics during language comprehension	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review						language comprehension; unification; syntax; semantics; neuronal synchronization; oscillatory dynamics; EEG power; EEG coherence	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIPPOCAMPAL MEMORY SYSTEM; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; WORD FORM AREA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; FIELD POTENTIALS	Language comprehension involves two basic operations: the retrieval of lexical information (Such as phonologic, syntactic, and semantic information) from long-term memory, and the unification of this information into a coherent representation of the overall utterance. Neuroimaging studies using hemodynamic measures such as PET and fMRI have provided detailed information on which areas of the brain are involved in these language-related memory and unification operations. However, much less is known about the dynamics of the brain's language network. This chapter presents a literature review of the oscillatory neuronal dynamics of EEG and MEG data that can be observed during language comprehension tasks. From a detailed review of this (rapidly growing) literature the following picture emerges: memory retrieval operations are mostly accompanied by increased neuronal synchronization in the theta frequency range (4-7 Hz). Unification operations, in contrast, induce high-frequency neuronal synchronization in the beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (above 30 Hz) frequency bands. A desynchronization in the (upper) alpha frequency band is found for those Studies that use secondary tasks, and seems to correspond with attentional processes, and with the behavioral consequences of the language comprehension process. We conclude that it is possible to capture the dynamics of the brain's language network by a careful analysis of the event-related changes in power and coherence of EEG and MEG data in a wide range of frequencies, in combination with subtle experimental manipulations in a range of language comprehension tasks. It appears then that neuronal synchrony is a mechanism by which the brain integrates the different types of information about language (such as phonological, orthographic, semantic, and syntactic information) represented in different brain areas.

J	Crowley, K; Trinder, J; Colrain, IM				Crowley, K; Trinder, J; Colrain, IM			Evoked K-complex generation: the impact of sleep spindles and age	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sleep spindle; age; sleep; K complex	SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; IN-VIVO; MUSCLE; NEURONS; SLOW; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUNITRAZEPAM; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY	Objective: It has been proposed that spindles and spontaneous K-complexes reflect two sides of a coin, with the spindle reflecting an inhibitory microstate and the K-complex reflecting an excitatory or aroused microstate [Physiol Behav 1993;54(4):795]. This hypothesis predicts that the presence of a sleep spindle at the time of stimulus presentation would decrease the likelihood of a K-complex being elicited by that stimulus. The present study sought to test this hypothesis in young and elderly subjects. Methods: Ten young and 7 elderly adults who were neurologically healthy and free from medications spent one night in the sleep laboratory. EEG was recorded from 6 gold plate electrodes (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz and O2) referenced to A1 + A2. Tone clicks (1000 Hz) at 80 dB above measured awake detection thresholds were presented binaurally either during a spindle (SP +) or in the absence of a spindle (SP -). This was achieved by viewing a central EEG channel filtered to pass only the frequencies between 12 and 14 Hz. Trials were further classified based on whether (KC +) or not (KC -) they produced a K-complex. K-Complex probability and the amplitude and latency of the N550 component of the averaged evoked potential for KC + trials were assessed using a two-way analysis of variance with main effects of age and spindle presence/absence. Results: There were significant reductions in K-complex probability and N550 amplitude and a significant increase in N550 latency, as a function of age. However, no variable displayed a significant effect of spindle presence/absence, or an age X spindle interaction effect. Conclusions: The data failed to support the hypothesis that sleep spindles are antagonistic to the production of K-complexes, both in terms of the likelihood of K-complexes being elicited or in their amplitude when elicited (N550). The absence of spindle effects on K-complex generation argues against them being two sides of a coin and supports the notion of K-complexes having an extra-thalamic or non-specific generation mechanism.

Hybrid systems are an effective method for developing higher-order decision models in which biomedical signal data can be incorporated. Methods: The hybrid system components include a knowledge-based system that utilizes approximate reasoning techniques, a neural network model based on a potential function approach the supervised learning that uses the general class of Cohen orthogonal functions as potential functions, and a signal analysis component that relies on continuous chaotic modeling to produce a degree of variability in the time series. The hybrid system is illustrated in an application for differentiation among different types of dementia. Results: Application of this method to cardiac diagnosis shows that chaotic parameters alone contribute significantly to correct classification while the addition of clinical parameters increases the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Applications to electroencephalogram analysis indicate that the second-order difference plots display significant differences for the different types of EEG waves identifiable by frequency, both in shape and degree of dispersion. Hence,the identification of these waves, and the duration of their occurrence, may provide suitable variables for chaotic analysis. Conclusions: Results from studies in cardiology demonstrate that using chaotic measures for ECG analysis provide useful information for classification. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are increased if these methods are combined with other clinical parameters in a hybrid system. This approach has been extended to new applications based on EEG analysis combined with other relevant information.

Because a spinal motoneuron and the corresponding muscle fibers form a motor unit with one-to-one correspondence of their action potentials, the EMG indirectly measures the activity of the corresponding spinal neuronal group. The tasks were isometric contraction (Control condition); and isometric contraction with concurrent ignoring of visual Stimuli (VS condition). By comparing the Control and VS conditions, the following results were obtained. The coherence increased significantly in magnitude, but was unchanged in frequency range (beta band) and scalp location; the EEG and EMG spectral power in the beta band were unchanged in amplitude; and the alpha and gamma hands of EEG spectral power were significantly increased and decreased, respectively. These findings suggest that the cortico-muscular coherence reflects the cognitive effort needed to maintain isometric muscle contraction. When visual stimuli need to be ignored, the cognitive effort and cortico-spinal coherence are enhanced. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the findings diverge with respect to which measurement of alpha activity is influenced by memory processes. Here, we differentiate between evoked and total alpha activity in order to separate effects of phase-locking and amplitude modulation. We present data from a delayed-matching-to-sample task (S1-S2 paradigm) for which we compared EEG alpha responses between a perception and a memory condition. Increased total alpha activity was found in the retention interval for the memory as compared to the perception condition. Evoked alpha activity, however, did not differentiate between memory and perception conditions but, instead, was increased for the more complex condition of processing non-Kanizsa figures as compared to Kanizsa figures. Thus, our results demonstrate a functional differentiation between evoked and total alpha activity. While alpha phase locking seemed to be influenced mainly by task complexity, alpha amplitude clearly reflected memory demands in our paradigm.

One proposed mechanism for the claimed effects of homeopathy, a form of complementary medicine used for FM, is time-dependent sensitization (TDS, progressive amplification) of host responses. This study examined possible sensitization-related changes in EEG relative alpha magnitude during a clinical trial of homeopathy in FM. A 4-month randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of daily orally administered individualized homeopathy in physician-confirmed FM, with an additional 2-month optional crossover phase, included three laboratory sessions, at baseline, 3 and 6 months (N=48, age 49.2+/-9.8 years, 94% women). Nineteen leads of EEG relative alpha magnitude at rest and during olfactory administration of treatment and control solutions were evaluated in each session. After 3 months, the active treatment group significantly increased, while the placebo group decreased, in global alpha-1 and alpha-2 during bottle sniffs over sessions. At 6 months, the subset of active patients who stayed on active continued to increase, while the active-switch subgroup reversed direction in alpha magnitude. Groups did not differ in resting alpha. Consistent with the TDS hypothesis, sniff alpha-1 and alpha-2 increases at 6 months versus baseline correlated with total amount of time on active remedy over all subjects (r=0.45, p=.003), not with dose changes or clinical outcomes in the active group. The findings suggest initiation of TDS in relative EEG alpha magnitude by daily oral administration of active homeopathic medicines versus placebo, with laboratory elicitation by temporolimbic olfactory stimulation or sniffing.

J	Price, GW				Price, GW			EEG-dependent ERP recording: using TMS to increase the incidence of a selected pre-stimulus pattern	BRAIN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS			English	Article						event-related potential; transcranial magnetic stimulation; interactive ERP; selective averaging	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; P300; HUMANS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; CORTEX; REAL	EEG dependent event-related potential (ERP) recording (interactive ERP) is an extension to ERP paradigms whereby stimuli are initiated in response to a selected pattern of background EEG. This form of recording is critically dependent upon the incidence of the particular pattern of interest. We introduce here a process that modifies the EEG in a predictable manner so as to increase the incidence of a particular pattern. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimuli are applied in response to a selected pattern of pre-TMS activity, and the post-TMS response is characterized by the incidence of a defined pattern of EEG activity. Analysis of validation test results obtained with the TMS modification part of the process verifies an increased incidence of the response pattern after TMS stimuli, compared with placebo stimuli. The TMS modification procedure is then combined with interactive ERP recording in a two step process to affect the ERP response to sensory stimuli. The post-TMS pattern from the first step becomes the pre-stimulus pattern of the interactive ERP recording in the second step. The TMS modified interactive ERP (TMIERP) process is illustrated here using an auditory oddball paradigm. The amplitude of the P300 peak obtained using this process was significantly higher than that obtained using the standard auditory oddball paradigm.

We used a neuronally plausible model to characterise the dependency of response components on the models parameters. This generative model was a neural mass model of hierarchically arranged areas using three kinds of inter-area connections (forward, backward and lateral). We investigated how responses, at each level of a cortical hierarchy, depended on the strength of connections or coupling. Our strategy was to systematically add connections and examine the responses of each successive architecture. We did this in the context of deterministic responses and then with stochastic spontaneous activity. Our aim was to show, in a simple way, how event-related dynamics depend on extrinsic connectivity. To emphasise the importance of nonlinear interactions, we tried to disambiguate the components of event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs) that can be explained by a linear superposition of trial-specific responses and those engendered nonlinearly (e.g., by phase-resetting). Our key conclusions were; (i) when forward connections, mediating bottom-up or extrinsic inputs, are sufficiently strong, nonlinear mechanisms cause a saturation of excitatory interneuron responses. This endows the system with an inherent stability that precludes nondissipative population dynamics. (ii) The duration of evoked transients increases with the hierarchical depth or level of processing. (iii) When backward connections are added, evoked transients become more protracted, exhibiting damped oscillations. These are formally identical to late or endogenous components seen empirically. This suggests that late components are mediated by reentrant dynamics within cortical hierarchies. (iv) Bilateral connections produce similar effects to backward connections but can also mediate zero-lag phase-locking among areas. (v) Finally, with spontaneous activity, ERPs/ERFs can arise from two distinct mechanisms: For low levels of (stimulus related and ongoing) activity, the systems response conforms to a quasi-linear superposition of separable responses to the fixed and stochastic inputs. This is consistent with classical assumptions that motivate trial averaging to suppress spontaneous activity and disclose the ERP/ ERE However, when activity is sufficiently high, there are nonlinear interactions between the fixed and stochastic inputs.

Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) of the 1-20 Hz EEG frequencies were studied using wavelet transforms in elderly controls, MCI patients and mild probable AD patients performing an auditory-verbal Sternberg memory task. Behaviourally, the AD patients made more errors than the controls and the MCI group. Statistically significant differences during the encoding of the memory set were found between the controls and the MCI group, such that the latter group showed ERD in the similar to 10-20 Hz frequencies. The findings may reflect different.. compensatory encoding strategies in MCI. During retrieval, the most obvious differences were observed between the controls and the AD group: the ERD in the similar to 7-17 Hz frequencies was absent in the AD group particularly in anterior and left temporal electrode locations. This finding might indicate that AD is associated with deficient lexical-semantic processing during the retrieval phase in working memory tasks. Future studies with larger patient groups are needed to establish the diagnostic value of ERD/ERS patterns in MCI and AD. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To investigate adenosinergic mechanisms in these differences, we studied the effects of prolonged waking and the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine on sustained vigilant attention and regional electroencephalogram ( EEG) power in the ranges of theta activity ( 6.25-8.25 Hz) in waking and the slow oscillation (< 1 Hz) in sleep. Activity in these frequencies is functionally related to sleep deprivation. In 12 subjectively caffeine-sensitive and 10-insensitive young men, psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance and EEG were assessed at 3 h intervals before, during, and after one night without sleep. After 11 and 23 h waking, subjects received 200 mg caffeine and placebo in double-blind, cross-over manner. In the placebo condition, sleep deprivation impaired PVT speed more in caffeine-sensitive than in caffeine-insensitive men. This difference was counteracted by caffeine. Theta power in waking increased more in a frontal EEG derivation than in a posterior derivation. Caffeine attenuated this power gradient in caffeine sensitive subjects. Sleep loss also differently affected the power distribution < 1 Hz in non-rapid eye movement sleep between caffeine sensitive and insensitive subjects. Also, this difference was mirrored by the action of caffeine. The effects of sleep deprivation and caffeine on sustained attention and regional EEG power in waking and sleep were inversely related. These findings suggest that adenosinergic mechanisms contribute to individual differences in waking-induced impairment of neurobehavioral performance and functional aspects of EEG topography associated with sleep deprivation.

Our goal was to analyze high-frequency activity recorded with electroencephalograph (EEG) macroelectrodes during the slow wave immediately following interictal spikes, given the potential importance of this presumed hyperpolarization in transforming spikes into seizures. Methods: Depth electrode EEG recordings from 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Spikes were categorized according to localization and morphology. Segments of 256 ms were selected immediately following (postspike), and 2 s before each spike (baseline). Power was estimated in subgamma (0-40 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz), high frequency (100-200 Hz), and very high frequency (250-500 Hz) bands. Results: Changes in power above 100 Hz were seen in 22 of 29 spike categories, consisting primarily of a widespread decrease in frequencies above 100 Hz. This decrease became spatially more restricted as frequencies increased, and coincided with the localization of largest spikes for the highest frequencies. High-frequency power decreases were prominent in the hippocampus but less common in amygdala and neocortex. High-frequency power increases were observed in the amygdala. Conclusions: Thus high-frequency EEG activity can be recorded with macroelectrodes in humans and may provide insights on neuronal mechanisms related to human epilepsy. This activity undergoes consistent modifications after EEG spikes. We propose that the reduction in high frequencies reflects a postspike depression in neuronal activity that is more pronounced in the region of spike generation. This depression is almost always seen in hippocampus but less in amygdala.

Methods: EEG correlation indices (EEGCIs), based on the waveform characteristics of two EEG signals, were used as measures of slow joint activation of cortical regions during visual discrimination in pupils with visual perception disabilities. Results: During visual discrimination low EEGCIs were seen between the left temporal and both parieto-occipital EEG channels in pupils with visual perception disabilities and in pupils with a poor occupational outcome. The pupils with low performance intelligence and those with difficulties in the visual discrimination task had low EEGCls within the left hemisphere. The left hemispheric dominance of the findings is suggested to reflect the psychophysiology of the task since visual discrimination demands attention to details (local processing) and is thus supposed to be more strongly represented in the left hemisphere. Conclusions: During visual discrimination, low EEGCIs were seen in the posterior and left hemispheric regions of pupils with disabilities in visual perception and visual discrimination and with a poor occupational outcome. Significance: Low EEGCIs in posterior and left hemispheric regions during visual discrimination can to some extent be seen as neurophysiological markers for visual perception disabilities and a poor occupational outcome and imply an increased need for adjustment of the educational curriculum and a need for occupational guidance.

In the present study, we investigated these possible preictal changes in long-term intracranial recordings of five patients by a measure of phase synchronization. In order to clearly distinguish preictal changes from all the other interictal states, we developed an automatic extraction of representative patterns of interictal synchronization activity. This reference library was used to classify the successive synchronization patterns of long-term recordings into groups of similar patterns. Altered states of brain synchronization were identified as deviating from patterns in the reference library and were evaluated relative to the times of seizure onset in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Methods: A phase-locking measure was estimated using a sliding window analysis on 15 frequency bands (2 Hz steps between 0 and 30 Hz), for all pairs of EEG channels in the epileptogenic temporal lobe (14-20 channels), over the entire data sets (total analyzed duration 305 h). The preictal identification encompasses three basic stages: (1) a preprocessing stage involving the determination of a reference library of characteristic interictal synchronization patterns using a K-means algorithm, and the identification of discriminant variables differentiating interictal from preictal states, (2) a classification stage of the synchronization pattern via a minimum Mahalanobis distance to the reference patterns, as well as detection of outliers, (3) an evaluation stage, of the sensitivity and specificity of the detection by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Results: In most of the cases (36 of 52 seizures, i.e. 70%), a specific state of brain synchronization can be observed several hours before the actual seizure. The changes involved both increases and decreases of the synchronization levels, occurring mostly within the 4-15 Hz frequency band, and were often localized near the primary epileptogenic zone. Conclusions: The analysis of phase synchronization offers a way to distinguish between a preictal state and normal interictal activity. These findings suggest that brain synchronizations are preictally altered in the epileptogenic temporal lobe, inducing a pathological state of higher susceptibility for seizure activity. Significance: Phase synchronization is capable of extracting information from the EEG that allow the definition of a preictal state. Although the proposed analysis does not constitute genuine seizure anticipation, these changes in neuronal synchronization may provide helpful information for prospective seizure warning.

Methods: Multi-channel EEG recordings from 29 adults, assessed at three different occasions over 2 years were examined. Between-session correlations and consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) across the three experiments were evaluated for both, spectral power features of the resting EEG and ERD/ERS estimates while the participants performed some cognitive task (i.e. different elementary cognitive tasks that put comparable demands on the participants). Results: ERD/ERS values, while subjects performed a cognitive task, demonstrated satisfactory stability and consistency (i.e. > 0.7), whereby the degree of consistency varied as a function of frequency band and brain region. Highest consistency was found for the 8-10 Hz ERD in parieto-occipital recording sites (i.e. > 0.9). In resting EEG, mean alpha (gravity) frequency was the most stable EEG feature. Conclusions: The present data suggest that ERD/ERS phenomena in different narrow frequency bands are rather stable over time and across different situations. The relatively high reproducibility of ERD/ERS promotes the usefulness of this measure in assessing individual differences of physiological activation patterns accompanying cognitive performance. Significance: This study addresses the issue of reproducibility of EEG in general and ERD/ERS experiments in particular, which is a prerequisite for both basic research and clinical studies.

EEG alpha oscillations during the performance of verbal creativity tasks: Differential effects of sex and verbal intelligence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; creativity; intelligence; sex differences; hypofrontality	NEURAL EFFICIENCY; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN; NEUROBIOLOGY; AREAS	Task-related power changes in the EEG alpha band were analyzed in 31 participants (17 males and 14 females) during performance of two verbal creativity tasks. Participants were confronted with verbal problems that are in need of explanation (insight problems) and utopian situations that will actually never happen. In both tasks they were instructed to generate as many but also as unusual, unique or original ideas as possible. To assess brain responses that come along with highly original ideas, individual responses were divided into more and less original ideas (within each participant). Creative problem solving was generally accompanied by lower levels of cortical arousal (i.e., increases in alpha power from a pre-stimulus reference to an activation interval). Additionally, more original (vs. less original) responses were associated with a stronger task-related alpha synchronization in posterior (particularly centroparietal) cortices. Task-related alpha power changes during creative problem solving were also moderated by verbal IQ and sex. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This formulation allows for a faster execution of CLAD by using fast Fourier transform algorithms. The frequency characteristics of the deconvolution filter depends exclusively on the stimulus sequence and determines whether the noncoherent noise is amplified or attenuated in different frequencies. A formula for calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achieved by the deconvolution process is developed. The newly developed theory and the methodology is applied to the extraction of the auditory brainstem and middle latency responses using various sequences. The effect,; of the sequence used and the number of sweeps averaged in ongoing acquisition on SNR are examined by using single sweep recordings. The results verify the deconvolution theory and the methodology and show its limitations. Depending on the frequency characteristics of the sequence, the deconvolution process can amplify or attenuate the EEG noise. Proper selection of the stimulus sequence can increase the SNR enhancement obtained with conventional averaging. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

A time-frequency representation method was applied to EEG data in order to obtain phase-locked gamma band activity (29-45 Hz) and was analyzed within a 0-150 ms time window range. Significant reduction of the gamma band response in the frontal region during target stimulus processing was observed in alcoholic compared to control subjects. In contrast, significantly higher gamma band response for the non-target stimulus was observed in alcoholics compared to controls. It is suggested that the reduction in early evoked frontal gamma band response to targets may be associated with frontal lobe dysfunction commonly observed in alcoholics. This perhaps can be characterized by a deficient top-down processing mechanism. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To obtain the phase, the signal is filtered in such a way that the filter output has minimal relative variation in the amplitude over all filters with complex-valued impulse response. The argument of the filter output yields the phase. Implementation of the algorithm and interpretation of the result are discussed. We argue that the phase obtained by the proposed method has a low susceptibility to measurement noise and a low rate of artificial phase slips. The method is applied for the detection and classification of mode locking in vortex flow meters. A measure for the strength of mode locking is proposed.

We hypothesized that Alpha power decreases during both Stage 2 and REM sleep would index the presence of sleep mentation in these stages. Absolute power for six classical EEG bands and three Alpha subbands was calculated for Stage 2 and REM sleep awakenings both with and without mentation recall. In both stages, recall was associated with lower Alpha power, especially with middle Alpha power (9.5-11.5 Hz). Unexpectedly, a similar effect for Delta power (0.5-4.0 Hz) was also observed. The Alpha effect may reflect cognitive elaboration active in the minutes preceding awakening; however, attention and memory processes cannot be excluded. The Delta effect is consistent with prior observations of regular linkages between Alpha and Delta power during sleep.

Personality was assessed using the NEO-Five-factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and resting brain activity was indexed by eyes closed EEG spectral magnitude from four frequency bands over the entire cortex. Results suggest that there are differences between males and females in the NEO-FFI personality traits. The NEO FFI traits were associated with lower frequency brain activity in both males and females. Mild significant and consistent associations were found between delta and theta activity across all cortical regions with Extraversion and Conscientiousness. There were few associations between personality traits and alpha and beta activity, this was shown in males only. Fewer associations between personality and faster frequency bands such as alpha may be due to the methodological problem of using fixed alpha bands. Multiple regression analyses showed that individual alpha frequencies had a greater contribution to personality traits than fixed band alpha waves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two new methods of measuring coherence between field potentials and EEG channels are proposed for modeling the level of linear association between channels during epileptic seizures. These methods rely upon modeling the repetitive clonic seizure activity as a sum of sinusoids with varying degrees of phase locking. Estimating the amplitude of sinusoids from correlation and cross-correlation time domain data, we can find the coherences from a ratio of these amplitudes. One method utilizes amplitude finding from the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique. The other method uses alterations in amplitude of individual sinusoids and their ratios in a matrix pencil equation formed from cross- and auto-correlation matrices. The corresponding generalized eigenvalues of these equations form the coherence ratios. This utilizes the estimation of signal parameters using rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm to arrive at coherence amplitude ratios. Simulations illustrate that the MUSIC method provides better noise immunity as it outperforms the conventional Fourier transform-based method for coherence estimation. Both coherence estimators reflect presence of sinusoidal components that are propagated or not propagated along a particular transmission pathway. We illustrate the value of both methods by examining the strength of correlation between seizure EEG from specific thalamic nuclei and cortex in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. The pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) chemoconvulsant model in rats reflects selective activation of the anterior thalamic nucleus. Using both methods, this neuronal element has much larger coherence with cortex than another thalamic region, the posterior thalamus (p < 0.05). These methods isolate the unique contribution of anterior thalamus in the formation of an ictal network and corroborate earlier conventional or periodogram techniques.

Using whole-head magnetoencephalography we recordeo brain activity during rest in 23 patients with ischemic cortical lesions to find out whether we can localise and characterise low-frequency oscillatory activity. We measured patients at different times after stroke and partly in a follow-up approach to determine the time course of slow wave activity. Using the analysis tool Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources we computed tomographic maps of oscillatory power in the delta-band (0.5-3 Hz). Fifteen of 23 patients with cortical strokes showed delta-activity, which was localised in an area not more than 2 cm away from the lesion. We found this perilesional low-frequency activity in the acute as well as in the chronic stage of stroke. Follow-up measurements of individual patients revealed persistence of perilesional low-frequency activity for months and even years. No consistent relation between perilesional activity and clinical symptoms was observed. Our results indicate that perilesional delta activity is common after ischemic cortical stroke. However, the functional significance remains to be elucidated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Besides experimental methods carried out either in vitro (human or animal tissue) or in vivo (animals), pathophysiologic mechanisms can be approached by direct recording of brain electrical activity in human epilepsy. Indeed, in some clinical presurgical investigation methods like stereoelectroencephalography, intracerebral electrodes are used in patients suffering from drug resistant epilepsy to directly record paroxysmal activities with excellent temporal resolution (in the order of I millisecond). The study of neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying such depth-EEG activities is crucial to progress in the understanding of the interictal to ictal transition. In this study, the authors relate electrophysiologic patterns typically observed during the transition from interietal to ictal activity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) to mechanisms (at a neuronal population level) involved in seizure generation through a computational model of EEG activity. Intracerebral EEG signals recorded from hippocampus in five patients with MTLE during four periods (during interictal activity, just before seizure onset, during seizure onset, and during ictal activity) were used to identify the three main parameters of a model of hippocampus EEG activity (related to excitation, slow dendritic inhibition and fast somatic inhibition). The identification procedure used optimization algorithms to minimize a spectral distance between real and simulated signals. Results demonstrated that the model generates very realistic signals for automatically identified parameters. They also showed that the transition from interictal to ictal activity cannot be simply explained by an increase in excitation and a decrease in inhibition but rather by time-varying ensemble interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons projecting to either their dendritic or perisomatic region (with slow and fast GABA(A) kinetics). Particularly, during preonset activity, an increasing dendritic GABAergic inhibition compensates a gradually increasing excitation up to a brutal drop at seizure onset when faster oscillations (beta and low gamma band, 15 to 40 Hz) are observed. These faster oscillations are then explained by the model feedback loop between pyramidal cells and interneurons targeting their perisomatic region. These findings obtained from model identification in human temporal lobe epilepsy are in agreement with some results obtained experimentally, either on animal models of epilepsy or on the human epileptic tissue.

However, it remains unclear how these brain regions communicate to exchange information. Recent findings using simultaneous recordings from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the behaving rat have demonstrated that prefrontal cells' firing is phase-locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm. This suggests that phase synchronization clocked by the theta rhythm could be crucial for the communication between hippocampal and prefrontal regions.

High amplitudes as observed during rest usually diminish during cognitive effort. During retention of information in working memory, however, power increase of a oscillations can be observed. This a synchronization has been interpreted as cortical idling or active inhibition. The present study provides evidence that during top-down processing in a working memory task, a power increases, at prefrontal but decreases at occipital electrode sites, thereby reaching a state in which a power and frequency become very similar over large distances. Two experimental conditions were compared. In the first, visuospatial information only had to be retained in memory whereas the second condition additionally demanded manipulation of the information. During the second condition, stronger a synchronization at prefrontal sites and larger occipital a suppression was observed as compared to that for pure retention. This effect was accompanied by assimilation of prefrontal and occipital a frequency, stronger functional coupling between prefrontal and occipital brain areas, and a latency shifts from prefrontal cortex to primary visual areas, possibly indicating the control of posterior cortical activation by anterior brain areas. An increase of prefrontal EEG a amplitudes, which is accompanied by a decrease at posterior sites, thus may not be interpreted in terms of idling or "global" inhibition but may enable a tight functional coupling between prefrontal cortical areas, and thereby allows the control of the execution of processes in primary visual brain regions.

Seizure outcome after surgery for epilepsy due to focal cortical dysplastic lesions	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						malformation of cortical development; focal cortical dysptasia; intractable epilepsy; epilepsy surgery	INTRACTABLE PARTIAL EPILEPSY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; EEG; MALFORMATIONS; CHILDREN; NEOPLASMS; FEATURES; CORTEX	Neocortical development is a highly complex process encompassing cellular proliferation, neuronal migration and cortical organization. At any time this process can be interrupted or modified by genetic or acquired factors causing malformations of cortical development (MCD). Epileptic seizures are the most common type of clinical manifestation, besides developmental delay and focal neurological deficits. Seizures due to MCD are frequently pharmacoresistant, especially those associated to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Surgical therapy results have been reported since 1971, however, currently available data from surgical series are still limited, mainly due to small number of patients, distinct selection of candidates and surgical strategies, variable pathological diagnosis and inadequate follow-up. This study addresses the possibilities of seizure relief following resection of focal cortical dysplasia, and the impact of presurgical evaluation, extent of resection and pathological findings on surgical outcome. We included 41 patients, 22 adults and 19 children and adolescents, with medically intractable seizures operated on from 1996 to 2002. All were submitted to standardized presurgical evaluation including high-resolution MRI, Video-EEG monitoring and ictal. SPECT. Post-surgical. seizure outcome was classified according to Engel's schema. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Fifteen patients had temporal and 26 extratemporal epilepsies. Of the total 26 patients (63.4%) reached seizure-free status post -operatively. There was no correlation between outcome and age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures, and pathotogical findings. There was, however, a clear correlation with topography of FCD (temporal versus extratemporal) and regional ictal EEG onset, on univariate as well as multivariate analysis.

Flexibility in spatial and non-spatial feature grouping: an event-related potentials study. Brain Res Cogn Brain Res 2004;22:13-25] were re-analyzed to identify event-related dynamics of phase-synchronization. Methods: In 20 Hz activity, uniform spreading of phase synchronization in closely spaced (similar to 2 cm) scalp electrodes appears and disappears spontaneously. The lengths of synchronized activity intervals and how they vary as a function of stimulus presentation were compared between task and control conditions. Results: Synchronization reached a maximum in the task condition about 180 ms post-stimulus onset, coinciding with the peak N180 ERP marking the deployment of task-specific attention. Synchronized intervals were longer in the task than in the control condition. Long (above 80 ms) intervals occurred at a stable rate before and just after stimulus onset, but steeply decreased 200-400 ms afterwards. Conclusions: Perceptual tasks lead to longer synchronized intervals in early visual areas. Attention deployment resets the ongoing synchronization. Event-related activity, besides low-frequency ERP, consists of high-frequency short and long synchronized intervals corresponding to evoked bursts and ongoing oscillations, respectively. Significance: High-density scalp recorded EEG revealed synchronization dynamics in a local, early visual area of cortex that can be interpreted as modulation of spontaneous ongoing task-related processes by attention.

We chose 10 healthy infants, who were born without complications other than prematurity, who were 29-30 weeks, 31-32 weeks, and 33-34 weeks of postconceptional age, respectively, at time of electroencephalogram recordings. Fast Fourier transform algorithm was applied for amplitude spectral analysis. The analyzed data were divided into five frequency bands: theta 14-6 Hz, theta 2 6-8 Hz, alpha 8-13 Hz, beta 1 13-20 Hz, and beta 2 20-30 Hz. The average amplitude of six segments with continuous patterns with high-voltage slow waves of preterm infants was calculated in each frequency band. A significant reduction of the amplitude along with postconceptional age was present in all leads in theta 1 and theta 2 bands. On the other hand, a significant correlation with postconceptional age was not observed in alpha, beta 1, or beta 2 bands. In conclusion, maturational electroencephalographic changes assessed by amplitude spectral analysis were prominent in theta activities and were not remarkable in alpha or beta activities.

These methods range from indirect means of measuring changes in cerebral blood flow in local regions of the human cortex (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI), or changes in the electrical activity of the human brain with EEG-recording with topological distributed macroelectrodes, to the use of chronically implanted multiple microelectrodes in primates. fMRI has the disadvantage of low temporal resolution and with multiple microelectrodes long distance measurements cannot yet be properly performed. Accordingly, recording of macro-activity (EEG/ERP or MEG) with a time resolution of millisecond-range is the most possibly adequate method to measure the dynamic properties of memory and the integrative brain function. Since neuroscientists have come to the general conclusion that large numbers of different brain regions have to cooperate for any brain function, the analysis of relationships between different regions of the brain is becoming more and more important. Before new progresses and importance of EEG studies research became clear, scientists working with macrodynamics of the brain had a long way to go, in order to elucidate brain functioning. In this tutorial report we explain in a narrative way the developments leading to the concept of Macrodynamics in search of an integrative brain function. Moreover, elements of a brain theory, which we call neurons-brain theory describing the dynamics of electrical activity in the whole brain, are introduced. The concept of superbinding in integrative brain function, which emerged from experimental data, is a consequence of this theory.

Former EEG studies of our research group demonstrated a reversal-related delta response and a frontal enhancement of gamma activity during multistable perception which has been interpreted as signaling attentional top-down processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional involvement of delta and gamma activity in top-down processes more explicitly by asking 21 healthy participants to bring the reversal rate under voluntary control during viewing of the Necker cube. Slowing down the reversal rate should be accomplished by focussing attention to the currently perceived alternative while speeding up should be accomplished by shifting attention as rapidly as possible from one perspective to the other. EEG was recorded from frontal, central, parietal, and occipital locations of both hemispheres. The data was analysed on the single-sweep level in the delta and gamma frequency range. The results showed that both delta response and gamma power were larger during slowing down than speeding up the reversal rate. These findings may indicate that more attentional resources have to be allocated by the cognitive system in order to prevent a reversal by means of focussed attention than to initiate a reversal by attentional shifts.

The EEGs of 18 males and 21 females (right-handed university students) were recorded during a performance of Remote Associates Task (RAT) compared with the letter-fluency and simple associate's tasks. Gender differences were found in a factor structure of the indices of verbal thinking and a score of generating words was greater in women than men. No significant gender differences in originality of associations were revealed, however, gender-related differences in the EEG-patterns were found at the final and initial stages of RAT. In men, the beta2-power was increased in both hemispheres at the beginning of test. To the end of testing, the power of oscillations in the beta2 band increased only in the central part of the cortex. In women, the beta2-power was increased to a greater extent in the right than in the left hemisphere at the initial stage of task performance, whereas the final stage was characterized by a relative decrease in beta-activity in parietotemporal cortical regions and increase in the left prefrontal region. It is suggested that the verbal creative thinking in men is based mostly on "insight" strategy whereas women additionally involve the "intellectual" strategy.

We have previously shown that mGIuR7 deletion in mice produces a selective working memory (WM) impairment, while other types of memory such as reference memory remain unaffected. Since WM has been associated with Theta activity (6-12 Hz) in EEGs, and since EEG abnormalities have been observed in these mice before, we studied the effect of mGIuR7 gene ablation on EEG activity in the hippocampus, in particular in the Theta range, during performance of a WM task. In an eight-arm maze with four arms baited, mGIuR7 knock-out (KO) and wild-type mice committed the same number of reference memory errors, whereas KOs committed more WM errors. While performing the task, KO mice showed substantially higher Theta amplitudes, and the ratio of Theta to overall EEG power was much increased. No change was seen in the Delta (0-5 Hz), or Gamma (30-40 Hz) EEG bands compared with controls. When recording EEGs during periods of rest in the home cages, no difference was seen between groups. These findings suggest that mGIuR7 is important for modulation and control of Theta activity. Since only WM was affected, and only the Theta range of EEG activity was altered, these results show a correlation between Theta rhythm and WM performance, and therefore support the concept that Theta activity in the hippocampus is involved in WM storage.

Nucleus- and species-specific properties of the slow (< 1 hz) sleep oscillation in thalamocortical neurons	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; delta waves; T-type calcium channels; metabotropic glutamate receptor	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THALAMIC RELAY NEURONS; IN-VITRO; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; DELTA-WAVES; K-COMPLEX; RAT; CAT; ACTIVATION	The slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm is an electroencephalogram hallmark of resting sleep. In thalamocortical neurons this rhythm correlates with a slow (< 1 Hz) oscillation comprising recurring UP and DOWN membrane potential states. Recently, we showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation brings about an intrinsic slow oscillation in thalamocortical neurons of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro which is identical to that observed in vivo. The aim of this study was to further assess the properties of this oscillation and compare them with those observed in thalamocortical neurons of three other thalamic nuclei in the cat (ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body; ventral lateral nucleus) and two thalamic nuclei in rats and mice (lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex). Slow oscillations were evident in all of these additional structures and shared several basic properties including, i) the stereotypical, rhythmic alternation between distinct UP and DOWN states with the UP state always commencing with a low-threshold Ca2+ potential, and ii) an inverse relationship between frequency and injected current so that slow oscillations always increase in frequency with hype rpola rizatio n, often culminating in delta (delta) activity at similar to 1-4 Hz. However, beyond these common properties there were important differences lin expression between different nuclei. Most notably, 44% of Slow oscillations in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus possessed UP states that comprised sustained tonic firing and/or high-threshold bursting. In contrast, slow oscillations in cat ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body and ventral lateral nucleus thalamocortical neurons exhibited such UP states in only 16%, 11% and 10% of cases, respectively, whereas slow oscillations in the lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex of rats and mice did so in < 12% of cases. Thus, the slow oscillation is a common feature of thalamocortical neurons that displays clear species and nuclei-related differences. The potential functional significance of these results is discussed. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This allowed examination of ongoing EEG activity during visual stimulation in the pain-free phase of migraine. Methods: Flash stimuli at frequencies of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 Hz were delivered to 15 migraine patients without aura and 15 controls, with the EEG recorded from 18 scalp electrodes, referred to the linked earlobes. The EEG signals were filtered in the alpha (7.5-13 Hz) band. For all stimulus frequencies that we evaluated, the phase synchronization index was based on the Hilbert transformation. Results: Phase synchronization separated the patients and controls for the 9, 24 and 27 Hz stimulus frequencies; hyper phase synchronization was observed in patients, whereas healthy subjects were characterized by a reduced phase synchronization. These differences were found in all regions of the scalp. Conclusions: During migraine, the brain synchronizes to the idling rhythm of the visual areas under certain photic stimulations; in normal subjects however, brain regions involved in the processing of sensory information demonstrate desynchronized activity. Hypersynchronization of the alpha rhythm may suggest a state of cortical hypoexcitability during the interictal phase of migraine. Significance: The employment of non-linear EEG analysis may identify subtle functional changes in the migraine brain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Material and methods - Therapeutically equivalent doses (150 mg OXC for every 100 mg CBZ) were compared in 20 adult patients. Neurological investigation, conventional and spectral EEG analysis, brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) were carried out in both treatment conditions. EEG and BAER data of 20 age-matched healthy controls helped interpretation. Primary target variables (electrophysiological parameters) were evaluated blindly. Results - There were no significant differences between treatment conditions concerning the neurological condition, lack of clinically evident neurotoxicity, seizure frequency and EEG spike frequency. OXC treatment was characterized by less delta, theta, and alpha power, more beta power, and significantly greater mean alpha frequency (P = 0.03 and 0.05 for the left and right occipital leads, respectively), than CBZ treatment. Interpeak latencies were prolonged in the CBZ condition as compared with normals (P = 0.01) and OXC (P = 0.02). Conclusion - In this cohort of patients substitution of OXC for CBZ was associated with significant normalization of electrophysiological parameters, indicating decreasing neurotoxicity while shifting from CBZ to OXC monotherapy.

This study was a systematic replication of our previous work. In the present double blind study, all subjects performed the memory task both with and without exposure to a digital 902 MHz field in a counterbalanced order. We were not able to replicate the findings from our earlier study. All eight of the significant changes in our earlier study were not significant in the present double blind replication. Also, the effect of EMF on the number of incorrect answers in the memory task was inconsistent. We previously reported no significant effect of EMF exposure on the number of incorrect answers in the memory task, but a significant increase in errors was observed in the present study. We conclude that EMF effects on the EEG and on the performance on memory tasks may be variable and not easily replicable for unknown reasons. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We proceed from the general hypothesis, originally proposed by Erol Basar that ERP's are generated by a super-position of evoked oscillations with different frequencies. Based on findings about event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), we analyze the following specific hypotheses. If evoked theta and alpha oscillations contribute to the generation of ERP components and if their functional role, type of reactivity and frequency specificity are similar to those of event-related oscillations (measured by ERD/ERS), we expect (i) to see the same functional relationship between frequency and cognitive processes, (ii) the same type of "reactivity" and a (iii) dependency of latency measures of evoked components on IAF. By reviewing respective data, we demonstrate that similar to research about event-related oscillations, evoked alpha reflects attention, whereas evoked theta reflects working memory processes. Furthermore, it was found that individual alpha frequency (IAF) has a significant influence on P1 latency in particular. For a better understanding of these findings, we outline a new theoretical framework. We assume that the P1-N1 complex is generated by an interplay between the synchronous activation of three neuronal network systems, a working memory, attentional, and semantic memory system, each operating with a different frequency, the first in the theta (about 6 Hz), the second in the lower alpha (about 8 Hz) and the third in the upper alpha (about 12 Hz) frequency range. The implications of this theoretical framework are discussed by reviewing research using phase sensitive measures to analyze "local" and "large scale" integration processes between different neural networks.

J	Buhl, DL; Buzsaki, G				Buhl, DL; Buzsaki, G			Developmental emergence of hippocampal fast-field "ripple" oscillations in the behaving rat pups	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ripple; fast oscillation; EEG; gap junction; development	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; BINDING PROTEIN PARVALBUMIN; HZ ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; GAP-JUNCTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; ENTORHINAL AXIS	Sharp wave and associated fast oscillatory ripples (140-200 Hz) in the cornu ammonis 1 region are the most synchronous hippocampal patterns in the adult rat. Spike sequences associated with sharp waves are believed to play a critical role in transferring transient memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex and the emergence of super-fast ripples is pathognostic in temporal lobe epilepsy. Sharp waves in cornu ammonis 1 stratum radiatum are induced by a strong depolarization by the cornu ammonis 3 Schaffer collaterals, due to the synchronous discharge of cornu ammonis 3 pyramidal cells. Although during the first postnatal week, sharp-wave events are associated with hippocampal unit bursts in the pyramidal layer, ripple oscillations are absent. We investigated the emergence of fast-field oscillations in rat pups ranging from postnatal day 12-20 by recording with wire tetrodes in freely behaving pups and with 16-site linear silicon probes in head fixed animals. Cornu ammonis 1 pyramidal cell layer was determined by the presence of multiple unit activity and a reversal of the field potential in the deeper electrode sites. On-line verification of the recording sites was determined via an evoked response to commissural stimulation, showing a clear reversal in the field potential. Sharp wave-associated fast-field oscillations did not begin to emerge until the end of the second postnatal week and showed a gradual increase until day 18. Once ripples emerged, the intra-ripple frequency assumed adult values. The developmental time course of the ripple parallels the switch in the GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling from excitation to inhibition. The time course may also reflect hitherto unidentified emergence of neuronal gap junctions. (c) 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bruns, A				Bruns, A			Fourier-, Hilbert- and wavelet-based signal analysis: are they really different approaches?	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						spectral analysis; time-frequency analysis; amplitude; phase; analytic signal; coherence; phase synchrony; envelope correlation	BRAIN SIGNALS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL AREAS; COHERENCE; TRANSFORM; EEG	Spectral signal analysis constitutes one of the most important and most commonly used analytical tools for the evaluation of neurophysiological signals. It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals.

We addressed this question by measuring local field potentials and single unit activity simultaneously from multiple electrodes placed in extrastriate visual cortex while monkeys were performing a working memory task. We describe a significant enhancement in theta band energy during the delay period. Theta oscillations had a systematic effect on single neuron activity, with neurons emitting more action potentials near their preferred angle of each theta cycle. Sample-selective delay activity was enhanced if only action potentials emitted near the preferred theta angle were considered. Our results suggest that extrastriate visual cortex is involved in short-term maintenance of information and that theta oscillations provide a mechanism for structuring the recurrent interaction between neurons in different brain regions that underlie working memory.

All cells reported in this study were labeled with Neurobiotin and classified as theta-related or non-theta-related according to the system of Colom and Bland [Colom, L.V, Bland, B.H., 1987. State-dependent spike train dynamics of hippocampal formation neurons: evidence for theta-ON and theta-OFF cells. Brain Res. 422; 277-286]. The findings are the first demonstration that hippocampal pyramidal cells are functionally heterogeneous in relation to the generation of theta-band oscillation and synchrony. In field CA1 pyramidal cells formed theta-related subsets of phasic theta-ON cells and tonic theta-ON cells and non-theta-related subsets of simple spike discharging cells, complex spike discharging cells and "silent" cells. Similar findings were evident for CA3 pyramidal cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The following hypotheses were tested and could be confirmed: (i) theta and alpha show a significant increase in phase locking during the time window of the P1 and N1 as compared to a prestimulus reference, (ii) the dynamics of event-related changes in evoked theta and alpha power obey the same principles as are known from event-related de-/synchronization research, and (iii) latency measures of the P1-N1 complex are negatively correlated with individual alpha frequency. In addition, we have found that theta phase locking is larger during encoding than recognition and that good memory performers show a larger increase in theta and alpha phase locking during recognition in the time window of the N1. Our general conclusion is that the P1-N1 complex is generated primarily by evoked alpha and theta oscillations reflecting the synchronous activation of a working- and semantic memory system.

Methods: Forty-nine HLA DQB1*0602-positive patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy (32 men and 17 women, aged 18-46 years) were included together with 37 age-matched normal controls. Each subject underwent one polysomnographic night recording after an adaptation night. Sleep stages were scored following standard criteria and CAP A phases were detected and classified into 3 subtypes (A1, A2, and A3). Power spectra for frequencies between 0.5 and 25 Hz were obtained for each CAP condition, separately in sleep stage 2 and SWS. Results: Narcoleptic patients displayed reduced total CAP rate. A selective reduction ill the number of A1 subtypes/hour and a reduced A3 index were found in narcoleptics who had also a smaller average number of CAP sequences. Narcoleptic patients had higher power spectra for fast frequencies mostly during SWS, while REM sleep power spectra showed significantly higher power density for frequency bins 0.5-1.5, 8.5-9.5, and 17.5-25 Hz. Similarly, CAP A1 subtypes and NCAP epochs during SWS displayed significantly higher power density for fast frequency bins. Conclusions: The main finding of this study is that the Occurrence of the A1 CAP subtypes is impaired during NREM sleep in narcoleptic patients. Thus, narcolepsy seems to be accompanied not only by alterations of REM but also NREM sleep which is subtly but significantly impaired. as reflected by CAP and the corresponding EEG spectral analysis. Significance: Our findings might indicate that in narcolepsy very-slow oscillation processes less effective than normal might be present, with a subtly impaired capability of grouping the other sleep EEG activities; this aspect deserves further insight in order to obtain a better understanding of its functional meaning, (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

It takes into account not only the anatomical location of the "site of the beginning and of the primary organization" of the epileptic discharge, but also how this discharge gives rise to the accompanying clinical symptoms. This definition is different from the North American view since, for the french authors, the epileptogenic zone is not synonymous with what can be called the "what-to-remove area". In fact, it is above all a conceptual definition which emphazises the importance of studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of seizure discharges, and not only their starting point.

However, spindles reduction and their relationship with K-complexes following deep cerebral venous thrombosis have not been reported. An 18-year-old woman suffered from a deep cerebral venous thrombosis with vasogenic oedema located predominantly in the thalami. Stage 2 steep EEG recorded in acute setting showed preservation of K-complexes but absent 12-14 Hz steep spindles, which were replaced by spindle-like theta oscillations. One month later, the patient having completely recovered, steep spindles were normally seen on the control EEG. This case illustrates that deep cerebral venous thrombosis, through a vasogenic oedema, may transiently affect thalamic functions such as spindles generation. Furthermore, thalamic impairment may lead to dissociation of spindle and K-complex activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

They select and pre-process the information carried by sensory stimuli as sense data, from which they construct meaning. They post-process cognitive meaning into informative commands that control the goal-directed actions that express meaning. Meaning exists in the interaction of subjects with their environments. The process of perception by which brains construct meaning from information can be explained by analyzing the neural activity in human and animal brains as subjects engage in meaningful behaviors. Measurement is followed by decomposition and modeling of the neural activity in order to deduce brain operations. Brains function hierarchically with neuronal interactions within and between three levels: microscopic of single neurons, mesoscopic of local networks forming modules, and macroscopic of the global self-organization of the cerebral hemispheres by the organic unity of neocortex. Information is carried in continuous streams of microscopic axonal pulses. Meaning is carried in mesoscopic local mean fields of dendritic currents in discontinuous frames resembling cinemas, each frame having a spatial pattern of amplitude modulation of an aperiodic carrier wave.

Testing was carried out by studying interdependence between cortical electrical and respiratory activities, by means of linear and nonlinear signal analysis techniques. Both physiological activities were evaluated through simultaneous power signals, derived from the power of the low-frequency band of the electroencephalogram (pEEG-LF), and from the power of the EMG-icm (pEMG-icm), respectively. During both DTP and NTP, there was a significant coherence between both signals in the main frequency band of pEMG-icm. During both DTP and NTP, the nonlinear index N measured significant linear asymmetric interdependence between pEEG-LF and pEMG-icm. The N value obtained between pEEG-LF vs. pEMG-icm was greater than the one between pEMG-icm vs. pEEGLF. This means that the system that generates the pEEG-LF is more complex than the one that generates the pEMG-icm, and suggests that the temporal variability of power in the low-frequency cortical electrical activity is driven by the power of the respiratory activity.

Some of them leave stable traces, and others fade away quickly. Recent advances in functional imaging methods allow researchers to contrast neuronal patterns of remembered against not remembered events at initial encoding. Research on young adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), intracranial, and standard electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings has identified differences between remembered and not remembered items in patterns of medio-temporal and prefrontal brain activity. However, little is known about the ways in which such neuronal patterns of successful encoding evolve across the lifespan as a function of maturation, senescence, and the accumulation of experience. Here, we first review empirical evidence on neuronal correlates of successful memory from middle childhood to old age. Based on the observation that associative and strategic components of episodic memory seem to follow different age gradients, we propose a conceptual framework for predicting age changes in neuronal patterns of successful encoding.

These reactions were observed in different areas of the cortex in response to positive and differentiated conditioned stimuli. Regional features between the spectra were found both in the power level and frequency structure. The power of the reactions in the visual and parietal areas of the left hemisphere was higher than in the motor areas. Power spectra of reactions to differentiated stimuli were significantly lower than the spectra of reactions to positive stimuli mainly owing to the high-frequency components (80-225 Hz). In these both cases, prestimulus power spectra did not differ. The frequency structure of corresponding EEG-reactions consisted of individual spectral peaks, mainly both gamma (3080 Hz) and higher-frequency (80-225 Hz) bands.

To further explore the functional role of oscillatory synchrony during language processing, we quantified event-related EEG power changes induced by the presentation of open-class (OC) words and closed-class (CC) words in a wide range of frequencies (from I to 30 Hz), while subjects read a short story. Word presentation induced three oscillatory components: a theta power increase (4-7 Hz), an alpha power decrease (10-12 Hz), and a beta power decrease (16-21 Hz). Whereas the alpha and beta responses showed mainly quantitative differences between the two word classes, the theta responses showed qualitative differences between OC words and CC words: A theta power increase was found over left temporal areas for OC words, but not for CC words. The left temporal theta increase may index the activation of a network involved in retrieving the lexical-semantic properties of the OC items.

It results from lack of the functional maternal allele of UBE3A, which encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase. Different mechanisms of UBE3A inactivation correlate with clinical phenotypes of varying severity; the majority of cases of AS are due to a de novo maternal deletion of the 15q11-q13 region. Methods: Ube3a maternal-deficient mice (Ube3a m-/p+) were generated in a C57BI/6J background. This study compares cortical EEG and architecture of the sleep-waking cycle in adult Uhe3a m-/p+ mice compared with those of age-matched WT (m+/p+) mice, under baseline conditions or after 4-h sleep deprivation (SD). Results: Ube3a m-/p+ mice exhibited: reduced slow-wave sleep (SWS) amount with increase waking (W) at the dark/light transitions; increased SWS and W episode numbers; and deterioration of paradoxical sleep (PS) over 24 h [amount: -44%; episode duration: -46%; episode number: -40%; theta peak frequency (TPF) acceleration: 7.6 Hz vs. 7.0 Hz in WT mice]. Characteristic paroxysmal EEG discharges are observed during W and SWS associated with synchronous muscle bursting activity during hypoactive W. During the recovery period following SD, Ube3a m-/p+ mice exhibited no rebound either in slow-wave activity (+89% in WT) or in delta-power spectra but a slight rebound in PS amount (+20%). Conclusions: These data validate the mouse model produced by null mutation of the maternal Ube3a gene and provide useful results to investigate and better understand the molecular basis of sleep disturbances in AS patients.

J	Konareva, IN				Konareva, I. N.			Correlations between the Psychological Peculiarities of an Individual and the Efficacy of a Single Neurofeedback Session (by the EEG Characteristics)	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram; feedback by EEG characteristics (neurofeedback); individual psychological characteristics; personality questionnaires		Modifications of different EEG rhythms induced by a single neurofeedback session (by the EEG characteristics) directed toward an increase in the ratio of the spectral powers (SPs) of the alpha vs theta oscillations were compared with the psychological characteristics of the tested subjects (the group included 30 persons). A generally accepted neurofeedback technique was used; the intensity of acoustic white noise served as the feedback signal. EEG potentials were recorded from the C3 and C4 leads. Psychological testing was carried out using Eysenck's (EPQ), Rusalov's (OST), and Cattell's (16 PF) questionnaires. The directions of changes in the SPs of EEG frequency components were found to significantly correlate with some individuality-related peculiarities of the tested subjects. The SP of the delta rhythm correlated with the EPQ scale "neuroticism," OST scale " social plasticity, "and 16 PF factors H ("parmia"), I ("premsia"), and Q(3) ("self-control of behavior"). The SP of the theta component demonstrated correlations with the OST scales "ergisity," "plasticity," and "social temp" and with 16 PF factors M ("autia"), Q(4) ("frustration"), and Q1 ("exvia"). The SP of the alpha rhythm correlated with 16 PF factors Q(3) ("self-control of behavior"), G ("strength of superEgo"), O ("hypothymia"), L ("protension"), and N ("shrewdness"). The SP of the beta rhythm correlated with the OST scale "emotionality," while that of the gamma rhythm showed correlations with the 16 PF indices L ("protension") and M ("autia"). Changes in the ratio of the alpha vs theta SPs correlated with the EPQ scale "neuroticism." Thus, our data confirm the statement that a high individual variability of the results of a single (first in the series) neurofeedback session is to a great extent related to peculiarities of the individual psychological pattern of the subject.

Simultaneously, the effect on cognitive function and the relationship between educational underachievement and cognitive impairment were evaluated, focusing on memory, attention, speed of information processing, and intelligence level. This study was an open, controlled, parallel-group, nonrandomized clinical investigation. Eligible patients were selected when referred to our center for assessment of relationships between epilepsy and learning impairment in the years 1997 to 2001. Separately, children without neurologic deficit and without educational delay were assessed with the same tests as the children with epilepsy. This latter group is used in this study as a control group. One hundred seventy-six children with epilepsy and 113 controls were included. Gender distribution and age were comparable for the two groups. All children were in regular primary education. The children were assessed with a test battery consisting of tests for educational achievement, cognitive tests and tests for reaction time, and tests for memory, and intelligence. Multivariate analysis of variance for tests of educational achievement showed a statistically significant effect for type of epilepsy (F = 4.386; P = .04), caused by the statistically lower scores for patients with localized epilepsy and symptomatic generalized epilepsy. For the reaction-time tests, a statistically significant effect for epileptiform EEG discharges (F = 3.165; P = .01) and treatment (F = 4.472; P = .001) on both vigilance tests was found, caused by patients with frequent epileptiform EEG discharges and polytherapy. Two-way interactions showed an interaction with type of epilepsy, with more patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy having frequent epileptiform EEG discharges and polytherapy. For memory, none of the analyses showed statistically significant effects. For intelligence only for type of epilepsy,. a statistically significant effect was found (F = 10.174; P =< .001). We propose a model with the type of epilepsy (epilepsy syndrome) as the dominant factor explaining educational underachievement in children with epilepsy. Such educational underachievement is most prominent for the localized and symptomatic generalized epilepsies, which suggests a dominant impact of underlying etiology (brain dysfunction or damage). These epilepsies are characterized specifically by a lower intelligence; hence, this could be the primary cognitive factor mediating between the type of epilepsy, and educational underachievement. From the other factors, treatment (the use of polytherapy) and frequent epileptiform EEG discharges are associated with impaired vigilance, which could have an additional influence on educational achievement. These factors are, however, not independent of the type of epilepsy.

However, so far there was no direct evidence for an interaction between these two structures during memory formation. Transient coupling of neural assemblies can be accomplished by phase synchronisation of gamma activity, i.e. EEG activity in the frequency range above 20 Hz. Method: In a group of 9 patients with unilateral MTL-epilepsies the event-related EEG was recorded with depth electrodes during a word-memory task. The EEG responses of the non-pathological MTL for later remembered and forgotten words were compared. Additionally, the continuous EEG was recorded during sleep with depth and scalp electrodes in a group of 8 patients. Phase synchronisation and spectral coherence were quantified as measures for a neural coupling. Results: Successful memory formation is accompanied by an initial stimulus-related increase of phase synchronisation between rhinal cortex and hippocampus and a later decrease. These memory-related synchronisation changes are interindividually correlated with increases of rhinal-hippocampal theta (4-7Hz) coherence. Compared to the waking state rhinal-hippocampal coherence decreases during sleep, most pronounced within the gamma-band. Discussion: The changes of theta coherence probably reflect a slowly modulated connectivity between rhinal cortex and hippocampus, while gamma synchronisation accomplishes the fast coupling and decoupling processes, which initiate and later terminate the information transfer between both structures. The reduced rhinal-hippocampal coupling during sleep may represent an indirect electrophysiological correlate of the diminished ability to encode memories during sleep.

We have attempted to investigate if the increase in beta power is a 'state' or 'trait' marker for alcoholism. This study also explores the gender differences in the expression of this potential risk marker. Absolute beta power in three bands-beta 1(12-16 Hz), beta 2 (16-20 Hz), and beta 3 (20-28 Hz)-in the eyes closed EEG of 171 high risk (HR) subjects who were offspring of male alcoholics and 204 low risk (LR) subjects with no family history of alcoholism, were compared for each gender separately using a repeated measures analysis of variance design. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic subjects within the high risk group were compared using a repeated measures design as a follow-up analysis. The present study demonstrated increased beta power in the resting EEG of offspring of male alcoholics. Male HR subjects had higher beta 1 (12-16 Hz) power and female HR subjects had increased power in beta 2 (16-20 Hz) and beta 3 (20-28 Hz) as compared with low risk participants. Female HR subjects also showed significantly increased beta 2 and beta 3 power if they had two or more alcoholic first-degree relatives when compared with HR females having only an affected father. Risk characteristics are expressed differentially in males and females and may be an index of differential vulnerability to alcoholism. The results indicate that increased EEG beta power can be considered as a likely marker of risk for developing alcoholism and may be used as a predictive endophenotype. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

They applied the chosen bandpass filters (4-8, 8-15, 15-20, 20-32 Hz) to the VEPs of subjects and obtained four different components for each VEP. The first aim of this study is to improve the previous report using some methods in time-frequency domain to estimate interhemispheric delays and amplitudes in a time window. Using the improved estimates of interhemispheric delays, the second aim is to estimate the proportion of callosal fibers of different diameters that are activated by visual stimuli by comparing amplitudes of VEPs in different frequency bands. If the relation between frequency components of VEP and delays for callosal fibers of different dimension were reliable, it would give us an opportunity to deal with amplitude of bandpass-filtered VEPs in order to see approximately the proportion of these fibers activated by a certain stimulus. By using frequency-dependent shifts in time and maximizing the cross correlation of direct VEP (DVEP-VEP obtained from contralateral hemisphere)-indirect VEP (IVEP-VEP obtained from ipsilateral hemisphere) pairs in the time-frequency domain, we examined the delay not only at P100 and N160 peaks but along a meaningful time interval as well. Furthermore, by shifting back the IVEP according to the delay estimated at each time window, both the amplitudes and energies of the synchronized DVEP-IVEP pairs were compared at the chosen frequency bands. The percentages of IVEPs at each band was then examined further in conjunction with the distribution of axon diameters in the posterior pole of the CC, questioning the relation between the distributions of the axon diameters and activations at each band. We established an energy definition to express the activation in the fibers. When the energy percentages of IVEPs in theta and alpha were totaled, they were found to be between 76.2% and 81.6%, which is close to the value 74-77% for fibers of 0.4-1 mum in diameter obtained from anatomical study of human CC. The sum of energy percentages in the beta1 and beta2 bands was between 20.1% and 24.2%, which probably reflects the proportion of activation of callosal fibers 1-3 mum in diameter.

Bulbar interneurons such as periglomerular and granule cells are thought to influence mitral/tufted odorant receptive fields through mechanisms such as lateral inhibition. The mitral - granule cell circuit is also important in the generation of the odor-evoked fast oscillations seen in the olfactory bulb local field potentials and hypothesized to be an important indicator of odor quality coding. Infant rats, however, lack a majority of these inhibitory interneurons until the second week of life. It is unclear if these developmental differences affect olfactory bulb odor coding or behavioral odor discrimination. The following experiments are aimed at better understanding odor coding and behavioral odor discrimination in the developing olfactory system. Single-unit recordings from mitral/tufted cells and local field- potential recordings from both the olfactory bulb and anterior piriform cortex were performed in freely breathing urethane-anesthetized rats ( postnatal day 7 to adult). Age-dependent behavioral odor discrimination to a homologous series of ethyl esters was also examined using a cross-habituation paradigm. Odorants were equated in all experiments for concentration ( 150 ppm) using a flow dilution olfactometer. In concordance with the reduced interneuron population, local field potentials in neonates lacked detectable odor-evoked gamma-frequency oscillations that were observed in mature animals. However, mitral/tufted cell odorant receptive fields and behavioral odor discrimination did not significantly change, despite known substantial changes in local circuitry and neuronal populations, over the age range examined. The results suggest that high-frequency local field- potential oscillations do not reflect processes critical for simple odor discrimination.

The EEG activity of the two sleep stages is almost indistinguishable by visual inspection. Although many efforts have been directed toward understanding the process of falling asleep, little is known about differences in EEG activity between stage 1 (S1) and R-EM sleep. Polysomnography of 8 healthy young adults from S 1, REM sleep and wakefulness was recorded. Spectral power and spectral correlation were obtained for 1-50 Hz. Stage 1 was distinguished (ANOVAs) from REM sleep by lower power in 1-9 Hz, higher power in alpha, beta and gamma, lower interhemispheric correlation in 1-8 Hz and gamma, and higher right correlation in 30-50 Hz. It differed from wakefulness by lower power in 9-50 Hz, but not in 1-8 Hz, or in inter- and intrahemispheric, correlation. EEG differences between S I and REM sleep reside not only in changes in power but also in coherent activity. The different behavior of slow and fast frequencies suggests two different mechanisms involved in the gate into sleep, one implicated in promoting sleep, the thalamocortical oscillator mode and the other in reducing alertness involving activation mechanisms. Stage I is a mixed state, alertness is already reduced but sleep-promoting mechanisms are not yet fully installed. The EEG differences between these two sleep stages contribute to the understanding of REM sleep and S1 physiology and may be relevant for understanding disorders in falling asleep.

Long-range phase synchronization is often observed by scalp EEG measurements during cognitive tasks and is considered to provide a possible neural principle for the functional integration of distributed neural activities. Synchronization could be reflected at the neuron firing level or at the local field potential and could appear in the scalp EEG under certain conditions on neural spatial and temporal coherence. To examine if phase synchronization is concerned with the integration of distant regions, we proposed a method to extract brain activities associated with task-dependent phase synchronization by combining simultaneous fMRI and EEG. By applying this method in a mental arithmetic task, we found a dominant task-dependent increase of phase synchronization around 14 Hz (in beta frequency) across bilateral parietal sites that were associated with both negative and positive BOLD responses. Functional connectivity analyses of these regions demonstrated that an increase in hemispheric beta synchronization was associated with a linking between the cross-hemispheric regions (left angular gyrus and right superior parietal gyros) and also among the anterior-posterior regions (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen, and right superior temporal gyrus). These findings indicate that the positive BOLD regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule) are linked with other negative BOLD regions. We also discussed the possible importance of beta synchronization in the formation of a working memory network. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The ERN is believed to index brain processes that monitor action outcomes. Our previous analyses of ERP and EEG data suggested that the ERN is dominated by partial phase-locking of intermittent theta-band EEG activity. In this paper, this possibility is further evaluated. Methods: The possibility that the ERN is produced by phase-locking of theta-band EEG activity was examined by analyzing the single-trial EEG traces from a forced-choice speeded response paradigm before and after applying theta-band (4-7 Hz) filtering and by comparing the averaged and single-trial phase-locked (ERP) and non-phase-locked (other) EEG data. Electrical source analyses were used to estimate the brain sources involved in the generation of the ERN. Results: Beginning just before incorrect button presses in a speeded choice response paradigm, midfrontal theta-band activity increased in amplitude and became partially and transiently phase-locked to the subject's motor response, accounting for 57% of ERN peak amplitude. The portion of the theta-EEG activity increase remaining after subtracting the response-locked ERP from each trial was larger and longer lasting after error responses than after correct responses, extending on average 400 ms beyond the ERN peak. Multiple equivalent-dipole source analysis suggested 3 possible equivalent dipole sources of the theta-bandpassed ERN, while the scalp distribution of non-phase-locked theta amplitude suggested the presence of additional frontal theta-EEG sources. Conclusions: These results appear consistent with a body of research that demonstrates a relationship between limbic theta activity and action regulation, including error monitoring and learning.

Methods: EEG was recorded from 23 subjects while they performed a simple choice reaction time task requiring discrimination of squares and circles. In separate blocks stimulus size, duration, and eccentricity were manipulated. EEG was recorded from 64 electrodes. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the analysis of gamma-band activity. Results: Amplitude of the GBR was diminished for small and peripheral stimuli. With short stimulus durations ON and OFF responses of the GBR merged into one peak. In comparison, VEP amplitudes were less susceptible to stimulus features. In contrast to VEP latencies, however, GBR latency did not show a lateralization for eccentric stimuli. Conclusions: In addition to previous experiments which have shown a modulation of the GBR by various cognitive processes, the present results demonstrate the susceptibility of the GBR in human EEG to exogenous factors, as numerous intracortical recordings in non-human primates have shown before. The results suggest that the human GBR resides in early visual areas. Significance: The demonstration of the susceptibility of the GBR to stimulus properties implies that studies aimed at exploring the involvement of the GBR in information processing have to be designed carefully. It also constrains the localization of the human GBR. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design: Sleep was polygraphically recorded for 2 consecutive nights, and blood was sampled during the last 24 hours. Setting: The University of Chicago Clinical Research Center. Participants: Two groups of healthy nonobese older subjects: 10 men (59 +/- 2 years), and 10 postmenopausal women (63 +/- 2 years). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: A spectral analysis of the EEG was performed in the delta and alpha bands. There were no sex differences in sleep stages. Blood sampling resulted in reductions of total sleep time, sleep maintenance, slow-wave sleep, and absolute delta activity that were all larger in women than in men. In absolute values, delta and alpha activities in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were higher in women than in men, but, for delta activity, the sex differences were larger in REM than in NREM sleep. In women, but not in men, absolute delta activity in REM was decreased during blood sampling and was strongly correlated with absolute delta activity in NREM. Delta activity in REM did not dissipate across the night in either group. When normalized for the activity in REM sleep, the sex difference in delta activity in NREM sleep was reversed, with lower activity in women. Conclusions: Sex differences in sleep EEG variables are present in older adults. When normalized, delta activity in older women is lower than in older men, which may be more consistent with sex differences in subjective complaints, in fragility of sleep in the presence of environmental disturbances, and in the relationship to growth-hormone release.

Methods: The sample consisted of 17 (11 males, 6 females), right-handed, healthy, volunteer participants. Event-related activity was recorded under the omitted stimulus paradigm. Alpha response was obtained through digital filtering. The alpha response of each participant was separately analyzed. Results: The ARIMA(0,2,1) model was found to be applicable to alpha response that was evoked by stimulus omission. ARIMA (0,2,1) shows that this activity is short-lasting and it fluctuates stochastically. Conclusion: The present study showed that the alpha responses of single participants obtained under the omitted stimulus paradigm were best modeled by the ARIMA (0, 2, 1) type of time series model.

Quantitative analysis of EMG signals provides an important source of information for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. Following the recent development of computer-aided EMG equipment, different methodologies in the time domain and frequency domain have been followed for quantitative analysis. In this study, feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EMG signals. In these methods, we used an autoregressive (AR) model of EMG signals as an input to classification system. A total of 1200 MUPs obtained from 7 normal subjects, 7 subjects suffering from myopathy and 13 subjects suffering from neurogenic disease were analyzed. The success rate for the WNN technique was 90.7% and for the FEBANN technique 88%. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN counterpart. The proposed WNN classification may support expert decisions and add weight to EMG differential diagnosis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Interactions of genes in neurons affect the dynamics of the whole neural network model through neuronal parameters, which change their values as a function of gene expression. Through optimization of the gene interaction network, initial gene/protein expression values and neuronal parameters, particular target states of the neural network operation can be achieved, and statistics about gene interaction matrix can be extracted. In such a way it is possible to model the role of genes and their interactions in different brain states and conditions. Experiments with human EEG data are presented as an illustration of this methodology and also, as a source for the discovery of unknown interactions between genes in relation to their impact on brain activity.

Under high stress levels and workloads, or, when inattentive or bored, persons often make costly decision-making errors of which they are typically not aware. Decreased cognitive arousal and limited information processing capacity are important causative factors leading to errors in human performance. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used for several decades to study this phenomenon. Here, we propose that rhythmic oscillatory communication networks are active within disparate cortical regions involved in higher order cognitive processing, and that the identification of task specific activation patterns may be used to predict changes in arousal, stress, and cognitive workload. Thus, real-time EEG measures may be able to identify low vs. high quality decision-making prior to an actual response taking place so an operator could be informed with spontaneous feedback to enhance arousal, comprehension, and decision-making performance. The noninvasive examination of Spatial-Frequency (SF) patterns embedded within the continuous EEG is an area of great interest in medicine and psychophysiology [(1,2)]. Spectral methods of SF analysis examine the brain's use of oscillatory communication as a means of executive control and are a likely candidate as an index of cognitive functioning in humans [(3,4)]. The topic of this paper examines the spatial relationship of the banded power in brain waves recorded at the scalp as a predictor of arousal and performance changes during complex higher order cognitive processing in man. Many researchers have examined the spatial properties of filtered evoked potential components in the delta (2-4 Hz), low theta (4-6 Hz), hi theta (6-8 Hz), low alpha (8-11 Hz), hi alpha (11-13 Hz), sigma (13-15 Hz) and beta (15-30) bands of the EEG and their relationship to attention, working memory, and higher order cognitive processing in humans [(5,6,7)]. For years researchers have investigated the spatial distribution of evoked potential (EP) waves using topographic maps and current density plots as a means to visualize areas of the brain at rest and during mental tasks involving attention and working memory [(8,9)]. Some have attempted to quantify the spatiotemporal aspects of cognition using phase and correlation relationships of evoked and non-evoked potentials [(10,11)]. While others have investigated the use of SF bispectral and bipower techniques to account for nonlinear phase correlated rhythmic oscillations in the human brain [(12)]. Considerable work in mapping near and distant cortical and subcortical connectivity has laid much of the foundation for our understanding of inter- and intra-cortical communication in the brain [(13,14)]. Further, the spatial distribution of cognitive processing in the brain has been measured in cerebral blood flow studies with fMRI showing differential metabolic activation in prefrontal and cingulate cortices during attention and decision-making tasks [(15,5)]. These studies support the long-standing opinion that distributed cortical and subcortical interconnections in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampus participate in the executive control of cognitive and attentional resources and in communication among near and distant brain regions [(16,17)]Our belief is that this executive control is carried out through oscillatory coupling of interdependent cognitive processes and these rhythmic interactions are visible in the EEG at frequencies from 2 to 30 Hz. In this paper, we report the preliminary results of an ongoing pilot study, which examines the relationship between SF brainwave patterns and changes in arousal and performance of subjects taking a computer-based college level general knowledge assessment test. Below we report on our first pilot work. In four right-handed adults, the SF patterns measured at the scalp before accurate performance differed from patterns before inaccurate performance. Repeatable spatial power distributions (from 3 to 12 Hz) overlying frontal, central, and parietal cortices one second before a decision was made predicted correct and incorrect responses. Additionally, SF pattern differences were observed to correlate with changes in arousal level, particularly in the 5, 8, and 9 Hz bands. These measurements suggest that brief, spatially distributed oscillatory neural activity patterns in distinct associative, somesthetic-motor, and integrative spatio-motor areas of the human brain may be reliable precursors of arousal and accurate performance during complex tasks [(18)].

Individuals with high and low alexithymia scores were selected according to the scores on the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. EEG was recorded from alexithymic and nonalexithymic persons viewing emotionally negative or neutral stimuli. Nonalexithymic persons exhibited increased gamma band power and phase synchronization at the 400-450-ms time window when processing emotionally negative stimuli. Neither enhanced gamma band power nor phase synchronization was observed in alexithymic persons in the negative emotion condition. These results suggest that gamma band activity reflects emotional processing, and alexithymic persons may have a deficit in communication between brain regions or in the utilization of memory or emotional information during the processing of emotional stimuli.

I examined this phenomenon in rats by using theta band oscillations of the local field potential to signify sniffing as a sensorimotor process. Olfactory bulb (OB) theta oscillations are coherent with those in the dorsal hippocampus (HPC) during odor sniffing in a two-odor olfactory discrimination task. Coherence is restricted to the high-frequency theta band (6-12 Hz) associated with directed sniffing in the OB and type 1 theta in the HPC. Coherence and performance fluctuate on a time scale of several minutes. Coherence magnitude is positively correlated with performance in the two-odor condition but not in extended runs of single odor conditional-stimulus-positive trials. Simultaneous with enhanced OB-HPC theta band coherence during odor sniffing is a significant decrease in lateral entorhinal cortex (EC)-HPC and OB-EC coherence, suggesting that linkage of the olfactory and hippocampal theta rhythms is not through the synaptic relay from OB to HPC in the lateral EC. OB-HPC coupling at the sniffing frequency is proposed as a mechanism underlying olfactory sensorimotor effort as a cognitive process.

Broilers were individually stunned in a water bath for 1 s with a constant peak current of 400 mA of 200 Hz DC delivered using a variable voltage/constant current stunner. The pulse width of the 200 Hz DC was set at 0.5, 1.5 or 2.5 ms (10, 30 or 50% of 5 ms current cycle). The results showed that pulse width had a significant effect on the incidence of epileptiform activity in the electroencephalograms (EEGs). A pulse width of 10% of the current cycle was less effective than pulse widths of 30 and 50% of the current cycle; there was no significant difference between a pulse width of 30 and 50%. The results of a univariate analysis showed that ventral neck-cutting resulted in a significantly shorter time to the onset of less than 10% of the pre-stun power contents in the 13-30 Hz and 2-30 Hz EEG frequency bonds when compared with unilateral neck-cutting. It is concluded that a pulse width of 30 or 50% of the current cycle of 200 Hz DC, delivering 400 mA peak current was better than using a pulse width of 10% of the current cycle.

J	Thirion, B; Dodel, S; Poline, JB				Thirion, B; Dodel, S; Poline, JB			Detection of signal synchronizations in resting-state fMRI datasets	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX	In this paper, we propose a generic framework for the analysis of steady-state fMRI datasets, applied here to resting-state datasets. Our approach avoids the introduction of user-defined seed regions for the study of spontaneous activity. Unlike existing techniques, it yields a sparse representation of resting-state activity networks which can be characterized and investigated fairly easily in a semi-interactive fashion. We proceed in several steps, based on the idea that spectral coherence of the fMRI time courses in the low frequency band carries the information of interest. In particular, we address the question of building adapted representations of the data from the spectral coherence matrix. We analyze nine datasets taken from three subjects and show resting-state networks validated by EEG-fMRI simultaneous acquisition literature, with low intra-subject variability; we also discuss the merits of different (rapid/slow) fMRI acquisition schemes.

Subthalamic local field potential recordings revealed the presence of multiple rhythms, from the classical EEG frequency range (< 50 Hz), to surprisingly high frequencies (70 Hz and 300 Hz). Fast rhythms are particularly attractive because of their likely interaction with the excitatory mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation. Here we investigated whether the two rhythms at 70 Hz and at 300 Hz represent distinct modes of operation, and therefore different targets, within the subthalamic nucleus. We retrospectively analyzed the dataset we used to describe the 300 Hz rhythm (Foffani, Priori et al., Brain 126: 2153-2163, 2003) searching for significant 70 Hz oscillations after levodopa administration. Whereas (as previously reported) 300 Hz activity was a consistent feature in the dataset, significant 70 Hz activity was observed in only 2 of I I nuclei. Therefore, 70 Hz oscillations are not a necessary condition for the presence of 300 Hz oscillations. The two rhythms probably arise from different mechanisms, reflecting different functional and/or spatial aspects of subthalamic pathophysiology. Fast subthalamic oscillations could be exploited for intra-operative electrophysiological monitoring of the subthalamic nucleus, post-operative confirmation of electrode placement and patient-specific 'reglage' of the electrical parameters for chronic deep brain stimulation.

Neuro-imaging techniques able to assess these links with suitable time resolution are electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG and MEG), even if it is difficult to localize recorded extra-cranial information, particularly within restricted areas, due to complexity of the 'inverse problem'. By means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) a procedure 'blind' to position and biophysical properties of the generators, our aim in this work was to identify cerebral functionally different sources in a restricted area. MEG data of 5 subjects were collected performing a relax-movement motor task in 5 different days. ICA reliably extracted neural networks differently modulated during the task in the frequency range of interest. In conclusion, a procedure solely based on statistical properties of the signals, disregarding their spatial positions, was demonstrated able to discriminate functionally different neuronal pools activities in a very restricted cortical area.

There is increasing evidence of an imbalance of thalamocortical systems in schizophrenic patients. In order to assess correlations between somatosensory evoked oscillations and symptoms of schizophrenia, we investigated median nerve SEPs in 20 inpatients and their age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls using a multichannel EEG. Dipole source analysis and wavelet transformation were performed before and after application of a 450-Hz highpass filter. In schizophrenics, the maximum HFOs occurred with a significantly prolonged latency. There was also a higher amplitude ( energy) in the low-frequency range of the N20 component compared with the controls. Importantly, amplitudes ( energy) of HFOs were inversely correlated with symptoms of formal thought disorder and delusions. Alterations of the thalamocortical somatosensory signal processing in schizophrenia with absence of an early HFO - assumed to be of inhibitory nature - could indicate a dysfunctional thalamic inhibition with increased amplitudes of N20, paralleled by enhanced positive schizophrenic symptoms.

In this study, a theory of the "whole-brain-work," which can be useful for functional interpretation of brain oscillations, is presented together with its application to recognition of faces and facial expressions. Following results are summarized: (1) Mechanisms leading to the perception of the grandmother picture are manifested with parallel activations of neural assemblies in different cortical locations and as superposition of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Known and anonymous faces can be differentiated by means of oscillatory brain dynamics. Percepts cannot be localized in a given specific region. The differentiation of facial expression induces significant change in alpha and theta oscillation. (2) While the importance of fMRI in object recognition is clear, this method has low temporal resolution. Our results shows that multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ins, thus completing and implementing the analysis of percepts in the dynamic window and indicating a broader distribution at the cortex. (3) The presented evidence of selectively distributed multiple oscillations for differentiation of facial percepts is in conceptual accordance with the "selectively distributed processing" in neurocognitive networks of Goldman-Rakic, Fuster, and of Mesulam. The large-scale approach of several investigators is also confirmed with the new results. On facial stimuli, a given location can show a considerable selected activation, but the formation of percepts is manifested by multiple oscillations with differentiated weight in large neural populations. (4) The most important feature of the comparison of percepts of grandmother and anonymous faces is the existence of a variety of significant differences in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma responses between the anonymous and grandmother faces in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital sites. (5) The brain response is a construct in a multi-dimensional state manifested by amplitudes of oscillatory responses, topological coordinates, and changes in the time axis following presentation of the percepts including delays and prolongations, coherence between locations. Only a new metrics embracing all these parameters can be representative for dynamics of functionality in the brain. The conceptual aspects of this new scope are explained in the presented theory.

In rehabilitation, the correlation between parameters of interest (angles, speed, power, EMG) and images of the patient's movements is important to devise an adequate training protocol. In neurology, some pathologies need to be investigated by a comparison of images and EEG signals. Nowadays, commonly used systems are made up of two different apparatuses: one for signals acquisition and one for video recording. They are separate pieces of equipment, and the integration between data and video is possible only to the detriment of information and the possibility to make quantitative analysis. This paper describes a new digital system for the concomitant acquisition of signals and video. It is a low cost instrumentation, PC based and easy-to-use. Data and video are recorded in standard formats and can be analyzed in a post-acquisition stage. The time resolution of the system is given by the video frame rate (25 fps), although an A/D conversion system allows frequencies up to 8000 Hz. The prototype was tested to verify synchronism between data and frames, and differences smaller than the resolution (40 ms) were found. The feasibility of the system was checked in two different applications: rehabilitation training with an isotonic Leg Extension and a daily EEG examination of one patient at the Neurological Institute of Bologna University. Both the applications gave good results in terms of time resolution, synchronism and user-friendliness.

In addition, recent studies have shown that it is also involved in nonmotor functions such as attention and memory, a notion derived from both animal neurophysiology and human functional imaging. The present study is an attempt to bridge the gap between these experimental techniques in the human brain, using a task initially designed to dissociate attention from intention in the monkey, and recently adapted for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study [Simon, S.R., Meunier, M., Piettre, L., Berardi, A.M., Segebarth, C.M., Boussaoud, D. (2002). Task-related changes in cortical synchronization are spatially coincident with the hemodynamic response. Neuroimage, 16, 103-14]. Intracranial EEG was recorded from the cortical regions preferentially active in the spatial attention and/or working memory task and those involved in motor intention. The results show that, among the different intracranial EEG responses, only the high gamma frequency (60-200 Hz) oscillatory activity both dissociates attention/memory from motor intention and spatially colocalizes with the fMRI-identified premotor substrates of these two functions. This finding provides electrophysiological confirmation that the human premotor cortex is involved in spatial attention and/or working memory. Additionally, it provides timely support to the idea that high gamma frequency oscillations are involved in the cascade of neural processes underlying the hemodynamic responses measured with fMRI [Logothetis, N.K., Pauls, J., Augath, M., Trinath, T. and Oeltermann, A. (2001). Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal. Nature, 412, 150 - 7], and suggests a functional selectivity of the gamma oscillations that could be critical for future EEG investigations, whether experimental or clinical. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

THE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN MEN AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						autonomic nervous system; heart rate variability; intelligence quotient; myocardial infract		Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects periodic changes taking place in heart rhythm, which are controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and external factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between HRV and the level of intelligence using the Raven Advanced Matrices Test in 95 men (mean age 41.6 perpendicular to 3.7SD yr) who experienced myocardial infarction during two years preceding the psychophysiological examination. HRV was analyzed from the EEG signal recordings in the time and spectral domains. It was found that post-myocardial infarct men of the higher than average intelligence had significantly increased HRV; the finding was reflected in the analysis of both time and frequency domains. Although both sympathetic and parasympathetic components showed an increase in the frequency domain, the former did disproportionately more, achieving substantial predominance. The results indicate that active mental processes and attitude, linked to a higher intelligence level, might be a beneficial prognostic marker, as is higher HRV, for the overall post-infarction cardiac mortality and for return of such subjects back to normal life. The corollary is that the assessment of IQ in post-infarction patients seems a simple screening method that may help presage the health and social course the patient takes.	[Pecyna, M.

J	Kocsis, B				Kocsis, B			The effect of descending theta rhythmic input from the septohippocampal system on firing in the supramammillary nucleus	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						theta rhythm; neuronal oscillation; medial septum; hippocampus; electroencephalogram; spike train	URETHANE-ANESTHETIZED RATS; SEPTUM-DIAGONAL BAND; HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; MEDIAL SEPTUM; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; MAMMILLARY BODY; SLOW ACTIVITY; REM-SLEEP; FREQUENCY	The supramammillary nucleus (SUM) is part of an ascending pathway conveying behavior-dependent drive to the septal generator of limbic theta rhythm. The SUM is, however, reciprocally connected to the septohippocampal system and there is strong evidence that both septum and SUM are capable of generating theta rhythmic activity. The present study examined the possible role of a descending rhythmic input to the SUM using simultaneously recorded hippocampal EEG and SUM neuronal activity in anesthetized rats. Fourier based phase analysis was performed on recordings in which fast theta rhythmic activity was elicited by tail pinch and in which a slower theta rhythm persisted after cessation of the sensory stimulus. It was found that the firing of a subpopulation of SUM neurons followed the hippocampal theta waves with a constant time delay, rather than a constant phase, suggesting that during deceleration associated with a shift from sensory-elicited theta to spontaneous theta rhythm they followed a descending rhythmic input, most likely from the medial septum. Neurons of a second group, which fired at the hippocampal theta peaks, did riot show such relationship demonstrating heterogeneity in the population of rhythmic SUM neurons and their possible roles in theta generation. Combined with previous studies focusing on the role of the ascending theta drive from the SUM, these results demonstrate dynamic bidirectional coupling between subcortical theta generators. Thus, during certain rhythmically firing SUM neurons lead the septal theta oscillator, in others the direction may reverse and SUM follows a theta drive of septal origin. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we investigated if this is also true for the illusion of movements, induced by a vibration at 80 Hz on the biceps tendon. We compared the post-movement synchronization of EEG beta rhythms induced by active and passive movements and illusion in eight right-handed healthy subjects. As a result, a short-lasting post-movement beta ERS was present over motor areas after both active and passive and also after illusion of movement in all subjects. These results suggested a possible role of MI and the somatosensory cortex in the somatic perception of limb movement in humans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nine able-bodied subjects were asked to imagine one type of movement following the presentation of a visual cue stimulus. EEG was recorded from 60 closely spaced electrodes placed over frontal, central and parietal areas. Spatiotemporal ERD/ERS patterns were evaluated in form of time-frequency maps. Seven out of nine subjects displayed a significant short-lasting beta power increase (beta rebound) after termination of imagery of movement of both feet in the frequency range of 23-29 Hz with a clear maximum at the vertex. In contrast, only two subjects displayed a clear beta rebound at the vertex after imagery of one of the hands, although five exhibited a significant beta rebound at the contralateral side of the head. None showed a beta rebound after tongue motor imagery. The midcentrally located beta rebound is interpreted as an electrophysiological correlate of a simultaneous "resetting" of overlapping neural networks in the foot representation areas and the SMA.

Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the FINE algorithm in an inhomogeneous realistic geometry head model under a variety of conditions. The source localization abilities of FINE were examined at different cortical regions and at different depths. The present computer simulation results indicate that FINE has enhanced source localization capability, as compared with MUSIC and RAP-MUSIC, when sources are closely spaced, highly noise-contaminated, or inter-correlated. The source localization accuracy of FINE is better, for closely-spaced sources, than MUSIC at various noise levels, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 6 dB to 16 dB, and RAP-MUSIC at relatively low noise levels, i.e., 6 dB to 12 dB. The FINE approach has been further applied to localize brain sources of motor potentials, obtained during the finger tapping tasks in a human subject. The experimental results suggest that the detailed neural activity distribution could be revealed by FINE. The present study suggests that FINE provides enhanced performance in localizing multiple closely spaced, and inter-correlated sources under low SNR, and may become an important alternative to brain source localization from EEG or MEG.

J	Woertz, M; Pfurtscheller, G; Klimesch, W				Woertz, M; Pfurtscheller, G; Klimesch, W			Alpha power dependent light stimulation: dynamics of event-related (de)synchronization in human electroencephalogram	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha rhythm; visual stimulation; event-related synchronization; event-related desynchronization; feedback stimulation; EEG		The desynchronization and resynchronization of alpha oscillations was studied in 10 normal subjects after visual stimulation of both eyes under two experimental conditions, "eyes opened" and "eyes closed". The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded bipolarly over the occipital area and sampled at 200 Hz. The data was processed in real time and evaluated online. In accordance with the alpha power in the 7 to 13 Hz band, short red light flashes of 10 ms duration were presented at intervals of at least 2 s. This stimulation resulted in an event-related desynchronization (ERD) followed by resynchronization. Trials were controlled for artifacts, averaged offline, and the amount of event-related (de)synchronization was calculated. The event-related desynchronization was significantly larger in the eyes open paradigm. In addition, the latencies of event-related desynchronization and resynchronization maxima were larger in the eyes open paradigm compared to the eyes closed one. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, SW preferably occurs during light sleep and transitional phases of the vigilance status. Since high-frequency somatosensory evoked potentials (HF-SEPs) are powerfully modulated by sleep and arousal, we verified whether they can reveal abnormalities of arousal-related structures in two patients having showed sporadic SW discharges during light sleep. Methods: We recorded right median nerve SEPs in two adult patients who suffered since the infancy from childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Sleep stage-related changes of HF-SEPs were compared to those observed in five healthy volunteers. Results: HF-SEPs decreased during sleep in controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the subcortical component dramatically increased in CAE patients during phase II NREM sleep. Simultaneous EEG showed normally represented sleep spindles, but not SW discharges. Conclusions: HF-SEP increase probably reflects the hyperactivation of brain-stem arousal-related structures. During such a hyperactivation no EEG abnormalities were observed. Significance: We hypothesize that HF-SEP increase might reflect a protective mechanism against seizure occurrence during light sleep.

Traditional assistive technology devices eventually fail, especially in the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) subjects who gradually become totally locked-in. A direct brain-to-computer interface that provides switch functions can provide a direct communication channel to the external world. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from scalp electrodes are significantly degraded due to skull and scalp attenuation and ambient noise. The present system using conductive skull screws allows more reliable access to cortical local field potentials (LFPs) without entering the brain itself. We describe an almost locked-in human subject with ALS who activated a switch using online time domain detection techniques. Frequency domain analysis of his LFP activity demonstrates this to be an alternative method of detecting switch activation intentions. With this brain communicator system it is reasonable to expect that locked-in, but cognitively intact, humans will always be able to communicate.

More specifically, gamma activity has been found to be enhanced when stimuli are stored in or match with short-term memory (STM). We tested the hypothesis that gamma activity is also evoked when stimuli match representations in long-term-memory (LTM). EEG was recorded from 13 subjects performing a choice reaction task. Visual stimuli were either known real-world objects with a memory representation or novel configurations never seen before. Results: All stimuli evoked an early gamma response which was maximal over occipital electrodes. This evoked gamma activity was significantly larger for items that matched memory templates. Conclusions: Therefore, we argue that gamma activity results from the feedback from memory into perception systems. This assumption seems to be true for STM as well as LTM.

J	Schack, B				Schack, B			How to construct a micro state-based alphabet for evaluating information processing in time	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article						instantaneous coherence; microstates; event-related cognitive tasks	INSTANTANEOUS COHERENCE; EEG; SEGMENTATION; SENSITIVITY; ENTROPY; BAND	Cognitive processes are highly dynamic processes concatenating different components of human thinking successively or parallel in time. Thereby, different cortical networks are generated, transient or stable in time. One important integration mechanism between different cortical sites is the synchronization of electrical oscillations of neural ensembles. Prior studies have shown that instantaneous EEG coherence analysis is a useful tool to unhide transient synchronization phenomena (see e.g. [Krause et al., 1998; Miltner et al., 1999; Schack et al., 1999a, 1999b]). In those studies instantaneous coherence was investigated for selected short time intervals, respectively, specific time parameters of instantaneous coherence were examined. The present study proposes a method for the evaluation of the whole cognitive process on the basis of instantaneous coherence without loss of time and process information. To this purpose prototypical microstates of synchronous oscillations are constructed. Their temporal, sequential and topographical properties reflect the underlying process of the dynamic activation and deactivation of neuronal networks during information processing. The sequence of microstates may be understood as the orderly arrangement of words of an alphabet in the correspondent thinking process. The presented method is applied to an event-related cognitive task of comparing categorization processes, pattern comparison, and to an irreproducible long task when solving; mathematical problems. In both cases we obtain detailed information about temporal structures and strategies of human thinking.

We compared pre-task 'resting' data from healthy individuals with the Normative Cuban digital resting EEG-database recently calculated for VARETA (qEEG/VARETA). The results allowed us to state that a 'pre-task resting conditions' exists as a state beyond the 'zero' or 'baseline' condition. The pre-task 'resting' condition is never truly 'at rest', however most of the previous published fMRI/PET studies assumed such a pre-task condition as reference/baseline condition. By defining different 'resting states' by qEEG/VARETA analyses, we have a potential methodology which can define resting state conditions and to be sure that they are consistent when comparing within group analyses across tasks or between groups either void of task or for task specific conditions.

Methods: A biophysical model was used to analyse electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of tonic brain activity at multiple scalp sites before and after treatment with medication. Results: It was observed that stimulants had the affect of significantly reducing the parameter controlling activation in the intrathalamic pathway involving the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and the parameter controlling excitatory cortical activity. The effect of stimulant medication was also found to be preferentially localized within subcortical nuclei projecting towards frontal and central scalp sites. Conclusions: It is suggested that the action of stimulant medication occurs via suppression of the locus coeruleus, which in turn reduces stimulation of the TRN, and improves cortical arousal. The effects localized to frontal and central sites are consistent with the occurrence of frontal delta-theta EEG abnormalities in ADHD, and existing theories of hypoarousal. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first study where a detailed biophysical model of the brain has been used to estimate changes in neurophysiological parameters underlying the effects of stimulant medication in ADHD.

The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts involve modulation of neuronal "baseline" activity in early visual areas, presumably through top-down control from higher-order attentional systems. We used electroencephalography to study the largely unknown relationship between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left or right peripheral position in the absence of visual stimulation resulted in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these alpha-changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with negative values (alpha_right < alpha_left) indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha_left <= alpha_right) indexing rightward attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual targets. Collapsed over trials, there was an advantage for left target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in alpha-index values. Across trials, left targets were detected most rapidly when preceded by negative index values. Detection of right targets was fastest in trials with most positive values. Our data indicate that collateral modulations of posterior alpha-activity, the momentary bias of visuospatial attention, and imminent visual processing are linked. They suggest that the momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial biases in imminent visual processing, can be estimated from a lateralization index of posterior alpha-activity.

The effects of zolpidem on autonomic functions remain unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of zolpidem on sleep and related cardiac autonomic modulations as compared with triazolam in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Methods: Continuous power spectral analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram, and heart rate variability were performed on freely moving rats during daytime sleep. The consciousness states were classified into active waking (AW), quiet sleep (QS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). Drugs were administered via gavage and data within 2 h were analyzed. Results: All zolpidem (ZP3, 3 mg/kg; ZP30, 30 mg/kg) and triazolam (TZ0.075, 0.075 mg/kg; TZ0.75, 0.75 mg/kg) groups had longer accumulated QS time and averaged QS duration as compared with the vehicle control. The accumulated QS time and averaged QS duration of ZP3 were similar to those of TZ0.075. Significant suppressions of PS time were noted in all drug groups except ZP3. During QS, ZP3 and ZP30 exhibited significant increases of magnitude and percentage of EEG 5 power, whereas TZ0.075 and TZ0.75 did not. Heart period and high-frequency power of heart rate variability increased significantly in ZP3 during all sleep-wake states. Both parameters, however, did not increase but even decreased in ZP30, TZ0.075, and TZ0.75. Conclusions: Zolpidem not only caused a longer and deeper sleep but also led to an elevated cardiac vagal activity at a specific dose in the rat.

We hypothesized the selective mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 [2S-2-amino-2-(1S, 2S-2-carboxycyclopropyl- 1yl)- 3-(xanth-9-yl) propanoic acid] given alone would 1) increase arousal, producing sleep-wake EEG effects opposite those of LY379268, and 2) block/reverse the effects of LY379268 when the drugs are coadministered. Rats with implanted electrodes were injected with 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg LY341495 at hour 5.5 of the dark period. In the coadministration study the rats received the same dose of LY341495 followed 30 min later by 1 mg/kg LY379268. LY341495 alone increased waking by reducing NREM and REM sleep. LY341495 also depressed low-frequency and stimulated high-frequency EEG power. It produced a sharp spike in theta power in waking but not NREM sleep, a striking state-dependent difference in pharmacological response. These changes indicate that blocking mGlu2/3 receptors increases brain arousal. Moreover, they show that mGlu2/3 receptors actively support arousal even in the absence of heightened glutamate excitation. The coadministration experiment demonstrates that LY341495 is selective in vivo since it dose-dependently attenuates or reverses the sleep-wake EEG effects of the highly selective mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268. The capacity of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists and antagonists to alter the sleep wake balance suggests they could be developed to enhance sleep or sustain arousal. Their opposing actions on theta EEG could test the putative role of these oscillations in memory consolidation.

Analytic phase	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analytic phase; basis function; phase cone; phase gradient; self-organized criticality; spatial EEG pattern; spontaneous cortical activity	OLFACTORY EEG; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; CORTEX; AWAKE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PREPYRIFORM; BRAIN	Objective: To explain spontaneous EEG through measurements of spatiotemporal patterns of phase among beta-gamma oscillations. Methods: High-density 8 X 8 intracranial arrays were fixed over sensory cortices of rabbits. EEGs were spatially low pass filtered, temporally bandpass filtered and segmented in overlapping windows stepped at 2 ms. Phase was measured with the cosine as the temporal basis function, using both Fourier and Hilbert transforms to compensate for their respective limitations. Spatial patterns in 2D phase surfaces were measured with the geometric form of the cone as the spatial basis function. Results: Two fundamental state variables were measured at each digitizing step in the 64 EEGs: the rate of change in phase with time (frequency) and the rate of change in phase with distance (gradient). The parameters of location, diameter, duration, and phase velocity of the cone of phase were derived from these two state variables. Parameter distributions including recurrence intervals extending into the low theta range were fractal; the mean values varied with window duration and interelectrode distance. Conclusions: The formation of spatial amplitude patterns began with state transitions that were documented by phase discontinuities and phase cones. The multiplicity of overlapping cones indicated that sensory neocortices maintained a scale-free state of self-organized criticality (SOC) in each hemisphere as the basis for its rapid integration of sensory input with prior learning stored in cortical synaptic webs. Further evidence came from the fractal properties of the phase parameters and the self-similarity of phase patterns in the ms/mm to m/s ranges. Significance: These EEG data suggest that neocortical dynamics is analogous to the dynamics of self-stabilizing systems, such as a sand pile that maintains its critical angle by avalanches, and a pan of boiling water that maintains its critical temperature by bubbles that release heat. Beta-gamma oscillations stem from the ability of neocortex to maintain its stability under continuous sensory bombardment. Modeling implies that the critical parameter of neocortex (analogous to angle of repose or temperature) is the mean firing rates of neurons that are homeostatically regulated by refractory periods everywhere at all times in cortex. The advantage of SOC in perception may be the ability it gives neocortex to generate instantaneous global state transitions (avalanches, bubbles) large enough to include the multiple sensory areas that are necessary to form gestalts (multisensory percepts).

To provide a self-consistent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we have constructed a large-scale computer model that encompasses portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several intrinsic Currents. are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical, corticothalamic. and both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode. the model exhibits irregular spontaneous firing and selective responses to Visual Stimuli. In the sleep mode, neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation. maintenance. and termination of slow oscillations shows the following. 1) An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2) The activation of persistent sodium Currents is Sufficient to initiate the up-state of the slow oscillation. 3) A combination of intrinsic and synaptic Currents is Sufficient to maintain the up-state. 4) Depolarization-activated potassium Currents and synaptic depression terminate the up-state. 5) Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation The model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and plasticity.

Cortical gamma oscillations have been associated with neural processes supporting conscious perception, but the effect of general anesthesia on these oscillations is controversial. In this study, the authors examined three volatile anesthetics, halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane, and compared their effects on flash-induced gamma oscillations in terms of equivalent concentrations producing the loss of righting reflex (1 minimum alveolar concentration for the loss of righting [MAC(LR)]). Methods: Light flashes were presented every 5 s for 5 min, and event-related potentials were recorded from primary visual cortex of 15 rats with a chronically implanted bipolar electrode at increasing anesthetic concentrations (0-2.4 MAC(LR)). Early cortical response was obtained by averaging poststimulus (0-100 ms) potentials filtered at 20-60 Hz across 60 trials. Late (100-1.000 ms) gamma power was calculated using multitaper power spectral technique. Wavelet decomposition was used to determine spectral and temporal distributions of gamma power. Results: The authors found that (1) halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane enhanced the flash-evoked early cortical response in a concentration-dependent manner; (2) the effective concentration for this enhancement was the lowest for isoflurane, intermediate for halothane, and the highest for desflurane when compared at equal fractions of the concentration that led to a loss of righting; (3) the power of flash-induced late (> 100 ms) gamma oscillations was augmented at intermediate concentrations of all three anesthetic agents; and (4) flash-induced y power was not reduced below waking baseline even in deep anesthesia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a reduction in flash-induced y oscillations in rat visual cortex is not a unitary correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.

In this framework, the complex brain functions require integration of several operations throughout the whole neocortex. However, the role of inhibitory brain systems in such processes is still unsettled. The effects of a single dose (30 mug/kg) of lorazepam on the operational activity of neuronal populations and on the temporal binding between them were examined in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo-controlled study with eight healthy volunteers. EEG measures at 20 channels were evaluated on two occasions: (1) eyes closed, (2) eyes open. In short, we conducted a two-by-two factorial study where one factor manipulated GABA(ergic) neurotransmission (lorazepam vs. placebo), and the other factor was simply brain state (eyes closed vs. eyes opened). We were primarily interested in the main effect of lorazepam. In the present study, a connection between the mesoscopic level, described by the local functional processes (neuronal assemblies or populations) and the macroscopic level, described as a sequence of metastable brain states (remote functionally synchronized neuronal populations) was established. The role of inhibitory brain systems facilitated by lorazepam in the operational dynamics of neuronal populations and in the process of EEG structural synchrony (SS) (topological peculiarities) was addressed for the first time. It was shown that GABA signaling reorganized the dynamics of local neuronal populations and the remote functional connectivity between them. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Studies in schizophrenia using functional and diffusion tensor neuroimaging, event-related potentials and EEG coherence indicate an impairment of cortical network coupling in this disorder. Previous electrophysiological investigations in animals and humans suggested that gamma activity (oscillations at around 40 Hz) is essential for cortical network binding. Studies in medicated schizophrenia provide evidence for a reduced gamma activity in the context of auditory stimulus processing. This is the first investigation of oscillatory activations in the gamma-band in an auditory oddball paradigm in unmedicated schizophrenic patients. Methods: EEG gamma-band responses (GBRs) of 15 drug-free schizophrenic patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were compared. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the calculation of oscillatory GBRs. Results: In response to standard stimuli, early evoked GBRs (20-100 ms), which are supposed to reflect auditory cortex activation, did not show significant group differences. However, schizophrenic patients showed reduced evoked GBRs in a late latency range (220-350 ms), particularly after target stimuli. This deficit occurred over right frontal scalp regions. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between oscillatory GBRs and clinical parameters in schizophrenic patients. Conclusions: The results are consistent with a relative preserved stimulus processing in the auditory cortex as reflected by the early GBR. The reduced late GBR is compatible with an abnormal interaction within a frontal lobe network, as was postulated by previous neuroimaging studies. Significance: The present study provides evidence for disturbed processing within frontal cortical regions in unmedicated schizophrenic patients as indicated by reduced evoked EEG GBRs.

The link between cardiac autonomic activity and sleep delta power is altered in men with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						heart rate variability; delta sleep electroencephalogram; loss of fluctuations; phase shift	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABILITY; SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE; EEG; PRESSURE; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; AGE	We hypothesize that sleep apnea-hypopnea alters interaction between cardiac vagal modulation and sleep delta EEG. Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is related to cardiovascular complications in men. SAHS patients show higher sympathetic activity than normal subjects. In healthy men, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is associated with cardiac vagal influence, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is linked to cardiac sympathetic activity. Interaction between cardiac autonomic modulation and delta sleep EEG is not altered across a life span nor is the delay between appearances of modifications in both signals. Healthy controls, moderate SAHS, and severe SAHS patients were compared across the first three NREM-REM cycles. Spectral analysis was applied to ECG and EEG signals. High frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) of heart rate variability (HRV), ratio of LF/HF, and normalized (nu) delta power were obtained. A coherency analysis between HFnu and delta was performed, as well as a correlation analysis between obstructive apnea index (AI) or hypopnea index (HI) and gain, coherence, or phase shift. HRV components were similar between groups. In each group, HFnu was larger during NREM, while LFnu predominated across REM and wake stages. Coherence and gain between HFnu and delta decreased from controls to severe SAHS patients. In SAHS patients, the delay between modifications in HFnu and delta did not differ from zero. AI and HI correlated negatively with coherence, while HI correlated negatively with gain only. Apneas-hypopneas affect the link between cardiac sympathetic and vagal modulation and delta EEG demonstrated by the loss of cardiac autonomic activity fluctuations across shifts in sleep stages. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas alter the interaction between both signals differently.

The 62-channel EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n = 25) and Sahaja Yoga meditators (SYM, n = 25). Findings from the non-emotional continuum show that at the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) SYM manifested larger power values in theta-1 (4-6 Hz), theta-2 (6-8 Hz) and alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) frequency bands. Although increasing arousal desynchronized activity in these bands in both groups, the theta-2 and alpha-l power in the eyes-open period and alpha-1 power while viewing the neutral clip remained still higher in the SYM. During eyes-closed and eyes-open periods the controls were marked by larger right than left hemisphere power, indexing relatively more active left hemisphere parieto-temporal cortex whereas meditators manifested no hemisphere asymmetry. When contrasted with the neutral, the aversive movie clip yielded significant alpha desynchronization both groups, reflecting arousing nature of emotional induction. In the control group along with alpha desynchronization affective movie clip synchronized gamma power over anterior cortical sites. This was not seen in the SYM. Overall, the presented report emphasizes that the revealed changes in the electrical brain activity associated with regular meditation practice are dynamical by nature and depend on arousal level. The EEG power findings also provide the first empirical proof of a theoretical assumption that meditators have better capabilities to moderate intensity of emotional arousal.

The authors present a wavelet decomposition algorithm suitable for identification and detection of very weak VEPs. The cross-correlation analysis between Daubechies wavelet (i.e. dbN) functions psi(N)(t), for N = 4, 5,..., 10 and a representative noiseless VEP signal is performed to choose the proper wavelet function, say that with maximum correlation coefficient (highest resemblance) with respect to the representative VEP signal sequence. In this way, the specific choice of the best wavelet prototype function is no longer arbitrary for the application of obtaining pattern reversal VEPs. Extensive clinical experiments have demonstrated that the multiresolution wavelet analysis method can identify and estimate the peak latency of VEP signal well, with only a much reduced trial of ensemble averaging (EA) required. The major advantages of the wavelet transform are that it can 'zoom-in' to time discontinuities, and that orthonormal bases, localised in time and frequency, can be constructed. With this zoom-in property of the wavelet analysis, the irregularities or abnormalities of signals can easily be detected. Also the characteristics of EP signals can be captured by means of wavelet analysis, which can be further used for the detection and recognition of the abnormalities in the brain.

Subjects had to switch between tasks in which they were to respond to either the visual or the auditory component of the stimulus. 11-13 Hz occipital amplitude increased prior to auditory, relative to visual repetition trials. The effect was transient, ending well before presentation of the stimulus that was being prepared for. Alternation trials were preceded by an increase in occipital theta-band activity, relative to repetition trials, for the visual task. This effect was also transient. The effects suggest tentative hypotheses for the function of transient bursts of alpha- and theta-band oscillations and indicate the possibility of a psychophysiological resolution of theoretical questions concerning the origin of switch costs.

Effect of lamotrigine on cognition in children with epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NEWLY-DIAGNOSED EPILEPSY; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; DOUBLE-BLIND; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; CARBAMAZEPINE; GABAPENTIN; IMPAIRMENT; PLACEBO; EEG	Background: Lamotrigine does not affect cognition in healthy adult volunteers or adult patients with epilepsy, but its effect on cognition in children is uncertain. Objective: To compare the effect of lamotrigine and placebo on cognition in children with well-controlled or mild epilepsy. Method: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 61 children with well-controlled or mild epilepsy were randomly assigned to add-on therapy with either lamotrigine followed by placebo or placebo followed by lamotrigine. Each treatment phase was 9 weeks, the crossover period 5 weeks. A neuropsychological test battery was performed during EEG monitoring at baseline and at the end of placebo and drug phases. The paired Student' t test was used for statistical analysis for neuropsychological data (two tailed) with a p value of 0.01 considered significant. Carryover and period effect were analyzed with generalized linear modeling (SPSS 10). Results: Forty-eight children completed the study. Seizure frequency was similar during both treatment phases. No significant difference was found in continuous performance, binary choice reaction time, verbal and nonverbal recognition, computerized visual searching task, verbal and spatial delayed recognition, and verbal and nonverbal working memory between placebo and lamotrigine treatment phase. There was no significant carryover and period effect when corrected for randomization. Conclusion: Lamotrigine exhibits no clinically significant cognitive effects in adjunctive therapy for children with epilepsy.

Methods: Thirty-three adult patients with the 3243A > G mutation entered a 3-year follow-up study. They were clinically evaluated annually, audiometry was performed, and samples were drawn for the analysis of blood chemistry and mutation heteroplasmy in leukocytes. Holter recording was performed three times during the follow-up and echocardiography, neuropsychological assessment, and quantitative EEG and brain imaging conducted at entry and after 3 years. Results: The incidence of new neurologic events was low during the 3-year follow-up. Sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) progressed, left ventricular wall thickness increased, mean alpha frequency in the occipital and parietal regions decreased, and the severity of disease index ( modified Rankin score) progressed significantly. The rate of SNHI progression correlated with mutation heteroplasmy in muscle. The increase in left ventricular wall thickness was seen almost exclusively in diabetic patients. Seven patients died during the follow-up, and they were generally more severely affected than those who survived. Conclusions: Significant changes in the severity of disease, sensorineural hearing impairment, left ventricular hypertrophy, and quantitative EEG were seen in adult patients with 3243A > G during the 3-year follow-up.

In thalamocortical (TC) and nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) neurones, and possibly in neocortical cells, an I-Twindow-mediated bistability is the key cellular mechanism underlying the expression of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation, one of the fundamental EEG rhythms of non-REM sleep. As the I-Twindow-mediated bistability may also represent one of the cellular mechanisms underlying the expression of high frequency burst firing in awake conditions, I-Twindow is of critical importance in neuronal population dynamics associated with different behavioural states.

Drawing upon brain modelling and dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate that the thalamic circuitry of the system is crucial for the generation of these abnormal rhythms, observing that the combination of inhibition from reticular nuclei and excitation from the cortical signal, interplay to generate the spike-wave oscillation. The mechanism revealed provides an explanation of why approaches based on linear stability and Heaviside approximations to the activation function have failed to explain the phenomena of spike-wave behaviour in mean-field models. A mathematical understanding of this transition is a crucial step towards relating spiking network models and mean-field approaches to human brain modelling. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While this hypothesis can account for the maintenance of a single memory item, it remains unclear how multiple working memory items are represented. This account will discuss the possible physiological mechanism responsible for the maintenance of multiple working memory items including mechanisms based on sustained firing and synaptic encoding. The focus will be on temporal segmentation by phase encoding, namely the idea that several working memory items are activated sequentially at different points in time. It has been proposed that a mechanism of nested gamma (30-80 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations is responsible for controlling the reactivation of the memory list. This mechanism has been shown to be compatible with multiple behavioral findings on working memory such as the data from the Sternberg experiment. The theta/gamma mechanism has also received support from a large set of electrophysiological findings, however, more experimental work is required to further substantiate or falsify the model.

Epileptic activity modifies the endogenous opioid system by increasing its levels at the end of the ictal phase, and in post-ictal and interictal phases. This increase originates a cortical excitatory effect which suppresses both slow wave sleep and REM. The epileptic activity is initiated with the presence of interictal epileptiform activity, which may be induced through penicillin administration into amgdaline nuclei. Interictal epileptiform activity is a widely employed tool used to determine the localization of epileptic foci characterized by the sudden presence Of spikes or acute waves in an electroencephalogram (EEG). In the present work, this tool was used to study the participation of the opioid system in the installation and propagation of epileptic activity induced in temporal lobe amygdala. In the epiloptogenetic study, amygdaline interictal epileptiform activity was used to assess changes induced by opioids and an antagonist in the occurrence of interictal activity using an event histogram. Propagation was studied with the cortical topographic mapping technique, which shows EEG frequency components in a power spectrum, as well as the rhythmic EEG patterns. T he aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of enkephalins on epileptiform activity induced with penicillin in temporal lobe amygdala and its propagation to the cerebral cortex. Method. Fifteen male Wistar rats were submitted to an acute preparation; they were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.). A stainless steel bipolar electrode provided with a cannula was directed toward the left amygdaline basolateral nucleus and a second concentric bipolar electrode to the right amygdaline basolateral nucleus. Two types of cortical recordings were carried out: global mapping and restricted areas. The first consisted of the placement of a 16 stainless steel electrode matrix (in which the electrodes from the vertex were removed) on the scalp, taking care that the tips of the electrodes were in contact with the cortex; this arrangement Covered the whole cerebral cortex. The second involved a 4 x 4 mm square matrix consisting of 16 equidistant electrodes placed on the cerebral cortex. The cortical recording was a result of placing this matrix in four different positions so that the whole cerebral cortex was monitored. To monitor cortical recordings, experimental groups were injected penicillin into the amygdaline nuclei. To perform global mapping, enkephalins, [D-ala(2)]-methionine and [D-ala(2)] were topically applied into the amygdaline nuclei and naloxone was administered systemically. Analogical signals were recorded in a video-tape and were digitized in parallel with an HP workstation. Off-line analysis was carried as follows: a) information recorded in video-tapes was acquired in a computer designed for this purpose, using amygdaline interictal epileptiform activity to plot event histograms; b) EEG digitized signal, obtained from global mapping, was used to obtain a spectral analysis, consisting of color images maps in time and frequency domains, using RBEAM software. The recording of electrical activity obtained with the square matrix was visually analyzed only. At the end of each experiment, animals were perfused and each brain was Fixed intracardially with 10% formaldehyde. To verify the recording and sub-cortical injection sites, the rapid procedure was used. Results. During control stages, cortical records showed slow activity in the form of spindles in all the recording channels; this was due to urethane. Penicillin administration in amygdaline nuclei induced epileptiform activity with a specific Pattern: immediate appearance after penicillin application,with a gradual increase in amplitude until stabilization was reached within 5-10 minutes of administration. Analyses of global mapping in the frequency domain showed a specific mode of amygdaline interictal epileptiform activity propagation, starting in ipsilateral temporal, prefrontal and frontal cortices, appearing subsequently in contralateral prefrontal and frontal cortices, and finally in temporal cortex. In the time domain spectrum, an electric dipole generating an interictal spike was found in cerebral cortex. Restricted areas mapping approach showed interictal epileptiform activity and its propagation along the ipsilateral fronto-temporal region. Data revealed an antero-posterior medial cortical activation spreading with decreasing intensity toward occipital regions. Application of enkephalins-[D-ala(2)]-methionine and [D-ala(2)]-leucine produced no epileptic activity, but an increase in basal EEG of cortical epileptiform activity was detected, as well as a decrease in amplitude and frequency of amygdaline epileptiform activity. Naloxone originated a facilitatory effect, since its administration induced focal and generalized electrocorricographic seizures. Conclusions. Focal penicillin is a reliable model of interictal spikes, paroxysms and generalized seizures. The study in rats showed a propagation of epileptic activity to prefrontal cortices prior to contralateral amygdala. Our results showed that enkephalins produced a double effect. First, they originated an increase in basal in temporal cortical areas, as well as a putative participation in propagation mechanisms. Second, they exerted an inhibitory effect on epilepsy installation mechanisms. The inhibitory effect originated by enkephalins was reverted by naloxone.

Methods: Tones were presented to 8 subjects at 10 different tempos from 150 to 3125 ms and with random intervals. We quantified time-frequency (TF) power with respect to a pre-tone-onset baseline and the TF phase coherence across trials. Peak-to-peak event-related potential (ERP) amplitude values for the middle and long-latency auditory responses were obtained for comparison. Results: ERP amplitude, size of power modulation, and amount of phase coherence were larger at slower tempos for the long-latency response (LLR) but not for the middle-latency response (MLR). Multiple regression analysis indicated that for MLR and LLR, phase modulation was a better predictor of ERP amplitude than power modulation. Conclusions: Phase modulation is a better predictor of ERP amplitude than power modulation for middle and long-latency auditory responses. Significance: Lack of diminution of the MLR at fast tempos indicates its usefulness for studying early cortical processing of music and speech patterns.

The hemodynamic method We use is Event-Related fMRI, and the electrophysiological method measures Event-Related Band Power (ER BP) of the EEG signal. The experimental technique allows us to approach the relation between cortical structure and cognitive function in a sophisticated way. In particular, we can formulate original working hypotheses about the language-induced changes in the ongoing brain dynamics. We show, on the basis of electrophysiological data collected in an experiment on language production, that synchronized cortical networks code cognitive processes induced by language in form of power modulations of specific frequency bands. The hemodynamic (fM RI) data collected in the same task point to the existence of a central processor for the phrase structure assignment. We conceptualize Such a central processor as a frequency scanner, a cortical device designed to pick up synchronized brain activity over a specific range of frequencies. We discuss the experimental designs which result from this set of hypotheses and show their relevance for the models of language processing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We prospectively recorded and digitalized at a frequency rate of 10 Hz (AcqKnowledge(TM) software) the following parameters in 6 brain injured patients: mean arterial pressure, heart rate, ICP, mean flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MFVMCA) (transcranial Doppler WAKI(TM)) and left and right spectral edge frequency (SEFl, SEFr) of continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (Philips(TM) technologies). All patients were sedated using a combination of sufentanil and midazolam and mechanically ventilated. Cerebral electrical activity (oscillations of SEF at a mean frequency of 26 +/- 9 mHz) and MFVMCA fluctuations were found strongly correlated with the intracranial Lundberg B waves (mean frequency 23 +/- 7 mHz). These result support the existence of a neuro-pacemaker at the origin of the Lundberg B waves. The change in cerebral electrical activity, resulting from cerebral pacemakers, could increase cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and thus lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow and secondarily of ICP through a change in cerebral blood volume.

We investigated the relationships of periodic EEG both among various parts of the septum and with dorsal hippocampal theta recorded concurrently in freely moving rats. Most septal sites showed theta rhythm concurrent with hippocampal theta during locomotion. However, periods with theta at hippocampal but not septal sites were more frequent than the reverse. Theta waves in different parts of the septum were synchronized with each other but medial septal sites showed less frequent theta than other sites. The phase delays between medial and lateral septal sites were < 10 ms, suggesting that the hippocampus does not act as a simple relay between the two. Spectral analysis revealed periods (> 5 s) of theta at hippocampal sites co-occurring with rhythms at multiple septal sites that were slower than theta. Even slower were the 'slow septal waves' (mean 2.7 Hz), which were present in the absence of locomotion and did not 'drive' the hippocampus. Our data suggest that the pacemaker of hippocampal theta may best be thought of as a set of functionally differentiated components rather than as a single homogenous unit.

The goals of the present report were, first, to find the brain areas with maximal rhythmic activity before warning and imperative stimuli in a classic contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm, and, second, to study the modulation of the EEG rhythms of these areas during the preparatory attention interval which precedes the S2 (imperative) stimulus. Trial by trial LORETA analysis found similar brain rhythm generators during both pre-S1 and pre-S2 intervals. Each theta, alpha and beta traditional EEG rhythm originates in several anatomically distinct brain structures. Preparatory attention is associated with a decrease in power in alpha (right and left occipital and temporal areas) and low-beta (left frontal, bilateral occipital and middle frontal areas) EEG bands. In these structures power changes associated with preparatory attention modulated either a dominant or a non-dominant oscillatory band, suggesting that nondominant rhythms of a cerebral area have some functional relevance. Our results imply distributed regional sources for brain rhythms and support the view that during preparatory attention there is a modulation of the brain sources generating alpha and beta brain rhythms. Moreover, the proposed combined approach makes it possible to explore the definition of a given brain area not only anatomically, but also by the frequency content and the functional reactivity of the electrical rhythms that it generates.

Not only convulsive states, but also nonconvulsive status may represent with EN and this phenomenon may be the only motor manifestation of seizure activity. Epileptic activation of a cortical saccade region may be distinguished from activation of a cortical put-suit region clinically as activation of pursuit regions results in nystagmus slow phases that bring the eyes across the midline. Horizontal EN results most commonly from seizure activity involving the occipital cortex. In this report, horizontal EN in a patient with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is described with clinical, radiological and electrophysiological findings that occur probably due to posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.

Why is this so? To investigate whether changes in cortical information transmission play a role, we used. transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography and asked how the activation of one cortical area (the premotor area) is transmitted to the rest of the brain. During quiet wakefulness, an initial response.(similar to 15 milliseconds) at the stimulation site was followed by a sequence of waves that moved to connected cortical areas several centimeters away. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response was stronger but was rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. Thus, the fading of consciousness during certain stages of steep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity.

These physical activities can be measured using various multimodal bio-signals employing either invasive or non-invasive sensors. In contrast, although mental activities have been modeled from various standpoints, they have been associated mostly with brain activities. We have focused on mapping physical multimodal bio-signals as time series data with mental states such as somnolence, fatigue, and concentration. We will discuss two mathematical data mining tools: (1) the interval cross-correlation coefficient; and (2) the interval cross-covariance function coefficient(Given a multimodal time series bio-signal data acquired at a given frequency using non-invasive sensors attached to a human volunteer, our methods aimed to predict the mental state of a human subject(The primary objective was to examine the feasibility of our methods in predicting the mental state of students during lessons in a university classroom(Previous attempts to predict mental states from bio-signals have mostly been based on electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), or electrooculogram (EOG), but have not tried to combine them( However, it is often difficult to obtain stable EEG signals from students in a university classroom because of artifacts arising from body and eye movements(Based on this observation, we considered simultaneous multimodal bio-signals with their combination, and introduced interval cross-correlation coefficient and interval cross-covariance function coefficient as data mining tools for mapping the physical and mental states of the human body(We conducted experiments using subjects equipped with multiple sensors, and compared the results with the outputs of our data mining methods(Preliminary experiments show that our method produces reasonable results and allows us to control the experimental parameters to cope with individual variations(Our method is also applicable to monitoring personal health care, vehicle drivers, and individuals in business group meetings(	[Aono, Masaki; Seki, Yohei] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Comp & Informat Sci, 1-1 Tempakucho, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Yuske] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Res Ctr Phys Fitness Sports & Hlth, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan; [Yasuda, Yoshifumi] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan; [Suzuki, Naoya] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan		Aono, M (corresponding author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, Comp & Informat Sci, 1-1 Tempakucho, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.	aono@ics.tut.ac.jp			21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) program of the Japanese government	21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) program of the Japanese government	This work was supported by the 21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) program of the Japanese government.

An overcomplete basis matrix is estimated by using the K-means method. We have proved that for the estimated overcomplete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coefficient matrix) with minimum l(1)-norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm. The comparisons of the l(1)-norm solution and the l(0)-norm solution are also presented, which can be used in recoverability analysis of blind source separation (BSS). Next, we apply the sparse rnatrix factorization approach to BSS in the overcomplete case. Generally, if the sources are not sufficiently sparse, we perform blind separation in the time-frequency domain after preprocessing the observed data using the wavelet packets transformation. Third, an EEG experimental data analysis example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its performance. Two almost independent components obtained by the sparse representation method are selected for phase synchronization analysis, and their periods of significant phase synchronization are found which are related to tasks. Finally, concluding remarks review the approach and state areas that require further study.

Alan			Separation of gastric electrical control activity from simultaneous MGG/EGG recordings using independent component analysis	2006 28TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-15			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2006	New York, NY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			EEG	Spatiotemporal parameters of gastric electrical control activity such as its amplitude, direction and propagation velocity are physiological parameters of distinctive clinical interest due to their potential use for differentiating between the healthy and diseased states of the human stomach. Whereas their time evolution is relatively well behaved in the case of healthy subjects, significant deviations from normal have been observed in patients suffering from a number of gastric diseases such as gastroparesis and gastropathy. For this reason, monitoring ECA parameters noninvasively may offer a useful test for the presence of such diseases whose diagnosis remains problematic. Here, we describe a method for computing ECA direction and orientation from simultaneous, noninvasive magnetogastrographic (MGG) and electrogastrographic (EGG) recordings. We demonstrate how independent component analysis and standard frequency analysis methods can be used to predict the locations and orientations of gastric current dipoles from MGG/EGG data. We compare our MGG-based dipole parameters to analogous ones obtained from simultaneous EGG recordings within the experimental framework of a human model. We find that magnetic recordings are superior in their ability to portray the underlying physiology of the stomach.	[Gallucci, Michael R.; Richards, William O.; Bradshaw, L.

This study describes this dynamics with a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. We recorded depth EEG of epileptic patients performing a face detection task and found that the stimuli induced strong modulations in the gamma band (40 Hz to 200 Hz) in selective occipital, parietal and temporal sites, in particular the fusiform gyros, the lateral occipital gyros and the intra-parietal sulcus. Occipito-temporal sites were the first to be activated, closely followed by the parietal sites, while portions of the primary visual cortex seemed to deactivate temporarily. Some of those effects were found to be correlated across distant sites, suggesting that a coordinated balance between regional gamma activations and deactivations could be involved during visual perception.

Seven male participants were kept awake for 24 h in a metabolic ward. Meals were given every 4 h and cognitive performance and sleepiness ratings were assessed hourly. The Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT, EEG derived) was performed twice after meal. Performance in simple reaction time showed a significant interaction of diet and the post-prandial period, a slower reaction time was observed for the HC-diet 3.5 h after meal intake. Diet did not affect EEG measures but a general post-prandial increase of objective sleepiness was observed 3.5 h after meal servings. The HC-diet was significantly associated with an increase of subjective sleepiness. The study demonstrated that the HC-diet caused larger oscillation in performance and increased sleepiness as compared to HF-diet throughout day and night. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vigabatrin increased the percentage of time that rats spent being immobile. During spontaneous walking in the open field, the speed of locomotion was increased by vigabatrin, while theta peak frequency was decreased. Vigabatrin also reduced the theta peak frequency during forced (speed controlled) walking. There was only a weak positive correlation (r = 0.22) between theta peak frequency and locomotor speed for the saline condition. Furthermore, vigabatrin abolishes the weak relationship between speed of locomotion and theta peak frequency. Vigabatrin and saline did not differ in the slope of the regression line, but showed different offset points at the theta peak frequency axis. Thus, other factors than speed of locomotion seem to be involved in determination of the theta peak frequency. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These impairments have been discussed as being associated with deficits in self-regulated action monitoring and anticipatory action plan generation. To study electrophysiological correlates of executive control - specifically action monitoring and action rule switching - under varying WM load, we used a paradigm derived from classic N-back (WM) tasks and requiring monitoring of simple actions. We focused on event-related changes in post-stimulus theta oscillatory activity during varying cognitive and WM demand in healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. The results show significant WM load and rule-switching-related increases of post-stimulus theta amplitude at fronto-central locations in controls. In patients with schizophrenia, there was no such modulation, but - apart from an increased early theta at left temporal locations - generally reduced late theta responses in all tasks and at all locations. Furthermore, the patients with schizophrenia showed significant differences in their error patterns, which imply differences in automation and anticipation of actions between controls and patients. These findings suggest that theta oscillations are involved in mediating frontal lobe activity and functions related to enhanced executive control. We conclude that the patients with schizophrenia showed deficits in acquiring a mental task set which appear to be associated with impairments in action monitoring and task-specific regulation of executive control.

All brain rhythms in healthy subjects appeared to be symmetrical and synchronous both in phase and frequency. In "acute" schizophrenics, opposite to healthy subjects, the distribution of cortical activity is asymmetrical, and in the chronic cases, the spectral power of most cortical rhythms is decreased as compared to healthy subjects. In the "acute" patients, interhemispheric connections are absent in all rhythms but alpha. In the chronic patients, the number of cortical connections is slightly higher than in the acute patients; and they are located in the posterior areas in the gamma rhythm. These neurophysiological aberrations evidently underlie the multiple mental activity disorders in schizophrenic patients. Thus, the correspondence between the brain rhythms and their synchronization is a necessary condition for normal perception, emotions and cognition evidently influencing behavior and consciousness.

Patterns form through interactions in both directions, so that the impact of transmitter molecule release can be analyzed to larger scales through synapses, dendrites, neurons, populations and brain systems to behavior, and control of that release can be described step-wise through transforms to smaller scales. Here we explore the feasibility of interpreting neurophysiological data in the context of many-body physics by using tools that physicists have devised to analyze comparable hierarchies in other fields of science. We focus on a mesoscopic level that offers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and the macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We use electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode arrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in rabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the various modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert transform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of' amplitude (AM) and phase modulations (PM) of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize in the beta and gamma ranges in very short time lags over very long distances. The dominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic transmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations owing to finite propagation velocities and sequential synaptic delays. It does not. EEGs show evidence for anomalous dispersion: neural populations have a low velocity range of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the spread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does not explain it. In this report we analyze these phenomena using concepts of energy dissipation, the maintenance by cortex of multiple ground states corresponding to AM patterns, and the exclusive selection by spontaneous breakdown of symmetry (SBS) of single states in sequential phase transitions.

Non-linear mathematical analysis of EEG frequency components has confirmed the presence of a pre-ictal state in focal epilepsy. We report on functional MRI (fMRI) analysis of the pre-ictal state in three patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Each subject had a typical partial seizure in the scanner while continuous blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI images were acquired. The pre-ictal BOLD changes were first analysed by statistically comparing BOLD signals of two one-minute blocks. Further examination of the full time course was then performed. Each patient showed highly significant, focal BOLD signal changes. In Patient 1, a striking pre-ictal BOLD signal increase was seen over the region of the seizure focus identified on complementary epilepsy investigations. No significant BOLD signal decreases were observed. Patient 2 showed widespread pre-ictal BOLD increase contralateral to the presumed seizure focus, as well as a focal BOLD decrease near the presumed seizure focus. In Patient 3, pre-ictal BOLD increase was co-localized with the site of hyperperfusion seen on ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, this was contralateral to the seizure focus localization based on seizure symptomatology. No significant BOLD decreases were seen. The time course data in each patient studied showed change of the BOLD signal several minutes before the onset of the seizure. Highly significant BOLD fMRI signal changes occur before the onset of seizures, supporting the presence of a pre-ictal state. These changes can be localized to the site of the presumed seizure focus, as well as to other brain regions, suggesting that the pre-ictal BOLD signal changes and their underlying mechanisms are complex.

Significant differences in caffeine consumption and smoking habits were observed between the two groups. Plasma samples were taken from each subject before (T-0) and after caffeine intake at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Three pharmacokinetic parameters: half-life (t(1/2)), maximum time (T-max) and maximum plasma concentration (C-max) were calculated from caffeine plasma concentration measurements determined by reversed phase HPLC analysis. Caffeine-sensitive subjects showed significantly greater half-life values when calculated on 24 h after the administration than tolerant subjects (p < 0.05). Since the elimination kinetics were similar on the first 6 h after caffeine administration, the increased caffeine clearance observed overnight, when smoking was resumed in the control group, may indicate a short delay for the induction of hepatic cytochrome, reported here for the first time. Electrophysiological responses to caffeine, including vigilance and cortical activity, were assessed by ambulatory electroencephalographic (EEG) recorded during a period of 6 h before and after caffeine consumption. Following caffeine intake, the caffeine-intolerant subjects presented an increase in vigilance levels with faster peak alpha, beta frequency and lower delta and theta power when compared to tolerant subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters and EEG data showed significant differences between sleep-sensitive and control subjects. These variations may be, in part, explained by cigarette smoking and the higher caffeine intake observed in the subjects of the control groups while caffeine sleep-sensitive subjects have a significantly lower caffeine intake, as already reported in previous studies on patients with sleep disturbances.

Applied to time series, AMI provides a measure of future points predictability from past points. Five minutes of recording were acquired with a 148-channel wholehead magnetometer (AIIAGNES 2500 NVH, 413 Neuroimaging) in 12 patients with probable AD and 12 elderly control subjects. Artifact-free epochs of 20 seconds (3392 points, sample frequency of 169.6 Hz) were selected for our study. Our results showed that the absolute values of the averaged decline rate of AIM were lower in AD patients than in control subjects for all channels. In addition, there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) in most channels. These preliminary results suggest that neuronal dysfunction in AD is associated with differences in the dynamical processes underlying the MEG recording.

The current routine SEP paradigm is markedly predictive for future cerebral palsy (CP) or other neurocognitive sequelae in brain-injured babies. Recent advances in basic science have dramatically increased our knowledge about structural-functional development of SEP-related brain mechanisms. It has thereby become apparent that preterm SEP differs from that in more mature counterparts in that it also comprises responses from transient brain structures, and hence being unique to the preterm period. It is now obvious also that several aspects in the current SEP paradigm, ranging from the type of stimulation to the methods of recording and analysis, are suboptimal for preterm babies. Recent progress in recording and analysis techniques have made it possible to combine SEP studies with EEG recordings, as well as to implement advanced analyses (e.g. time-frequency analysis) into routine practice. This review summarizes literature from relevant areas in basic science, and proposes a novel, integrated approach in neonatal SEP studies in order to significantly increase the fidelity of testing somatosensory system.

In the present study, the overnight sleep cycles (SC) of 20 normal subjects were analyzed according to their stage composition, CAP rate, phase A subtypes and arousals. Individual SC were then divided into 10 normalized temporal epochs. CAP parameters and arousals were measured in each epoch and averaged in relation to the SC order. Subtypes A2 and A3 of CAP in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and arousals, both in REM and NREM sleep when not coincident with a A2 or A3 phases, were lumped together as fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activities (FA). Subtypes A1 of CAP, characterized by slow EEG activities (SA), were analyzed separately. The time distribution of SA and FA was compared to the mathematical model of normal sleep structure including functions representing the homeostatic process S, the circadian process C, the ultradian process generating NREM/REM cycles and the slow wave activity (SWA) resulting from the interaction between homeostatic and ultradian processes. The relationship between SA and FA and the sleep-model components was evaluated by multiple regression analysis in which SA and FA were considered as dependent variables while the covariates were the process S, process C, SWA, REM-on and REM-off activities and their squared values. Regression was highly significant (P < 0.0001) for both SA and FA. SA were prevalent in the first three SC, and exhibited single or multiple peaks immediately before and in the final part of deep sleep (stages 3 + 4). The peaks of FA were delayed and prevailed during the pre-REM periods of light sleep (stages 1 + 2) and during REM sleep. SA showed an exponential decline across the successive SC, according to the homeostatic process. In contrast, the distribution of FA was not influenced by the order of SC, with periodic peaks of FA occurring before the onset of REM sleep, in accordance with the REM-on switch. The dynamics of CAP and arousals during sleep can be viewed as an intermediate level between cellular activities and macroscale EEG phenomena as they reflect the decay of the homeostatic process and the interaction between REM-off and REM-on mechanisms while are slightly influenced by circadian rhythm.

Our objective was to analyze cortical activation, on a scale of hundreds of milliseconds, occurring during the process of dynamic cooling and warming, based on an evaluation of the amplitude changes seen in 10 Hz electroencephalographic oscillations. Eleven right-handed subjects were exposed to innocuous cold ramp stimuli (from 32 degrees C to 22 degrees C, 10 degrees C/s) and warm ramp stimuli (32 degrees C to 42 degrees C, 10 degrees C/s) on the thenar region of their right palm, using a contact thermode. EEG was recorded from Ill scalp sites, and the 10 Hz current source densities were modeled using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. During cooling, the earliest amplitude decreases of 10 Hz oscillations were seen in the contralateral posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and the premotor cortex (PMC). During warming, the earliest events were only observed in the PMC and occurred approximate to 0.7 s later than during cooling. Linear regression analysis between 10 Hz current source densities and temperature variations revealed cooling-sensitive activation in the bilateral posterior insula, PMC and the anterior cingulate cortex. During warming, the amplitude of 10 Hz oscillations in the PMC and posterior insula correlated with stimulus temperature. Dynamic thermal stimulation activates, in addition to the posterior insula and parietal operculum, the lateral PMC. The activation of the anterior cingulate cortex during cooling may aid in the anticipation of the cold temperature end-point and provide continuous evaluation of the thermal stimulus.

However, cognitive function may depend more crucially upon a dynamic alternation between synchronous and desynchronous activity rather than synchronous behaviour per se. The principle aim of this study is to develop and validate a novel method of quantifying this complex process. The method permits a direct mapping of phase synchronous dynamics and desynchronizing bursts in the spatial and temporal domains. Two data sets are analyzed: Numeric data from a model of a sparsely coupled neural cell assembly and experimental data consisting of scalp-recorded EEG from 40 human subjects. In the numeric data, the approach enables the demonstration of complex relationships between cluster size and temporal duration that cannot be detected with other methods. Dynamic patterns of phase-clustering and desynchronization are also demonstrated in the experimental data. It is further shown that in a significant proportion of the recordings, the pattern of dynamics exhibits nonlinear structure. We argue that this procedure provides a 'natural partitioning' of ongoing brain dynamics into topographically distinct synchronous epochs which may be integral to the brain's adaptive function. In particular, the character of transitions between consecutive synchronous epochs may reflect important aspects of information processing and cognitive flexibility.

Here, we measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) with an aim to characterize and classify single MEG trials during finger movements. We also examined whether averaging consecutive trials, or averaging signals from neighboring sensors, would improve classification accuracy. Methods: MEG was recorded in five subjects during lifting the left, right or both index fingers. Trials were classified using features, defined by an expert, from averaged spectra and time-frequency representations. Results: Classification accuracy of left vs. right finger movements was 80-94%. In the three-category classification (left, right, both), accuracy was 57-67%. Averaging three consecutive trials improved classification significantly in three subjects. Instead, spatial averaging across neighboring sensors decreased accuracy. Conclusions: The use of averaged signals to find appropriate features for single-trial classification proved useful for the two-class classification. The classification accuracy was comparable to that in previous EEG studies. Significance: MEG provides another useful method to measure brain signals to be used in BCIs. Good performance was obtained when the classified signals were generated by two distinct sources in the left and right hemisphere. The present findings should be extended to multi-task cases involving additional brain areas. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In both age groups, encoding of the four-word memory set elicited ERS in the theta and alpha frequency range. Theta ERS, and ERD in the alpha and beta bands were observed during retrieval. During encoding, the elderly showed greater alpha ERS and smaller theta ERS. During retrieval, smaller alpha ERD and theta ERS was found in the elderly subjects. Also, in the elderly, beta ERD was elicited in the late time window during retrieval. The statistically significant differences between the age groups were more marked during retrieval than during encoding. The results indicate that although the two groups performed equally well behaviorally in the task and the elderly subjects were cognitively intact, normal aging affects oscillatory theta, alpha and beta responses particularly during retrieval from working memory. The ERD/ERS patterns of the elderly resemble those of children found in a recent study, which might suggest that those memory-related brain processes that evolve later in childhood are the first to be affected in older age.

We recorded the EEG of 10 patients with ET, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 controls. Subjects pressed an on-off switch in a self-paced manner with the thumb of their less (T+) and more (T++) tremulous hand. After digitalization of the EEG from the Cz, C3, C4 electrodes the movement reactive beta frequency, its maximum peak power value and its latency triggered to movement offset were determined. In ET tremor intensity did not influence the power of PMBS, however it was significantly delayed after the movement of the more tremulous hand. In Parkinson's disease after the movement of the more tremulous hand PMBS power was decreased, but it was not delayed. In controls the side of movement had no effect on the power and latency of the PMBS. The neuronal mechanisms underlying PMBS generation are differently affected in essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. The increase of PMBS latency after movement of the more affected hand in ET indicates possible cortical mechanisms in essential tremor generation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hamada, T				Hamada, T			A model for the mechanism of generating the auditory evoked field	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article							PHASE-LOCKING; POTENTIALS; LOCALIZATION; AREAS; EEG	The auditory evoked potentials and fields, recorded with electro- and magneto-encephalography, respectively, have the prominent peak at the latency of about 100 ms, named N100(m). The mechanism for generating the peak is not yet fully elucidated, however. Firstly, this study reviewed empirical results on the mechanism that had been previously published by the same author. The results showed that phases of the ongoing oscillations at around 6 Hz above the auditory cortex are locked with respect to onsets of the auditory stimuli during the period of N100 m, and also that powers of the oscillations are increased during the same period. Taking into account these results as well as another evidence that the peak arises from multiple sources within the auditory cortex, a model for the mechanism of generating the auditory N100 m was proposed. The model assumed several oscillators in the auditory cortex, whose phases were locked during the period of N100 m, but not locked at other periods. Computer simulation validated the model. The model could represent a starting point for further experiment and simulation.

The P3 (P300) response was evoked using a three-stimulus visual oddball paradigm and a phenotype that relates to the energy in the theta band (4-5 Hz) was analyzed. Studies have shown that similar electrophysiological measures represent cognitive correlates of attention, working memory, and response selection; a role has been suggested for the ascending cholinergic pathway in the same functions. The results of our genetic association tests, combined with knowledge regarding the presence of presynaptic cholinergic M2 autoreceptors in the basal forebrain, indicate that the cognitive processes required by the experiment may in part be mediated by inhibitory neural networks. These findings underscore the utility of electrophysiology and neurogenetics in the understanding of cognitive function and the study of brain-related disorders.

Role of corpus callosum in interhemispheric coherent activity during sleep	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; callosotomy; corpus callosum; EEG coherence; EEG correlation; sleep	INTRAHEMISPHERIC EEG CORRELATION; EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT CHANGES; REM-SLEEP; WAKEFULNESS; SPINDLES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; CALLOSOTOMY; INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONY	Objective: To investigate to what extent the increase in interhemispheric coherent activity observed from wakefulness to sleep depends on the integrity of the corpus callosum (CC). Methods: Interhemispheric coherent activity was analyzed in two epileptic patients selected for callosotomy because of multifocal refractory epilepsy, before and 4 months after callosotomy. One patient underwent complete callosotomy and another was subjected to callosotomy of the anterior 2/3, which offered the possibility of comparing the role of the CC in the coherent activity increase from wakefulness to sleep, between anterior regions with interrupted CC communication (in the two patients) and posterior regions with intact communication (in one of them). Results were compared with a group of normal subjects. Results: Both patients showed increased coherent activity from wakefulness to sleep after surgery. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that interhemispheric coherent activity, despite an attenuation after surgery, is higher during SWS than during wakefulness after sectioning the CC; however, they have to be taken with caution because they come from two patients only. Significance: Present results show that the increase in coherent activity during sleep does not depend exclusively on callosal integrity but also on state-dependent influences from sleep-promoting mechanisms, probably spread throughout the thalamo-cortical network.

In the present study, an information criterion method, in which the penalty functions are selected based on the spatio-temporal source model, has been developed to estimate the number of independent dipole sources from, electromagnetic measurements such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the estimation of the source number. A three-concentric-spheres head model was used to approximate the head volume conductor. Three kinds of typical signal sources, i.e., the damped sinusoid sources, sinusoid sources with one frequency band and sinusoid sources with two separated frequency bands, were used to simulate the oscillation characteristics of brain electric sources. The simulation results suggest that the present method can provide a good estimate of the number of independent dipole sources from the EEG measurements. In addition, the present simulation results suggest that choosing the optimal penalty function can successfully reduce the effect of noise on the estimation of number of independent sources. The present study suggests that the information criterion method may provide a useful means in estimating the number of independent brain electrical sources from EEG/MEG measurements.

Although computer-aided techniques have been used in pharmaceutical research (e.g. in structure- and ligand-based drug design), the power of dynamical models has not yet been exploited in drug discovery. We suggest that dynamical system theory and computational neuroscience - integrated with well-established, conventional molecular and electrophysiological methods - offer a broad perspective in drug discovery and in the search for novel targets and strategies for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

Repetition suppression of induced gamma band responses is eliminated by task switching	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						human EEG; implicit memory; induced gamma band response; oscillations; sharpening	OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PRIMING TASK; MEMORY; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION	The formation of cortical object representations requires the activation of cell assemblies, correlated by induced oscillatory bursts of activity > 20 Hz (induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). One marker of the functional dynamics within such cell assemblies is the suppression of iGBRs elicited by repeated stimuli. This effect is commonly interpreted as a signature of 'sharpening' processes within cell-assemblies, which are behaviourally mirrored in repetition priming effects. The present study investigates whether the sharpening of primed objects is an automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing, or whether it depends on task demands. Participants performed either a 'living/non-living' or a 'bigger/smaller than a shoebox' classification on repeated pictures of everyday objects. We contrasted repetition-related iGBR effects after the same task was used for initial and repeated presentations (no-switch condition) with repetitions after a task-switch occurred (switch condition). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analysis by examining other brain responses known to be modulated by repetition-related memory processes (evoked gamma oscillations and event-related potentials; ERPs). The results obtained for the 'no-switch' condition replicated previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs at 200-300 ms after stimulus onset. Source modelling showed that this effect was distributed over widespread cortical areas. By contrast, after a task-switch no iGBR suppression was found. We concluded that iGBRs reflect the sharpening of a cell assembly only within the same task. After a task switch the complete object representation is reactivated. The ERP (220-380 ms) revealed suppression effects independent of task demands in bilateral posterior areas and might indicate correlates of repetition priming in perceptual structures.

Methods: We used a prospective. power analysis-driven, age-matched design to Study 20 subjects with nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). MEG was used to localize the Source area of interictal spikes. H-1-MRS measured integrated peak areas for N-acetyl compounds (NAA) and choline-containing compounds (Cho) in both hippocampi, the MEG spike zone, and the region contralateral to the MEG spike zone in all Subjects. H-1-MRS was performed in seven controls. Results: Fifteen of 20 Subjects had a lower NAA/Cho ratio in the MEG spike zone compared with the contralateral homologous region. NAA/Cho was significantly decreased in the MEG spike zone (p < 0.01). NAA/Cho ratios were not significantly different between the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the spike activity, or from control hippocampi. NAA/Cho ratios did not correlate with spike frequency. Conclusions: Metabolic dysfunction is present in focal areas of interictal spiking in nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings confirm that functional abnormalities can be detected ill vivo in radiographically normal-appearing cortex exhibiting abnormal excitability.

Both activity and silence are stable network states, but the mechanisms of their alternation remain unknown. We show, using simultaneous multisite intracellular recordings in cats, that slow rhythm involves all neocortical neurons and that both activity and silence started almost synchronously in cells located up to 12 mm apart. Activity appeared predominantly at the area 5/7 border and spread in both anterior and posterior directions. The activity started earlier in fast-spiking cells and intrinsically bursting cells than in regular-spiking neurons. These results provide direct evidence for two mechanisms of active state generation: spread of activity from a local focus and synchronization of weaker activity, originating at multiple locations. Surprisingly, onsets of silent states were synchronized even more precisely than the onsets of activity, showing no latency bias for location or cell type. This most intriguing finding exposes a major gap in understanding the nature of state alternation. We suggest that it is the synchronous termination of activity and occurrence of silent states of the neuronal network that makes the EEG picture during slow-wave sleep so characteristic. Synchronous onset of silence in distant neurons cannot rely exclusively on properties of individual cells and synapses, such as adaptation of neuronal firing or synaptic depression; instead, it implies the existence of a network mechanism. Revealing this yet unknown large-scale mechanism, which switches network activity to silence, will aid our understanding of the origin of brain rhythms in normal function and pathology.

As these neurons project to the septum and hippocampus, it is generally assumed that their role is to mediate ascending activation, leading to the hippocampal theta rhythm. However, the connections between SUM and the septohippocampal system are reciprocal; there is Strong evidence that theta remains in the hippocampus after SUM lions and in the SUM after lesioning the medial septum. The present study examines the dynamics of coupling between rhythmic discharge in the SUM and hippocampal field potential oscillations, using the directionality information carried by the two signals. Using directed transfer function analysis, we demonstrate that during sensory-elicited theta rhythm and also during short episodes of theta acceleration of spontaneous oscillations, the spike train of a subpopulation Of SUM neurons contains information predicting future variations in rhythmic field potentials in the hippocampus. in contrast, during slow spontaneous theta rhythm, it is the SUM spike signal that can be predicted from the preceding segment of the electrical signal recorded in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that, in the anesthetized rat, SUM neurons effectively drive theta oscillations in the hippocampus during epochs of sensory-elicited theta rhythm and short episodes of theta acceleration, whereas spontaneous slow theta in the SUM is controlled by descending input from the septohippocampal system. Thus, in certain states, rhythmically firing SUM neurons function to accelerate the septal theta oscillator, and in others, they are entrained by a superordinate oscillatory network.

Towards a proper estimation of phase synchronization from time series	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						phase synchronization; time series; EEG; epilepsy	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; HILBERT TRANSFORM; AMPLITUDE; SIGNAL; WAVELET; ORIGIN	In experimental synchronization studies a continuous phase variable is commonly estimated from a scalar time series by means of its representation on the complex plane. The aim is to obtain a pair of functions {A(t), phi(t)} defining its instantaneous amplitude and phase, respectively. However, any arbitrary pair of functions cannot be considered as the amplitude and the phase of the real observable. Here. we point out some criteria that the pair {A(t), phi(t)} must observe to unambiguously define the instantaneous amplitude and phase of the observed signal. In this work, we illustrate how the complex representation may fail if the signal possesses a multi-component or a broadband spectra. We also point out a practical procedure to test whether a signal, not displaying a single oscillation at a unique frequency, has a narrow-band behavior. Implications for the study of phase interdependencies are illustrated and discussed. Phase dynamics estimated from electric brain activities recorded from an epileptic patient are also discussed.

There is some evidence that RBD patients have more of slow-wave sleep (SWS) than healthy elderly subjects. No study has looked at quantitative electroencephalogram analysis during non-R-EM sleep in either primary or secondary, RBD. The aim of this study was to assess the increase of SWS and to analyze different electroencephalographic frequency ranges during non-REM sleep in 28 idiopathic RBD patients compared with 28 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Idiopathic RBD patients spent more time in SWS (men: 1.4%; women: 5.9%) than control subjects (men: 0.4%; women: 0.6%: p = 0.004). Spectral analyses demonstrated that idiopathic RBD patients had increased all-night delta power in comparison with control subjects (p = 002). This study shows an increase of SWS and power in the delta band during non-REM sleep in idiopathic RBD patients compared with control subjects. Results are discussed about the possible nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment in RBD patients and the association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders.

Oscillatory correlates of the primacy effect in episodic memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; gamma; free-recall; episodic memory; encoding	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; THETA SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG ACTIVITY; ALPHA; ATTENTION; CORTEX; RETENTION; POWER; FMRI; TIME	Both intracranial and scalp EEG studies have demonstrated that oscillatory activity, especially in the gamma band (28 to 100 Hz), can differentiate successful and unsuccessful episodic encoding [Sederberg, P.B., Kahana, M.J., Howard, M.W., Donner, E.J., Madsen, J.R., 2003.

Dissociable neural mechanisms for encoding predictable and unpredictable events. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]. Although the probability of recalling an item varies as a function of where it appeared in the list, the relation between the oscillatory dynamics of successful encoding and serial position remains unexplored. We recorded scalp EEG as participants studied lists of common nouns in a delayed free-recall task. Because early list items were recalled better than items from later serial positions (the primacy effect), we analyzed encoding-related changes in 2 to 100 Hz oscillatory power as a function of serial position. Increases in gamma power in posterior regions predicted successful encoding at early serial positions; widespread low-frequency (4-14 Hz) power decreases predicted successful memory formation for later serial positions. These results suggest that items in early serial positions receive an encoding boost due to focused encoding without having to divide resources among numerous list items. Later in the list, as memory load increases, encoding is divided between multiple items. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These analysis techniques have been applied to empirical data recorded in various branches of research, ranging from economics to biomedical sciences. Investigations of interactions between different brain structures are of strong interest in neuroscience. The information contained in electromagnetic signals may be used to quantify the information transfer between those structures. When investigating such interactions, one has to face an inverse problem. Usually the distinct features and different conceptual properties of the underlying processes generating the empirical data and therefore the appropriate analysis technique are not known in advance. The performance of these methods has mainly been assessed on the basis of those model systems they have been developed for. To draw reliable conclusions upon application to empirical time series, understanding the properties and performances of the time series analysis techniques is essential. To this aim, the performances Of four representative multivariate linear signal processing techniques in the time and frequency domain have been investigated in this study. The partial cross-spectral analysis and three different quantities measuring Granger causality, i.e. a Granger causality index, partial directed coherence, and the directed transfer function are compared on the basis of different model systems. To capture distinct properties in the dynamics of brain neural networks, we have investigated multivariate linear, multivariate nonlinear as well as multivariate non-stationary model systems. In an application to neural data recorded by electrothalamography and electrocorticography from juvenile pigs under sedation, directed as well as time-varying interactions have been studied between thalamic and cortical brain structures. The time-dependent alterations in local activity and changes in the interactions have been analyzed by the Granger causality index and the partial directed coherence, Both methods have been shown to be most suitable for this application to brain neural networks based on our model systems investigated. The results of this investigation contribute to the long-term goal to understand the relationships in neural structures in an abnormal state of deep sedation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We recently created knockin (KI) mice harboring a point mutation (serine 270 to histidine) in the GABA(A)-R alpha 1 subunit. This mutation abolishes sensitivity of recombinant GABAA-Rs to isoflurane while maintaining normal sensitivity to halothane and increasing the potency of GABA KI mice showed abnormalities in the EEG baseline, including occasional spike-wave activity and spindle-like bursts. When anesthetized with isoflurane, the KI mice but not the control mice revealed repetitive 4-5Hz slow wave discharges in the cortical EEG. KI mice did not differ from controls in response to isoflurane or halothane in the standard tail clamp/withdrawal and loss of righting reflex assays. We recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells in brain slices. mIPSCs in neurons from KI mice were of normal amplitude, but decayed more slowly than controls Hippocampal mIPSCs in control mice were significantly prolonged by 0 4 and 0.9 MAC isoflurane, and by 0.5 MAC halothane. In KI mice, the effect of isoflurane on mIPSC decay was dramatically reduced, while halothane prolonged mIPSCs as for controls. We conclude that the kinetic and pharmacological proper-ties of hippocampal GABAA-Rs in the KI mouse recapitulate many features of mutant alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 GABA(A)-Rs observed in vitro GABAA-Rs containing alpha 1 subunits do not appear to contribute to the actions of isoflurane in the spinal cord, but both EEG and synaptic recordings provide evidence for effects of isoflurane on these GABAA-R isoforms in cortical structures.

Dynamic causal modeling of evoked responses in EEG and MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; neural networks; nonlinear dynamics; causal modeling; Bayesian inference	GRANGER CAUSALITY; BRAIN-STEM; TOP-DOWN; FMRI; CORTEX; ATTENTION; FACE; REPRESENTATION; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Neuronally plausible, generative or forward models are essential for understanding how event-related fields (ERFs) and potentials (ERPs) are generated. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme, in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among well-defined neuronal subpopulations. In a previous paper, we simulated ERPs using a hierarchical neural-mass model that embodied bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections among remote regions. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian procedure to estimate the parameters of this model using empirical data. We demonstrate this procedure by characterizing the role of changes in cortico-cortical coupling, in the genesis of ERPs. In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the face-selective N170, could be explained by category-specific differences in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework.

Methods: The animals were first tested with the GABA(B) agonist L-baclofen followed by the GABA(B) antagonist SCH 50911. Moreover, digital EEGs recorded under experimental conditions were processed at baseline and 10 and 20 min after L-baclofen injection. This procedure was followed by injection of the GABA(B) antagonist SCH50911 and by an additional EEG evaluation at 10 and 20 min from drug administration. The power spectra analysis of signals was obtained for delta (0.5-3 Hz), theta (3.5-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-20 Hz), and gamma (21-50 Hz) frequencies. Results: The spiking pattern and power spectrum of beta activity was increased by <= 80% after administration of 5 mg/kg L-baclofen, whereas gamma power frequency decreased to the same extent. After administration of 50 mg/kg SCH 50911, spiking activity and beta power frequencies were markedly reduced (> 80%), whereas gamma power increased (correlation, 0.92; p < 0.001). The remaining frequency bands were unaffected. Conclusions: This study confirms the potential of GABA(B) antagonists in contrasting seizure absence in rodent models and suggests the application of drugs with a similar mechanism in humans. In addition, because GABA(B) antagonists not only contrast seizure in rodent models of absence but also improve '' cognitive '' performance, it could be hypothesized that gamma increase, correlated with optimized cortical binding during coherent percepts, may produce potential cognition-enhancing effects.

The EEG was recorded while students were performing two tasks: the Raven's advanced progressive matrices (RAPM), and identifying emotions in pictures (IDEM). Significant differences in event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) related to verbal/performance intelligence were only observed while respondents solved the RAPM. The HIQ and AIQ groups displayed temporal and spatial differently induced gamma band activity. Significant differences in ERD/ERS related to emotional intelligence were only observed for the IDEM task. HEIQ individuals displayed more gamma band ERS and less upper alpha band ERD than did AEIQ individuals. It can be concluded that H IQ and HEIQ individuals employed more adequate strategies for solving the problems at hand. The results further suggest that emotional intelligence and verbal/performance intelligence represent distinct components of the cognitive architecture. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous research has suggested that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may explain the pathology observed in ASD. Because EEG oscillations in the mu frequency (8-13 Hz) over sensorimotor cortex are thought to reflect mirror neuron activity, one method for testing the integrity of this system is to measure mu responsiveness to actual and observed movement. It has been established that mu power is reduced (mu suppression) in typically developing individuals both when they perform actions and when they observe others performing actions, reflecting an observation/execution system which may play a critical role in the ability to understand and imitate others' behaviors. This study investigated whether individuals with ASD show a dysfunction in this system, given their behavioral impairments in understanding and responding appropriately to others' behaviors. Mu wave suppression was measured in ten high-functioning individuals with ASD and ten age- and gender-matched control subjects while watching videos of (1) a moving hand, (2) a bouncing ball, and (3) visual noise, or (4) moving their own hand. Control subjects showed significant mu suppression to both self and observed hand movement. The ASD group showed significant mu suppression to self-performed hand movements but not to observed hand movements. These results support the hypothesis of a dysfunctional mirror neuron system in high-functioning individuals with ASD. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In concordance, deficits in decision making have been observed in human patients with damage to the PFC. Contemporary accounts of decision making suggest that emotion guides the process of decision making by ways of providing for reward-punishment contingencies. A task capable of assessing the influence of reward and punishment on decision making is the Iowa gambling task. In this task decisions become motivated by inherent punishment and reward schedules. Insensitivity for punishment together with a strong reward dependency results in risk taking, which is in the gambling task the disadvantageous strategy. Interestingly, the processing of punishment and reward is argued to be lateralized over the right and left PFC, respectively. Here we investigated whether more relative left compared to right-sided frontal brain activity (left-sided dominance) quantified as reduced alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) would lead to a more risky, disadvantageous pattern of decision making. Contrary to what was expected, relatively more right compared to left frontal brain activity was strongly associated with the disadvantageous strategy. The results are discussed in terms of recent theoretical accounts which argue that the functional interpretation of baseline frontal alpha activity depends on the mental operation involved and does not necessarily imply inactivity.

Although recent studies suggest that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) provides an endogenous control system that influences the occurrence of absence seizures, the mechanisms of propagation of cortical epileptic discharges in the STN have never been explored. The present study provides the first description of the electrophysiological activity in the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal network during absence seizures in the genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg, a well established model of absence epilepsy. In corticosubthalamic neurons, the SWDs were associated with repetitive suprathreshold depolarizations correlated with EEG spikes. These cortical paroxysms were reflected in the STN by synchronized, rhythmic, high-frequency bursts of action potentials. Intracellular recordings revealed that the intraburst pattern in STN neurons was sculpted by an early depolarizing synaptic potential, followed by a short hyperpolarization and a rebound of excitation. The rhythmic hyperpolarizations in STN neurons during SWDs likely originate from a subpopulation of pallidal neurons exhibiting rhythmic bursting temporally correlated with the EEG spikes. The repetitive discharges in STN neurons accompanying absence seizures might convey powerful excitation to basal ganglia output nuclei and, consequently, may participate in the control of thalamocortical SWDs.

In the current study, theta activity of cue-elicited field potentials and multiple unit activity in posterior cingulate cortical areas 29b and 29c/d, and in the associated anterior ventral (AV) thalamic nucleus, was monitored while rabbits underwent discriminative avoidance conditioning. Theta activity in the field potentials occurred during training in areas 29b and 29c/d, and was severely attenuated by electrolytic lesions in the dorsal hippocampus. Significant theta rhythmicity was not evident in multiple unit activity recorded from area 29c/d, either in lesioned or sham-operated subjects. However, theta-like modulation was evident in the multiple unit activity of area 29b, and in the AV thalamic nucleus, occurring in synchrony with the field potential oscillations. Theta rhythmicity of unit activity in these areas was unaffected by dorsal hippocampal lesions. These results suggest that theta-frequency oscillations apparent in posterior cingulate cortical field potentials are volume-conducted from the dorsal hippocampus, but that theta-like unit activity in posterior cingulate cortical area 29b and in the AV thalamic nucleus occurs independently of hippocampal theta.

Although this projection has been extensively studied, the precise actions of its transmitters, dopamine (DA) and GABA, on PFC pyramidal neurons remain to be determined. We have recently shown that VTA stimulation elicits a sustained depolarization in PFC pyramidal neurons resembling the periodic depolarizations (up states) these neurons exhibit. This response was shortened by a D-1 antagonist, suggesting that DA may sustain depolarized up states in PFC neurons. Here, we tested whether spontaneous PFC up states in vivo require spontaneous VTA activity. Intracellular recordings from PFC neurons conducted simultaneously with VTA local field potentials (LFPs) revealed PFC membrane potential fluctuations occurring synchronously with VTA field potential transitions. Extracellular PFC recordings performed simultaneously with VTA LFPs also indicated a high coherence between these two regions, with VTA oscillations trailing PFC oscillations by a few milliseconds. Furthermore, blockade of VTA activity with lidocaine transiently eliminated PFC LFPs, but not PFC cell up states; instead, up states became irregular during intra-VTA lidocaine administration. These results suggest that baseline levels of VTA activity are necessary for synchronizing PFC pyramidal neurons in the up-down oscillations observed in the anesthetized preparation, allowing the emergence of slow EEG components.

J	Gais, S; Born, J				Gais, S; Born, J			Declarative memory consolidation: Mechanisms acting during human sleep	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Review							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; MOTOR NEURON SYNAPSES; LATE NOCTURNAL SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLE; ACETYLCHOLINE; HIPPOCAMPUS; TRANSITIONS; IMPROVEMENT	Of late, an increasing number of studies have shown a strong relationship between sleep and memory. Here we summarize a series of our own studies in humans supporting a beneficial influence of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on declarative memory formation, and try to identify some mechanisms that might underlie this influence. Specifically, these experiments show that declarative memory benefits mainly from sleep periods dominated by SWS, whereas there is no consistent benefit of this memory from periods rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A main mechanism of declarative memory formation is believed to be the reactivation of newly acquired memory representations in hippocampal networks that stimulates a transfer and integration of these representations into neocortical neuronal networks. Consistent with this model, spindle activity and slow oscillation-related EEG coherence increase during early sleep after intense declarative learning in humans, signs that together point toward a neocortical reprocessing of the learned material. In addition, sleep seems to provide an optimal milieu for declarative memory reprocessing and consolidation by reducing cholinergic activation and the cortisol feedback to the hippocampus during SWS.

Design: Prospective study. Settings: University sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten normal healthy subjects (6 girls and 4 boys, mean age 4.6 years; range 3-6 years) underwent polysomnography recordings for 2 consecutive nights in a standard laboratory setting. Sleep data were stored on a computer using a polysomnography digital system (Embla N7000, Medcare, Iceland). Sleep structure was visually scored according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. The cyclic alternating pattern was visually scored following the criteria by Terzano et al. These criteria were modified for the purposes of this study because it was noticed that, at the age of the group under analysis, most electroencephalogram arousals, often accompanied by electromyogram activation, are expressed at the level of the electroencephalogram by theta frequencies and not alpha or higher frequencies. Measurements and results: The CAP rate in preschool-aged children (25.93%) showed a progressive increase with the deepness of sleep, with highest values during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 3 (44.0%) and 4 sleep (46.08%) and lowest values in NREM stage 2 (17.26%). The CAP time showed its longest duration during stage 2 sleep, followed by stage 4, stage 3, and NREM stage 1. The CAP cycle duration showed no differences across NREM stages. The cyclic alternating pattern phase A was longer and phase B was shorter during stage 1 than during stages 2, 3, and 4. A1 phases were the most numerous (63.2%), followed by A2 (21.5%) and by A3 (15.3%). The distribution of A-phase subtypes across NREM sleep stages (A index) showed significant differences for the A1 subtypes that occurred more frequently during stage 3 and 4 sleep than during stages 1 and 2. The A2 index showed no significant differences across NREM sleep stages, while the A3 index was significantly higher during stage I sleep than during stages 2, 3, and 4. The analysis of the A1 interval distribution showed a log-normal-like distribution with a peak around 25 seconds for the A1 phases and no clear peak for A2-A3 phases. Conclusions: The analysis of CAP in preschool-aged children is characterized by an increase of CAP rate during slow-wave sleep and a high percentage of A1 phases and A2 phases. However, the lower percentage of A1 paralleled by an increase of A2 could represent a signal of higher sleep instability in this age group as compared with prepubertal school-aged children.

Several dissociations between LRP and mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA were found. Mu-MRAA and beta-MRAA, but not LRP, exhibited an early and strong reversal in cortical lateralization when advance preparation for a switch of response hand was required. LRP, but not mu-MRAA or beta-MRAA, was sensitive to manipulation of the probability that advance preparation of response hand would be useful in a response precuing task. These dissociations replicate earlier findings and suggest that movement-related cortical rhythms and cortical potentials are associated with distinct preparatory component processes that differ in terms of level of abstraction and effort, in line with similar functional distinctions between component processes underlying executive control in task switching. This suggests that a fine-grained analysis of subprocesses involved in motor control may provide important guiding principles for the study and understanding of levels and mechanisms of cognitive control.

Methods: We use intermittent pulse stimulation in the frequency range 10-20 Hz. A quantitative measure of spectral phase demodulation, the relative phase clustering index (rPCI) was applied to the evoked EEG signals, measured from electrodes implanted in the hippocampal formation. Results: We found that in the interictal periods, high values of rPCI recorded from specific sites were correlated with the most probable seizure onset sites (SOS). Furthermore we found that high values of rPCI from certain locations correlated with shorter time intervals to the next seizure. Conclusions: Our clinical findings indicate that although the precise moment of ictal transitions is in general unpredictable, it may be possible to estimate the probability of occurrence of some epileptic seizures. Significance: The use of the rPCI for probabilistic forecasting of upcoming epileptic seizures is warranted. rPCI measurements may be used to guide interventions with the aim of modifying local tissue excitability that ultimately might prevent ictal transitions.

We tested the feasibility to record an auditory steady state evoked response (ASSR) at the binaural beat frequency in order to find a measure for temporal coding of sound in the human EEG. Methods: We stimulated each ear with a distinct tone, both differing in frequency by 40 Hz, to record a binaural beat ASSR. As control, we evoked a beat ASSR in response to both tones in the same ear. We band-pass filtered the EEG at 40 Hz, averaged with respect to stimulus onset and compared ASSR amplitudes and phases, extracted from a sinusoidal non-linear regression fit to a 40 Hz period average. Results: A 40 Hz binaural beat ASSR was evoked at a low mean stimulus frequency (400 Hz) but became undetectable beyond 3 kHz. Its amplitude was smaller than that of the acoustic beat ASSR, which was evoked at low and high frequencies. Both ASSR types had maxima at fronto-central leads and displayed a fronto-occipital phase delay of several ms. Conclusions: The dependence of the 40 Hz binaural beat ASSR on stimuli at low, temporally coded tone frequencies suggests that it may objectively assess temporal sound coding ability. The phase shift across the electrode array is evidence for more than one origin of the 40 Hz oscillations. Significance: The binaural beat ASSR is an evoked response, with novel diagnostic potential, to a signal that is not present in the stimulus, but generated within the brain.

Despite their proposed function in learning and memory, their role in synaptic plasticity is essentially unknown. We studied the ability of a neuronal firing pattern underlying spindles in vivo to induce synaptic plasticity in neocortical pyramidal cells in vitro. A spindle stimulation pattern (SSP) was extracted from a slow oscillation upstate that was recorded in a cat anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, which is known to induce a sleep-like state. To mimic the recurrence of spindles grouped by the slow oscillation, the SSP was repeated every 1.5 s (0.6 Hz). Whole-cell patch- clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells of rat somatosensory cortex with infrared videomicroscopy, and composite EPSPs were evoked within layers II - III. Trains of EPSPs and action potentials simultaneously triggered by the SSP induced an NMDA receptor-dependent short-term potentiation (STP) and an L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). The number of spindle sequences affected the amount of STP-LTP. In contrast, spindle trains of EPSPs alone led to long-term depression. LTP was not consistently induced by a regular firing pattern, a mirrored SSP, or a randomized SSP; however, a synthetic spindle pattern consisting of repetitive spike bursts at 10 Hz reliably induced STP-LTP. Our results show that spindle-associated spike discharges are efficient in modifying excitatory neocortical synapses according to a Hebbian rule. This is in support of a role for sleep spindles in memory consolidation.

High phase synchronization (zero-lag) in fast frequencies is implicated in integrating sensory events. Alpha EEG activity, long regarded as a passive "idling" frequency, is now being implicated in this integrative function. As an example, in brain pathology decreased alpha phase synchrony is correlated with a decline in cognitive function. Transcendental Meditation (TM) provides an interesting starting point to study neuronal coordination because the "transcending" experience is a baseline state of consciousness, a condition of restful alertness Without cognitive activity. Previous work on TM, reported to increase numerous indices of mind-body health, has been shown to increase neural coherence in the alpha band. In this study 15 subjects practicing the TM technique were investigated for changes in alpha phase synchrony. A time-domain method was used to measure millisecond phase shifts in 19 electrodes in long-term practitioners of TM in two conditions: eyes-closed resting and meditation. Significant reductions in millisecond phase lag were found during the meditation condition as compared to the eyes-closed resting condition in 30 of 49 long-range electrode pairings between frontal and occipito-parietal areas. Under the same conditions, twelve control subjects without meditation experience showed no change in alpha phase synchrony over the same time period. It is proposed that enhanced phase synchrony in the alpha frequency during meditation may improve functional integration and may have implications for performance and mind-body health. A short proposal for a phase synchrony model of consciousness is included. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The size of the abnormal ipsilateral projection is variable. We have used coherence and cumulant analysis between EEG and first dorsal interosseous muscle (1DI) EMG to explore mechanisms underlying mirror movements in three XKS subjects. Results are compared with those of three normal subjects. We argue that significant coherence is functionally relevant when associated with a negative cumulant at an appropriate lag. Given this, normal subjects showed coherence at similar to22 Hz between the EEG recorded over the sensori-motor cortex contralateral to the voluntarily moved hand and the 1DI EMG of this hand. No significant coherence was seen between 1DI EMG and the sensori-motor cortex ipsilateral to the muscle activity. In contrast, two of the XKS subjects (K2 and K4) had significant coherence at 22 Hz, together with a negative cumulant at an appropriate lag, between the ipsilateral cortical EEG and the 1DI EMG of the voluntarily activated hand. This implies that activity in the abnormal ipsilateral corticospinal projection can contribute to the voluntary drive. For these two subjects, the ipsilateral corticospinal projection was greater than the contralateral projection, as revealed using magnetic brain stimulation. In one of these subjects, K4, significant 22 Hz coherence and negative cumulant was also seen between the EMG of the voluntarily activated hand and the cortex contralateral to this hand. In the third subject, K4a, coherence and negative cumulant was detected between the EMG of the voluntary side and the cortical activity contralateral to this hand. The contralateral cortico spinal projection of this subject was greater than the ipsilateral projection. Regarding the mirroring hand of the XKS subjects, coherence (with negative cumulant at an appropriate lag) was seen in all three subjects between the EMG recorded from the mirroring hand and cortical EEG ipsilateral to this hand. This provides evidence that activity in the aberrant ipsilateral projection is involved in producing the drive that results in mirror movements. In one subject, K4, coherence and negative cumulant was also seen between the EMG of the mirroring hand and motor cortical activity contralateral to this hand. Thus, in this subject, activity in the corticospinal projection contralateral to the mirroring hand also contributed to the mirror movements. In conclusion, this study has provided further evidence that the 22 Hz coherence seen between EEG and EMG is dependent upon corticospinal activity and has furthered our understanding of mechanisms underlying mirror movements.

To this purpose, we studied multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from two broad groups (all participants were females): artists (professionally trained in visual arts) and non-artists (without any training in art). To assess the underlying synchronization, which is assumed to be the platform for general cognitive integration between different cortical regions, three measures inspired by nonlinear dynamical system theory were applied as follows: (1) index based on generalized synchronization; (2) index based on mean phase coherence; and (3) index of phase synchrony based on entropy. Results consistent over a I I three measures were as follows: comparing the tasks to rest, the artists showed significantly stronger short- and long-range delta band synchronization, whereas the non-artists showed enhancement in short-range beta and gamma band synchronization primarily in frontal regions; comparing the two groups during the tasks, the artists showed significantly stronger delta band synchronization and alpha band desynchronization than did the non-artists. Strong right hemispheric dominance in terms of synchronization was found in the artists. In artists, the higher synchrony in the low-frequency band is possibly due to the involvement of a more advanced long-term visual art memory and to extensive top-down processing. The results demonstrate that in artists, patterns of functional cooperation between cortical regions during mental creation of drawings were significantly different from those in non-artists.

Although the opposite phenomenon of desynchronization is well known from EEG studies, it is largely neglected on the neuronal level. We here provide an example of in vivo recordings from weakly electric fish demonstrating that, depending on the social context, different types of natural communication signals elicit transient desynchronization as well as synchronization of the electroreceptor population without changing the mean firing rate. We conclude that, in general, both positive and negative changes in the degree of synchrony can be the relevant signals for neural information processing.

Participants read a sentence, retained it for 2.5 s, and then verified a statement about its meaning. The sentences contained either three semantically related nouns or unrelated nouns and started either with a what phrase (WH sentences) or not (non-WH sentences), imposing either a high or low demand on verbal working memory. Comprehension accuracy showed an interaction of semantic relatedness and sentence type due to the presence of a relatedness effect (lower accuracy in the unrelated condition) in WH sentences but not in non-WH sentences. During the post-sentence retention interval, EEG coherences also displayed this interaction of relatedness and sentence type. A semantic relatedness effect was obtained in the WH sentences (high demand) but not in the non-WH sentences (low demand). In addition, compared to a pre-sentence baseline and sentence presentation, coherences increased in the 10-14 Hz band during retention and decreased in the 4-6 Hz band. These coherence changes spanned prefrontal and posterior brain regions, possibly reflecting increased synchronization in projection loops between attention control systems in prefrontal cortex and activated meaning representations in semantic memory in posterior cortex. These findings suggest that short-term retention of the meaning of a sentence involves active maintenance in a capacity-limited working memory, accompanied by a heightened inner direction of attention after sentence presentation.

Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in neuronal networks modulates activity and information processing during cognitive tasks, which can be observed in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. In this review, we will address aspects of nAChR functioning as well as synaptic and cellular modulation important for nicotinic impact on neuronal networks that ultimately underlie its effects on cognition. Although we will focus on general mechanisms, an emphasis will be put on attention behavior and nicotinic modulation of prefrontal cortex. In addition, we will discuss how nicotinic effects at the neuronal level could be related to its effects on the cognitive level through the study of electrical oscillations as observed in EEGs and brain slices. Very little is known about mechanisms of how nAChR activation leads to a modification of electrical oscillation frequencies in EEGs. The results of studies using pharmacological interventions and transgenic animals implicate some nAChR types in aspects of cognition, but neuronal mechanisms are only poorly understood. We are only beginning to understand how nAChR distribution in neuronal networks impacts network functioning. Unveiling receptor and neuronal mechanisms important for nicotinic modulation of cognition will be instrumental for treatments of human disorders in which cholinergic signaling have been implicated, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and addiction.

Experiment 1 demonstrated that electrical stimulation administered to the substantia nigra, globus pallidus (GP) and caudate-putamen (CPu) in urethane anesthetized rats elicited theta field activity in the hippocampal formation. Subsequent microinfusion of the local anesthetic procaine hydrochloride into the medial septum reversibly abolished this effect. In Experiment 2, single cell discharge profiles established for 152 cells recorded in nuclei of the basal ganglia resulted in 101 (66%) being classified as theta-related and 51 (34%) classified as nonrelated. Theta-related cells were further subclassified as tonic theta-ON cells (n = 79) and tonic theta-OFF (n = 22). Tonic theta-ON and tonic theta-OFF cells displayed irregular or regular (tonic) discharge patterns. Rhythmic discharge patterns did not occur in any theta-related cells in the nuclei of the basal ganglia. However, analyses using Kaneoke and Vitek's [J. Neurosci. Methods 68, (1996) 211] algorithms revealed that 51/101 (50%) theta-related cells displayed periodicity in their discharge patterns whereas 27/51 (53%) of the nonrelated cells displayed periodicity in their discharge patterns. The periodicities in the majority of cells were in frequency ranges above that of theta band oscillation and synchrony. The results support the following conclusions: (1) the cellular activity of the basal ganglia, composed of nuclei traditionally associated with motor functions, is functionally connected with the neural circuitry involved in the generation of theta band oscillation and synchrony in the hippocampal formation; (2) the observed functional connectivity provides support for the role of the hippocampal formation in sensorimotor integration.

EEG correlates of verbal and nonverbal working memory	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; TASK; ACTIVATION; LOAD; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMMEDIATE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; ALPHA	Background: Distinct cognitive processes support verbal and nonverbal working memory, with verbal memory depending specifically on the subvocal rehearsal of items. Methods: We recorded scalp EEG while subjects performed a Sternberg task. In each trial, subjects judged whether a probe item was one of the three items in a study list. Lists were composed of stimuli from one of five pools whose items either were verbally rehearsable (letters, words, pictures of common objects) or resistant to verbal rehearsal (sinusoidal grating patterns, single dot locations). Results: We found oscillatory correlates unique to verbal stimuli in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (9-12 Hz), beta (14-28 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands. Verbal stimuli generally elicited greater power than did nonverbal stimuli. Enhanced verbal power was found bilaterally in the theta band, over frontal and occipital areas in the alpha and beta bands, and centrally in the gamma band. When we looked specifically for cases where oscillatory power in the time interval between item presentations was greater than oscillatory power during item presentation, we found enhanced beta activity in the frontal and occipital regions. Conclusion: These results implicate stimulus-induced oscillatory activity in verbal working memory and beta activity in the process of subvocal rehearsal.

Auditory event-related potentials were measured from 11 healthy subjects. Binaural stimuli were created by introducing a dichotic delay of 500-ms duration to a narrow frequency region within a broadband noise, and resulted in a perception of a centrally located noise and a right-lateralized pitch (dichotic pitch). In separate listening conditions, subjects actively discriminated and responded to randomly interleaved binaural and control stimuli, or ignored random stimuli while watching silent cartoons. In a third listening condition subjects ignored stimuli presented in homogenous blocks. For all listening conditions, the dichotic pitch stimulus elicited an object-related negativity (ORN) at a latency of about 150-250 ms after stimulus onset. When subjects, were required to actively respond to stimuli, the ORN was followed by a P400 wave with a latency of about 320-420 ms. These results support and extend a two-stage model of auditory scene analysis in which acoustic streams are automatically parsed into component sound sources based on source-relevant cues, followed by a controlled process involving identification and generation of a behavioral response.

A cognitive neuroscience approach to 'theory of mind' in relationships	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalogram; prefrontal cortex; request refusals; theory of mind	CORTEX; BRAIN	Formulating cognitive representations of others' mental states when interpreting behavior (i.e., 'theory of mind') rather than merely focusing on the behavior is considered a distinctly human trait which both interpersonal scholars and cognitive neuroscientists agree plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of social relationships. Although. brain-imaging studies have led to huge advances in the understanding of memory and language, theories of social relationships remain relatively uninformed by cognitive neuroscience. In the present study, hypotheses regarding the implementation of theory of mind in a relationship context are (a) derived from extant theory and research, and (b) tested via brain-imaging technology. Specifically, spectrum analyses were conducted using brain wave recordings collected by an electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring oscillations in the gamma range for the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices while participants attempted to construct cognitive representations regarding a friend's request refusal. Results indicated statistically greater electrical activity in both cortical regions for participants engaged in the task than for participants in the control condition. The implications of the findings for building a fully elaborated sequential process model of cognitive representations in interpersonal contexts, among other theoretical endeavors, are discussed.

It is demonstrated that gamma-rhythm spectral power in frontal and temporal areas of depressive patients was significantly higher than that in the norm. In stressful situation the number of differences of healthy subjects from depressive patients decreased in the rest condition and in Kraepelin test. Spatial imagination revealed more significant differences between depressive patients and healthy subjects both in normal and in stressful situations. Gamma-rhythm synchronization level was the same in healthy subjects both in the rest condition and during the tests performance, but in stressful situation it increased in the latter situation as well as in depressive patients. Thus, in the most cases stressful situation decreases the differences of EEG indices between healthy subjects and depressive patients both in the rest condition (by spectral power) and during the tests performance (by both indices). This may point out stress as the "trigger" of depression.

Analysis of LFP phase predicts sensory response of barrel cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SINGLE CORTICAL CELLS; NEURONS IN-VIVO; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; EVOKED RESPONSES; ONGOING ACTIVITY; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; EEG PHENOMENA; LAYER 2/3	Several previous studies have shown the existence of Up and Down states and have linked their magnitude ( e. g., depolarization level) to the size of sensory-evoked responses. Here, we studied how the temporal dynamics of such states influence the sensory-evoked response to vibrissa deflection. Under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, barrel cortex exhibits strong quasi-periodic similar to 1-Hz local field potential ( LFP) oscillations generated by the synchronized fluctuation of large populations of neurons between depolarized ( Up) and hyperpolarized ( Down) states. Using a linear depth electrode array, we recorded the LFP and multiunit activity ( MUA) simultaneously across multiple layers of the barrel column and used the LFP to approximate the subthreshold Up-Down fluctuations. Our central finding is that the MUA response is a strong function of the LFP oscillation's phase. When only ongoing LFP magnitude was considered, the response was largest in the Down state, in agreement with previous studies. However, consideration of the LFP phase revealed that the MUA response varied smoothly as a function of LFP phase in a manner that was not monotonically dependent on LFP magnitude. The LFP phase is therefore a better predictor of the MUA response than the LFP magnitude is. Our results suggest that, in the presence of ongoing oscillations, there can be a continuum of response properties and that each phase may, at times, need to be considered a distinct cortical state.

Seizures are not uncommon in ChAc but have not been well characterized in the literature. We report two ChAc families in which patients presented with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Detailed medical and family histories were obtained. EEG, video-telemetry, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with volumetric studies of amygdala and hippocampus, as well as neuropsychological testing were performed. Blood smears were examined for acanthocytosis. Mutation analysis of VPS13A was carried out in five patients. Results: Six patients in three sibships were initially seen with seizures. Age at seizure onset ranged from 22 to 38 years. Seizures preceded other clinical manifestations of ChAc by <= 15 years. The epileptic aura consisted of a sensation of deja-vu, fear, hallucinations, palpitations, or vertigo. EEG with video-telemetry showed epileptiform discharges originating either from one or both temporal lobes. Epilepsy was generally well controlled, but some patients had periods of increased seizure frequency requiring treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs). Both families shared a deletion of exons 70-73 of VPS13A, extending to exons 6-7 of GNA14. Conclusions: Temporal lobe epilepsy may be the presenting feature of ChAc and may delay its diagnosis. Epilepsy in ChAc patients represents a challenge, because seizures may at times be difficult to control, and some AEDs may worsen the involuntary movements. Mutations in VPS13A or GNA14 or both may be associated with clinical features of temporal lobe epilepsy.

Cortico-muscular communication during the generation of static shoulder abduction torque in upper limb following stroke	2006 28TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-15			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2006	New York, NY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERNS; ELBOW; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; HEMIPARESIS; EEG	In this study, we introduced a new index, namely overlap index, to quantify the spatial resolution of cortical activity for muscle coordination based on the measurement of EEG-EMG coherence during a motor task. By applying this index on 4 control and 4 hemisphere chronic stroke subjects we successfully identified that there is a significantly increased overlap between biceps brachii at the elbow and intermediate deltoids at the shoulder when stroke subjects generating a static shoulder abduction torque. Muscles that have increased overlap in cortex are consistent with those that coactivate abnormally in stroke when compared to control subjects. These results not only proof the effectiveness of this index in quantifying the spatial resolution of cortical activity but also point out that the reduced spatial resolution of muscle activity in cortex can be a reason for the abnormal muscle coactivation observed in impaired arms following stroke. Quantification of the cortical overlap index will provide us with new tools to test for the modifiability of the nervous system following clinical interventions. This work will be an important step toward our long-term goal of developing more effective rehabilitation techniques for the treatement of stroke.	[Yao, Jun; Dewald, Julius P.

A second objective was to test Rauscher et al.'s (1993) priming explanation of the Mozart effect. Methods: In Experiment I individuals were first trained in how to solve spatial rotation tasks, and then solved similar tasks. Fifty-six students were divided into 4 groups: a control one - CG who prior to and after training relaxed, and three experimental groups: MM - who prior to and after training listened to music; MS - who prior to training listened to music and subsequently relaxed; and SM - who prior to training relaxed and afterward listened to music. The music used was the first movement of Mozart's sonata (K. 448). In Experiment 2, thirty-six respondents were divided into three groups: CG, MM (same procedure as in Experiment 1), and BM - who prior to and after training listened to Brahms' Hungarian dance No. 5. In both experiments the EEG data collected during problem solving were analyzed using the methods of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and approximated entropy (ApEn). Results: In the first experiment the respondents of the MM, MS, and SM groups showed a better task-performance than did the respondents of the CG group. Individuals of the MM group displayed less complex EEG patterns and more alpha band synchronization than did respondents of the other three groups. In Experiment 2 individuals who listened to Mozart showed a better task performance than did the respondents of the CG and BM groups. They displayed less complex EEG patterns and more lower-1 alpha and gamma band synchronization than did the respondents of the BM group. Conclusions: Mozart's music, by activating task-relevant brain areas, enhances the learning of spatio-temporal rotation tasks. Significance: The results support Rauscher et al.'s (1993) priming explanation of the Mozart effect. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Since antidepressant treatments normalize disrupted rhythms in depression (eg rapid-eye-movement sleep and hormonal rhythms), we hypothesized that depression-related changes in ultradian oscillations of DA and 5-HT might be revealed during antidepressant treatment, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected q10 min for 24 h in 13 patients experiencing major depressive episodes (MDE) before and after treatment for 5 weeks with sertraline or bupropion were assayed for levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and their ratio was calculated. Data were analyzed in the frequency domain using Fourier transforms and multivariate permutation testing. Antidepressant treatments were associated with decreased variance for 5-HIAA, increased variance for HVA, and markedly increased variance for the HVA: 5-HIAA ratio (p<0.05, p<0.02, and p<0.003, respectively). With treatment, the correlations between 5-HIAA and HVA weakened (p = 0.06). Power spectral density (PSD - the Fourier magnitude squared) of the 5-HIAA signals at periods of 1.75 and 3.7h (both p<0.05) decreased, while circadian cycling of HVA levels (p < 0.05) and of the ratio (p<0.005) increased after treatment. The PSD of the full-length HVA: 5-HIAA ratio series after treatment increased in rapid variability (20-103 min periods, p<0.05). Spectrographic windowing demonstrated a focal span of enhanced HVA: 5-HIAA ratio variability following antidepressant treatment, in an approximately 84-min period through the evening (p<0.05). Periodic neurotransmitter relationships in depressed patients were altered by treatment in this analysis of a small data set. This may represent a baseline abnormality in the regulation of periodic functions involved in the depression pathophysiology, but it could also be due to an unrelated antidepressant effect. Further studies including comparisons with healthy subject data are in progress.

It is known that induced and evoked activities reflect different aspects of cortical processing which may result in different time courses. In the current study, we analyzed topography of postimperative negative variation (PINV) in 39 healthy right-handed adolescents in an acoustic forewarned reaction time (contingent negative variation, CNV) task using a 64-electrode high-density sensor array. We dissociated different PINV components in their time course from postmovement beta ERS in order to provide fundamental knowledge about evoked and induced EEG components after movement execution as a basis for further analysis of postmovement processing. A postmovement negativity occurred from about 500 to 1200 ms after the imperative stimulus (peaking about 600 ins after a right-hand button press) at central electrodes, contralateral to the response movement side. Current source density (CSD) analysis confirmed the current sinks over motor areas [contralateral primary motor/premotor and supplementary/cingulate motor area]. The described DC component (motor PINV, mPINV) differed in time course and localization from later "classical" PINV (cPINV) which is thought to reflect contingency reappraisal. mPINV could also be distinguished topographically from a mere delayed CNV resolution. When mPINV and ERS at the same left central electrode were compared, both parameters showed different time courses. Left central mPINV rather paralleled ERS at midcentral electrodes. Therefore, we suggest that the topography of mPINV provides first hints towards an involvement of contralateral primary motor cortex in postmovement processing beyond a mere idling state as reflected by later beta ERS. mPINV could be a useful tool to investigate the role of primary motor cortex in motor-learning processes. The combined analysis of induced and evoked activities seems to be able to elucidate different aspects of cortical connectivity and motor processes following movement. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Moore, RA; Gale, A; Morris, PH; Forrester, D				Moore, Roger A.; Gale, Anthony; Morris, Paul H.; Forrester, Dave			Theta phase locking across the neocortex reflects cortico-hippocampal recursive communication during goal conflict resolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						septo-hippocampal system; goal conflict; theta power; theta coherence	SUPRAMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; POTENTIALS; STIMULUS; RHYTHM	EEG theta coherence, EEG theta power and subjective levels of response were examined in a continuous monitoring target detection task where periodic goal conflicts were introduced as 34 participants progressed through a stimulus sequence leading to response. EEG theta coherence revealed increases in phase locking between cortical areas at specific task stages involving goal conflict. Theta power also increased at points of goal conflict. The temporal characteristics of subjective response (measured continuously throughout the task) indicated a delay between participants actually experiencing goal conflict and overt indications of conflict. The starting point for the study was based on a specific aspect of Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] behavioural inhibition system model-namely, septo-hippocampal system involvement in the resolution of goal conflicts. We drew on Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford] suggestion that septo-hippocampal involvement in this process is reflected by EEG theta. While their theory explains many of our findings, we also drew upon Given's [Givens, B., 1996. Stimulus-evoked reseting of the dentate theta rhythm: relation to working memory. Neuroreport 8(1), 159-163] proposal that the dentate theta rhythm is reset by behaviourally relevant stimuli. We made further proposals based on Makeig et al.'s [Makeig, S., Westerfield, M., Jung, T.-P., Enghoff, S., Townsend, J., Courchesne, E., Sejnowski, T.J., 2002. Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses. Science 295, 690-694] view that specific stimulus events invoke concurrent phase resetting and transient frequency domain coherence across different areas of neocortex. Relations with Go/NoGo event related potentials (P300 and N2; e.g., [Bokura, H., Yamaguchi, S., Kobayashi, S., 2001. Electrophysio logical correlates of response inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. Clin. Neurophysiol. 112 (12), 2224-2232]) were also discussed, as well as parallels between our data and interpretation, and other theoretical models of theta (e.g., [Kahana, M.J., Selig, D., Madsen, J.R., 2001.

Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia with treatment-refractory AH were allocated randomly to one of three groups: daily left, light, and sham rTMS groups. rTMS was applied to the TP3 or 4 regions with the aid of the electroencephalography 10-20 international system at 1 Hz for 20 min per day for 10 treatment days. Symptoms were evaluated using the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS), the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. For the time effect (within-subject comparison), there were significant changes in the frequency of AHs, positive symptoms of PANSS, and CGI-I. A between-group comparison revealed significant differences in the positive symptoms of PANSS, and CGI-I scores. Post hoc analysis revealed that both the right- and left-side rTMS treatment groups exhibited better CGI-I scores compared to the sham-stimulated group. This study suggests that 10 days of low-frequency rTMS applied daily for 20 min to either temporoparietal cortex significantly reduces the symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who are having refractory AH, but the left sided rTMS is not superior to right or sham rTMS.

Several studies observed a positive, some a negative relationship. The latter finding, interpreted in terms of the neural efficiency hypothesis, suggests that good performance is associated with a more 'efficient', smaller extent of cortical activation. Other studies found that ERD increases with semantic processing demands and that this increase is larger for good performers. Studies supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis used tasks that do not specifically require semantic processing. Thus, we assume that the lack of semantic processing demands may at least in part be responsible for the reduced ERD. In the present study we measured ERD during a difficult verbal-semantic task. The findings demonstrate that during semantic processing, more intelligent (as compared to less intelligent) subjects exhibited a significantly larger upper alpha ERD over the left hemisphere. We conclude that more intelligent subjects exhibit a more extensive activation in a semantic processing system and suggest that divergent findings regarding the neural efficiency hypotheses are due to task specific differences in semantic processing demands.

Analysis of neuronal activity in the medial septal area or hippocampus and hippocampal EEG simultaneously recorded in awake rabbits exposed to different kinds of brainstem influences led to the following conclusions. 1. Serotonergic median raphe nucleus and noradrenergic locus ceruleus act as functional antagonists in theta regulation: the former structure restricts the theta rhythm,generation, whereas the latter enhances this process. 2. Both transmitter systems control sensory reactions of septal and hippocampal neurons through up and down regulation of the theta activity. 3. When continuous theta activity induced by various experimental manipulations is recorded, responsiveness of septohippocampal neurons to sensory stimulation is strongly reduced. These findings provide support for the view that the theta oscillations act as an active filter in the information selection and registration. Interaction of different transmitter systems in the theta rhythm control as well as atterntion and memory is discussed.

In the intact hippocampal preparation, spontaneous rhythmic field potentials are exhibited in the 3-4 Hz range which evidence suggests is due to discharges in the inhibitory interneuron population. Because field rhythms arise as a network effect and models must be built from the neuron up, we focus on developing a methodology to deconstruct the non-stationary rhythms into its important constituents. This study uses 50 CA1/CA3 local field potentials to determine the important constituents, and an additional field recording and two intracellular recordings are examined subsequently. We determine the suitability of several time-frequency techniques. Distinct regions in the time-frequency domain which account for the signal behaviour are then characterized in terms of duration and frequency. These characteristics are interpreted as arising from a statistical mixture distribution. The decomposition of the 50 recordings yields three components whose patterns of activity match those of the intracellular recordings. We suggest that the statistical variability of the local field data can be linked to the variability of neuronal activities seen in intracellular data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Twelve subjects were presented with test stimulus sets of 1-3 syllables spoken in a natural female voice. After an 800-ms delay period, a probe syllable was presented and subjects had to judge whether the probe had been included in the preceding test set. Compared to a non-memory-control task, memory trials elicited an increase of beta activity over right temporal regions and an increase of alpha activity over right middle prefrontal cortex at the end of the delay phase. Monotonic increases in spectral amplitude as a function of memory load were revealed for the beta band over right temporal sensors and the alpha band over right frontal sensors during the delay period. The results demonstrate the relevance of both beta and alpha oscillations for the memorization of multiple stimuli. The former may be associated with the representation of task-relevant stimulus features, while the latter may reflect the top-down control of these representations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The Penrose-Hameroff "Orch OR" model suggests that consciousness is a sequence of quantum computations ill microtubules within brain neurons, shielded from decoherence to reach threshold for objective reduction (OR), the Penrose quantum gravity solution to the measurement problem. The quantum computations are "orchestrated" by neuronal/synaptic inputs (hence "Orch OR"), and extend throughout cortex by tunneling through gap junctions. Each Orch OR. is proposed as a conscious event, akin to Whitehead's philosophical "occasion of experience", occurring in concert with brain electrophysiology. This chapter discusses the need for such all approach and its neurobiological requirements.

A number of notions related to the concepts of phase and synchrony, which are incorporated in contemporary neurophysiology, particularly in the domain of neuro-cognitive physiology are discussed. These notions need a critical examination, since their use sometimes is not clear, or it may even be ambiguous. We present some of these concepts, namely (a) (des)synchronization, (b) phase resetting, (c) phase synchrony and phase/time delays, and (d) phase clustering within one signal, while discussing what type of neuronal activities may underlie these EEG phenomena.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						olfactory bulb; learning; memory; neural plasticity; oscillations; population coding; odor discrimination	SELECTIVE MODULATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NEURAL ASSEMBLIES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTEX; RABBIT; EEG; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION	In the first relay of information processing, the olfactory bulb (OB), odors are known to generate specific spatial patterns of activity. Recently, in freely behaving rats, we demonstrated that learning modulated oscillatory activity in local field potential (LFP), in response to odors, in both beta (15-40 Hz) and gamma (60-90 Hz) bands. The present study further characterized this odor-induced oscillatory activity with emphasis on its spatiotemporal distribution over the olfactory bulb and on its relationship with improvement of behavioral performances along training. For that purpose, LFPs were simultaneously recorded from four locations in the OB in freely moving rats performing an olfactory discrimination task. Electrodes were chronically implanted near relay neurons in the mitral cell body layer. Time-frequency methods were used to extract signal characteristics (amplitude, frequency, and time course) in the two frequency bands. Before training, odor presentation produced, on each site, a power decrease in gamma oscillations and a weak but significant increase in power of beta oscillations (similar to25 Hz). When the training was achieved, these two phenomena were amplified. Interestingly, the beta oscillatory response showed several significant differences between the anterodorsal and posteroventral regions of the OB. In addition, clear-cut beta responses occurred in the signal as soon as animals began to master the task. As a whole, our results point to the possible functional importance of beta oscillatory activity in the mammalian OB, particularly in the context of olfactory learning.

Patients with TEA often complain of autobiographical amnesia for recent and remote events, but show normal anterograde memory. Objective: To investigate ( a) accelerated long term forgetting and (b) autobiographical memory in a group of patients with TEA. Methods: Seven patients with TEA and seven age matched controls were evaluated on a range of anterograde memory tasks in two sessions separated by 6 weeks and by the Galton-Crovitz test of cued autobiographical memory. Results: Patients with TEA showed abnormal long term forgetting of verbal material, with virtually no recall after 6 weeks. In addition, there was impaired recall of autobiographical memories from the time periods 1985 - 89 and 1990 - 94 but not from 1995 - 1999. Conclusions: TEA is associated with accelerated loss of new information and impaired remote autobiographical memory. There are a number of possible explanations including ongoing subclinical ictal activity, medial temporal lobe damage as a result of seizure, or subtle ischaemic pathology. Future analyses should seek to clarify the relationship between aetiology, seizure frequency, and degree of memory impairment.

Background: We analyzed beat-to-beat heart rate and continuous breathing signals from 10 experienced meditators (4 females; 6 males; mean age 42 years; range 29-55 years) during three traditional interventions: relaxation response, breath of fire, and segmented breathing. Results: Heart rate and respiratory dynamics were generally similar during the relaxation response and segmented breathing. We observed high amplitude, low frequency (similar to 0.05-0.1 Hz) oscillations due to respiratory sinus arrhythmia during both the relaxation response and segmented breathing, along with a significantly (p < 0.05) increased coherence between heart rate and breathing during these two maneuvers when compared to baseline. The third technique, breath of fire, was associated with a different pattern of response, marked by a significant increase in mean heart rate with respect to baseline (p < 0.01), and a significant decrease in coherence between heart rate and breathing (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that different meditative/breathing protocols may evoke common heart rate effects, as well as specific responses. The results support the concept of a "meditation paradox," since a variety of relaxation and meditative techniques may produce active rather than quiescent cardiac dynamics, associated with prominent low frequency heart rate oscillations or increases in mean resting heart rate. These findings also underscore the need to critically assess traditional frequency domain heart rate variability parameters in making inferences about autonomic alterations during meditation with slow breathing.

Elevated sleep spindle density after learning or after retrieval in rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spindles; slow-wave sleep; memory consolidation; retrieval; off-line processing; rats	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; REACTIVATION; RECONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; WAKING; REPLAY; NEUROBIOLOGY; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION	Non-rapid eye movement sleep has been strongly implicated in consolidation of both declarative and procedural memory in humans. Elevated sleep-spindle density in slow-wave sleep after learning has been shown recently in humans. It has been proposed that sleep spindles, 12-15 Hz oscillations superimposed on slow waves (< 1 Hz), in concert with high-frequency hippocampal sharp waves/ripples, promote neural plasticity underlying remote memory formation. The present study reports the first indication of learning-associated increase in spindle density in the rat, providing an animal model to study the role of brain oscillations in memory consolidation during sleep. An odor-reward association task, analogous in many respects to human paired-associate learning, is rapidly learned and leads to robust memory in rats. Rats learned the task over 10 massed trials within a single session, and EEG was monitored for 3 h after learning. Learning-induced increase in spindle density is reliably reproduced in rats in two different learning situations, differing primarily in the behavioral component of the task. This increase in spindle density is also present after reactivation of remote memory and in situations when memory update is required; it is not observed after noncontingent exposure to reward and training context. The latter results substantially extend findings in humans. The magnitude of increase (similar to 25%) and the time window of maximal effect (similar to 1 h after sleep onset) were remarkably similar to human data, making this a valid rodent model to study network interactions through the use of simultaneous unit recordings and local field potentials during postlearning sleep.

We recorded the magnetic responses in an auditory oddball task and analyzed these data by using Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry (SAM) and SPM permutation analysis. Twelve normal subjects (aged 27-36 years) participated in this study. MEG data were obtained by using a standard auditory oddball paradigm under the instruction to press the buttons when subjects heard the target stimuli. SAM and SPM Permutation analyses were used to visualize the multiple brain regions related to P300 generation within the latencies between 200 and 600 ms during target detection processing. Evoked magnetic fields for target stimuli calculated by simple averaging were peaking at approximately 300 to 400 ms over the various regions on both hemispheres. SAM and SPM permutation analysis showed that the suppressions in the 8-15, 15-30 and 30-60 Hz bands were distributed mainly in the left primary sensorimotor area. The activations in the 4-8 and 8-15 Hz bands were found primarily in the bilateral frontal cortices, including the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas. Basar et al. (E. Basar, Brain Function and Oscillations: L Brain Oscillations: Principles and Approaches, Springer, Berlin, 1998, 1999) reported that, by using an oddball paradigm, prolonged event-related alpha oscillations up to 400 ms were observed. They named this alpha component "functional alpha." We suggested that the distributed alpha and theta activity in the prefrontal cortex is "functional" and engaged in auditory attention and memory updating. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, disturbance of effective communication can cause neurological symptoms like apraxia, dyslexia or object agnosia. Interregional communication can be assessed by coherence analysis of synchronized neuronal oscillations, and has been referred to as synchrony or 'binding'. The concept of synchrony as a means of information coding is attractive, but its functional relevance has been challenged. We hypothesized that if synchrony is functionally relevant in humans, then more synchrony should determine better behavioral performance. Here, we show in a visuotactile integration task that the amount of low-frequency (7-13Hz), long-range electroencephalographic coherence between visual and sensorimotor cortex is significantly correlated with the level of performance. Trials with highest coherences were the most successful ones and vice versa in the absence of differences in regional activation measured as task-related spectral power. In summary, quantitatively linking the amount of long-range synchrony with the degree of behavioral success in humans, the present data suggest that the ability to generate topographically specific synchrony of high amplitude is functionally relevant for behavioral success. They also raise the possibility that the magnitude of regional activation is less representative of the efficacy of brain functioning than interregional synchrony.

Methods: Seven consecutive patients with definite sCJD underwent a systematic assessment of sleep-wake disturbances, including clinical history, video-polysomnography, and actigraphy. Extent and distribution of neurodegeneration was estimated by brain autopsy in six patients. Western blot analyses enabling classification and quantification of the protease-resistant isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, in thalamus and occipital cortex was available in four patients. Results: Sleep-wake symptoms were observed in all patients, and were prominent in four of them. All patients had severe sleep EEG abnormalities with loss of sleep spindles, very low sleep efficiency, and virtual absence of REM sleep. The correlation between different methods to assess sleep-wake functions (history, polysomnography, actigraphy, videography) was generally poor. Brain autopsy revealed prominent changes in cortical areas, but only mild changes in the thalamus. No mutation of the PRNP gene was found. Conclusions: This study demonstrates in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, first, the existence of sleep-wake disturbances similar to those reported in fatal familial insomnia in the absence of prominent and isolated thalamic neuronal loss, and second, the need of a multimodal approach for the unambiguous assessment of sleep-wake functions in these patients.

These sleep-related systems can provoke seizure discharge propagation during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and can suppress propagation during REM sleep. Experimental manipulations of discrete physiological components were conducted in feline epilepsy models, mostly in the systemic penicillin epilepsy model of primary generalized epilepsy and the amygdala kindling model of the localization-related seizure disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy. The sleep-wake state distribution of seizures was quantified before and after discrete lesions, Systemic and localized drug administration, and/or photic stimulation, as well as in relation to microdialysis of norepinephrine. We found that (1) neural generators of synchronous EEG oscillations-including tonic background slow waves and phasic "arousal" events (sleep EEG transients such as sleep spindles and k-complexes)-combine to promote electrographic seizure propagation during NREM and drowsiness, and antigravity muscle tone permits seizure-related movement; (2) neural generators of asynchronous neuronal discharge patterns reduce electrographic seizures during alert waking and REM sleep, and skeletal motor paralysis blocks seizure-related movement during REM; (3) there are a number of similarities between amygdala-kindled kittens and children with Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) that suggest a link among seizures, sleep disorders, and behavioral abnormalities/regression.

Emotional abilities and cortical activation during emotional information processing	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						emotional intelligence; emotion perception; neural efficiency; EEG; ERD	NEURAL EFFICIENCY; INTELLIGENCE; ALPHA; MEMORY; BRAIN; SEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS	In the physiological study of cognitive intelligence there is sound evidence of a more efficient use of the brain in brighter individuals (the neural efficiency hypothesis). However, scarcely anything is known with respect to physiological correlates of emotional abilities. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed the relationship between interpersonal emotional management abilities (EMA) and the extent of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the EEG during the performance of an emotional face processing task (and a control task) in a sample of 65 participants (31 males, 34 females) with low (n = 31) versus high (n = 34) emotional management abilities. In the emotional face processing task (judging the equivalence of two simultaneously presented facial emotions), significant ERD-differences between the EMA-groups (with a larger amount of ERD in the low versus high EMA-group) were found in both sexes. In the control task (requiring participants to judge the equivalence of the faces' sex without considering their emotional expressions), an inverse EMA-activation relationship was found only in men, but not in women. Overall, the results indicate that the neural efficiency phenomenon is not restricted to the cognitive ability domain but might also play an important role in the emotional ability domain.

Application to intracerebral EEG in temporal lobe epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						temporal lobe epilepsy; intracerebral EEG; interictal spikes; signal processing; co-occurrence; statistical analysis	EPILEPTIFORM SPIKES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SPIKING; EVENTS; PROPAGATION; DISCHARGES; BRAIN; ZONE	Objective: We present a novel quantitative method to statistically analyze the distribution of multichannel intracerebral interictal spikes (multi-IIS) in stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings. The method automatically extracts groups of brain structures conjointly and frequently involved in the Generation of interictal activity. These groups are referred to as 'subsets of co-activated structures' (SCAS). We applied the method to long duration interictal recordings in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and analyzed the reproducibility of subsets of structures involved in the generation of multi-IIS for each patient and among patients. Methods: Fifteen patients underwent long-term intracerebral EEG recording (SEEG technique) using depth electrodes. A 1 h period of continuous interictal EEG recording was selected for each patient with precautions regarding the time after anesthesia pre-SEEG, the temporal distance with respect to seizures, the vigilance state of the patient, and the anti-epileptic drug withdrawal. A research of SCAS was conducted on each recording using the developed method that includes 3 steps: (i) automatic detection of monochannel intracerebral interictal spikes (mono-IIS), (ii) formation of multi-IIS using a temporal sliding window, and (iii) extraction of SCAS. In the third step, statistical tests are used to evaluate the frequency of multi-IIS as well as their significance (with respect to the 'random distribution of mono-IIS' case). Results: In each patient, several thousands of multi-IIS (mean +/- SD, 3322 +/- 2190) were formed and several SCAS (mean +/- SD, 3.80 +/- 1.47) were automatically extracted. Results show that reproducible subsets of brain structures are involved in the generation of interictal activity. Although SCAS were found to be variable from one patient to another, some invariant information was pointed up. In all patients. multi-ITS distribute over two distinct groups of structures: mesial structures (15/15) and lateral structures (7/15). Moreover, two particular structures, the internal temporal pole and the temporo-basal cortex, may be conjointly involved with either the first or the second group. Finally, some extracted SCAS seem to match well-defined anatomo-functional circuits of the temporal lobe. Conclusions and Significance: During interictal activity in MTLE, similar subsets of temporal lobe structures are involved in the generation of spikes. This paper brings statistical evidence for the existence of these subsets and presents a method to automatically extract them from SEEG recordings. Interictal activity is spatially organized in the temporal lobe and preferentially involves two functional systems of the temporal lobe (either mesial or lateral).

Membrane potential changes in pyramidal neurons were initially attributed to the rhythmic fluctuation of the cholinergic input as the basal forebrain (BF) neurons fire in synchrony with cortical waves, but a more recent proposal suggested that the slow rhythm was of cortical origin. In the present experiments, interaction between the cortex and the BF was examined in urethane-anesthetized rats. BF neuronal activity was inhibited by local infusion of lidocaine into the substantia innominata in one group of rats, while in another group, the slow cortical rhythm was blocked by inducing spreading depression (SD) in the cortex. Slow cortical rhythm persisted after unilateral lidocaine injection, but rhythmic firing in BF neurons disappeared following SD induction. These findings support the view that slow cortical rhythm is generated in the cortex and transmitted to the BF through descending fibers. According to anatomical data, these fibers can excite cholinergic cells only indirectly as they terminate on non-cholinergic neurons. Thus, timing of activity changes in BF neurons during the slow cortical rhythm might give some clue regarding their transmitter specificity.

External stimulation can be employed to test for nonlinearity in alpha genesis. since an entrainment of such rhythmic activity (shift in the alpha peak) could only be explained by nonlinear relationships. Flash photic stimulation has, been used to investigate such entrainment. Nevertheless, only entrainments due to the second harmonic of the stimulation could be suitably measured. Aiming at overcoming this limitation. a coherence-based technique is proposed for evaluating the strength of responses. due to rhythmic stimulation. It was applied to the occipital EEG derivations of 12 normal subjects during stroboscopic stimulation. Entrainment of alpha rhythm by the second harmonic of the stimulation occurred in 75% of the subjects, whilst no spectral shifts were observed for the remained that exhibited broadband alpha peak at rest. However, stimulating with fundamental frequency close to that peak led to entrainment in all subjects. These differences in the degree of synchronization due to stimulation at the first and second harmonics should reflect complex nonlinear mechanisms in alpha genesis. (C) 2004 IPEM.

The PPN neuronal circuitry related to theta generation involves its cholinergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic components. Here we provide data indicating that the PPN tachykinin system may also be a part of this circuitry. In the experimental model of the tail-pinch elicited hippocampal theta in urethane-anesthetized rats (implanted with bilateral recording electrodes in the stratum moleculare of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus, and with injection carmula unilaterally inserted into the PPN) it was found that intra-PPN microinjection of Substance P (SP) and [d-Pro2, d-Phe7, d-Trp9]-Substance P (DPDPDT) caused suppression of the theta and enhancement of the delta activity in the hippocampal EEG. Accordingly, there was approximately a 50% (SP) -70% (DPDPDT) decline of the peak power in the theta frequency range and a decrease by 0.4 Hz; in the corresponding peak frequency (DPDPDT only) in both hippocampi. The circuitry through which SP exerts its effect in the PPN can be only hypothetical at present. We suggest SP-evoked activation (either direct or indirect through the glutamatergic inputs) of the GABA interneurons which may tonically inhibit PPN outputs to the other theta-relevant structures.

Methods: The CS +/- were tones and the US was a photic checkerboard. Alpha amplitude, CNV, RT and verbal responses were recorded from 12 participants. Results: The CS +/- difference in acquisition was greatest from 250 ins before the US. It was greatest from the trial where RT declined and participants could report the CS +/US relationship. There was an amplitude increase in lower band activity 230 ins after the US. This looked like a VEP but was produced by phase-locked activity starting before the US. Conclusions: Predicting the US led to cortical priming. Amplitude change in acquisition is congruent with CNV, RT and verbal performance. Significance: Prediction, expectancy and motor preparation are reflected in changes in alpha activity. These results provide converging evidence for the functional role of 8-10 Hz activity. They complement the emerging picture of the role of alpha activity in cognition, indicating that it extends to the acquisition of predictive knowledge.

Based on parahippocampal electrocorticography of epileptic patients we found an increase in REM-like 1.5-3.0 Hz parahippocampal activity during wake-sleep transition, which peaks after on average 30s of sleep onset, and reaches 82% of REM sleep value. The increase in 1.5-3.0 Hz parahippocampal activity followed alpha dropout, but did not relate to short-term fluctuations in alpha waves or sleep spindles. Non-REM sleep-specific slow (< 1.25 Hz) activity showed a continuous increase during wake-sleep transition in both temporal scalp and parahippocampal recordings. It is suggested that REM-like parahippocampal rhythmic slow activity is an aftereffect of hypothalamic wake-promoting centers' switch-off at sleep onset, leading to an inhibited hippocampal functioning and hypnagogic hallucinations.

In an open-label study, we evaluated the neurophysiological effects of chronic administration of donepezil to AD patients, by means of a correlative approach between quantitative EEG (qEEG) and perfusional brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Methods: Sixteen patients (mean age: 74.8 +/- 7.9 years) with mild to moderate AD (MMSE score > 13, mean: 20.7 +/- 4.6) underwent qEEG and SPECT examinations at the time of diagnosis (t(0)) and after approximately 1 year of donepezil therapy (t(1)). The brain SPECT (Tc-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime) was performed by means of a high-resolution SPECT camera; the qEEG was recorded from 19 scalp electrodes by average reference and digitized at 512 Hz. The mean frequency (MF) value of the mean power spectrum (fast Fourier transform) from 4 brain regions (one frontal and one temporal-parietal in each hemisphere) was chosen for statistical analysis. Changes in MMSE score and qEEG-MF values between t(0) and t(1) were assessed by analysis of variance. SPECT differences between t(0) and t(1), as well as the relationships between SPECT and qEEG changes, were assessed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99; height threshold: P = 0.001 at cluster level). Results: Between t(0) and t(1), the MMSE score significantly (P < 0.05) decreased (from 20.7 +/- 4.64 to 19.1 +/- 5.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.14) and qEEG was unchanged. There was no regional per-fusion decrease; a small area of relative perfusion increase was observed, including the right occipital cuneus and the left lingual gyrus. A positive correlation was found between the right frontal MF and brain perfusion in the left superior parietal lobule. A post hoc SPM analysis (height threshold: P = 0.01) showed a positive correlation between brain perfusion and each of the 4 qEEG MF values in the left parietal lobe, including the precuneus, the superior parietal lobule, and the Postcentral gyrus. Conclusions: The posterior parietal region, which is involved in memory and attention, is often affected by hypoperfusion in AD, as a likely consequence of disconnection from the atrophic mesial temporal cortex. Metabolic activation induced by AChEIs may especially influence this disconnected but still not grossly impaired area, which could be one of the pathophysiological substrates of the cognitive effects of AChEIs.

Frequency and predictors of nonconvulsive seizures during continuous electroencephalographic monitoring in critically ill children	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CONTINUOUS EEG; NEONATAL SEIZURES; COMATOSE PATIENTS; FEATURES	Objective: To determine the incidence, predictors, and timing of nonconvulsive seizures (NCSz) during continuous electroencephalographic monitoring (cEEG) in critically ill children. Methods: We identified critically ill children who underwent cEEG during a 4-year period. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables associated with NCSz. Results: Among 117 monitored children, 44% had seizures on cEEG and 39% had NCSz. The majority of patients with seizures (75%) had purely NCSz, and 23% of patients had status epilepticus, which was purely nonconvulsive in 89% of cases. Seizures occurred immediately on cEEG initiation in 15%, within 1 hour in 50%, and within 24 hours in 80%. Those with clinical seizures prior to cEEG were more likely to have NCSz on cEEG (83%) than those without prior seizures (17%). On multivariate analysis, NCSz were associated with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and absence of background reactivity. Conclusions: Seizures, the majority being NCSz, are common during cEEG in critically ill children (seen in 44% of patients). Half are detected in the first hour of recording, whereas 20% are not detected until after more than 24 hours of recording. Nonconvulsive seizures are associated with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and absence of reactivity on cEEG. This study confirms the importance of prolonged cEEG for critically ill children as a means to detect NCSz.

Switch and stay trials did not differ with respect to memory load or global working memory (WM) demands. The results revealed significantly stronger theta coupling (in a range of 4-7 Hz) between prefrontal and posterior regions during switch as compared to stay trials. Power differences, reflecting more local effects, were largest in the upper alpha band (10-13 Hz) and over posterior brain areas, possibly reflecting long-term memory activation. The conclusion of the present study is that long-range coherent oscillatory activity in the theta band reflects top-down activation rather than global WM functions.

It is assumed that the amplitude of network-specific oscillations depends on, in addition to other factors, the number of neurons available for synchronization and the excitability level of neurons and forms a bell-shaped curve with a maximum of oscillatory activity at a certain balance of both factors. Depending on the baseline level of cortical activation (CA) and the location of the "working point" (WP), a sudden change of activation can induce either ERD or ERS in a given area.

During much of sleep, cortical neurons undergo slow oscillations in membrane potential, which appear in electroencephalograms as slow wave activity (SWA) of < 4 Hz(1). The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated, increasing after wakefulness and returning to baseline during sleep(2). It has been suggested that SWA homeostasis may reflect synaptic changes underlying a cellular need for sleep(3). If this were so, inducing local synaptic changes should induce local SWA changes, and these should benefit neural function. Here we show that sleep homeostasis indeed has a local component, which can be triggered by a learning task involving specific brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the local increase in SWA after learning correlates with improved performance of the task after sleep. Thus, sleep homeostasis can be induced on a local level and can benefit performance.

In this paper, we use computational models of cortical structures to investigate relations between structure, dynamics, and function of such systems. In particular, we investigate the nature and role of noise at different organizational levels of the nervous system, emphasizing the neural network level. We show that microscopic noise can induce global network oscillations and pseudo-chaos, which make neural information processing more efficient. We find optimal noise levels for which the Convergence to stored memory attractor states reaches a maximum, akin to stochastic resonance. We finally discuss the relation between neural and mental processes, and how computational models may relate to real neural systems.

J	Grabska-Barwinska, A; Zygierewicz, J				Grabska-Barwinska, A; Zygierewicz, J			A model of event-related EEG synchronization changes in beta and gamma frequency bands	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; lumped model; cortical circuit; beta rebound	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS	During preparation, execution and recovery from simple movements, the EEG power spectrum undergoes a sequence of changes. The power in the beta band (13-25 Hz) decreases during preparation and execution of movement, but during recovery it reaches a level higher than that in the reference period (not affected by the event). These effects are known as event-related beta desynchronization and beta rebound. The power in the gamma band (> 30 Hz) increases significantly just before the onset of the movement. This effect is known as event-related gamma synchronization. There are numerous observations concerning these effects but the underlying physiological mechanisms and functional role are not clear. We propose a lumped computational model of a cortical circuit. The model consists only of a pyramidal and an interneuronal population. Each population represents averaged properties of constituting neurons. The output of the model represents a local field potential, with a power spectrum peak either in the beta or in the gamma band. The model elucidates the mechanisms of transition between slower and faster rhythms, gamma synchronization and beta desynchronization and rebound effects. The sufficient conditions to observe the effects in the model are changes of the external excitation level and of the connection strength between excitatory and inhibitory populations attributed to short-time plasticity. The present model presents the role of the pyramidal neurons to interneuron connection in the oscillatory behavior of the two populations. We conclude that the pronounced facilitation of the pyramidal to fast spiking interneuron connections, initiated by robust excitation of the motor cortex neurons, may be essential for the effect of beta rebound. Further experiments concerning short-time plasticity during behavioral tasks would be of great value in studies of functional local cortical circuits. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain oscillatory 1-30 Hz EEG ERD/ERS responses during the different stages of an auditory memory search task	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						EEG; brain oscillations; event-related desynchronization (ERD); event-related synchronization (ERS); memory; auditory memory task	WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; THETA ACTIVITY; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; HUMANS; FINGER	Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) responses of 1-30 Hz EEG frequencies during the different stages of an auditory Sternberg memory task were examined. The ERD/ERS responses were examined separately for successive memory set items (four) and for the two recognition conditions (YES/NO). The presentation of the memory set elicited ERS responses in the theta and alpha frequencies, and also beta ERD responses. These ERD/ERS responses elicited during encoding were found to evolve with successive memory set item presentation. The ERD/ERS responses elicited during the presentation of the probe dissociated significantly between the two recognition conditions (YES/NO). When the probe was included in the memory set (YES condition), recognition elicited stronger alpha and beta frequency ERD responses as compared to the NO condition. The findings from the current study verify that alpha ERD/ERS responses robustly dissociate between auditory encoding and recognition. The increasing alpha ERS responses with increasing memory set item presentation during encoding may be correlates of the functioning phonological loop, active memory maintenance and/or attention. The alpha ERD responses during recognition are undoubtedly associated with auditory memory search processes and distinguish between previously presented versus not presented verbal material. We propose that alpha ERD/ERS responses reflect explicitly auditory memory processes, discriminating between auditory encoding and recognition. Theta ERS responses may be associated with working memory processes, and possibly more specifically with the functioning of the central executive. Beta ERD/ERS responses may reflect also cognitive and/or memory processing, rather than merely the activity of the motor cortices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Half of the participants received a divergent thinking training (over a time period of 2 weeks) which was composed of exercises structurally similar to those used in the pre- and post-test. Analyses revealed that the training group displayed higher task-related synchronization of frontal alpha activity (i.e. increases in alpha power from the pre-stimulus reference to the activation interval) than the control group. These findings are in line with the view of frontal alpha synchronization as a selective top-down inhibition process that prevents internal or top-down information processing being disturbed by incoming external input.

Although studies based on pharmacology and lesion experiments suggested heterogeneity of these rhythms and their behavioral correlates, controversies are abundant on these issues. Here we show that mice harboring a phospholipase C (PLC)-beta 1(-/-) mutation (PLC-beta 1(-/-) mice) lack one subset of theta rhythms normally observed during urethane anesthesia, alert immobility, and passive whole-body rotation. In contrast, the other subset of theta rhythms observed during walking or running was intact in these mutant mice. PLC-beta 1(-/-) mice also have somewhat disrupted theta activity during paradoxical sleep but do have an atropine-resistant component of theta rhythm. In addition, carbachol-induced oscillations were obliterated in hippocampal slices of PLC-beta 1(-/-) mice. Interestingly, PLC-beta 1(-/-) mice showed deficits in a hidden platform version of the Morris water maze yet performed well in motor coordination tests and a visual platform version of the Morris water maze. The results genetically define the existence of at least two subtypes of theta rhythms and reveal their association with different behaviors.

Inverted EEG theta lateralization in dyslexic children during phonological processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						theta band; dyslexia; lateralization; hemispherical asymmetry; EEG; working memory; phonology; semantic	HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; BRAIN; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; DISRUPTION; SYSTEMS; BAND	The phonological deficit hypothesis of dyslexia has been investigated in the present research by analysing language-related lateralization of the EEG theta band in a sample of dyslexic children. To this aim, a paradigm based on word-pair visual presentation was used in which the same words were processed in Semantic and Phonological tasks. Theta band amplitude, a cortical index that has been related to working memory processing, was analysed during four different phases of word elaboration, thus allowing to measure also the temporal dynamics of word reading/encoding in the verbal working memory. Control subjects showed a specific (and therefore efficient) task-related and time-dependent cortical activation: a peak of theta activity during word reading was found that decayed during the next inter stimulus interval. Furthermore, during word presentation in the Phonological task, theta amplitude was greater on the left hemisphere. Dyslexics evidenced an altered pattern of theta activation both in the temporal dimension and in the cortical space: their peak of activity was delayed to the first inter stimulus interval after word offset and was shifted to the right hemisphere throughout the whole epoch of Phonological task and in two phases of the Semantic task. Analysis of alpha band failed to replicate the complex pattern of lateralization found for theta band in the two groups, a result that suggests a specific functional role of theta band, which cannot be interpreted as a simple marker of cortical inhibition. Results point to a deficit, in dyslexic children, to recruit left hemisphere structures for the elaboration of the phonological component of the verbal working memory. This deficit was marked by a different, unspecific and dysfunctional hemispherical asymmetry of theta activation to language, a deficit that involved also the time course of phonological linguistic elaboration.

It is less clear, however, to what type of memory sub-processes theta is related. Using a continuous word recognition task with different repetition lags, we investigate whether theta reflects the strength of an episodic memory trace or general processing demands, such as task difficulty. The results favor the episodic trace decay hypothesis and show that during the access of an episodic trace in a time window of similar to 200-400 ms, theta power decreases with increasing lag (between the first and second presentation of an item). LORETA source localization of this early theta lag effect indicates that parietal regions are involved in episodic trace processing, whereas right frontal regions may guide the process of retrieval. We conclude that episodic encoding can be characterized by two different stages: traces are first processed at parietal sites at similar to 300 ms, then further processing takes place in regions of the medial temporal lobe at similar to 500 ms. Only the first stage is related to theta, whereas the second is reflected by a slow wave with a frequency of similar to 2.5 Hz.

A number of pathological processes affecting glial and neuronal function have been identified, including hyperammonia, changes within the excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems, as well as osmolytic changes with consecutive cell swelling. One explanation how these pathological processes result in neurological deficits in HE is the concept of pathologically synchronized oscillations within and between relevant brain regions. A number of studies suggest that the cognitive deficits and the reduced level of alertness in patients with HE can be attributed to a significantly slowed and pathologically synchronized spontaneous oscillatory brain activity, depending on the grade of HE. Moreover, HE motor symptoms, like postural tremor called"mini asterixis," have recently been shown to be associated with abnormal thalamo-cortical and corticomuscular synchronization. Indirect evidence exists from studies of processing and recognition of flicker stimuli that in HE slowing of oscillations also occurs in the visual system. Taken together, pathological synchronizationof neuronal activity may turn out to be a promising pathophysiological concept for linking neuronal dysfunction to the diversity of clinical deficits in HE.

Responses elicited by snout stimulation in the swine also contain similar HFOs during the rising phase of the porcine N20. This study examined the generators of the N20 and HFOs in the swine. Methods: We recorded intracortical SEPs and multi-unit activities in the sulcal area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) simultaneously with SEFs. The laminar profiles of the potential and current-source-density (CSD) were analyzed. Results: The CSD analysis revealed that the N20 was produced by two dipolar generators, both directed toward the cortical surface. After the arrival of the initial thalamocortical volley in layer TV, the sink of the first generator shifted toward shallower layers II-III with a velocity of 0.109 +/- 0.038 m/s (mean +/- SD). The sink of the second generator moved to layer V. The initial thalamocortical axonal component of the HFO was produced by repolarizing current with the sink in layer IV. The CSD laminar profile of the postsynaptic component was very similar to the profile of intracortical N20. The current sink within each cycle of HFO propagated upward with a velocity of 0.633 +/- 0.189 m/s, indicating backpropagation. Conclusions: We proposi, that the N20 is generated by two sets of excitatory neurons which also produce the HFOs. Although the loci of synaptic inputs are unknown, these neurons appear to fire initially in the soma and produce backpropagating spikes toward distal apical dendrites. Significance: These conclusions relate the N20 to the HFO and provide a new explanation of how the current underlying the N20 is invatiantly directed toward superficial layers across species.

Although recent pharmacological studies suggest that the basal ganglia could provide a remote control system for absence seizures, the mechanisms of propagation of epileptic discharges in these subcortical nuclei remain unknown. In the present study, we provide the first description of the electrical events in the corticostriatal pathway during spontaneous SWDs in the genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a genetic model of absence epilepsy. In corticostriatal neurons, the SWDs were associated with suprathreshold rhythmic depolarizations in-phase with local EEG spikes. Consistent with this synchronized firing in their excitatory cortical afferents, striatal output neurons (SONs) exhibited, during SWDs, large-amplitude rhythmic synaptic depolarizations. However, SONs did not discharge during SWDs. Instead, the rhythmic synaptic excitation of SONs was shunted by a Cl--dependent increase in membrane conductance that was temporally correlated with bursts of action potentials in striatal GABAergic interneurons. The reduced SON excitability accompanying absence seizures may participate in the control of SWDs by affecting the flow of cortical information within the basal ganglia circuits.

Detrimental effects of irrelevant speech on serial recall of visual items are reflected in reduced visual N1 and reduced theta activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; irrelevant sound effect; ISE; N1; theta	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TOKEN SET SIZE; UNATTENDED SPEECH; WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTIONAL SELECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; DISRUPTION; SOUND; PERFORMANCE; HABITUATION	The term irrelevant sound effect (ISE) describes an empirically robust finding in which serial recall performance of visual items is reduced by irrelevant speech. At present little is known about its neurophysiological basis. Although some previous neuroelectric studies have concentrated on responses elicited by irrelevant background sound, whether the processing of visually presented to-be-remembered digits itself is affected by irrelevant speech has yet to be studied. An experiment (n = 20) was conducted in which serial recall performance for visually presented digits was tested during exposure to either irrelevant speech, continuous white noise or silence while measuring EEG activity. White noise was chosen as a control condition, because it constitutes auditory stimulation while leaving serial recall performance unimpaired. In addition to replicating the detrimental behavioural effect of irrelevant speech, an analogous speech-specific early decrease (-160 ms) in the visual ERP (N1) and subsequently a reduced theta response (4-6 Hz; 400-800 ms) at right prefrontal electrodes were observed. Although irrelevant sound presentation was restricted to the visual presentation phase, power spectra reveal that the weaker theta response for speech persisted in a silent retention phase before serial recall. Based on such data we propose reevaluating the role attention plays in explaining the ISE.

Coherence was measured between multiple cortical areas (intracortical), reticular and rely thalamic nuclei (intrathalamic) and between the cortex and the thalamus. SWD-related increase of coherence (5-60 Hz) was found in all investigated pairs. The highest increase of coherence was around the mean frequency of SWD (8-11.5 Hz) and in the harmonic band 16-21.5 Hz with two central maxima around 10 and 20 Hz. The frequency profile of coherence was different in different intracortical networks, therefore latter were divided into local, global and transhemispheric networks. The presumable source of SWD in the somatosensory cortex and its closest surroundings formed a minimal (local) circuit, in which occurrence of SWD was facilitated by a consistent shift of network synchrony from delta to alpha/beta frequencies. Transhemispheric coherence revealed the largest increase with an additional 16 Hz peak, suggesting a crucial involvement of the corpus callosum in the pathophysiology of absence seizures. The increase in interhemispheric coherence was largest between relatively remote somatosensory or frontal areas, supporting the assumption that SWD originate from the lateral fronto-parietal cortical area.

We have addressed this issue in fatal familial insomnia (FFI) measuring the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) with 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET in parallel with detailed clinical, neuropsychological examinations and polysomnography with EEG spectral analyses. Nine asymptomatic carriers of the D178N mutation, 10 non-carriers belonging to the same family, and 19 age-matched controls were studied over several years. The CMRglc as well as clinical and electrophysiological examinations were normal in all cases at the beginning of the study. Four of the mutation carriers developed typical FFI during the study but CMRglc and the clinical and electrophysiological examinations remained normal 63, 56, 32 and 21 months, respectively before disease onset. The carrier whose tests were normal 32 months before disease onset was re-examined 13 months before the onset. At that time, selective hypometabolism was detected in the thalamus while spectral-EEG analysis disclosed an impaired thalamic sleep spindle formation. Following clinical disease onset, CRMglc was reduced in the thalamus in all 3 patients examined. Our data indicate that the neurodegenerative process associated with FFI begins in the thalamus between 13 and 21 months before the clinical presentation of the disease.

Dynamic sculpting of brain functional connectivity and mental rotation aptitude	EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review						functional connectivity; synchronization; steady state visually evoked potential; partial coherence; mental rotation; aptitude	HUMAN WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; ALPHA POWER; EEG ALPHA; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; GAMMA	Changes in long-range synchronization are considered a key mechanism for the integration and segregation of cortical regions mediating cognitive processes. Such synchronization or functional connectivity is reflected in human electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence and in steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) coherence. In this chapter, the relationship between cognitive proficiency in the mental rotation task (MRT) and functional connectivity reflected in SSVEP event-related partial coherence is described. The capacity to estimate changing levels of functional connectivity with a relatively high temporal resolution makes it possible to examine the relationship between functional connectivity at various points in time and aptitude. In the current study, the relationships between functional connectivity and two mental rotation aptitude measures, mental rotation speed and mental rotation accuracy, are described. We observed that functional connectivity was correlated with proficiency and that this correlation was both positive and negative for various regions and points in time. It is suggested that cognitive aptitude is related to the brain's capacity to enhance functional connectivity or communication between cortical regions that are relevant to the cognitive demands while attenuating irrelevant communication. This capacity is termed functional connectivity sculpting, and it is proposed that functional connectivity sculpting may constitute an important functional component of the neural substrate of learning and aptitude.

Methods: A specific GABA(B)-receptor antagonist CGP35348, CGP55845A, or CGP55699A was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), and EEGs and behaviors of rats were analyzed. Results: CGP35348 (56-110 mug, i.c.v.) induced afterdischarges (ADs) similar to60% of the time, starting at the hippocampus or neocortex. Neocortical-onset ADs began with sporadic discharges and were <3 mV. Hippocampal-onset ADs were bilateral, >5 mV, and spread to the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, often ending in a rebound AD and accompanied with stereotypic jumping, forelimb clonus, and wet-dog shakes. The CGP35348-induced hippocampal AD had an onset frequency (5-9 Hz) that was higher than the electrically evoked AD (2-4 Hz). CGP35348 i.c.v. also increased the mean starting frequency of an electrically evoked hippocampal AD from 3.6 Hz to 5.3 Hz. Hippocampal gamma activity (25-80 Hz) increased up to twofold for 30 min after a hippocampal but not a neocortical AD. A single dose of CGP35348 induced repeated ADs of increasing duration. Paired-pulse inhibition of the evoked potentials in CA1, at interpulse interval of <100 ms, was decreased after but not before a hippocampal AD. CGP56999A (i.c.v.) gave results similar to those with CGP35348, whereas CGP55845A (i.c.v.) rarely induced ADs. Conclusions: GABA(B)-receptor blockade increases seizure susceptibility by reducing AD threshold and increasing the frequency and spread of a hippocampal AD. Hippocampal excitability (based on paired-pulse test) and gamma activity increased after but not before a hippocampal AD.

Whereas event-related desynchronization (ERD) during motor preparation, execution, and imagery can be seen as a correlate of an activated cortical area, event-related synchronization (ERS) of frequency components between 10 and 13 Hz may represent a deactivated cortical area or inhibited cortical network, at least under certain conditions. Induced beta rhythms (13-35 Hz, beta ERS) can be found in sensorimotor areas following both voluntary movement and somatosensory stimulation. In a recent study we used different tasks involving execution and imagery of movements of the upper and lower limb to produce activation vs. deactivation/inhibition of the sensorimotor hand area. Sensorimotor interference, as a function of the activation level of the motor cortex, was studied by the use of repetitive median nerve stimulation (MNS) (ISI 1.5 s) in 12 healthy volunteers during the following task conditions: (i) cube manipulation between thumb and fingers of one hand, (ii) imagined cube manipulation, (iii) continuous foot rotation movements, and (iv) imagined foot movements. EEG was recorded from hand and foot representation areas and processed time-locked to MNS (ERD/ERS). In addition, task-related band power changes (TRPD/TRPI) were analyzed. We found a clear-cut suppression of the stimulation-induced beta ERS (indicating an enhanced activity state of the sensorimotor areas) during active cube manipulation and a weaker suppression during cube imagery. Mental imagination of foot movement led to an increase of the hand area mu rhythm, but did not interfere with stimulation-related effects on beta ERS. These findings support that interfering sensorimotor activation and deactivation is reflected in graduated changes of induced mu and beta oscillations.

Patients: Ninety-four adult outpatient paid volunteers with asthma. Setting: The psychophysiology laboratory at The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and the private outpatient offices of participating asthma physicians. Interventions: The interventions were as follows: (1) a full protocol (ie, HRV biofeedback and abdominal breathing through pursed lips and prolonged exhalation); (2) HRV biofeedback alone; (3) placebo EEG biofeedback; and (4) a waiting list control. Design: Subjects were first prestabilized using controller medication and then were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Medication was titrated biweekly by blinded asthma specialists according to a protocol based on National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines, according to symptoms, spirometry, and home peak flows. Measurements: Subjects recorded daily asthma symptoms and twice-daily peak expiratory flows. Spirometry was performed before and after each weekly treatment session under the HRV and placebo biofeedback conditions, and at triweekly assessment sessions under the waiting list condition. Oscillation resistance was measured approximately triweekly. Results: Compared with the two control groups, subjects in both of the two HRV biofeedback groups were prescribed less medication, with minimal differences between the two active treatments. Improvements averaged one full level of asthma severity. Measures from forced oscillation pneumography similarly showed improvement in pulmonary function. A placebo effect influenced an improvement in asthma symptoms, but not in pulmonary function. Groups did not differ in the occurrence of severe asthma flares. Conclusions: The results suggest that HRV biofeedback may prove to be a useful adjunct to asthma treatment and may help to reduce dependence on steroid medications. Further evaluation of this method is warranted.

To identify genes that affect the risk for alcoholism, we systematically ascertained and carefully assessed individuals in families with multiple alcoholics. Linkage and association analyses suggested that a region of chromosome 4p contained genes affecting a quantitative endophenotype, brain oscillations in the beta frequency range (13 - 28 Hz), and the risk for alcoholism. To identify the individual genes that affect these phenotypes, we performed linkage disequilibrium analyses of 69 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within a cluster of four GABA(A) receptor genes, GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1, at the center of the linked region. GABA(A) receptors mediate important effects of alcohol and also modulate beta frequencies. Thirty-one SNPs in GABRA2, but only 1 of the 20 SNPs in the flanking genes, showed significant association with alcoholism. Twenty-five of the GABRA2 SNPs, but only one of the SNPs in the flanking genes, were associated with the brain oscillations in the beta frequency. The region of strongest association with alcohol dependence extended from intron 3 past the 3' end of GABRA2; all 43 of the consecutive three-SNP haplotypes in this region of GABRA2 were highly significant. A three-SNP haplotype was associated with alcoholism, with P = .00000022. No coding differences were found between the high-risk and low-risk haplotypes, suggesting that the effect is mediated through gene regulation. The very strong association of GABRA2 with both alcohol dependence and the beta frequency of the electroencephalogram, combined with biological evidence for a role of this gene in both phenotypes, suggest that GABRA2 might influence susceptibility to alcohol dependence by modulating the level of neural excitation.

However, the validity of this approach may be questioned since pharmacological procedures are usually required to elicit spontaneous events similar to the EEG activity recorded in vivo. Here, we report that when superfused with control medium, rat brain slices comprising the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices along with a portion of the basolateral/lateral nuclei of the amygdala can synchronously generate periodic oscillatory activity at 5-11 Hz every 5-30 s. The periodic events: (i) correspond intracellularly to synaptic depolarizations in regularly firing neurons analyzed in the three areas; (ii) have no fixed site of onset; (iii) spread with time lags of 8-20 ms; and (iv) continue to occur asynchronously after their surgical isolation. NMDA receptor antagonism reduced the duration of the oscillatory events, while glutamatergic non-NMDA receptor antagonism abolished them. Activation of mu-opioid receptors, a procedure that hyperpolarizes interneurons thus decreasing GABA release, reversibly decreased the rate of occurrence of periodic oscillatory activity (POA). However, periodic events continued to occur during application of GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptor antagonists as well as in the presence of the cholinergic agent carbachol. We also found that POA was. abolished by baclofen and irreversibly reduced by the gap junction decoupler carbenoxolone. These findings demonstrate that parahippocampal networks in a brain slice preparation can generate periodic, synchronous activity under quasi-physiological conditions. These network oscillations (i) reflect the activation of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors, (ii) are contributed by gap-junction interactions, and (iii) are controlled by GABA(B) receptors that are presumably located presynaptically.

In this study, we evaluated whether temporal lobectomy changes autonomic modulation of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and cerebral autoregulation. We studied 16 TLE patients 3-4 months before and after surgery. We monitored heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiration, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (sat-O-2), end-expiratory carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) and middle cerebral artery CBFV. Spectral analysis was used to determine sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of HR, BP and CBFV as powers of signal oscillations in the low frequency (LF) ranges from 0.04-0.15Hz (LF-power) and in the high frequency ranges from (HF) 0.15-0.5Hz (HF-power). LF-transfer function gain and phase shift between BP and CBFV were calculated as parameters of cerebral autoregulation. After surgery, HR, BPmean, CBFVmean, respiration, sat-O-2, pCO(2) and HF powers remained unchanged. LF-powers of HR, BP, CBFV and LF-transfer function gain had decreased while the phase angle had increased (p<0.05). The reduction of LF powers and LF-gain and the higher phase angle showed reduced sympathetic modulation and improved cerebral autoregulation. The enhanced cerebrovascular stability after surgery may improve autonomic balance in epilepsy patients.

The perception state is formalized as the dynamic phase variable v(t) of a recursive process with cosinuidal transfer characteristic which is created by superposition (interference) of neuronal mean fields. The two parameters mu = difference of meaning of alternative percepts and G = attention parameter, control the transition between unambiguous and ambiguous stimuli, e.g. from stimulus off to stimulus on, and attention fatigue respectively. Mean field interference with delayed phase feedback enables transitions between chaotic and limit cycle attractors v(t) representing the perception states. Perceptual reversals are induced by attention fatigue G(t) (similar to adaptive gain g(v)) with time constant gamma, and attention bias which determines the relative duration of the percepts. The coupled attention - perception dynamics with an additive stochastic noise term reproduces the experimentally observed F-distribution of the reversal time statistics. Mean reversal times of typically 3 - 5 s as reported in the literature, are correctly predicted if delay T is associated with the delay of 40 ms between stimulus onset and primary visual cortex (VI) response. Numerically determined perceptual transition times of 3 - 5 T are in reasonable agreement with stimulus - conscious perception delay of 150 - 200 ins [11]. Eigenfrequencies of the limit cycle oscillations are in the range of 10 - 100 Hz, in agreement with typical EEG frequencies.

Little is known about this process and its impact on the brain. Here we find that long-term Buddhist practitioners self-induce sustained electroencephalographic high-amplitude gamma-band oscillations and phase-synchrony during meditation. These electroencephalogram patterns differ from those of controls, in particular over lateral frontoparietal electrodes. In addition, the ratio of gamma-band activity (25-42 Hz) to slow oscillatory activity (4-13 Hz) is initially higher in the resting baseline before meditation for the practitioners than the controls over medial frontoparietal electrodes. This difference increases sharply during meditation over most of the scalp electrodes and remains higher than the initial baseline in the postmeditation baseline. These data suggest that mental training involves temporal integrative mechanisms and may induce short-term and long-term neural changes.

Fifty-six patients who had suffered a unilateral stroke within the middle cerebral artery were enrolled. Median time since stroke was 2.8 years. In association with lesion features and clinical picture, total and relative band powers and the spectral entropy were analyzed in the affected (AH) and unaffected (UH) hemispheres in comparison with an age-matched control group. An increase of absolute and relative slow band powers and a reduction of relative fast band powers were found in patients' AH with respect to both UH and control values. Absolute delta band was higher than in controls also in UH. New findings were the increase of rolandic rest activity power also in the alpha band and the decrease of spectral entropy in AH with respect to both UH and control values. Moreover, our results in chronic stroke patients indicate frequency-selective alterations related to specific dysfunctions: global clinical status was mostly impaired in patients with larger lesions and increased total and slow band activity powers, whereas hand functionality was mostly disrupted in patients with subcortical involvement and reduction of high-frequency rhythms and spectral entropy. Total power increase and spectral richness decrease are in agreement with a higher synchrony of local neuronal activity, a reduction of the intracortical inhibitory network's efficiency, and an increase of neuronal excitability.

We showed recently that a learning task involving a circumscribed brain region produces a local increase in sleep SWA. We hypothesized that increases in cortical SWA reflect synaptic potentiation triggered by learning. To further investigate the link between synaptic plasticity and sleep, we asked whether a procedure leading to synaptic depression would cause instead a decrease in sleep SWA. We show here that if a subject's arm is immobilized during the day, motor performance deteriorates and both somatosensory and motor evoked potentials decrease over contralateral sensorimotor cortex, indicative of local synaptic depression. Notably, during subsequent sleep, SWA over the same cortical area is markedly reduced. Thus, cortical plasticity is linked to local sleep regulation without learning in the classical sense. Moreover, when synaptic strength is reduced, local sleep need is also reduced.

A linear and a nonlinear transformation based on wavelet transform are presented. They result in a statistical error model and an entropy function related to the Gibbs function and describe changes in midlatency auditory evoked potentials induced by general anaesthesia. The same transformations were calculated using 12 common wavelets. We present a method to compare the two defined parametrizations with respect to their ability to discriminate two defined states which is responsive and unresponsive depending on the wavelet used for the analysis. Auditory evoked potentials of 60 patients undergoing general anaesthesia were analysed. We propose the defined statistical error model and the entropy function as a very robust measure of changes in auditory evoked potentials. The influence of the wavelets suggest that for each parametrization the goodness of the wavelet should be validated.

Here we examined whether the statedependent gating occurs in the central olfactory pathway that lacks a thalamic relay. In urethane-anesthetized rats, neocortical EEG showed a periodical alternation between two states: a slow-wave state (SWS) characterized by large and slow waves and a fast-wave state (FWS) characterized by faster waves. Single-unit recordings from olfactory cortex neurons showed robust spike responses to adequate odorants during FWS, whereas they showed only weak responses during SWS. The state-dependent change in odorant-evoked responses was observed in a majority of olfactory cortex neurons, but in only a small percentage of olfactory bulb neurons. These findings demonstrate a powerful state-dependent gating of odor information in the olfactory cortex that works in synchrony with the gating of other sensory systems. They suggest a state-dependent switchover of signal processing modes in the olfactory cortex.

Particular focus is given to the further hypothesis that variations in firing rate can encode information independently from that encoded by firing phase. We discuss possible explanation of the phase-precession effect in terms of interference between two independent oscillatory influences on the pyramidal cell membrane potential, and the extent to which firing phase reflects internal dynamics or external (environmental) variables. Finally, we propose a model of the firing of the recently discovered ''grid cells'' in entorhinal cortex as part of a path-integration system, in combination with place cells and head-direction cells.

In a linear maze, ordered spatial distances between sequential locations were represented by the temporal relations of hippocampal place cell pairs within cycles of theta oscillation in a compressed manner. Such correlations could arise due to spike "phase precession" of independent neurons driven by common theta pacemaker or as a result of temporal coordination among specific hippocampal cell assemblies. We found that temporal correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across cell assemblies in place sequence representation. CA1 and CA3 ensembles, identifying spatial locations, were active preferentially on opposite phases of theta cycles. These observations suggest that interleaving CA3 neuronal sequences bind CA1 assemblies representing overlapping past, present, and future locations into single episodes.

According to the hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of steep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, steep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goat is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several specific predictions, and has implications for both steep and mood disorders. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Attentional capacity for processing concurrent stimuli is larger across sensory modalities than within a modality	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; electrophysiology; intermodal attention; oscillations; multisensory processing	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; STEADY-STATE; BLINK; AREAS; LINKS	One finding in attention research is that visual and auditory attention mechanisms are linked together. Such a link would predict a central, amodal capacity limit in processing visual and auditory stimuli. Here we show that this is not the case. Letter streams were accompanied by asynchronously presented streams of auditory, visual, and audiovisual objects. Either the letter streams or the visual, auditory, or audiovisual parts of the object streams were attended. Attending to various aspects of the objects resulted in modulations of the letter-stream-elicited steady-state evoked potentials (SSVEPs). SSVEPs were larger when auditory objects were attended than when either visual objects alone or when auditory and visual object stimuli were attended together. SSVEP amplitudes were the same in the latter conditions, indicating that attentional capacity between modalities is larger than attentional capacity within one and the same modality.

Event-related desynchronization/synchronization during an auditory-verbal working memory task in mild Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related desynchronization (ERD); event-related synchronization (ERS); Parkinson's disease (PD); working memory; encoding; retrieval	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; UPPER ALPHA; L-DOPA; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES	Objective: Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) were studied during an auditory-verbal working memory task in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: PD patients (n = 7, mean age 59) at a mild stage of the disease volunteered in the study. A group of healthy subjects (n = 10, mean age 61) served as control group. ERD and ERS of the 1-25 Hz EEG frequencies were studied using wavelet transforms during memory encoding and retrieval. Results: Both groups performed equally well on the memory task. Statistically significant differences in ERD/ERS responses were observed in posterior electrodes during encoding of the memory set due to the fact that alpha (similar to 10-15 Hz) ERS was elicited in the controls, but not in the PD group. In broad frequency bands (similar to 6-25 Hz) ERD responses were observed in both groups during memory retrieval. A pre-stimulus alpha ERS seen in the control group was absent in the PD group. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study indicate that Parkinson's disease might affect brain oscillatory responses in the alpha frequency range in the encoding phase of auditory-verbal working memory. Significance: The ERD/ERS patterns may reflect neurophysiological alterations in the processes underlying working memory deficits in PD. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Isoflurane disrupts anterio-posterior phase synchronization of flash-induced field potentials in the rat	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						synchronization; consciousness; anesthesia; event-related potential; EEG; gamma	BISPECTRAL INDEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; EEG; ANESTHESIA; AWARENESS; RESPONSES; PROPOFOL; BINDING	Consciousness presumes a set of integrated functions such as sensory processing, attention, and interpretation, and may depend upon both local and long-range phase synchronization of neuronal activity in cerebral cortex. Here we investigated whether volatile anesthetic isoflurane at concentrations that produce loss of consciousness (LOC) disrupts long-range anterio-posterior and local anterior synchronization of neuronal activity in the rat. In six rats, deep electrodes were chronically implanted in the primary visual cortex (VI) and in two areas of the motor cortex (M1 and M2) for recording of intracortical event-related potentials (ERP). Thirty discrete flashes were presented at random interstimulus intervals of 15-45 s, and ERPs were recorded at stepwise increasing isoflurane concentrations of 0-1.1%. Neuronal synchronization was estimated using wavelet coherence computed from the ERP data band-pass filtered at 5-50 Hz. We found that (1) in the waking state, long-range anterio-posterior coherence in 5-25 Hz and 25-50 Hz frequency bands was significantly higher than local anterior coherence; (2) anterio-posterior coherence in both 5-25 Hz and 26-50 Hz bands was significantly reduced by isoflurane in a concentration-dependent manner; (3) local anterior coherence was not affected by isoflurane at any of the concentrations studied. These findings suggest that a disruption of long-range anterio-posterior rather than local anterior synchronization of neuronal activity precedes the anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.

Task demand was varied among three two-level factors: task load (single, dual), decision load (no-decision, choice-decision), and target exposure time (short [2-4 s], long [4-6 s]). Target shooting scenarios were simulated using the Dismounted Infantryman Survivability and Lethality Testbed (DISALT), which controlled target presentation and exposure times and recorded weapon aim point data. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were acquired continuously from 36 channels during all scenarios and single-trial data from each scenario were epoched offline into 11-s windows time-locked to the onsets of targets (-5 s to +6 s). Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was derived and peak amplitude and latency measures were analyzed in the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz) for this preliminary report. The results revealed that different oscillatory EEG patterns were sensitive to different shooting task events and task load variations. Specifically, two new findings were revealed in the present study with respect to existing marksmanship research: (1) an early theta peak occurred approximately one second after the onset of targets that was sensitive to decision and task load demands but not to target exposure time demands and (2) a late theta peak occurred approximately at the time of trigger-pull that was sensitive to decision load and target exposure time demands but not to task load demands.

ECT-induced mnestic deficits can persist for several weeks after ECT. Electrophysiologically, slowing of brain electrical activity in the interictal state has often been reported. Especially, for bilateral ECT a correlation between enhanced left frontotemporal theta activity and retrograde amnesia has been demonstrated. This study focuses on the topographic distribution of cortical slow-wave oscillations during the interictal state of a bilateral ECT cycle. Twelve patients with major depression have been investigated with 32-channel resting EEG 24 h after the 6th ECT session. As controls, 8 major depressive patients were investigated prior to antidepressive treatment. The generating sources of slow-wave activity are estimated within the theta frequency band with low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Source analysis revealed a distinct pattern of theta activity in the depth of the left temporal lobe ( fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, Brodmann areas 37 and 36, respectively; p < 0.05) during the interictal state. This finding suggests a dysfunction of the left medial temporal lobe memory system during the interictal state of a bilateral ECT cycle. It will further be discussed whether it is possible to obtain information about activity of deep brain structures like the hippocampal formation from scalp-recorded signals. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

Design: We evaluated bilateral cortical electroencephalograms after unilateral local application of IL-1beta onto the somatosensory cortex of rats. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of unilateral application of an IL-1beta inhibitor, the IL-1 soluble receptor, on spontaneous sleep and sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Setting: University research laboratory. Interventions: N/A. Participants: Rats Measurements and Results: Neither dose of IL-1beta or the IL-1 soluble receptor affected the duration of non-rapid eye movement sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. Unilateral application of IL-1 P induced state- and frequency-dependent electroencephalogram asymmetries. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, but not during other states, electroencephalographic slow-wave activity was greater on the side that received IL-1beta (10- and 50-ng doses). Electroencephalographic power in the higher frequencies was not affected by IL-1 P in any state. Unilateral application of the IL-1 soluble receptor (0.1, 1.0 and 5.0 mug) had no effect on the spontaneous sleep electroencephalogram. In contrast, unilateral application of the IL-1 soluble receptor (5.0 mug) attenuated sleep deprivation-enhanced electroencephalographic slow-wave power ipsilaterally during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Conclusions: Results suggest that IL-1beta can induce state-dependent localized increases of electroencephalographic delta wave power, suggesting an enhancement of sleep intensity within the cortex.

Specifically, the role of cerebellar activity for appropriate movement timing has been investigated intensively. Behavioural studies, particularly of patients following cerebellar lesions, gave rise to the hypothesis that each hand is controlled by separate timing mechanisms most likely localized within lateral portions of each cerebellar hemisphere. Reduced timing variability during simultaneous bimanual tasks implies that both timing signals are integrated prior to movement execution, probably by information transfer between both cerebellar hemispheres. However, this raises the question for functional and anatomic fundamentals of such an integration process. The present article reviews behavioural, functional, and anatomic data to shed light on possible interactions between both cerebellar hemispheres during the execution of timed motor behaviour.

Objectives: First main objective was to develop an amplitude- independent multi-channel spindle detection method. Secondly the method was applied to study the anteroposterior frequency differences of pure synchronous ( visible bilaterally, either frontopolarly or centrally) and diffuse ( visible bilaterally both frontopolarly and centrally) sleep spindles. Methods: A previously presented spindle detector based on the fuzzy reasoning principle and a level detector were combined to form a multi-channel spindle detector. Results: The spindle detector had a 76.17% true positive rate and 0.93% false-positive rate. Pure central spindles were faster and pure frontal spindles were slower than diffuse spindles measured simultaneously from both locations. Conclusions: The study of frequency relations of spindles might give new information about thalamocortical sleep spindle generating mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The adolescent decline of NREM delta, an indicator of brain maturation, is linked to age and sex but not to pubertal stage	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sleep; adolescence; electroencephalograph; non-rapid eye movement	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; SLEEP ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYNAPTIC DENSITY; METABOLIC-RATE; CHILDHOOD; VARIABLES; CHILDREN; HORMONE; RELEASE; NEURONS	The adolescent decline of NREM delta, an indicator of brain maturation, is linked to age and sex but not to pubertal stage. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 291: R1724-R1729, 2006. First published July 10, 2006; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00293.2006.-Two dramatic phenomena of human adolescence are sexual maturation and a steep decline in the delta EEG of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It has long been speculated that these developmental changes are causally related. Here, we present the first longitudinal data on this issue. Cohorts of 9- and 12-year-old children (n = 31, 38) were studied with in-home sleep EEG recordings at 6-mo intervals over 2 years. Pubertal (Tanner) stage, height, and weight were obtained at each time point. NREM delta power density (DPD) did not change significantly over ages 9-11 years, and its level did not differ in boys and girls. DPD declined by 25% between ages 12 and 14 years. This decline was parallel in the two sexes, but levels were lower in girls, suggesting that their DPD decline began earlier. Mixed effect analyses demonstrated that DPD was strongly related to age with Tanner stage, height, weight and body mass index controlled but that none of these measures of physical and sexual development was related to DPD with age controlled. NREM delta is the sleep EEG component homeostatically related to prior waking duration and the intensity of waking brain activity. We hypothesize that the DPD decline is caused by age-programmed synaptic pruning that decreases waking brain metabolic rate. This reduced rate would decrease the "substrate" for delta homeostasis. Whether or not this interpretation proves correct, these longitudinal data demonstrate that the delta decline in adolescence reflects brain processes that are not predicted by physical growth or sexual maturation.

Following the last dose of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, during a time interval of 8 weeks, the following procedures were carried out: 1) cortical electroencephalographic recordings, including power-spectrum analysis; 2) administration of sub-threshold doses of kainate; 3) measurement of regional [C-14]2-deoxyglucose uptake; 4) monoamine assay. We demonstrate that all mice pre-treated with (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine showed long-lasting encephalographic changes with frequencies peaking at 3 - 4.5 Hz at the power-spectrum analysis. This is concomitant with latent brain hyperexcitability within selected limbic brain regions, as shown by seizure facilitation and long-lasting latent metabolic hyperactivity which can be unraveled by phasic glutamate stimulation. This study sheds new light into the brain targets of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and discloses the occurrence of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced latent hyperexcitability within limbic areas, while it might provide a model to study in controlled experimental conditions limbic seizures and status epilepticus in C57 Black mice. Persistent changes produced by (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in limbic brain excitability might be responsible for seizures and limbic-related disorders in chronic (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine abusers.

The authors conducted this study to characterize the electrical discharge patterns obtained using FOE recording and evaluated their clinical significance. Interictal and ictal discharge patterns and their temporal relationships to EEGs were examined in 16 patients who had FOEs implanted bilaterally and had good recovery from surgery. After long-term telemetry recording with FOEs, all patients displayed clear seizure onsets originating in one or both sides of the MTL and underwent an anterior temporal lobectomy. Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were lateralized to the operated side in 12 patients based on scalp EEGs and in 8 patients based on FOE recordings. Among the various possible IED patterns observed with the FOE recordings, a periodic pattern was dominant in the operated side (P = 0.001), whereas a polyspike pattern was dominant in the nonoperated side (P = 0.002). The number of patients with ictal onsets in the operated side was five based on the scalp EEG and 10 based on FOE recordings. Paroxysmal fast frequency activity, rhythmic spikes (>2 Hz), or sharp waves were dominant over other FOE seizure onset patterns in the operated side. By contrast, delta and theta slowing and positive spikes were prevalent in the nonoperated side. The start-stop- start pattern, previously described using subdural electrodes, was also found in FOE recordings and was concordant with the operated side in all cases. The interhemispheric propagation time recorded with bilateral FOEs was 22.6 +/- 20.0 seconds for ictal discharges initiated in the operated side and 7.0 +/- 8.4 seconds for those in the nonoperated side. Among various IED spreading patterns, the most prevalent progression was FOE --> contralateral FOE --> ipsilateral temporal lobe, or --> contralateral temporal lobe. In this series, FOE implantation caused no serious complications. FOE recording appears to be useful for confirming lateralization in patients with MTL epilepsy previously determined using clinical and neurointaging methods. A thorough analysis of FOE recordings can provide information that may facilitate the differentiation of primary from secondary (nonepileptogenic) temporal lobes.

Even worse, is the possibility that some athletes experience reinjury or Multiples injuries during their athletic careers. Athletes who experience multiple injuries are often labeled as injury prone and are treated numerous times for their physical injuries, but are never examined or treated for possible neural, behavioral or psychological deficits. For standard orthopedic injuries, it is assumed that the athlete is healthy once motor performance has reached pre-injury levels. For athletes that suffer concussions, it is assumed that the athlete is healthy once they are asymptomatic. Recent research has begun to target these misconceptions by providing data which suggest that neural symptoms, behavioral and psychological factors may exist as a by product of injury. Additionally, if injured athletes harbor any of these deficits during return to play, they may become more susceptible to re-injury. This paper attempts to attack the issue of re-injury by specifically addressing the psychological issues of fear related to re-injury of all sorts as well as neural substrates and behavioral deficits existing in concussed athletes. Using neural (EEG) basis of behavioral data (Balance), and psychological data (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) we will ultimately be able to identify athletes at risk for re-injury. The results presented differences in athletes related to fear levels and gender, severity of injury and number of injuries experienced.. EEG data was consistent in its findings in that concussed subjects showed an increase in the frequency bands of delta and theta, and a decrease in alpha compared to non-concussed subjects. Differences were also found in Balance levels in which concussed subjects showed high levels of instability particularly during eyes closed conditions in comparison to non-concussed subjects. Specific data analysis gives rise to psychological interventions that may help to identify athletes at risk for re-injury. With this identification athletes may seek the training needed to address neural, behavioral and psychological deficits.

In the hippocampus, which is one of the regions most sensitive to ischemic challenge, global ischemia induces a complete loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas the resistant CA3 pyramidal neurons display a long-term hyperexcitability several months after the insult. The mechanisms of this long-term hyperexcitability remain unknown despite its clinical implication. Using chronic in vivo EEG recordings and in vitro field recordings in slices, we now report spontaneous interictal epileptiform discharges in the CA3 area of the hippocampus from post-ischemic rats several months after the insult. Whole-cell recordings from CA3 pyramidal neurons, revealed a permanent reduction in the frequency of spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs and a parallel increase in the frequency of spontaneous and miniature glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Global ischemia also induced a dramatic loss of GABAergic interneurons and terminals together with an increase in glutamatergic terminals in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. Altogether, our results show a morpho-functional reorganization in the CA3 network several months after global ischemia, resulting in a net shift in the excitatory-inhibitory balance toward excitation that may constitute a substrate for the generation of epileptiform discharges in the post-ischemic hippocampus.

Previous studies have shown reduced SSVEPs to alpha and lower frequencies of stimulation in schizophrenia. We investigated SSVEPs in schizophrenia at frequencies spanning the theta (4 Hz) to gamma (40 Hz) range. Methods: The SSVEPs to seven different frequencies of stimulation (4, 8, 17, 20, 23, 30 and 40 Hz) were obtained from 18 schizophrenia subjects and 33 healthy control subjects. Power at stimulating frequency (signal power) and power at frequencies above and below the stimulating frequency (noise power) were used to quantify the SSVEP responses. Results: Both groups showed an inverse relationship between power and frequency of stimulation. Schizophrenia subjects showed reduced signal power compared to healthy control subjects at higher frequencies (above 17 Hz), but not at 4 and 8 Hz at occipital region. Noise power was higher in schizophrenia subjects at frequencies between 4 and 20 Hz over occipital region and at 4, 17 and 20 Hz over frontal region. Conclusions: SSVEP signal power at beta and gamma frequencies of stimulation were reduced in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia subjects showed higher levels of EEG noise during photic stimulation at beta and lower frequencies. Significance: Inability to generate or maintain oscillations in neural networks may contribute to deficits in visual processing in schizophrenia.

That is one of the reasons why experts seek further possibilities of helping these people. Two of these are the EEG biofeedback and the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) The EEG biofeedback enables to influence the actual bio-electric activity of the brain. For example, the so-called alpha feedback is effective for people with a severe anxiety condition and people suffering from depression. The so-called alpha-theta biofeedback has proved successful for treating various forms of addiction. The essence of the method is the application of the feedback principle to the regulation of the bio-electric activities of the brain. The bio-electric activity of the treated person is recorded (two-channel EEG). The record, i.e. the electro-encephalogram, is then enhanced and the cerebral waves are divided into frequency bands and projected on the monitor of a computer. A computer program will then process the bio-electric activity of the brain and ensure that, in every instant, the brain gets a feedback of its activity. The course of the cerebral waves, displayed on the monitor, is then transformed into various video games with therapeutic effects and the individual influences the course of the game only by his thinking, decisions, "will", without the use of a keyboard or mouse. If the bio-electric activity of the brain increases in the required band of cerebral waves, the individual is "rewarded" by, for example, points displayed on the monitor or by means of sonic signals. In this manner, the brain teaches itself how to tune into more suitable frequencies of its waves. The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses the principle of electromagnetic induction. A coil is attached to the skin of the head through which primary cut-rent passes. The current will trigger a development of a magnetic field whose oscillation will induce a development of a secondary current in the brain. The coils used in medicine produce a magnetic field of 1.5-2 Tesla and activate neurones within 1.5-2 cm of the coil surface. However, if required, neurones in a greater distance from the point of the stimulation may also be influenced by means of a trans-synaptic connection.

A better understanding of the neurophysiological processes underlying perceptual reversals might help to disentangle bottom-up from top-clown influences on multistable perception. Recently, we reported alpha activity decrease during multistable visual perception. The aim of the present study was to define more specifically the functional roles of the EEG alpha hand during the perception of Necker cube reversals by Subdividing the extended alpha band into three sub-bands (lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha, upper alpha). We employed a long-term recording condition, during which 10 healthy participants observed the Necker cube for approximately 60 min and responded by pressing a button to any perceived reversal. The results showed a reversal induced alpha desynchronization for the lower alpha hands, with the lower-2 alpha clesynchronization differing across the time course of the experiment. The upper alpha band demonstrated no reliable effects. It is concluded that the lower-1 alpha desynchronization reflects ail automatic arousal reaction which triggers attentional processing in a bottom-up manner, whereas the lower-2 alpha desynchronization is related to attentional processes that are achieved by top-down control with limited resources. The lack of reliable effects ill the Upper alpha hand is presumably due to the relatively low semantic task demands in Figure reversal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hirnpotentialanderungen bei Willkurbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflugers Archiv 1965;284:1-17], various source localization techniques in normal subjects and epicortical recording in epilepsy patients have disclosed the generator mechanisms of each identifiable component of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) to some extent. The initial slow segment of BP, called 'early BY in this article, begins about 2 s before the movement onset in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with no site-specificity and in the SMA proper according to the somatotopic organization, and shortly thereafter in the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally with relatively clear somatotopy. About 400 ms before the movement onset, the steeper negative slope, called 'late BP' in this article (also referred to as NS'), occurs in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) and lateral premotor cortex with precise somatotopy. These two phases of BP are differentially influenced by various factors, especially by complexity of the movement which enhances only the late BP. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta frequency EEG band before self-initiated movements shows a different temporospatial pattern from that of the BP, suggesting different neuronal mechanisms for the two. BP has been applied for investigating pathophysiology of various movement disorders. Volitional motor inhibition or muscle relaxation is preceded by BP quite similar to that preceding voluntary muscle contraction. Since BP of typical waveforms and temporospatial pattern does not occur before organic involuntary movements, BP is used for detecting the participation of the 'voluntary motor system' in the generation of apparently involuntary movements in patients with psychogenic movement disorders. In view of Libet et al.'s report [Libet B, Gleason CA, Wright EW, Pearl DK. Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential). The unconscious initiation of a freely voluntary act. Brain 1983;106:623-642] that the awareness of intention to move occurred much later than the onset of BP, the early BP might reflect, physiologically, slowly increasing cortical excitability and, behaviorally, subconscious readiness for the forthcoming movement. Whether the late BP reflects conscious preparation for intended movement or not remains to be clarified. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

To obtain evidence of the neuronal network responsible for this rhythmicity we investigated the effect of transcranial. magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation on the coupling between eletcroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded from the scalp over the motor cortex and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in 15 healthy human subjects. TMS over the leg area at intensities between 0.95 and 1.1 X threshold for a motor evoked potential (MEP) in the TA increased corticomuscular coherence in the 15-35 Hz frequency band. This effect lasted on average for 300 ms, but could last up to 600-800 ms in some subjects. Stimulation of motor nerves from the ankle muscles suppressed corticomuscular coherence in the 15-35 Hz frequency range between leg area EEG and TA EMG for a period up to 600-800 ms. In addition, increased coherence around 10 Hz was observed for a period up to 250 ms after the stimulation. Stimulation of motor nerves in the arm and motor nerves from the ankle muscles in the other leg had no effect. The findings indicate that TMS has direct access to the neuronal circuitry in the motor cortex, which generates the corticomuscular coherence. This effect was caused either by direct activation of corticospinal cells or by activation of local neuronal circuitries in the motor cortex. The effects of peripheral nerve stimulation suggest that an alternative rhythm generator may entrain the cortical cells into a lower 10 Hz rhythm and disrupt the 15-35 Hz rhythm.

Increases in alpha oscillatory power reflect an active retinotopic mechanism for distracter suppression during sustained visuospatial attention	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; CORTICAL AREAS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; SYSTEM; DEPLOYMENTS; SHIFTS; RHYTHM	Human electrophysiological (EEG) studies have demonstrated the involvement of alpha band (8- to 14-Hz) oscillations in the anticipatory biasing of attention. In the context of visual spatial attention within bilateral stimulus arrays, alpha has exhibited greater amplitude over parietooccipital cortex contralateral to the hemifield required to be ignored, relative to that measured when the same hemifield is to be attended. Whether this differential effect arises solely from alpha desynchronization (decreases) over the "attending" hemisphere, from synchronization (increases) over the "ignoring" hemisphere, or both, has not been fully resolved. This is because of the confounding effect of externally evoked desynchronization that occurs involuntarily in response to visual cues. Here, bilateral flickering stimuli were presented simultaneously and continuously over entire trial blocks, such that externally evoked alpha desynchronization is equated in precue baseline and postcue intervals. Equivalent random letter sequences were superimposed on the left and right flicker stimuli. Subjects were required to count the presentations of the target letter "X" at the cued hemifield over an 8-s period and ignore the sequence in the opposite hemifield. The data showed significant increases in alpha power over the ignoring hemisphere relative to the precue baseline, observable for both cue directions. A strong attentional bias necessitated by the subjective difficulty in gating the distracting letter sequence is reflected in a large effect size of 2.1 (eta(2) = 0.82), measured from the attention x hemisphere interaction. This strongly suggests that alpha synchronization reflects an active attentional suppression mechanism, rather than a passive one reflecting "idling" circuits.

J	Riddle, CN; Baker, SN				Riddle, C. Nicholas; Baker, Stuart N.			Digit displacement, not object compliance, underlies task dependent modulations in human corticomuscular coherence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						corticomuscular coherence; synchrony; skilled movement	FINGER MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CORTEX; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; CORRELATE; TREMOR; RHYTHM; THUMB; HAND	Human sensorimotor EEG shows oscillatory activity at similar to 10 and similar to 20 Hz; the latter frequency is coherent with contralateral EMG. The functional significance of this activity is obscure. A recent study found that corticomuscular coherence varied systematically with increasing lever compliance during a precision grip task. However, since subjects exerted the same force in all conditions, changes in lever compliance also produced changes in how far the digits moved. In this study, we disambiguated whether corticomuscular coherence modulates with object compliance or digit displacement. Subjects performed a precision grip task. Under computer control, the manipulandum could simulate a load of arbitrary compliance (spring constant). Subjects were required to produce a hold-ramp-hold profile of lever displacement, under visual feedback. Subjects first performed tasks with different sized lever movements, against an isotonic load (zero spring constant). Corticomuscular coherence was calculated between left sensorimotor EEG and EMG from five right hand and forearm muscles during the hold phase of the task. Coherence magnitude showed a clear dependence on the extent of digit displacement. In the next task, lever compliance instantaneously changed at the onset of the second hold phase of the task. Corticomuscular coherence modulated not with lever compliance during the analysed hold phase, but with digit displacement during the preceding ramp movement. These data suggest that human corticomuscular coherence is directly related to digit displacement during the preceding movement and not to object compliance. We speculate that corticomuscular coherence may reflect a sensorimotor recalibration, providing updated information about system state following movement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These include the lightdark and social cycles, a circadian hypothalamic oscillator oscillating virtually independently of behavior, and a homeostatic oscillator driven primarily by sleep-wake behavior. Both internal oscillators contribute to variation in many aspects of sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep timing and duration, REM sleep, non-REM sleep, REM density, sleep spindles, slow-wave sleep, electroencephalographic oscillations during wakefulness and sleep, and performance parameters, including attention and memory). The relative contribution of the oscillators varies greatly between these variables. Sleep and performance cannot be predicted by either oscillator independently but critically depend on their phase relationship and amplitude. The homeostatic oscillator feeds back onto the central pacemaker or its outputs. Thus, the amplitude of observed circadian variation in sleep and performance depends on how long we have been asleep or awake. During entrainment to external 24-h cycles, the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness. Some physiological correlates and mediators of both the circadian process (e.g., melatonin and hypocretin rhythms) and the homeostat (e.g., EEG, slow-wave activity, and adenosine release) have been established, offering targets for the development of countermeasures for circadian sleep and performance disorders. Interindividual differences in sleep timing, duration, and morning or evening preference are associated with changes of circadian or sleep homeostatic processes or both. Molecular genetic correlates, including polymorphisms in clock genes, of some of these interindividual differences are emerging.

J	Dockree, PM; Kelly, SP; Roche, RAP; Hogan, MJ; Reilly, RB; Robertson, IH				Dockree, PM; Kelly, SP; Roche, RAP; Hogan, MJ; Reilly, RB; Robertson, IH			Behavioural and physiological impairments of sustained attention after traumatic brain injury	COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha power; no-go task; desynchronization; frontal lobes	CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; FAILURES; DEFICITS; AROUSAL; MEMORY; DAMAGE	Sustaining attention under conditions of low external demand taxes our ability to stay on task and to avoid more appealing trains of thought or environmental distractions. By contrast, a stimulating, novel environment engages attention far more freely without the subjective feeling of having to override monotony. Our ability to maintain a goal-directed focus without support from the environment requires the endogenous control of behaviour. This control can be modulated by fronto-parietal circuits and this ability is compromised following traumatic brain injury (TBI) leading to increased lapses of attention. In this paper, we further explore a laboratory paradigm that we argue is particularly sensitive to sustained attention as opposed to other aspects of attentional control involving the selection and management of goals in working memory. The paradigm (fixed sequence Sustained Attention to Response Task-SART(fixed)) involves withholding a key press to an infrequent no-go target embedded within a predictable sequence of numbers. We demonstrate that TBI patients in this study make disproportionately more errors than controls on this task. An analysis of response times (RTs) and EEG alpha power across the task demonstrates group differences preceding the critical no-go trial. Controls demonstrate a lengthening of RTs accompanied by desynchronization of power within the alpha band (similar to 10 Hz) preceding the no-go trial. Conversely, the TBI group showed a shortening of RTs during this period with no evidence of alpha desynchronization. These findings suggest that TBI patients may have dysfunctional alpha generators as a consequence of their injury that impairs endogenous control during the task. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Phasic activation of locus ceruleus neurons by glutamate enhances the dentate gyrus population spike amplitude and results in long- term potentiation of synaptic responses recorded after 24 h. Cholinergic activation of locus ceruleus neurons increases hippocampal theta. At the level of the cellular network, it is not clear how the potentiating effects of norepinephrine are mediated. Previous studies show that exogenous norepinephrine enhances inhibitory interneuron firing in the dentate gyrus. This finding appears at odds with evidence for potentiation. In this study, natural release of norepinephrine was induced by glutamate activation of locus ceruleus while we recorded EEGs and physiologically identified interneurons in the dentate gyrus of urethane- anesthetized rats. Feedforward neurons were inhibited ( similar to 1 - 2 min) by locus ceruleus activation. Feedback interneurons showed both increased and decreased activity, whereas granule cells increased firing as predicted by evoked potential studies. EEG results replicated an increase in theta power ( 4 - 8 Hz) with locus ceruleus activation, but the effect with glutamatergic locus ceruleus activation was transient ( similar to 1 - 2 min). beta - gamma Frequencies were also transiently suppressed. Together, the data suggest that locus ceruleus activation enhances the throughput of concomitant sensory input by reducing feedforward inhibitory interneuron activity, which may reduce " binding" in existing cell assemblies, and enhances the conditions for synaptic plasticity through disinhibition, promotion of 4 - 8 Hz theta, and noradrenergic potentiation to facilitate the building of new representations.

Methods: Subjects had to memorize one (load 1) or 3 (load3) letters (memory set) and search for these among a recognition set consisting of 4 letters only, if the letters appeared in the correct (relevant) color. Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as alpha and theta event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERD/ERS) were derived from the EEG that was recorded during the task. Results: In the ERP to the memory set, a prolonged load-related positivity was found. In response to the recognition set, effects of relevance were manifested in an early frontal positivity and a later frontal negativity. Effects of load were found in a search-related negativity within the attended category and a suppression of the P3-amplitude. Theta ERS was most pronounced for the most difficult task condition during the recognition set, whereas alpha ERD showed a load-effect only during memorization. Conclusions: The manipulation of stimulus relevance and memory load affected both ERP components and ERD/ERS. Significance: The present paradigm may supply a useful method for studying processes of selective attention and working memory and can be used to examine group differences between healthy controls and children showing psychopathology.

Even earlier effects have occasionally been reported with subliminal or perceptual threshold presentation, particularly in clinical populations. Here, the underlying mechanisms are likely to diverge from the ones operational in standard natural reading. The variability in timing of the effects can be accounted for by dynamically changing lexical representations that can be activated as required by the Subjects' motivational state, the task at hand, and additional contextual factors. Through-out, Subcortical structures such as the amygdala, are likely to contribute these enhancements. Further research will establish whether or when emotional arousal, valence, or additional emotional properties drive the observed effects and how experimental factors interact with these. Meticulous control of other word properties known to affect ERPs in visual word processing, such as word class, length, frequency, and concreteness and the use of more standardized EEG procedures is vital. Mapping the interplay between cortical and subcortical mechanisms that give rise to amplified cortical responses to emotional words will be of highest priority for future research.

Animals were injected once a day, 5 days per week (Monday-Friday), for 2 weeks with fractions (0.3x, 0.4x, 0.5x, or 0.6x) of the established LD50 dose of sarin (42 mu g/kg, s.c.). The animals were assessed for changes in body weight, red blood cell (RBC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels, neurobehavioral reactions to a functional observational battery (FOB), cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum, and intrinsic acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter (NT) regulation over the 2 weeks of sarin exposure and for up to 12 days postinjection. No guinea pig receiving 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 x LD50 of sarin showed signs of cortical EEG seizures despite decreases in RBC AChE levels to as low as 10% of baseline, while seizures were evident in animals receiving 0.6 x LD50 of sarin as early as the second day; subsequent injections led to incapacitation and death. Animals receiving 0.5 x LD50 sarin showed obvious signs of cholinergic toxicity; overall, 2 of 13 animals receiving 0.5 x LD50 sarin died before all 10 injections were given, and there was a significant increase in the angle of gait in the animals that lived. By the 10th day of injection, the animals receiving saline were significantly easier to remove from their cages and handle and significantly less responsive to an approaching pencil and touch on the rump in comparison with the first day of testing. In contrast, the animals receiving 0.4 x LD50 sarin failed to show any significant reductions in their responses to an approaching pencil and a touch on the rump as compared with the first day. The 0.5 x LD50 sarin animals also failed to show any significant changes to the approach and touch responses and did not adjust to handling or removal from the cage from the first day of injections to the last day of handling. Thus, the guinea pigs receiving the 0.4 and 0.5 x LD50 doses of sarin failed to habituate to some aspects of neurobehavioral testing. Spectral analysis of EEG data suggested that repeated sarin exposure may disrupt normal sleeping patterns (i.e., lower frequency bandwidths). While these EEG changes returned to relative normalcy 6 days after the last injection in animals receiving 0.4 x LD50 sarm, these changes were still observed in the animals that received 0.5 x LD50 sarin. Ten to twelve days after the last sarin injection (in 0.4 x LD50 group only), neurochemical data showed that striatal choline levels were reduced in comparison to the saline group. At this time, atropine sulfate (5 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge resulted in a transient elevation in striatal ACh levels in animals exposed to repeated 0.4 x LD50 sarin as well as in control animals. No evidence of brain or heart pathology was found in any guinea pig that survived all 10 sarin injections. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have shown that ERD/ERS phenomena in narrow frequency bands are remarkably stable over time and across different testing situations. The high reproducibility of ERD/ERS promotes the usefulness of this biometric measure in assessing individual characteristics. In addition to the spatio-temporal patterns of (de)synchronization processes the most reactive frequency components are especially highly subject-specific and, therefore, open up new possibilities for user authentication and person identification. In contrast, ERD/ERS research will continue to be useful in clinical brain-computer interface (BCI) implementation. Promising novel applications of an ERD/ERS based BCI may contribute to enhanced functional recovery and rehabilitation in patients suffering from chronic stroke. According to current therapeutic strategies, feed back-regulated motor imagery could be used to enhance antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns and therewith, support activation of the stroke affected and inhibition of the non-affected, contralesional hemisphere.

Single-trial ERP recordings capture the oscillatory activity that are hypothesized to underlie both communication between brain regions and amplified processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, precise interpretations of ERPs are precluded by uncertainty about their neural mechanisms. One influential theory holds that averaged sensory ERPs are generated by partial phase resetting of ongoing electroencephalographic oscillations, while another states that ERPs result from stimulus-evoked neural responses. We formulated critical predictions of each theory and tested these using direct, intracortical analyses of neural activity in monkeys. Our findings support a predominant role for stimulus-evoked activity in sensory ERP generation, and they outline both logic and methodology necessary for differentiating evoked and phase resetting contributions to cognitive and motor ERPs in future studies.

The method of induced event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and coherence (ERCoh) was used. The music condition had a beneficial influence on respondents' performance of spatial rotation tasks, and a slightly negative influence on the performance of numerical tasks as compared with the silence condition. On the psychophysiological level a general effect of Mozart's music on brain activity in the induced gamma band was observed, accompanied by a more specific effect in the induced lower-2 alpha band which was only present while respondents solved the numerical tasks. It is suggested that listening to Mozart's music increases the activity of specific brain areas and in that way facilitates the selection and "binding" together of pertinent aspects of sensory stimulus into a perceived whole.

To characterize the neuronal couplings involved during these prominent power changes, we have chosen a certain coupling measure that bears directly on the issue of transient cortical connections. Specifically, we applied for the first time the phase-locking value to investigate the phase coupling of sensorimotor rhythms in different motor areas during tongue-movement imagery. Most interesting, we showed that robust neuronal couplings within the alpha frequency range are established between the midcentral position and bilateral central electrode positions, overlying the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right and left primary sensorimotor area, respectively. In contrast, no direct linkage was present between sensorimotor rhythms in both hemispheres. We suggest that the coupling results point at a separate interplay between neural networks within the SMA and lateralized networks in primary sensorimotor areas of each hemisphere during motor imagery.

In contrast, less is known about central executive processes. Neuroimaging studies suggest that central executive processes are related to a complex fronto-parietal network. In the present study we investigate the question whether varying demands on central executive processes are reflected by differences in coherent activity between and within a fronto-parietal network. We calculated coherence during a visuospatial working memory task. Under an easy executive condition subjects had to mentally imagine previously studied abstract patterns, whereas in the difficult condition, subjects had to mentally manipulate these patterns. The results indicate the involvement of prefrontal areas in executive functions reflected by a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of fronto-parietal long-range coherence mirroring activation of a fronto-parietal network.

For example, the MEG steady state response to a modulated auditory stimulus generates a complex magnetic field for each MEG channel, equal to the Fourier transform at the stimulus modulation frequency. The complex nature of these data sets, often not taken advantage of, is fully exploited here with new methods. Whole-head, complex magnetic data can be used to estimate complex neural current sources, and standard methods of source estimation naturally generalize for complex sources. We show that a general complex neural vector source is described by its location, magnitude, and direction, but also by a phase and by an additional perpendicular component. We give natural interpretations of all the parameters for the complex equivalent-current dipole by linking them to the underlying neurophysiology. We demonstrate complex magnetic fields, and their equivalent fully complex current sources, with both simulations and experimental data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The neural transmitter and receiver are modified TinyOS-based MICAz wireless sensor nodes that can sample, transmit, and receive neural data real-time at a rate of 44.8 kbps while consuming less than 100 mW of power. This data rate can be divided for recording on up to eight channels, with a resolution of up to 10 bits per sample. An archive server records the neural signals received by the Ethernet-based gateway receivers, and hosts them to browser-based clients over the Internet.

The current study investigates a possible link between Gamma synchrony and individual differences in intelligence within the theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence, with due reference to Hebbian theory. The hypothesis is that there are significant correlations between cognitive performance and synchronous Gamma activity across diverse brain regions. EEG data were recorded from 35 healthy participants, and the peak magnitude and latency of early and late Gamma Synchrony were extracted using a method for quantifying phase synchronization across multiple sites. Participants also completed 11 diverse cognitive ability tests tapping fluid and crystallized intelligence. Overall, moderate-sized correlations were obtained between accuracy and speed composite scores, derived from the ability tests, and magnitude and latency indices of Gamma synchrony. Phase-synchronous Gamma activity provides a plausible physiological mechanism that might account for individual differences in cognitive abilities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This could involve efferent and/or afferent components of the sensorimotor loop. We investigated the pathways responsible for coherence genesis by manipulating nervous conduction delays using cooling. Coherence between left sensorimotor EEG and right EMG from three hand and two forearm muscles was assessed in healthy subjects during the hold phase of a precision grip task. The right arm was then cooled to 10 degrees C for similar to 90 min, increasing peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) by similar to 35% (assessed by F-wave latency). EEG and EMG recordings were repeated, and coherence recalculated. Control recordings revealed a heterogeneous subject population. In 6/15 subjects (Group A), the corticomuscular coherence phase increased linearly with frequency, as expected if oscillations were propagated along efferent pathways from cortex to muscle. The mean corticomuscular conduction delay for intrinsic hand muscles calculated from the phase-frequency regression slope was 10.4 ms; this is smaller than the delay expected for conduction over fast corticospinal pathways. In 8/15 subjects (Group B), the phase showed no dependence with frequency. One subject showed both Group A and Group B patterns over different frequency ranges. Following cooling, averaged corticomuscular coherence was decreased in Group A subjects, but unchanged for Group B, even though both groups showed comparable slowing of nervous conduction. The delay calculated from the slope of the phase-frequency regression was increased following cooling. However, the size of this increase was around twice the rise in PMCT measured using the F-wave (regression slope 2.33, 95% confidence limits 1.30-3.36). Both afferent and efferent peripheral nerves will be slowed by similar amounts following cooling. The change in delay calculated from the coherence phase therefore better matches the rise in total sensorimotor feedback loop time caused by cooling, rather than just the change in the efferent limb. A model of corticomuscular coherence which assumes that only efferent pathways contribute cannot be reconciled to these results. The data rather suggest that afferent feedback pathways may also play a role in the genesis of corticomuscular coherence.

They appear to reflect movement control mechanisms, which remain partially unclear. With the aim of better understanding their sources and significance, we recorded MRCPs and sensorimotor rhythms during and after self-paced movement using intracerebral electrodes in eight epileptic subjects investigated by stereoelectroencephalography. The results showed that: (i) there is a strong spatial relationship between the late components of movement - the so-called motor potential (MP) and post-movement complex (PMc) - and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) within the 40-60 Hz band, as the MP/PMc always occurred in contacts displaying gamma ERS (the primary sensorimotor areas), whereas mu and beta reactivities were more diffuse; and (ii) MPs and PMc are both generated by the primary motor and somatosensory areas, but with distinct sources. Hence, this could mean that kinesthesic sensory afferences project to neurons other than those firing during the pyramidal tract volley. The PMc and low gamma ERS represent two electrophysiological facets of kinesthesic feedback from the joints and muscles involved in the movement to the sensorimotor cortex. It could be suggested that gamma oscillations within the 40-60 Hz band could serve to synchronize the activities of the various neuronal populations involved in control of the ongoing movement.

In a magnetoencephalography study using pictorial stimuli, we have now identified oscillatory activity in the gamma (60-90 Hz) and theta (4.5-8.5 Hz) band during declarative memory operations in healthy participants. Both theta and gamma activity was stronger for the later remembered compared with the later forgotten items (the "subsequent memory effect"). In the retrieval session, theta and gamma activity was stronger for recognized items compared with correctly rejected new items (the "old/new effect"). The gamma activity was also stronger for recognized compared with forgotten old items (the "recognition effect"). The effects in the theta band were observed over right parietotemporal areas, whereas the sources of the effects in the gamma band were identified in Brodmann area 18/19. We propose that the theta activity is directly engaged in mnemonic operations. The increase in neuronal synchronization in the gamma band in occipital areas may result in a stronger drive to subsequent areas, thus facilitating both memory encoding and retrieval. Alternatively, the gamma synchronization might reflect representations being reinforced by top-down activity from higher-level memory areas. Our results provide additional insight on human declarative memory operations and oscillatory brain activity that complements previous electrophysiological and brain imaging studies.

J	Haken, H				Haken, Hermann			Synergetics of brain function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						synergetics; self-organization; movement coordination; pulse synchronization; visual pattern recognition; attention	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; POPULATIONS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS	Several brain functions such as movement coordination and visual perception are analysed in terms of synergetics, an interdisciplinary field of research dealing with spontaneous pattern formation. Accordingly, the brain is conceived as a self-organizing system operating close to instabilities where its activities are governed by collective variables, the order parameters, that enslave the individual parts, i.e., the neurons. In this approach, emphasis is laid on qualitative changes of behavioral and neuronal activities. These concepts are substantiated by detailed experimental and theoretical studies of the coordination of finger movements by direct observation of their changes and MEG measurements. In its main part, this paper deals with visual pattern recognition. Using general properties of order parameters, at the phenomenological level bistability, hysteresis and oscillations of visual perception can be modelled. Then, at the microscopic level, a network of pulse-coupled neurons is treated, where the dynamics of the dendritic currents as well as the axonic pulses (spikes) are taken into account. Both pulse-synchronization as well as pattern recognition are treated. In the high pulse frequency limit the attractor network of the synergetic computer is recovered. In the next step, the concept of quasi-attractors is mathematically formulated where due to saturation of attention attractors are closed. Depending on incoming signals, the visual system thus wanders from quasi-attractor to quasi-attractor. The paper includes an interpretation of consciousness in terms of order parameters as well as a discussion on linearity versus nonlinearity, the binding problem, and the psychological "present".

The ecb21 phenotype underwent the statistical adjustments for the age of participants, and for attaining a normal distribution. A total of 1,000 subjects' available phenotypes were included in linkage analysis with microsatellite markers. Linkage analysis was performed only for chromosome 4 where a quantitative trait locus with 5.01 LOD score had been previously reported. Previous findings related this location with the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor. At the same location, our analysis showed a LOD score of 2.2. This decrease in the LOD score is the result of a drastic reduction (one-third) of the available GAW14 phenotypic data. We performed SNP and haplotype association analyses with the same phenotypic data under the linkage peak region on chromosome 4. Seven Affymetrix and two Illumina SNPs showed significant associations with ecb21 phenotype. A haplotype, a combination of SNPs TSC0044171 and TSC0551006 ( the latter almost under the region of GABAA genes), showed a significant association with ecb21 ( p = 0.015) and a relatively high frequency in the sample studied. Our results affirmed that the GABA region has potential of harboring genes that contribute quantitatively to the beta oscillation of the brain rhythms. The inclusion of the remaining 614 subjects, which in the GAW14 had missing data for the ecb21, can improve the strength of the associations as they have already shown that they contribute quite important information in the linkage analysis.

We hypothesize that cortical integration of sensory information may underlie conscious perception and may be disrupted by anesthetics. A critical role in frontal-posterior interactions has been proposed, and gamma (20-60 Hz) oscillations have also been assigned an essential role in consciousness. Here we investigated whether general anesthetics may interfere with the exchange of information encoded in gamma oscillations between frontal and posterior cortices. Bipolar electrodes for recording of event-related potentials (ERP) were chronically implanted in the primary visual cortex, parietal association and frontal association cortices of six rats. Sixty light flashes were presented every 5 s, and ERPs were recorded at increasing concentrations of halothane or isoflurane (0-2%). Information exchange was estimated by transfer entropy, a novel measure of directional information transfer. Transfer entropy was calculated from 1-s wavelet-transformed ERPs. We found that (1) feedforward transfer entropy (FF-TE) and feedback transfer entropy (FB-TE) were balanced in conscious-sedated state; (2) anesthetics at concentrations producing unconsciousness augmented both FF-TE and FB-TE at 30 Hz but reduced them at 50 Hz; (3) reduction at 50 Hz was more pronounced for FB-TE, especially between frontal and posterior regions; (4) at high concentrations, both FF-TE and FB-TE at all frequencies were at or below conscious-sedated baseline. Our findings suggest that inhalational anesthetics preferentially impair frontal-posterior FB information transfer at high gamma frequencies consistent with the postulated role of frontal-posterior interactions in consciousness.

However, SEP amplitudes from single trials fluctuate periodically between high and low values regardless of sleep-wake cycle. To test the hypothesis that state-independent fluctuations represent local functional sleep-like states of individual cortical columns, we examined single trial SEP amplitudes from multiple cortical locations across sleep-wake cycles. Bilateral stimuli produced SEP amplitude fluctuations in each hemisphere that usually covaried (r = 0.4), but with frequent hemispheric differences. Two neighboring whiskers, twitched simultaneously on the same side, produced highly correlated SEPs in neighboring cortical columns (r = 0.9) with frequent divergences. We found 50% more disparity during QS over waking, indicating that the differences did not result from recording noise or stimulus inconsistency. Local SEP fluctuations also followed local differences in the delta wave signal during QS (r = 0.4), suggesting that similar mechanisms may modulate the SEP. The duration of the localized sleep-like (high SEP amplitude) state was dependent on the duration of prior wake-like (low SEP amplitude) state (r = 0.5), suggesting a use dependence of prior functional state period. Since SEP indicators fluctuated independently from whole animal sleep state,. and were frequently different between hemispheres and nearby cortical columns, these data support the theory that sleep-like functional states may be localized to brain regions at least as small as cortical columns.

J	Clemens, Z; Fabo, D; Halasz, P				Clemens, Zsofia; Fabo, Daniel; Halasz, Peter			Twenty-four hours retention of visuospatial memory correlates with the number of parietal sleep spindles	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						sleep spindles; Rey-Osterrieth complex figure task; memory consolidation; oscillations; hippocampus; declarative memory	LATE NOCTURNAL SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; RELIABILITY; EEG	Recent evidence suggests that the sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories relies on the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) rather than the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep. Moreover, a few studies both at the cellular and the behavioural levels have suggested the involvement of sleep spindles, the most synchronous oscillatory waveforms during NREM sleep stage 2, in this process. Our previous study showed that overnight verbal memory retention correlates with the total number of sleep spindles in left frontocentral areas, while spindling in other regions did not correlate with mnemonic retention. In the present study, we show that retention of visuospatial memories over a 24-h period correlates with the total number of sleep spindles detected over parietal regions during the intervening night-time sleep. This result provides further evidence for the association between sleep spindle activity and declarative memory consolidation, and suggests that visuospatial and verbal memory retention differ in the topographic distribution of the NREM spindle activity with which they are associated.

However, the temporal dynamics of these fluctuations are poorly understood, and the question of whether they exhibit persistent long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) remains unanswered. In this paper we use detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to show that the energy fluctuations in human hippocampus show LRTC with power-law scaling, and that these correlations differ between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic hippocampus. The analysis shows that the energy fluctuations exhibit slower decay of the correlations in the epileptogenic hippocampus compared with the non-epileptogenic hippocampus. The DFA-derived scaling exponents demonstrate that there are LRTC of energy fluctuations in human hippocampus, and that the temporal persistence of energy fluctuations is characterized by a bias for large (small) energy fluctuations to be followed by large (small) energy fluctuations. Furthermore, we find that in the period of time leading up to seizures there is no change in the scaling exponents that characterize the LRTC of energy fluctuations. The fact that the LRTC of energy fluctuations do not change as seizures approach provides evidence that the local neuronal network dynamics do not change in the period before seizures, and that seizures in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy may be triggered by an influence that is external to the hippocampus. The presence of LRTC with power-law scaling does not imply a specific mechanism, but the finding that temporal correlations decay more slowly in epileptogenic hippocampus provides electrophysiologic evidence that the underlying neuronal dynamics are different within the epileptogenic hippocampus compared with contralateral hippocampus. We briefly discuss possible neurobiological mechanisms for LRTC of the energy fluctuations in hippocampus. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, flight safety is threatened severely. It is necessary to provide pilots with appropriate mental workload during flying. A experiment of multitask which simulated the flight control environment with some degree of fidelity was developed. This work investigated how subjects perform four concurrent tasks (monitor, calculation-memory, attack and detect task) under different mental workload levels which achieved by changing working speed rhythm by measuring their reaction time and accuracy. Electroencephalograph was applied to measure subject's physiology reaction for searching the relation between mental workload and task difficulty. Result indicates that the subjects' performance is declining in series with the increase of mental workload. Subjects allot their attention,to lower mental workload. It is likelihood that there is non-sequence phenomenon of deterioration when concentrating on one characteristic task. Stimuli display time effects subjects' performance significantly though increasing stimuli display time can improve accuracy at the expense of increasing reaction time. The way frequency and high oscillation amplitude waves of electroencephalogram, to some extent, can reflect the scale of mental workload.

Although mu suppression and enhancement echo sensorimotor processing in frontoparietal networks, they are also sensitive to cognitive and affective influences and likely reflect more than an idling brain state. Mu rhythms are present at early stages of human development and in other mammalian species. They exhibit adaptive and dynamically changing properties, including frequency acceleration and posterior-to-anterior shifts in focus. Furthermore, individuals can learn to control mu rhythms volitionally in a very short period of time. This raises questions about the mu rhythm's open neural architecture and ability to respond to cognitive, affective, and motor imagery, implying an even greater developmental and functional role than has previously been ascribed to it. Recent studies have suggested that mu rhythms reflect downstream modulation of motor cortex by prefrontal mirror neurons, i.e., cells that may play a critical role in imitation learning and the ability to understand the actions of others. It is proposed that mu rhythms represent an important information processing function that links perception and action - specifically, the transformation of "seeing" and "hearing" into "doing." In a broader context, this transformation function results from an entrainment/gating mechanism in which multiple alpha networks (visual-, auditory-, and somatosensory-centered domains), typically producing rhythmic oscillations in a locally independent manner, become coupled and entrained. A global or 'diffuse and distributed alpha system' comes into existence when these independent sources of alpha become coherently engaged in transforming perception to action. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Examination showed the "excessive" spectral power of this rhythm in the prefrontal cortical areas in patients with acute schizophrenia and its "insufficient" spectral power in all derivations of the right hemisphere in patients with the chronic form as compared to the controls. The similarity of the beta2 spectral power distribution in different cortical areas measured by covariance method decreased with increase in psychopathologic manifestations. Coherent analysis revealed a substantially lower number of cortico-cortical functional connections in schizophrenic patients than in healthy subjects, absence of interhemispheric connections in patients with acute schizophrenia, and a slight increase in their number if patients with the chronic disease. However, as distinct from the controls revealing many interand intrahemispheric connections in all cortical areas, in schizophrenics the interhemispheric connections were observed only in the posterior cortical regions. The results point to a disorder of interhemispheric interaction in schizophrenia.

Such 0-trace conditioning does not depend critically on the hippocampus in wild-type mice, but it does in GluR delta 2 mutant mice. Here we examined the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) during 0-trace conditioning in GluR delta 2 mutant and wild-type mice. During the apparatus habituation sessions, the total hippocampal theta activity (4-12 Hz) of GluR delta 2 mutant mice was less than that of wildtype mice. Activity in the higher frequency band (8-12 Hz, type 1) in GluR delta 2 mutant mice was significantly less than it was in wild-type mice, but activity in the lower frequency band (4-8 Hz, type 2) was not. As learning proceeded during the acquisition sessions, the total theta activity decreased in many of the wild-type mice, while this phenomenon was less prominent in GluR delta 2 mutant mice. Further analysis showed that the type 1 activity in wild-type mice increased in the early sessions and then decreased, while that in GluR delta 2 mutant mice did not change. Type 2 activity tended to decrease in both types of mice as the conditioning proceeded. These results indicate that the distribution of hippocampal EEG frequency and its properties during conditioning are different between wild-type and GluR delta 2 mutant mice, suggesting that the cerebellar cortical dysfunction may cause an alteration in the electrophysiological characteristics of the hippocampus.

J	Wyble, BP; Hyman, JM; Rossi, CA; Hasselmo, ME				Wyble, BP; Hyman, JM; Rossi, CA; Hasselmo, ME			Analysis of theta power in hippocampal EEG during bar pressing and running behavior in rats during distinct behavioral contexts	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						wavelet; sensorimotor; learning; motor	ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; WORKING-MEMORY; SLOW ACTIVITY; TYPE-2 THETA; GUINEA-PIG; RHYTHM; PATTERNS; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION	These experiments examine changes in theta power as measured by wavelet analysis in five rats performing a conditional visual discrimination task and a simple running task. In the conditional task, rats were trained to press one lever to initiate a trial and then to press one of two choice levers, each corresponding to one of two cue lights. Analysis of theta power in this operant task found a large decrease in theta power during the choice bar presses, in contrast to the increase in theta power during trial initiation bar presses. This result seems to stand counter to results that propose consistent relationships between motor actions and theta power (Vanderwolf, EEG Clin Neurophys 26:407-418, 1969), as well as studies suggesting that the lack of bar-press theta is the result of habituation. However, these data can be seen as being in broad agreement with the theoretical framework of sensorimotor integration (Bland and Oddie, Behav Brain Res 127:119-136, 2001). To investigate further the power of theta observed at the termination of type 1 motor activity, a runway task was devised in which rats ran back and forth between two ends of a linear track, one of which was always rewarded and the other never rewarded. Theta power decreased sharply 240 ms before movement ended at the rewarded end, but not at the unrewarded end of the track. These data extend the current scope of theory in demonstrating that hippocampal theta activity can end abruptly 200-400 ms prior to the end of type 1 motor movement when approaching the end of a motor sequence.

Methods: Evoked (P3) and induced ERD/ERS changes were studied in six subjects with drug-resistant epilepsy. Depth EEG activity from the mesiotemporal limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus) was analyzed. We used an averaging of raw data to obtain ERPs, and an averaging of the amplitude/power envelope (complex demodulation) in five frequency bands: theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma to obtain ERD/ERS. The P3 component of ERP and ERD/ERS in response to target and nontarget stimuli were evaluated. Results: Even though both P3 and ERD/ERS phenomena were observed in all of the investigated mesiotemporal regions, the most pronounced findings were revealed in the hippocampus. A P3 component of ERP was repeatedly observed in the hippocampus after target stimuli. Significant changes in the oscillatory hippocampal activity were found: ERD in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 frequency bands. Evident, near-significant changes were observed throughout the hippocampus in the theta band. No apparent ERD/ERS changes in the beta or in the gamma frequency band were seen in our intracerebral data. The distribution of the P3 and ERD/ERS maxima differed slightly in adjacent contacts, but occurred at the same time. Conclusions: The cognitive processing of visual information is simultaneously accompanied by several electrophysiological phenomena. In addition to ERPs, apparent changes in oscillatory activity were detected in the intracerebral recordings from mesiotemporal limbic structures. Timing of both neuronal processes seems to be simultaneous, but differing spatial distribution could reflect the involvement of different networks.

Gamma and beta neural activity evoked during a sensory gating paradigm: Effects of auditory, somatosensory and cross-modal stimulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; electrophysiology; event-related potentials; event-related oscillations; perception; stimulus salience	ORIENTING RESPONSE; BAND ACTIVITY; MIDDLE-LATENCY; N1 WAVE; PROCESSING RESOURCES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; FRONTAL COMPONENTS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Stimulus-driven salience is determined involuntarily, and by the physical properties of a stimulus. It has recently been theorized that neural coding of this variable involves oscillatory activity within cortical neuron populations at beta frequencies. This was tested here through experimental manipulation of inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Methods: Non-invasive neurophysiological measures of event-related gamma (30-50 Hz) and beta (12-20 Hz) activity were estimated from scalp-recorded evoked potentials. Stimuli were presented in a standard "paired-stimulus" sensory gating paradigm, where the S1 (conditioning) stimulus was conceptualized as long-ISI, or "high salience", and the S2 (test) stimulus as short-ISI, or "low salience". Three separate studies were conducted: auditory stimuli only (N = 20 participants), somatosensory stimuli only (N = 20), and a cross-modal study for which auditory and somatosensory stimuli were mixed (N = 40). Results: Early (20-150 ms) stimulus-evoked beta activity was more sensitive to ISI than temporally-overlapping gamma-band activity, and this effect was seen in both auditory and somatosensory studies. In the cross-modal study, beta activity was significantly modulated by the similarity (or dissimilarity) of stimuli separated by a short ISI (0.5 s); a significant cross-modal gating effect was nevertheless detected. Conclusions: With regard to the early sensory-evoked response recorded from the scalp, the interval between identical stimuli especially modulates beta oscillatory activity. Significance: This is consistent with developing theories regarding the different roles of tempo rally-overlapping oscillatory activity within cortical neuron populations at gamma and beta frequencies, particularly the claim that the latter is related to stimulus-driven salience.

It is postulated that, in depressed patients, sleep propensity during wakefulness does not rise to the level attained by nondepressed subjects, resulting in altered sleep structure or changes in the electroencephalogram during sleep. We aimed to test this hypothesis by assessing topographic changes in the sleep electroencephalogram associated with depression. Design: Cross-sectional clinical study. Setting: Mental Health Clinical Research Center. Participants: Sixteen unmedicated depressed outpatients (mean age: 41.2 years) and 16 pair-matched healthy controls (mean age: 41.1 years). Interventions: None. Measurements: Baseline sleep electroencephalogram recordings were obtained from a central referential electrode and from 3 bipolar derivations (frontocentral, centroparietal, parietooccipital) along the anteroposterior axis. Results: Symptoms of depression at the time of sleep recordings were moderate (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression range: 16-31). No differences between patients and controls were found in sleep variables and all-night electroencephalogram spectra in non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep. The ultradian modulation of slowwave activity (power within 0.75-4.5 Hz), as well as the exponential decline of slow-wave activity, during sleep did not differ between the groups. The statistical analyses of electroencephalogram power gradients between adjacent derivations revealed no Group x Derivation interactions. An anterior dominance in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep power was present in the 0.75- to 2-Hz range, which diminished throughout the night. Conclusions: These findings in moderately depressed patients do not support the existence of an S-deficiency during sleep. Because the build up of sleep propensity during waking can be dissociated from its decline, future studies need to investigate the waking electroencephalogram spectra in depression.

Studies from our laboratory have shown that good performers show a larger upper alpha ERD (interpreted in terms of larger cortical activation) than bad performers. In contrast, other researchers found evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis, which states that more intelligent subjects exhibit a smaller extent of cortical activation, which is assumed to be reflected by a smaller upper alpha ERD. Here we address the question whether these divergent results may be due to differences in general task difficulty. Using a modified version of the RAVEN, individually divided into easy and difficult tasks, a group of average and a group of highly intelligent subjects (IQ- and IQ+) have been investigated. While in the theta frequency IQ+ subjects generally exhibited a significantly stronger activation, we found a significant interaction of task difficulty and IQ group in the upper alpha band, indicating both, a weaker activation for the high IQ group during the easy tasks, and a significant increase from easy to difficult tasks for IQ+ only.

J	Klimesch, W; Hanslmayr, S; Sauseng, P; Gruber, WR				Klimesch, W; Hanslmayr, S; Sauseng, P; Gruber, WR			Distinguishing the evoked response from phase reset: A comment to Makinen et al.	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MEMORY PERFORMANCE; EEG-ALPHA; AMPLITUDE; LOCKING	Makinen et al. [Makinen, V., Tiitinen, H., May, P., 2005. Auditory event-related responses are generated independently of ongoing brain activity. Neuroimage 24, 961 -968] suggest the use of amplitude variance to distinguish the evoked response from phase reset. Because their data do not exhibit a drop in amplitude variance, they conclude that ERPs are generated by 'processes separate from and additive to ongoing brain activity.' We argue that this conclusion is premature because of unrealistic assumptions about the processes underlying an event-related modulation of oscillations. A realistic phase reset model has to consider at least two parameters, degree of phase reset (or 'phase concentration') and amplitude change (event-related increase or decrease in amplitude). With simulated data, we show that a variable increase in amplitude size increases amplitude variance and masks the influence of a phase reset. On the other hand, an event-related decrease in amplitude without a phase reset leads to a sharp drop in variance. Furthermore, simulation of a frequency-specific phase reset shows a drop in variance that may be too small to be detected empirically. Thus we conclude that amplitude variance is not capable of distinguishing the evoked response from phase reset. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Andrzejak, RG; Ledberg, A; Deco, G				Andrzejak, RG; Ledberg, A; Deco, G			Detecting event-related time-dependent directional couplings	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION; SERIES; INTERDEPENDENCE; PREDICTION; EEG	Nonlinear interdependence measures can be used to detect directional couplings between stationary dynamical systems from a pair of signals measured from them. For many dynamics, however, intermittent directional couplings arise in causal relation to distinct events on timescales that are often too short to be resolved by nonlinear interdependence measures. On the other hand, in many experimental settings signals are measured for multiple instances of such events. We demonstrate how these multiple realizations can be exploited to reliably detect event-related time-dependent directional couplings. For this purpose, we propose the general concept of time-resolved causal statistics derived from embeddings across multiple realizations of time-dependent dynamics. Surrogates constructed by permuting the order of realizations can be used to test specified null hypotheses. We adapt a conventional nonlinear interdependence measure to serve as a time-resolved causal statistic and apply it to exemplary coupled Lorenz dynamics. This approach allows detecting event-related time-dependent directional couplings based on only a few tens of realizations. Changes of the coupling direction can be detected within one oscillation of the dynamics. Beyond this particular application, any metric bivariate or univariate measure can be adapted to serve as time-resolved causal statistics to characterize various aspects of event-related time-dependent dynamics.

BOUNDARIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS: NEUROBIOLOGY AND NEUROPATHOLOGY	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review	8th Conference of the Association-for-the-Scientific-Study-of-Consciousness	JUN 26-28, 2004	Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, BELGIUM	Assoc Sci Study Consciousness	Univ Antwerp		CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; BACKGROUND EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; HZ	For practical clinical purposes, as well as because of their deep philosophical implications, it becomes increasingly important to be aware of contemporary studies of the brain mechanisms that generate subjective experiences. Current research has progressed to the point where plausible theoretical proposals can be made about the neurophysiological and neurochemical processes which mediate perception and sustain subjective awareness. An adequate theory of consciousness must describe how information about the environment is encoded by the exogenous system, how memories are stored in the endogenous system and released appropriately for the present circumstances, how the exogenous and endogenous systems interact to produce perception, and explain how consciousness arises from that interaction. Evidence assembled from a variety of neuroscience areas, together with the invariant reversible electrophysiological changes observed with loss and return of consciousness in anesthesia as well as distinctive quantitative elect roencephalographic profiles of various psychiatric disorders, provides an empirical foundation for this theory of consciousness. This evidence suggests the need for a paradigm shift to explain how the brain accomplishes the transformation from synchronous and distributed neuronal discharges to seamless global subjective awareness. This chapter undertakes to provide a detailed description and explanation of these complex processes by experimental evidence marshaled from a wide variety of sources.

Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is the expression of rhythmic arousability during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. CAP parameters, arousals and conventional sleep measures were studied in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy. Patients and methods: Data were collected from all-night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) on the intervening day of 25 drug-naive patients (10 males and 15 females; mean age: 34 16 years) after adaptation and exclusion of other sleep disorders. A group of 25 age- and gender-matched normal sleepers were selected as controls. Each PSG recording was subdivided into sleep cycles. Analysis of CAP included classification of A phases into subtypes A1, A2, and A3. Results: There was an increase in sleep period time mainly due to an increased wake time after sleep onset. REM latency was sharply reduced. The percentage of NREM sleep was slightly reduced and the balance between light sleep (S1 + S2) and deep sleep (S3 + S4) showed a curtailment of the former, while deep sleep was slightly increased. Excluding sleep cycles with sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs), the duration of ordered sleep cycles was not different between narcoleptics and controls. The two groups showed similar values of arousal index, while CAP time, CAP rate, number of CAP cycles and of phase A subtypes (in particular subtypes All were significantly reduced in narcoleptic patients. Conclusions: The reduced periods of CAP in narcoleptic NREM sleep could be the electroencephalographic (EEG) expression of a generally reduced arousability or an increased strength of sleep-promoting forces in the balance between sleep and arousal systems. This can explain some of the clinical correlates of the disorder, i.e. excessive sleepiness, short sleep latency and impaired attentive performances, even without any sign of arousal-induced sleep fragmentation.

Wakefulness-sleep cycle and hypothalamo-pituitary system of young rat pups on the background of photostimulation	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN; FROG	Effects of multiple photostimulations (PS) on behavioral reactions of the 30-day old rats were studied in the "open field" test, on the dynamics of the time EEG parameters of the wakefulness-sleep cycle, and on morpho-functional characteristics of the hypothalamo-pituitary neuroendocrine system. It has been revealed that PS promotes the gradual inhibition of the locomotor activity and exploratory behavior (p < 0.05) and an enhancement of autonomic reactions (p < 0.05) as well as an initial increase of intensity of orientation reactions with a subsequent decrease of their number (in connection with adaptation to a light stimulus), A comparative analysis of time parameters of the wakefulness-sleep cycle (WSC) shows a decrease of the part of wakefulness, the slow-wave and rapid-wave sleep phases with a simultaneous increase of the cataleptic stage and the sleep stage transient to the rapid-wave stage, as well as of the number of microactivations appearing on the sleep background at once after the several first PS. By the 4-5th photostimulations the CWS parameters on the whole are restored, except for the cataleptic stage, whose value remains statistically significantly high. The obtained data indicate the initial total CNS excitation and a decrease of the CWS stability. This conclusion is confirmed by the data of analysis of spectral characteristics of electrograms of cortical, hippocampal, hypothalamic brain parts and of caudate nucleus, which revealed only a brief small increase of delta-waves in the slow-wave sleep phase, but a statistically significant long decrease of power of the EEG delta- and theta-oscillations. with a simultaneous power increase of alpha-components in the rapid-wave sleep. The quantitative parameters of changes of the morpho-functional state of neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei indicate the stress effect of this performed stimulation. The aspects of interaction of the hypothalamic-cortical and thalamo-cortical levels of the CWS integration on the background of chronic stress are discussed.

So far, this question has only been addressed for early ERP components. Late ERP components, however, are generally thought to represent superimposed activities of several anatomically distinct brain areas. Thus, the question of which mechanism underlies the genesis of late ERP components cannot be easily answered based on scalp recordings. In contrast, two well-investigated late ERP components recorded invasively from within the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) in epilepsy patients, the so-called MTL-P300 and the anterior MTL-N400 (AMTL-N400), are based on single source activity. Hence, we investigated whether the MTL-P300 and the AMTL-N400 are based on an event-related activity increase, a phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity or both. ERPs were recorded from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex in subjects performing a visual oddball paradigm and a visual word recognition paradigm. With wavelet techniques, stimulus-related phase-locking and power changes were analyzed in a frequency range covering 2 to 48 Hz. We found that the MTL-P300 is accompanied by both phase reset and power increase P300 and that both effects overlap partly in time. In contrast, the AMTL-N400 is initially associated with phase locking without power increase and only later during the course of the out AMTL-N400 we observed an additional power increase. In conclusion, both aspects, event-related activation of neural assemblies and phase resetting of ongoing activity seem to be involved in the generation of late ERP components as recorded in cognitive tasks. Therefore, separate analysis of event-related power and phase-locking changes might reveal specific related insights into the mechanisms underlying different cognitive functions.

The anatomo-functional organization of partial drug-resistant epilepsies is the subject of much current research aiming at better understanding these pathologies and improving their treatment. The work carried out by our team on the study of intracerebral recording falls within this category of research. The objectives are to identify the neural networks involved in the generation of paroxysmal activity and to understand their spatio-temporal dynamics, in order to be able in the long term to propose targeted therapeutic approaches likely to "control" these networks. State of art. The traditional concept of epileptic "focus" must nowadays be replaced by a more complex model taking into account potential interactions within the neural networks involved in the seizure. Indeed, during partial seizures, involved cerebral structures are the site of characteristic oscillations which may be synchronized or on the contrary transiently desynchronized. These epileptic rhythms may disturb the physiological rhythms underlying normal cognitive processes; these cognitive processes may thus be impaired in partial epilepsy, even those remote from the site of origin of the discharge. In this article we describe a model of organization of human partial seizures, through characterization of the relationships ("synchrony") between intracerebral signals recorded in the involved structures. We propose that seizures are generated in an initial network of highly epileptogenic brain structures (epileptogenic zone network, EZN) whose activity is synchronized; this activity is then transiently desynchronized with the appearance of fast oscillations. During a second ictal phase, other cortical and subcortical structures are the seat of slower rhythmic modifications that are synchronized (propagation network, PN). The emergence of a particular clinical semiology in the course of the seizure depends on these phenomena which can in certain cases "mimic" a normal cerebral process or on the contrary provoke a major rupture in normal cerebral functioning. Conclusions. These studies contribute to improvement in our knowledge of the neural networks involved in partial epilepsies. In the future, this type of research may contribute to the development of specific treatments that target certain pathophysiological mechanisms involved in seizure generation.

Here, we assessed the contribution of alpha2GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors to the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep and waking oscillatory patterns by combining pharmacological and genetic tools. The effects of diazepam on the electroencephalogram were compared between alpha(2)(H101R) knock-in mice in which the alpha2GABA(A) receptor was rendered diazepam-insensitive, and their wild-type controls. The suppression of delta activity typically induced by diazepam in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly stronger in wild-type control mice than in alpha(2)(H101R) mice. Moreover, electroencephalogram frequency activity above 16-18 Hz was enhanced in wild-type mice both in non-REM sleep and waking. This effect was absent in alpha(2)(H101R) mice. Theta activity was enhanced after diazepam both in REM sleep and in waking in wild-type mice. In alpha(2)(H101R) mice, this effect was markedly reduced in REM sleep whereas it persisted in waking. These findings suggest that alpha(2)GABA(A) receptors, which are expressed in hypothalamic and pontine nuclei and in the hippocampus, are localized in distinct neural circuits relevant for the modulation of rhythmic brain activities by benzodiazepines.

In particular, the distributed coherent electrical properties of central neuronal ensembles are considered to be a promising avenue of inquiry concerning global brain functions. The intrinsic oscillatory properties of neurons (Llinas, R. (1988) The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: Insights into central nervous system function. Science, 242: 1654-1664), supported by a large variety of voltage-gated ionic conductances are recognized to be the central elements in the generation of the temporal binding required for cognition. Research in neuroscience further indicates that oscillatory activity in the gamma band (25-50 Hz) can be correlated with both sensory acquisition and premotor planning, which are non-continuous functions in the time domain. From this perspective, gammaband activity is viewed as serving a broad temporal binding function, where single-cell oscillators and the conduction time of the intervening pathways support large multicellular thalamo-cortical resonance that is closely linked with cognition and subjective experience. Our working hypothesis is that although dedicated units achieve sensory processing, the cognitive binding process is a common mechanism across modalities. Moreover, it is proposed that such time-dependent binding when altered, will result in modifications of the sensory motor integration that will affect and impair cognition and conscious perception.

SWDs were recently shown to initiate at the perioral area of the SmI and spread over the cortex and thalamus within a few milliseconds [J. Neurosci. 22 (2002) 1480]. It was hypothesized that functional deactivation of the SmI might reduce the appearance of SWDs. This was tested using unilateral microinjections (1 mul) of 2% lidocaine into the SmI in 13 WAG/Rij rats. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded in free moving animals from four cortical sites after lidocaine and control (saline) injections. Lidocaine effectively diminished the power of the ECoG spectra mostly in the area surrounding the injection site. Deactivation of the perioral region of the SmI reduced the incidence of SWDs at the entire cortex in both hemispheres. The number of SWDs gradually reached control level at the end of the second hour after injections of lidocaine. These data show that proper functioning of SmI is important for the occurrence of SWDs, supporting the idea that absence seizures might have a focal cortical origin. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Treatment with dopaminergic drugs reduces the background level of beta frequency band synchronization in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but has not been shown to increase the proportion of beta activity that is suppressed before voluntary movement in PD. We assessed changes in the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band of local field potential signals from the region of the STN in 14 patients with PD as they performed self-paced movements of a joystick before and after levodopa administration. The dopamine precursor, levodopa, increased the duration and magnitude of the premovement beta ERD, but did not alter postmovement synchronization in the beta band. Both the latency and magnitude of the beta ERD inversely correlated with the degree of motor impairment. These findings suggest that the beta ERD recorded in the STN area reflects motor-preparative processes that are at least partly dependent on dopaminergic activity within the basal ganglia.

Between February 1990 and June 2002, 51 children with either unilateral PMG or closed-lip SCHZ were selected through neuroradiological analysis for investigation at our service. We evaluated the frequency of epilepsy, electroclinical features and evolution. The mean time of follow-up was 7 years (range 1-12 years). All patients underwent neurological examination, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, serial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and neuropsychological assessment. Thirty-six of the 51 patients had unilateral PMG. All patients had hemiparesis with mild spasticity. Mental retardation was mild in 20 and moderate in 14. In two patients IQ was normal. Partial motor seizures were recorded in 28 patients, with secondary generalization in 20. The median age at onset of seizures was 2 years (range 4 months-7 years). Interictal EEGs showed unilateral spikes in all patients. In 21 patients epilepsy worsened between the ages of 4 and 8 (mean 5.6 years) with frequent atonic seizures, atypical absences, epileptic negative myoclonus and gait difficulties. EEGs showed continuous spike-wave activity or bilateral high-frequency spike discharges during slow-wave sleep. Frequent relapses of atonic and myoclonic seizures were seen in nine patients. At present, 16 patients are seizure-free. Fifteen patients with unilateral SCHZ were included in the study. Focal motor seizures were registered in seven cases, in three of them with secondary generalization. The median age at onset of epilepsy was 2.5 years (range 1-4 years). Interictal EEGs showed unilateral spikes in these seven cases. All patients except one presented mild spastic hemiparesis. Mental retardation was mild in ten children, moderate in two and IQ was normal in three. Although the underlying mechanisms leading to PMG and SCHZ are probably similar, the electroclinical phenomenon of secondary bilateral synchrony with frequent negative myoclonus was not present in our cases with unilateral closed-lip SCHZ.

NAPOLEON CYBULSKI - POLISH PIONEER IN DEVELOPING OF THE DEVICE FOR MEASURING BLOOD FLOW VELOCITY	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						photohemotachometer; linear blood flow; adrenaline; histamine; Pitot's cannulas		Napoleon Cybulski (1854-1919) was the most prominent Polish physiologist who chaired the Department of Physiology at the Faculty of Medicine of Jagiellonian University between 1885 and 1919. One of his greatest achievements was the construction of a device for precise measurements of blood movement in the vessels - the photohemotachometer, which provided a better insight into the physiology and pathophysiology of the circulatory system. In the field of endocrinology Cybulski together with Szymonowicz, found out that adrenal extracts contain biologically active substances that elevate blood pressure. He was also a constructor of an extremely clever microcalorimeter to measure the quantity of heat produced during isolated muscle contraction. He applied, for the first time, condensator discharges to stimulate nerves and analyzed changes in the excitability of the muscles. Cybulski proved that the cause of the electrical excitability of tissue depends on the electrical energy and the time of its duration. Together with Beck, he performed the experiments on the sensory centers in the central nervous system by means of the observations of the electrical evoked potentials. They discovered the continuous electrical oscillations in the brain - the brain waves and recorded the negative electrical potentials in certain brain areas induced by sensory impulses coming from the periphery. Using this technique Beck and Cybulski localized various centers in the brain of dogs and Macaccus rhesus monkeys. The names of Beck and Cybulski were quoted in many publications on neurophysiology and electroencephalography. The present paper describes Napoleon Cybulski as a constructer of an original instrument for studying the movement of blood under various experimental conditions an emphasizes the contribution of this invention to the development of physiology.

For semantic memory performance we have found that resting or reference power is positively associated with performance, whereas during actual processing of the task, small power - reflected by a large extent of event-related desynchronization (ERD) - is related to good performance. We also have shown that the induction of large alpha reference power by neurofeedback training or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at individual alpha frequency mimicked exactly the situation which is typical for good memory performance under normal situations: increased alpha reference power is associated with large ERD and good performance. Recent studies have demonstrated that this relationship holds true only for memory and not perceptual tasks that require the identification of simple visual stimuli under difficult conditions. In contrast to good memory performance, good perceptual performance is related to small pre-stimulus alpha power and a small ERD. We interpret this finding in terms of cortical inhibition vs. activation preceding task performance by assuming that large rhythmic alpha activity reflects inhibition. We assume that small reference alpha enhances perceptual performance because the cortex is activated and prepared to process the stimulus, whereas memory performance is enhanced if the cortex is deactivated before a task is performed because in typical memory tasks selective processing can start only after the to-be-remembered item or cue is presented. We also suggest that conflicting results about alpha ERD and the neural efficiency hypothesis (which assumes that highly intelligent exhibit a small ERD) can also be interpreted in terms of inhibition. Only if an intelligence test actually requires the activation of (semantic) memory, a large (because task specific) ERD can be observed. If other processing systems are required, the semantic memory system may even become suppressed, which is reflected by alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) or at least a largely decreased ERD.

SALUD MENTAL			Portuguese	Article						vagus nerve; penicillin; epilepsy; EEG; spectral analysis	SOLITARY TRACT; SEIZURES; NUCLEUS; SLEEP; PROJECTIONS; SPIKES; GABA	Antecedents Vagus nerve electric stimulation (VNS) is an anticonvulsant therapy used in patients with refractory epilepsy. Several methods are used to find VNSs action mechanisms. These techniques employ experimental models of epilepsy, such as topic applications into cerebral cortex or injections of convulsive substances by different systemic ways, both in chronic and acute experiments. However, only a few studies have related the VNS and the epilepsy of the temporal lobe. When limbic seizures are produced in the amygdaloid complex, it is known that all their own sub-nuclei activate. However, during the spread or propagation of epileptiform activity, all nuclei and sites related with amygdala's complex participate are involved. There are many reports about the relationship between development and spread topics. However, it remains unclear the effect of VNS and its relation with interictal spike's frequency, seizure epileptic behavioral stages on Racine's scale, and the number of crisis in an induced epileptic focus into temporal lobe amygdala. Aim of the study The propose is to study how the VNS affects the development and spread of the epileptiform spike in the penicillin focus and behavioral stages induced by a topical administration of penicillin in the temporal lobe of the amygdala. Additionally we will observe the changes induced by VNS on theta rhythm. Material and methods Male Wistar rats were used. Rats were implanted with a guide cannula glued to a bipolar electrode in the amygdala of the temporal lobe; an electrode to the dorsal hippocampus; two epidural nails in the prefrontal cortex (for cortical record); two flexible wires in the lateral part of the neck muscles for electromyogram record, and one hook-form electrode in the left vagus nerve corresponding exactly to the larynx's level. At the end of the post-surgery recovery period (five days), the animals were divided in two groups (n = 5). After one hour of recording, group I animals were administrated penicillin G sodic (Pn) in the amygdala (solution with 50 international units in 1 microliter as final volume, using a saline solution of 0.9% sodium chloride as vehicle). After one hour of the penicillin injection, the vagus nerve electrical stimulation was performed (1.2 to 3.0 mA, square pulses of 0.5 ms duration, and 30 Hz frequency) during 30 seconds with intervals of 15 minutes between each stimulation only during two hours of recording (eight VNS's in total). The same manipulation was followed with group II, except that in this case the first VNS was performed just before the penicillin injection. Cerebral electric activity was recorded and saved for post off-line frequency analysis, during a six-hour period in both groups. Results We compared electrographic parameters provoked by a single Pn injection vs Pn + VNS on each group of animals and considering each rat as its own control. Vagus nerve stimulation effects on the latency and duration of the epileptiform spikes. Group I showed a 40% decrease on its latency, and a 15% duration increase when compared with its own controls. Group II showed a 37% increase on latency, and a 40% decrease on duration. Vagus nerve stimulation effects over seizure stage and seizure number. Group I developed stages III and IV on Racine's scale and higher number of seizures. Group II remained on seizure stages I and IT presenting a smaller number of seizure compared to its own control records. Vagus nerve stimulation effects on frequency, of spikes. Group I showed a significant increase in frequency (p < 0.05), which was sustained during a long recording time. In contrast, Group II showed a decrease. Spectral analyses of cerebral electric activity. The electroencephalogram is a tool used to investigate how the vagus nerve stimulation affects the epileptic phenomenon. In this case, the spectral analysis of the electric activity of amygdala and cerebral cortex showed a high activity between 1 and 4 Hz. This high voltage prevailed after penicillin injection and during all recording time. Hippocampus showed theta rhythm periods. The VNS caused cortical desynchronization, but it was not associated with hippocampal theta rhythm elicitation. There is a possibility that VNS induced an increased susceptibility on rats to the convulsive effects of Pn. This was manifested in significantly. shorter latencies to seizures, and significantly higher incidence, and duration of seizure. Conclusion When performed before the Pn injection, the vagus nerve stimulation increased the latency to the appearance of spikes, as well as the frequency, but the number of seizures decreased instead. Even, only early stages, such as I and II of Racine's scale, were seen. These data suggest that VNS softened epileptic synchronization. The frequency of the spikes, the development of stages IV and V, and also the number of seizures were dalayed. The VNS performed one hour after penicillin injection produced progressive epileptiform spike spread and changes in the behavioral seizure pattern. Frequency of spikes increased as well as seizures severity (stage III and I-V). The vagus nerve stimulation did not only reduce epileptiform activity, but also induced neuronal recruiting, which is manifested as an enhancement in seizure expression. The VNS elicited dual effects related with tissue-sensibility. This effect confirms anatomic and physiological relations among vagal afferents, amygdaloid complex and cerebral cortex due to thalamic pathways and its relations with vagus nerve, amygdaloid complex and pyramidal cells. As 2 matter of fact, the thalamus is the most important structure related with cerebral rhythms. For this reason we hypothesized that the thalamus plays a key role in the results showed here.

Different aspects of the gamma activity (20-80 Hz) have been suggested as correlates of attention, arousal and sensory binding. It is clear that allention has a modality selective influence, while arousal has a more general effect on the sensory systems. We used an experimental conditioning paradigm to separate these differential effects of attention and arousal on spontaneous neocortical gamma activity. We recorded field potentials with epidural electrodes placed above the auditory cortical areas of cats. The animals performed a simple instrumental alimentary conditioning task with different modality (visual and auditory) conditioned stimuli. When they attended to the auditory conditioned stimulus, both frequency and power increase of spontaneous gamma activity were detected. However when they attended visual, we found no power increase of gamma activity recorded above auditory areas, while the frequency increase was the same as in the "attend auditory" condition. We conclude that the power modulation of gamma activity is modality specific and thus can be attributed to selective attention, whereas the frequency modulation of gamma activity shows no modality specificity, it is influenced by the arousal level.

This activity consists of 3 main components: the classic occipital a rhythm, the Rolandic mu rhythm, and the so-called third rhythm. In recent years, the long-held belief that a rhythms are strongly influenced by the thalamus has been confirmed in several animal models and, in humans, is well supported by numerous noninvasive imaging studies. Of specific importance is the emergence of 2 key cellular thalamic mechanisms, which come together to generate locally synchronized a activity. First, a novel form of rhythmic burst firing, termed high-threshold (HT) bursting, which occurs in a specialized subset of thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and second, the interconnection of this subset via gap junctions (GJs). Because repetitive HT bursting in TC neurons occurs in the range of 2 to 13 Hz, with the precise frequency increasing with increasing depolarization, the same cellular components that underlie thalamic a rhythms can also lead to theta (2-7 Hz) rhythms when the TC neuron population is less depolarized. As such, this scenario can explain both the deceleration of a rhythms that takes place during early sleep and the chronic slowing that characterizes a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Additionally, it had been discussed if spindles might be related to a more general learning or cognitive ability. In the present multicentre study we examined the relationship of automatically detected slow (< 13 Hz) and fast (> 13 Hz) stage 2 sleep spindles with: (i) the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (testing 'general cognitive ability'); as well as (ii) the Wechsler Memory scale-revised (evaluating memory in various subdomains). Forty-eight healthy subjects slept three times (separated by 1 week) for a whole night in a sleep laboratory with complete polysomnographic montage. Whereas the first night only served adaptation and screening purposes, the two remaining nights were preceded either by an implicit mirror-tracing or an explicit word-pair association learning or (corresponding) control task. Robust relationships of slow and fast sleep spindles with both cognitive as well as memory abilities were found irrespectively of whether learning occurred before sleep. Based on the present findings we suggest that besides being involved in shaping neuronal networks after learning, sleep spindles do reflect important aspects of efficient cortical-subcortical connectivity, and are thereby linked to cognitive- and memory-related abilities alike.

Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that GABAergic medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178degrees) or the peak (330degrees) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.

In this exploratory MEG study in normal young adults, we tested whether very simple short-term memory (STM) demands induce visible changes in amplitude and latency of surface a rhythms. Two delayed response tasks were used. In the STM condition, a simple cue stimulus (one bit) was memorized along a brief delay period (3.5-5.5 s). In the control (no short-term memory; NSTM) condition, the cue stimulus remained available along the delay period. To make extremely simple the tasks, the explicit demand was visuospatial but the retention could be also based on phonological and somatomotor coding. Compared to the control condition, the amplitude of the alpha 1 (6-8 Hz) ERD decreased in the left hemisphere, whereas the amplitude of the alpha 2 (8-10 Hz) and alpha 3 (10-12 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) increased in right and left parietal areas, respectively. Furthermore, the latency of the alpha ERD peak was slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) later in STM compared to control condition. In conclusion, whole-head MEG technology and very simple STM demands revealed significant changes of human neuromagnetic a rhythms in normal young adults. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Materials and methods: Averaged frequency spectra (0.5-30 Hz) of the electroencephalogram were studied in freely moving rats with carbon electrodes implanted into the somatosensory cortex. The rats were repeatedly (3 days, 30 min day(-1)) exposed to low-intensity (congruent to0.3 mW cm(-2)) microwaves (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration), amplitude modulated (square-wave) at extremely low frequency (4 Hz). Results: The exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves alone significantly enhanced the fast electroencephalographic rhythms (18-30 Hz). This effect was observed neither in subsequent sham-exposure experiment nor in radiation-naive animals. In the microwave-exposed rats, scopolamine (0.1 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously) did not cause a slowing in the electroencephalogram that was shown in non-exposed rats. A similarity between the scopolamine-induced electroencephalogram effect in the microwave-exposed rats and that of physostigmine (enhancing the acetylcholine level in the brain) in radiation-naive animals was noted. This paradoxical phenomenon stimulates new experimentation for understanding its mechanism(s). Conclusions: The data obtained provide additional evidence that repeated low-level exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves can modify an activity of cholinergic system in the brain.

Chronic atypical absence seizures were verified in the AY-treated animals by the presence of spontaneous 5- to 6-Hz slow spike-wave discharges (SSWDs) in the neocortex. General behavioral activity, as measured by total movements (TM), movement time (MT), ambulatory movement time (AMT), time spent in center of arena (CT), jumps (JFP), and rotational behavior (TURNS), were continuously recorded under a 12-hour light:12-hour dark photocycle. The average SSWD duration in AY-treated rats varied daily, with two peaks occurring at approximately dark phase and light phase onset. Mice treated with AY exhibited significant increases in all behavioral measures during the light and dark phases, with the exception of light-phase CT, which did not differ from that of controls. Consequently, the daily rhythm of total behavioral activity (TM) exhibited a significantly higher mean oscillation (mesor) and amplitude without evidence of phase shift compared with the TM rhythm of controls. The occurrence of SSWD activity in the AY model appears to be subject to regulation by biological timing mechanisms and, furthermore, associated with motor hyperactivity that does not alter the timing of behavioral rhythmicity.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							COGNITIVE DYSMETRIA; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BAND ACTIVITY; BRAIN; MODEL; PSYCHOSIS; TASK; DYSFUNCTIONS; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION	Objective: There has been a convergence of models describing schizophrenia as a disconnection syndrome, with a focus on the temporal connectivity of neural activity. Synchronous gamma-band (40-Hz) activity has been implicated as a candidate mechanism for the binding of distributed neural activity. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate "gamma synchrony" in first-episode schizophrenia. Method: Forty medicated first-episode schizophrenia patients and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects participated in a conventional auditory oddball paradigm. Gamma synchrony, time-locked to target stimuli, was extracted from an ongoing EEG. The magnitude and latency of both early (gamma 1: -150 msec to 150 msec poststimulus) and late (gamma 2: 200 to 550 msec poststimulus) synchrony were analyzed with multiple analysis of variance. Results: First-episode schizophrenia patients showed a decreased magnitude and delayed latency for global gamma 1 synchrony in relation to healthy comparison subjects. By contrast, there were no group differences in gamma 2 synchrony. Conclusions: These findings suggest that first-episode schizophrenia patients have a global decrease and delay of temporal connectivity of neural activity in early sensory response to task-relevant stimuli. This is consistent with cognitive evidence of perceptual integration deficits in this disorder and raises the possibility that a breakdown in the early synchrony of distributed neural networks is a marker for the onset of schizophrenia.

J	Gonzalez-Hernandez, JA; Pita-Alcorta, C; Cedeno, IR				Gonzalez-Hernandez, JA; Pita-Alcorta, C; Cedeno, IR			From genes to brain oscillations: Is the visual pathway the epigenetic clue to schizophrenia?	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							CARD SORTING TEST; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; EEG; TASK; DYSFUNCTION; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCIES; ATTENTION	Molecular data and gene expression data and recently mitochondrial genes and possible epigenetic regulation by non-coding genes is revolutionizing our views on schizophrenia. Genes and epigenetic mechanisms are triggered by cell-cell interaction and by external stimuli. A number of recent clinical and molecular observations indicate that epigenetic factors may be operational in the origin of the illness. Based on the molecular insights, gene expression profiles and epigenetic regulation of gene, we went back to the neurophysiology (brain oscillations) and found a putative role of the visual experiences (i.e. visual stimuli) as epigenetic factor. The functional evidences provided here, establish a direct link between the striate and extrastriate unimodal visual cortex and the neurobiology of the schizophrenia. This result support the hypothesis that 'visual experience' has a potential role as epigenetic factor and contribute to trigger and/or to maintain the progression of the schizophrenia. In this case, candidate genes sensible for the visual 'insult' may be located within the visual cortex including associative areas, while the integrity of the visual pathway before reaching the primary visual cortex is preserved. The same effect can be perceived if target genes are localised within the visual pathway, which actually, is more sensitive for 'insult' during the early life than the cortex per se. If this process affects gene expression at these sites a stably sensory specific 'insult', i.e. distorted visual information, is entering the visual system and expanded to fronto-temporoparietal multimodal areas even from early maturation periods. The difference in the timing of postnatal neuroanatomical events between such areas and the primary visual cortex in humans (with the formers reaching the same development landmarks later in life than the latter) is 'optimal' to establish an abnormal 'cell-communication' mediated by the visual system that may further interfere with the local physiology. In this context the strategy to search target genes need to be rearrangement and redirected to visual-related genes. Otherwise, psychophysics studies combining functional neuroimage, and electrophysiology are strongly recommended, for the search of epigenetic clues that will allow to carrier gene association studies in schizophrenia.

Effect of noxious input on the primary motor (MI) cortex remains, however, poorly understood. To characterize this effect in more detail, we quantified the ongoing oscillatory communication between the MI cortex and hand muscles during selectively noxious laser stimulation. The subjects maintained an isometric contraction of finger muscles while receiving the laser stimuli to the dorsum of the hand. Tactile stimuli with well-known effects on the MI cortex reactivity served as control stimuli. Cortex-muscle coherence was computed between magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from the contralateral MI and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the hand muscles. Statistically significant coherence at similar to 20 Hz was found in 6 out of 7 subjects. The coherence increased phasically after both types of stimuli but significantly later after laser than tactile stimuli (mean SEM peak latencies 1.05 +/- 0.12 s vs. 0.58 +/- 0.06 s; P < 0.05), and the coherence increase lasted longer after laser than tactile stimuli (0.87 +/- 0.09 s vs. 0.50 +/- 0.06 s, P < 0.05). The observed coherence increase could be related to stabilization of the motor-cortex control after sensory input. Our findings add to the clinically interesting evidence about the cortical pain-motor system interaction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We predicted that the ligation should differentially affect these structures due to differences in blood supply. Methods: The SEPs between I and 3000 Hz were measured in the SI cortex with a multichannel electrode array before, during and after a 20 min bilateral ligation of the internal carotid arteries in the swine under a barbiturate anesthesia. Results: The ligation differentially affected the thalamic input and the cortical responses contained in the high-frequency signals (HFSs) between 400 and 2000 Hz. The amplitude of the thalamic input did not change, but the amplitudes of the cortical HFS postsynaptic to the thalamic inputs decreased immediately after start of ligation, recovering over the next 30-90 min. The latency showed a small, but significant increase for several minutes after the start of ligation for both the thalamic input and cortical responses. The ligation increased the latency and reduced the amplitude of the peak of the first cortical response in the wideband SEP corresponding to human N20. Conclusions: The HFS is useful for distinguishing selective effects of the temporary ligation on the subcortical and cortical structures of the somatosensory system. Since the porcine N20 starts after the presynaptic HFS, it was not useful in differentiating thalamic and cortical effects.

In the present magnetoencephalographic study we examined the hypothesis that the coherence of electromagnetic oscillatory activity within and across brain areas indicates neurophysiological processes linked to speech comprehension. Results: Amplitude-modulated (sinusoidal 41.5 Hz) auditory verbal and nonverbal stimuli served to drive steady-state oscillations in neural networks involved in speech comprehension. Stimuli were presented to 12 subjects in the following conditions ( a) an incomprehensible string of words, (b) the same string of words after being introduced as a comprehensible sentence by proper articulation, and ( c) nonverbal stimulations that included a 600-Hz tone, a scale, and a melody. Coherence, defined as correlated activation of magnetic steady state fields across brain areas and measured as simultaneous activation of current dipoles in source space (Minimum-Norm-Estimates), increased within left-temporal-posterior areas when the sound string was perceived as a comprehensible sentence. Intra-hemispheric coherence was larger within the left than the right hemisphere for the sentence ( condition ( b) relative to all other conditions), and tended to be larger within the right than the left hemisphere for nonverbal stimuli ( condition ( c), tone and melody relative to the other conditions), leading to a more pronounced hemispheric asymmetry for nonverbal than verbal material. Conclusions: We conclude that coherent neuronal network activity may index encoding of verbal information on the sentence level and can be used as a tool to investigate auditory speech comprehension.

We found that, under conditions of increased sleep need, i.e., at the end of the active period or after sleep deprivation (SD), NPAS2 allows for sleep to occur at times when mice are normally awake. Lack of npas2 affected electroencephalogram activity of thalamocortical origin; during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), activity in the spindle range (10-15 Hz) was reduced, and within the delta range (1-4 Hz), activity shifted toward faster frequencies. In addition, the increase in the cortical expression of the NPAS2 target gene period2 (pert) after SD was attenuated in npas2(-/-) mice. This implies that NPAS2 importantly contributes to the previously documented wake-dependent increase in cortical per2 expression. The data also revealed numerous sex differences in sleep; in females, sleep need accumulated at a slower rate, and REMS loss was not recovered after SD. In contrast, the rebound in NREMS time after SD was compromised only in npas2(-/-) males. We conclude that NPAS2 plays a role in sleep homeostasis, most likely at the level of the thalamus and cortex, where NPAS2 is abundantly expressed.

There are two levels of information processing in this neural network: the level of individual neurons and the level of the neural network. Similar to the state of brain, the state of chaotic neural network is defined. It is characterized by two types of memories (memory I and memory II) and correlation structure between the neurons. In normal (unperturbed) state, the neural network generates chaotic patterns of averaged neuronal activities (memory I) and patterns of oscillation amplitudes (memory II). In the presence of external stimulation, the activity patterns change, showing changes in both types of memory. As in experiments on stimulation of the brain, the neural network model shows synchronization of neuronal activities due to stimulus measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient. An increase in neural network asymmetty (increase of the neural network excitability) leads to the phenomenon similar to the epilepsy. Modeling of brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and dementia is performed by removing and weakening interneuron connections. In all cases, the chaotic neural network shows a decrease of the degree of chaos and changes in both types of memory similar to those observed in experiments with healthy human subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia.

Here we test the possibility of modifying ongoing activity associated with working memory by tDCS. The concept of working memory applies to a system that is capable of transiently storing and manipulating information, as an integral part of the human memory system. We applied anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current ( tDCS) stimulation ( 260 mu A) bilaterally at fronto-cortical electrode sites on the scalp over 15 min repeatedly ( 15 sec-on/15sec-off) as well as sham-tDCS while subjects performed a modified Sternberg task. Results: Reaction time linearly increased with increasing set size. The slope of this increase was closely comparable for real and sham stimulation indicating that our real stimulation did not effect time required for memory scanning. However, reaction time was slowed during both anodal and cathodal stimulation as compared to placebo ( p < 0.05) indicating that real stimulation hampered neuronal processing related to response selection and preparation. Conclusion: Intermittent tDCS over lateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task impairs central nervous processing related to response selection and preparation. We conclude that this decrease in performance by our protocol of intermittent stimulation results from an interference mainly with the temporal dynamics of cortical processing as indexed by event-related sustained and oscillatory EEG activity such as theta.

Antiepileptic effect of gap-junction blockers in a rat model of refractory focal cortical epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						epilepsy; seizure; gap junction; connexin; focal application	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VITRO; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; DRUG-DELIVERY; SEIZURES; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; DISEASE	Purpose: Epilepsy is the most common serious neurologic disease, and current treatments are ineffective for <= 30% of patients. Gap junctions have been implicated in seizure generation and propagation, and as such, may represent a novel therapeutic target but have been little investigated in vivo. We set out to assess the efficacy and tolerability of gap-junction blockers delivered to the seizure focus in a well-characterized model of refractory cortical epilepsy in rats. Methods: A chronic epilepsy focus was induced in the cortex of rats by using tetanus toxin, and subsequent studies were conducted in freely moving unanesthetized animals with frequent spontaneous seizures, as we previously described. Carbenoxolone, meclofenamic acid, and saline were applied directly to the seizure focus. EEG, electromyogram (EMG), and behavioral parameters were measured for >= 1 h before drug infusion and for >= 3 h afterward. No ill effects were observed. Results: An immediate and marked reduction in percentage of seizure time was seen in rats receiving carbenoxolone (baseline, 69.4%+/- 7.0% (SEM); maximum effect, 9.3% +/- 3.5%, p <= 0.001) and meclofenamic acid (baseline, 58.3% +/- 3.7%; maximum effect, 0.92% +/- 0.92%, p < 0.001). No effect was seen after saline infusion. Conclusions: Gap-junction blockers applied focally are effective at suppressing seizures and, as such, represent a potential new treatment for epilepsy. Development of focal treatment strategies is essential in this regard.

J	Villablanca, JR				Villablanca, JR			Counterpointing the functional role of the forebrain and of the brainstem in the control of the sleep-waking system	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Review						forebrain-brainstem interactions; functional anatomy; regulation; sleep-waking	VENTROLATERAL PREOPTIC NUCLEUS; PERMANENTLY ISOLATED FOREBRAIN; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CERVEAU-ISOLE; REM-SLEEP; RETICULAR-FORMATION; TRANSECTED CATS; THETA RHYTHM	This paper reviews the lifetime contributions of the author to the field of sleep-wakefulness (S-W), reinterprets results of the early studies, and suggests new conclusions and perspectives. Long-term cats with mesencephalic transection show behavioral/polygraphic rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), including the typical oculo-pupillary behavior, even when the section is performed in kittens prior to S-W maturation. REMS can be induced as a reflex. Typical non-rapid eye movement S (NREMS) is absent and full W/arousal is present only after a precollicular section. The isolated forebrain (IF) rostral to the transection exhibits all features of W/arousal and NREMS [with electroencephalographic (EEG) spindles and delta waves], arousal to olfactory stimuli, and including the appropriate oculo-pupillary behaviors. These features also mature normally after neonatal transection. REMS is absent from the IF. After deprivation there is NREMS pressure and rebound in the IF, but the decerebrate cat only shows pressure for REMS. Most IF reactions to pharmacologic agents are within expectations, except for the tolerance/withdrawal effects of long-term morphine use which are absent. In contrast, these effects are supported by the brainstem (i.e. seen in the decerebrate cat). In cats with ablation of the telencephalon, or diencephalic cats, delta waves are absent in the thalamus. EEG thalamic spindle waves are seen triggering S for only 4-5 days after ablation. Therefore, true NREMS is absent in chronic diencephalic cats although pre- and postsomniac behaviors persist. These animals are hyperactive and show a pronounced, permanent insomnia; however, a low dose of barbiturate triggers a dramatic REMS/atypical NREMS rebound. Cats without the thalamus (athalamic cats), initially show a dissociation between behavioral hyperactivity/insomnia and the neocortical EEG, which for 15-20 days exhibits only delta and slower oscillations. Fast, low-voltage W rhythms appear later on, first during REMS, but spindle waves and S postures are absent from the start, such that these cats also display only atypical NREMS. Athalamic cats also show barbiturate-sensitive insomnia. Cats with ablation of the frontal cortices or the caudate nuclei remain permanently hyperactive. They also show a mild, but significant hyposomnia, which is permanent in afrontal cats, but lasts for about a month in acaudates. The polygraphic/behavioral features of their S-W states remain normal. We conclude and propose that: (a) the control of the S-W system is highly complex and distributed, but is organized hierarchically in a well-defined rostro-caudal manner; the rostral-most or highest level (telencephalon), is the most functionally complex/adaptative and regulates the lower levels; the diencephalic/basal forebrain, or middle level, has a pivotal role in inducing switching between S and W and in coordinating the lowest (brainstem) and highest levels; (b) W can occur independently in both the forebrain and brainstem, but true NREMS- and REMS-generating mechanisms exist exclusively in the forebrain and brainstem, respectively; (c) forebrain and brainstem S-W processes can operate independently from each other and are preprogrammed at birth; this helps understanding normal and abnormal polygraphic/behavioral dissociations in humans and normal dissociations/splitting in aquatic mammals; (d) NREMS homeostasis is present in the IF, but only REMS pressure after deprivation persists in the decerebrate cat; (e) the thalamus engages in both NREMS and W; (f) insomnia in diencephalic cats is the result of an imbalance between antagonistic W- and S-promoting cellular groups in the ventral brain (normally modulated by the telencephalon); (g) the EEG waves, which are signature for each S-W state, appear to truly drive the concomitant behaviors, e.g. a hypothetical human IF could alternate between behavioral NREMS and W/arousal/awareness; (h) a role for REMS is to keep the individual sleeping at the end of the self-limiting NREMS periods. The need for accelerating research on telencephalic S-W processes and downstream control of the lower S-W system levels is emphasized.

DC shifts were elicited by changes in artificial ventilation, causing end-tidal CO2 variations within a 2-5% range. Hypercapnia was consistently associated with negative scalp DC shifts (average shift -284.4 muV/CO2%, range -216 to -324 muV/CO2%), whereas hypocapnia induced positive scalp DC shifts (average shift 307.8 muV/CO2%, range 234 to 342 muV/CO2%) in all electrodes referenced versus the nasium bone. The former condition markedly increased intracranial pressure (ICP), whereas the latter only slightly reduced ICP. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) resulted in a positive DC shift and drastically reduced subsequent DC responses to hypo-/hypercapnia. Thiopental and isoflurane also elicited a dose-dependent positive DC shift and, at higher doses, hypo-/hypercapnia responses displayed reverted polarity. As to the possible implication of neurons in the production of DC shifts, no polarity reversal was recorded between scalp, various intracortical layers, and deep brain structures. Moreover, the membrane potential of neurons and glia did not show either significant or systematic variations in association with the scalp-recorded CO2-dependent DC shifts. Pathological activities of neurons during spike-wave seizures produced DC shifts of significantly smaller amplitude than those generated by hyper-/hypocapnia. DC shifts were still elicited when neuronal circuits were silent during anesthesia-induced burst-suppression patterns. We suggest that potentials generated by the BBB are the major source of epicortical/cranial DC shifts recorded under conditions affecting brain pH and/or cerebral blood flow.

Chronic ethanol drinking reduces native T-type calcium current in the thalamus of nonhuman primates	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cynomolgus macaque; alcoholism; sleep; burst; in vitro	LATERAL GENICULATE NEURONS; ADMISSION PREDICTS RELAPSE; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; PRIMARY ALCOHOLISM; EEG SLEEP; VOLTAGE; RAT; CAT; CHANNELS; NUCLEUS	Background: Chronic ethanol use is known to disrupt normal sleep rhythms, but the cellular basis for this disruption is unknown. An important contributor to normal sleep patterns is a low-threshold calcium current mediated by T-type calcium channels. The T-type calcium current underlies burst responses in thalamic nuclei that are important to spindle propagation, and we recently observed that this current is sensitive to acute low doses of ethanol. Methods: We used a combination of current clamp and voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys that have chronically self-administered ethanol to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure may affect T-type currents. Results: Current clamp recordings from the LGN of ethanol naive macaques showed characteristic burst responses. However, recordings from the LGN in macaques that self-administered ethanol revealed a significant attenuation of bursts across a range of voltages (n = 5). Voltage clamp recordings from control LGN neurons (n = 16) and neurons (n = 29) from brain slices from chronically drinking macaques showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in T-type current kinetics or in the membrane resistance of the thalamic cells between the two cohorts. However, mean T-type current amplitude measured in the chronically drinking animals was reduced by 31% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure.

Linking behavioral data to phasic properties of field potential and unit recording data	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Theta Oscillations in the Brain	SEP, 2004	London, ENGLAND			EEG oscillations; region CA3; region CA1; spatial alternation; fornix; septum; theta phase precession; computational modeling	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SOURCE DENSITY ANALYSIS; FREELY-MOVING RATS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; SPATIAL NAVIGATION; ANESTHETIZED RATS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; WORKING-MEMORY; PLACE CELLS	The extensive physiological data on hippocampal theta rhythm provide an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses about the role of theta rhythm for hippocampal network function. Computational models based on these hypotheses help to link behavioral data with physiological measurements of different variables during theta rhythm. This paper reviews work on network models in which theta rhythm contributes to the following functions: (1) separating the dynamics of encoding and retrieval, (2) enhancing the context-de pendent retrieval of sequences, (3) buffering of novel information in entorhinal cortex (EC) for episodic encoding, and (4) timing interactions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus for memory-guided action selection. Modeling shows how these functional mechanisms are related to physiological data from the hippocampal formation, including (1) the phase relationships of synaptic currents during theta rhythm measured by current source density analysis of electroencephalographic data from region CA1 and dentate gyrus, (2) the timing of action potentials, including the theta phase precession of single place cells during running on a linear track, the context-dependent changes in theta phase precession across trials on each day, and the context-dependent firing properties of hippocampal neurons in spatial alternation (e.g.,''splitter cell''), (3) the cholinergic regulation of sustained activity in entorhinal cortical neurons, and (4) the phasic timing of prefrontal cortical neurons relative to hippocampal theta rhythm.

Auditory on- and off-responses of 12 healthy volunteers (average 17 years. old) were recorded from five locations (Fz, Cz, Pz, P3, and P4). The auditory stimuli of 80 dB SPL and 1000 ms duration were delivered at six different stimulation frequencies (f1-f6; 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz, respectively). In using individual alpha frequency (IAF) as individual anchor point, wide band alpha and three different alpha frequency sub-bands with a bandwidth of 2 Hz each were defined: lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha, and upper alpha. The Root Mean Square (RMS) values of the alpha frequency bands were computed for two time periods: +/-3 sd around the mean peak latency of the auditory on-responses (t1-on and t2-on) and a time window of the same length of the auditory off-responses (t1-off and t2-off). The alpha RMS values of both on- and off responses showed significant differences between t1 and t2 periods on wide band, lower-1 and lower-2 alpha bands, especially at 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2, and 3 kHz stimulation frequencies in all recording places. Amplitudes in anterior locations (Fz, Cz) were higher than the others. These observations may provide a preliminary but nonetheless important understanding of how information may be processed in the brain.

Methods: Achromatic or isoluminant chromatic sinusoidal grating stimuli were presented to each hemifield at a rate of 8 reversals/s to record steady-state visual-evoked potentials (S-VEPs) in 10 healthy subjects. Four recording electrodes were placed at O1, O2, P3 and P4, referred to an electrode at Cz. A total of 50 responses of 1 s epoch were averaged, and were subjected to discrete fast Fourier transforms to yield the amplitude and phase of the 8 Hz component. Ordinary and partial Coh values were also calculated. Results: For both achromatic and chromatic stimuli, the 8 Hz amplitudes of O1 and O2 were significantly larger than those of P3 and P4 without any significant difference between O1 and O2. The phase lag between O1 and O2 was approximately 30degrees (latency shift 10.4 ms). Partial Coh between O1 and O2 at 8 Hz was significantly greater than that of the unstimulated condition, and this was only observed at 8 Hz. Conclusions: These results suggest that interhemispheric synchronization in the occipital area occurs despite the nature of the visual stimuli. Therefore, the activation of interhemispheric connection is important for the early stage of the visual information processing. Significance: Our results indicate that the first step of the visual information processing requires interhemispheric functional synchronization.

We now report thalamic LVA current elevations in a non-Ca2+ channel mutant. EEG analysis of Coloboma (Cm/+), an autosomal dominant mutant mouse lacking one copy of the gene for a synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP25) that interacts with HVA channels, reveals abnormal spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the behaving animal. We compared the biophysical properties of both LVA and HVA currents in Cm/+ and wild-type thalamic neurons and observed a 54% increase in peak current density of LVA currents evoked at -50 mV from -110 mV in Cm/+ before the developmental onset of seizures relative to control. The midpoint voltage for steady-state inactivation of LVA currents in Cm/+ was shifted in a depolarized direction by 8 mV before epilepsy onset, and the mean time constant for decay of LVA Ca2+ currents at -50 mV was also prolonged. No significant differences were found in recovery from inactivation of LVA currents or in HVA current densities and kinetics. Our data demonstrate that a non-Ca2+ channel subunit gene mutation leads to potentiated thalamic LVA currents that precede the appearance of SWDs and that altered somatodendritic HVA currents are not required for abnormal thalamocortical oscillations. We suggest that presynaptic release defects shared by these mutants lead to postsynaptic LVA excitability increases in thalamic pacemaker neurons that favor rebound bursting and absence epilepsy.

The objectives were to measure the progression of Type 2 (immobility-related) hippocampal theta amplitude and frequency recorded during jump avoidances at each of the levels, and determine if there was a consistent relationship between the phase of the Type 1 (movement related) theta jump wave and the moment of movement initiation at each of the jump heights. The results demonstrated that the immobility period prior to the execution of the jump could be divided into two components: a sensory processing period and a movement preparation period. Comparing these two periods, average amplitudes were higher while frequency remained relatively constant during the sensory processing period. During the movement preparation period there was a negative correlation between amplitude and frequency: amplitude declined rapidly and frequency increased rapidly. During the execution of the jump, theta amplitude (Type 1) and frequency were positively correlated, both reaching peak values. The separate analyses of the individual jump heights provided further support for the precise relationships between theta parameters and the magnitude of the required movements. A significant phase preference was demonstrated for the highest jump height, with movement initiation occurring around the trough of theta recorded from the stratum moleculare of the dentate region. The findings supported the conclusion that the generation of hippocampal theta band oscillation and synchrony was related to sensorimotor processing and integration. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We recorded neuromagnetic signals while Korean native speakers were exposed to a phonogram of Korean, acquired at school age as their L1 (Hangul), that of Japanese, learned in adulthood as a L2 (Kana) and pseudoletter (Pseudo), and quantified the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). In all conditions, sustained ERDs in the alpha band were observed in both hemispheres. ERD for Pseudo was gradually attenuated after similar to 400-500 ms after stimulus onset, whereas both Hangul and Kana produced stronger and longer-lasting ERD. ERD for Kana showed a broader alpha band than Hangul. Furthermore, transient ERSs in the gamma band around 70 Hz were observed between 100 and 400 ms in the bilateral occipitotemporal areas. In the left hemisphere, gamma band oscillations showed similar enhancement in all conditions, suggesting that gamma band activity in the left occipitotemporal area might be enhanced not only by the bottom-up process as visual perception but also by the top-down process as attention to prelexical visual stimuli. In the right hemisphere, gamma band ERS was stronger for Hangul than Pseudo and no differences were shown between Kana and Pseudo. The differences of oscillatory activity in the alpha and gamma bands suggest that neuronal networks, including the occipitotemporal area, are related to the visual perception of letters differing between L1 and L2.

Changes in the firing of visual lateral geniculate nucleus neurons have been reported to be dependent on the animal's behavioral state. The lateral geniculate extracellular neuronal firing and hippocampal field activity were recorded in chronically implanted animals to analyze the relationship during quiet wakefulness and sleep associated with stimulation shifts that may introduce novelty. During wakefulness, a change in light flash stimulation pattern (stimuli frequency shift, stimuli on and off) caused an increment in the theta band power in 100% of the cases and a phase-locking of the spikes in 53% of the recorded neurons. During slow wave sleep, there were no consistent changes in the theta power notwithstanding 13% of the neurons exhibited phase-locking, i.e., novelty may induce changes in the temporal correlation of visual neuronal activity with the hippocampal theta rhythm in sleep. The present results suggest that visual processing in slow wave sleep exists, while auditory information and learning were reported during slow wave sleep in animals and newborn humans. The changes in the theta power as well as in the neuronal phase-locking amount indicate that in slow wave sleep, the ability of the hippocampus to detect/process novelty, although present, may be decreased. This is consistent with the noticeable decrease in awareness of the environment during sleep. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we describe initial attempts to use MRI to detect directly the neuronal currents resulting from spontaneous alpha wave activity, which have previously been shown to generate the largest extracranial magnetic fields. Experiments were successfully carried out on four subjects at 3 T. A single slice was imaged at a rate of 25 images per second under two conditions. The first (in darkness with eyes-closed) was chosen to promote alpha wave activity, while the second (eyes-open viewing a visual stimulus) was chosen to suppress it. The fluctuations of the phase and magnitude of the resulting MR image data were frequency analysed, and tested for the signature of both alpha wave activity and neuronal activity evoked by the visual stimulus. Regions were found that consistently showed elevated power in fluctuations of the phase of the MR signal, in the frequency range of alpha waves, during the eyes-closed condition. It was conservatively assumed that if oscillations occurred at the same frequency in the magnitude signal from the same region or at the same frequency in the phase or magnitude signal from other regions overlying large vessels or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), then the phase changes were not due to neuronal activity related to alpha waves. Using these criteria the data obtained were consistent with direct detection of alpha wave activity in three of the four volunteers. No significant MR signal fluctuations due to evoked activity were identified. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG signals, leads [Fpz'-Cz'] and [C3'-C4'], were collected from two groups of normal volunteers, stimulated at the rate of 4.91 (G1:26 volunteers) and 5.13 Hz (G2:18 volunteers). About 1400 stimuli were applied to the right tibial nerve at the motor threshold level. After applying the anti-aliasing filter, the signals were digitized and then further low-pass filtered (200 Hz, 6th order Butterworth and zero-phase). Based on the rejection of the null hypothesis of response absence (MSC(f) > 0.0060 with 500 epochs and the level of significance set at alpha = 0.05), the beta and gamma bands, 15-66 Hz, were identified as the maximum driving response band. Taking both leads together ("logical-OR detector", with a false-alarm rate of alpha = 0.05, and hence alpha = 0.0253 for each derivation), the detection exceeded 70% for all multiples of the stimulation frequency within this range. Similar performance was achieved for MSC of both leads but at 15, 25, 35, and 40 Hz. Moreover, the response was detected in [C3'-C4'] at 35.9 Hz and in [Fpz'-Cz'] at 46.2 Hz for all members of G2. Using the "logical-OR detector" procedure, the response was detected at the 7th multiple of the stimulation frequency for the series as a whole (considering both groups). Based on these findings, the MSC technique may be used for monitoring purposes.

It is assumed that during temporal bimanual coordination, timing signals controlling each hand might be integrated. Although a specific role of the cerebellum for this integration process has been suggested, its neural foundations are still poorly understood. Since dynamic interactions between spatially distributed neural activity are reflected in oscillatory neural coupling, the aim of the present study was to characterize the dynamic interplay between participating brain structures. More specifically, the study aimed at investigating whether any evidence for the integration of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres could be found. Seven right-handed subjects synchronized bimanual index finger-taps to a regular pacing signal. We recorded continuous neuromagnetic activity using a 122-channel whole-head neuromagnetometer and surface EMGs of the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle of both hands. Coherence analysis revealed that an oscillatory network coupling at 8-12 Hz subserves task execution. The constituents are bilateral primary sensorimotor and premotor areas, posterior-parietal and primary auditory cortex, thalamus and cerebellum. Coupling occurred at different cortical and subcortical levels within and between both hemispheres. Coupling between primary sensorimotor and premotor areas was observed directly and indirectly via the thalamus. Coupling direction suggests that information was integrated within the left premotor cortex corroborating a specific role of the left premotor cortex for motor control in right-handers. Most importantly, our data indicate strong coupling between both cerebellar hemispheres substantiating the hypothesis that cerebellar signals might be integrated during task execution.

The present electroencephalogram (EEG) study was intended to uncover to the generators of induced gamma band responses (GBRS) and to analyze phase-synchronization between these sources. A standard object recognition task was used to elicit gamma activity. At the scalp surface (electrode space), we found an augmentation of induced GBRs after the presentation of meaningful (familiar) as opposed to meaningless (unfamiliar) stimuli, which was accompanied by a dense pattern of significant phase-locking values between distant recording sites. Subsequently, intracranial current density distributions compatible with the observed scalp voltage topographies were estimated by means of VARETA (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In source space brain electrical tomographies (BETs) revealed widespread generators of induced GBRs at temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. Phase-locking analysis was calculated between re-constructed electrode signals based on separate forward solutions of the observed generators, thereby eliminating the possibly confounding influence of activity from areas not under observation. The results support the view that induced GBRs signify synchronous neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. The localization of the generators of event-related potentials (ERPs), evoked gamma activity, and induced alpha activity revealed different sources as compared to the induced GBR and, thus, seem to mirror complementary functions during the present task as compared to induced high-frequency brain dynamics.

A preliminary study showed that slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4.5 Hz) is decreased in anorectic adolescents. The present study investigates whether this reduction is the result of the increased sleep fragmentation or is dependent on an intrinsic weakness of SWA-producing mechanisms. Design: Statistical analysis of spectral electroencephalogram data recorded during sleep from a group of anorectics and a control group. Setting: Polysomnographic data were recorded in single rooms in the hospital for 1 night following an adaptation night. Participants: 20 adolescent anorectic girls (13.9 +/- 2.0 years) and 12 age-matched control subjects. Interventions: Refeeding and psychotherapy. Measurements and Results: Anorectics had an increase of wakefulness after sleep onset, a higher number of arousals, and a reduction of SWS and SWA during total sleep time. No relationship between the reduction of SWA and duration of illness was found, while a relationship between SWA decrease and the level of emaciation (body mass index) was present. The analysis limited to the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle did not show any difference between the 2 groups in the number of awkenings and arousals. Nevertheless.. anorectics showed a reduction of SWS and SWA. Conclusions: Sleep of anorectic patients seems to be characterized by an impairment of SWA-producing mechanisms independent of the increased sleep fragmentation. This is probably related to he primary pathophysiologic characteristics of the illness but could also reflect secondary functional and anatomic alterations of the brain.

These techniques are often underutilized in the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, but nevertheless they can-be most useful and highly effective in the diagnostic workup of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in monitoring the course of the disorders and the prediction of treatment responses. ERP are noninvasive instruments that directly reflect cortical neuronal activity. Cortical neuronal dysfunction plays a major role in variable neuropsychiatric disorders, and a change in cortical activity under medication might reflect treatment response and could be useful for monitoring drug effects. ERP are the only methods with a sufficiently high time resolution for the analysis of the dynamic patterns of neuronal brain activity, e.g., synchronization and desynchronization, oscillations, coherence, gamma band activity, latency of event related activity, etc., which are crucial for a deeper understanding of functional (neurophysiological) correlates of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances in neuropsychiatric patients. Methodological advances have further improved and strengthened the position of ERP concerning research and clinical application. The usefulness and applicability of ERP in determining and monitoring clinico-pharmacological effects will be summarized mainly by focussing on the auditory evoked P300 and the N1/P2 component of auditory evoked potentials. Owing to important recent developments in the field of brain functional diagnostics the combination of neurophysiological techniques and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be included.

Fast, visual specialization for reading in English revealed by the topography of the N170 ERP response	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article								Background: N170 effects associated with visual words may be related to perceptual expertise effects that have been demonstrated for faces and other extensively studied classes of visual stimuli. Although face and other object expertise effects are typically bilateral or right-lateralized, the spatial topography of reading-related N170 effects are often left-lateralized, providing potential insights into the unique aspects of reading-related perceptual expertise. Methods: Extending previous research in German [1], we use a high-density channel array to characterize the N170 topography for reading-related perceptual expertise in English, a language with inconsistent spelling-to-sound mapping. N170 effects related to overall reading-related expertise are defined by contrasting responses to visual words versus novel symbol strings. By contrasting each of these conditions to pseudowords, we examined how this reading-related N170 effect generalizes to well-ordered novel letter strings. Results: A sample-by-sample permutation test computed on word versus symbol ERP topographies revealed differences during two time windows corresponding to the N170 and P300 components. Topographic centroid analysis of the word and symbol N170 demonstrated significant differences in both left-right as well as inferior-superior dimensions. Words elicited larger N170 negativities than symbols at inferior occipito-temporal channels, with the maximal effect over left inferior regions often unsampled in conventional electrode montages. Further contrasts produced inferior-superior topographic effects for the pseudoword-symbol comparison and left-lateralized topographic effects for the word-pseudoword comparison. Conclusion: Fast specialized perception related to reading experience produces an N170 modulation detectable across different EEG systems and different languages. Characterization of such effects may be improved by sampling with greater spatial frequency recordings that sample inferior regions. Unlike in German, reading-related expertise effects in English produced only partial generalization in N170 responses to novel pseudowords. The topographic inferior-superior N170 differences may reflect general perceptual expertise for orthographic strings, as it was found for words and pseudowords across both languages. The topographic left-right N170 difference between words and pseudowords was only found in English, and may suggest that ambiguity in pronunciating novel pseudowords due to inconsistency in spelling-to-sound mapping influences early stages of letter string processing.

We have studied the effects of transitory changes in cerebral state during drowsiness on breath duration and lung volume in eight healthy subjects in the absence of changes in airway resistance and fluctuations of ventilation and CO2 tension, characteristic of the onset of non-rapid eye movement sleep. A volume-cycled ventilator in the assist control mode was used to maintain CO2 tension close to that when awake. Changes in cerebral state were determined by the EEG on a breath-by-breath basis and classified as alpha or theta breaths. Breath duration and the pause in gas flow between the end of expiratory airflow and the next breath were computed for two alpha breaths which preceded a theta breath and for the theta breath itself. The group mean (SD) results for this alpha-to-theta transition was associated with a prolongation in breath duration from 5.2 (SD 1.3) to 13.0 s (SD 2.1) and expiratory pause from 0.7 (SD 0.4) to 7.5 s (SD 2.2). Because the changes in arterial CO2 tension (Pa-CO2) are unknown during the theta breaths, we made in two subjects a continuous record of Pa-CO2 in the radial artery. Pa-CO2 remained constant from the alpha breaths through to the expiratory period of the theta breath by which time the duration of breath was already prolonged, representing an immediate and altered ventilatory response to the prevailing Pa-CO2. In the eight subjects, the CO2 tension awake was 39.6 Torr (SD 2.3) and on assisted ventilation 38.0 Torr (1.4). We conclude that the ventilatory instability recorded in the present experiments is due to the apneic threshold for CO2 being at or just below that when awake.

The STN rest electrical activity in Parkinson's disease, however, is still unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological modulation of STN activity has rhythm-specific effects in the classical range of EEG frequencies, below 50 Hz. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) through electrodes implanted in the STN of patients with Parkinson's disease (20 nuclei from 13 patients). After overnight withdrawal of antiparkinsonian therapy, Ups were recorded at rest both before (off) and after (on) acute administration of different antiparkinsonian drugs: levodopa, apomorphine, or orphenadrine. In the off-state, STN LFPs showed clearly defined peaks of oscillatory activity below 50 Hz: at low frequencies (2-7 Hz), in the alpha (7-13 Hz), low-beta (13-20 Hz), and high-beta range (20-30 Hz). In the on-state after levodopa and apomorphine administration, low-beta activity significantly decreased and low-frequency activity increased. In contrast, orphenadrine increased beta activity. Power changes elicited by levodopa and apomorphine at low frequencies and in the beta range were not correlated, whereas changes in the alpha band, which were globally not significant, correlated with the beta rhythm (namely, low beta: 13-20 Hz). In conclusion, in the human STN, there are at least two rhythms below 50 Hz that are separately modulated by antiparkinsonian medication: one at low frequencies and one in the beta range. Multiple rhythms are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple oscillating systems, each possibly correlating with specific aspects of human STN function and dysfunction. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Amplitude modulation of gamma activity at low frequencies has been seen in rat hippocampus and modeled in a number of forms. Significant amplitude modulation (p=0.05) of 33 Hz gamma frequency activity at the frequency of an 8 1/3 Hz photic driving stimulus, which also produced strong alpha entrainment, was observed in 67% of the channels in 42 human subjects. Similar amplitude modulation was found at a range of frequencies from greater than 50 Hz to about 28 Hz. The peak of the gamma amplitude modulation curve trailed the peak of the alpha signal by 25 to 30 ms, corresponding to a phase difference of 150 degrees to 180 degrees. The phase consistency of the gamma signal, measured across comparable times of the alpha signal, was least at the minimum amplitude modulation, and largest at the maximum. Although there was no consistent overall relation between the gamma amplitude and alpha amplitude, peak gamma amplitude values were consistently higher during post-target-stimulus alpha suppression, which occurs about 300-750 ms subsequent to stimulus presentation, than they were at the time of maximum alpha activity during the immediate post-stimulus period. It is hypothesized that there is an interaction between the alpha and gamma generating systems, in which gamma triggers alpha activity and is subsequently inhibited by it, thus producing the observed amplitude modulation. The transition from dark to light of the photic driving stimulus begins a phase resetting process in the gamma system and a concomitant burst of gamma activity; this produces an activation in the alpha system, similar to that found in the P1-N1 response in evoked potential experiments, and a subsequent inhibition of gamma production.

J	Bruns, A; Eckhorn, R				Bruns, A; Eckhorn, R			Task-related coupling from high- to low-frequency signals among visual cortical areas in human subdural recordings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						gamma; theta; envelope; correlation; coherence; amplitude; phase; non-linear; intracranial	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; EEG; BRAIN; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; RHYTHMS; OBJECT	Cortical cooperativity during cognitive demands includes high- and low-frequency activities, which raises the question whether there are interdependencies between fast and slow processes and how they are reflected in electrical brain signals. We had the opportunity to record signals intracranially from occipital visual areas in an epileptic patient and quantified inter-areal signal coupling while the patient performed a visual delayed-match-to-sample task. We computed coherence, phase consistency and amplitude envelope correlation and we also determined inter-frequency coupling through correlation between low-frequency signal components and amplitude envelopes of high-frequency components. There was a pronounced task-related increase of correlation between gamma-band (28-70 Hz) signal envelopes from a superior (occipital) and low-frequency (0-3.5 Hz) signals from an inferior (occipital) visual area, lasting for approximately 1 s and possibly reflecting a short-term memory encoding process. The correlational delay between envelopes and low-frequency components was 40 ms. In contrast, coherence, phase consistency and envelope correlation showed event-, but no task-related changes of intra-areal and no changes of inter-areal coupling. Our data suggest a specific effect of gammsa-activity in the superior onto low-frequency activity in the inferior area. We argue that temporal dispersion of conduction delays might prevent coherent transmission of high-frequency signals and thus account for the absence of gamma-coherence. As such dispersion is a general property of long-range projections, envelope-to-signal correlation possibly reflects a general neuronal mechanism. Hence, our method provides a powerful tool for detecting such inter-areal interactions not visible with conventional linear coupling measures. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Van Strien, JW; Hagenbeek, RE; Stam, CJ; Rombouts, SARB; Barkhof, F				Van Strien, JW; Hagenbeek, RE; Stam, CJ; Rombouts, SARB; Barkhof, F			Changes in brain electrical activity during extended continuous word recognition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; induced band power; alpha; theta; delta; old/new effect; recognition; familiarity; recollection	THETA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; TASK	Twenty healthy subjects (10 men, 10 women) participated in an EEG study with an extended continuous recognition memory task, in which each of 30 words was randomly shown 10 times and subjects were required to make old vs. new decisions. Both event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and induced band power (IBP) were investigated. We hypothesized that repeated presentations affect recollection rather than familiarity. For the 300- to 500-ms time window, an 'old/new' ERP effect was found for the first vs. second word presentations. The correct recognition of an 'old' word was associated with a more positive waveform than the correct identification of a new word. The old/new effect was most pronounced at and around the midline parietal electrode position. For the 500- to 800-ms time window, a linear repetition effect was found for multiple word repetitions. Correct recognition after an increasing number of repetitions was associated with increasing positivity. The multiple repetitions effect was most pronounced at the midline central (Cz) and fronto-central (FCz) electrode positions and reflects a graded recollection process: the stronger the memory trace grows, the more positive the ERP in the 500- to 800-ms time window. The ERP results support a dual-processing model, with familiarity being discernable from a more graded recollection state that depends on memory strengths. For IBP, we found 'old/new' effects for the lower-2 alpha, theta, and delta bands, with higher bandpower during 'old' words. The lower-2 alpha 'old/new' effect most probably reflects attentional processes, whereas the theta and delta effects reflect encoding and retrieval processes. Upon repeated word presentations, the magnitude of induced delta power in the 375- to 750-ms time window diminished linearly. Correlation analysis suggests that decreased delta power is moderately associated with faster decision speed and higher accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Automated detection of videotaped neonatal seizures of epileptic origin	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						motion segmentation; motion-strength signal; motion tracking; motion-trajectory signal; neonatal seizure; neural network; quantitative feature; video recording	MOTOR-ACTIVITY SIGNALS; QUANTUM NEURAL-NETWORKS; QUANTIFYING MOTION; RECORDINGS; RISK; EEG; CONVULSIONS; EXTRACTION; COUNTY; BRAIN	Purpose: This study aimed at the development of a seizure-detection system by training neural networks with quantitative motion information extracted from short video segments of neonatal seizures of the myoclonic and focal clonic types and random infant movements. Methods: The motion of the infants' body parts was quantified by temporal motion-strength signals extracted from video segments by motion-segmentation methods based on optical flow computation. The area of each frame occupied by the infants' moving body parts was segmented by clustering the motion parameters obtained by fitting an affine model to the pixel velocities. The motion of the infants' body parts also was quantified by temporal motion-trajectory signals extracted from video recordings by robust motion trackers based on block-motion models. These motion trackers were developed to adjust autonomously to illumination and contrast changes that may occur during the video-frame sequence. Video segments were represented by quantitative features obtained by analyzing motion-strength and motion-trajectory signals in both the time and frequency domains. Seizure recognition was performed by conventional feed-forward neural networks, quantum neural networks, and cosine radial basis function neural networks, which were trained to detect neonatal seizures of the myoclonic and focal clonic types and to distinguish them from random infant movements. Results: The computational tools and procedures developed for automated seizure detection were evaluated on a set of 240 video segments of 54 patients exhibiting myoclonic seizures (80 segments), focal clonic seizures (80 segments), and random infant movements (80 segments). Regardless of the decision scheme used for interpreting the responses of the trained neural networks, all the neural network models exhibited sensitivity and specificity > 90%. For one of the decision schemes proposed for interpreting the responses of the trained neural networks, the majority of the trained neural-network models exhibited sensitivity > 90% and specificity > 95%. In particular, cosine radial basis function neural networks achieved the performance targets of this phase of the project (i.e., sensitivity > 95% and specificity > 95%). Conclusions: The best among the motion segmentation and tracking methods developed in this study produced quantitative features that constitute a reliable basis for detecting neonatal seizures. The performance targets of this phase of the project were achieved by combining the quantitative features obtained by analyzing motion-strength signals with those produced by analyzing motion-trajectory signals. The computational procedures and tools developed in this study to perform off-line analysis of short video segments will be used in the next phase of this project, which involves the integration of these procedures and tools into a system that can process and analyze long video recordings of infants monitored for seizures in real time.

These newly discovered evoked-responses have durations that exceed the time between the stimuli in a continuous stream, thus causing an overlap which, up to now, has prevented their detection. We have named them "A-waves", and added a prefix to show the sensory system from which the responses were obtained (visA-waves, audA-waves, somA-waves). Results: When A-waves were studied as a function of stimulus repetition-rate, it was found that there were systematic differences in waveshape at repetition-rates above and below the psychophysical region in which the sensation of individual stimuli fuse into a continuity. The fusion phenomena is sometimes measured by a "Critical Fusion Frequency", but for this research we can only identify a frequency-region [which we call the STZ (Sensation-Transition Zone)]. Thus, the A-waves above the STZ differed from those below the STZ, as did the sensations. Study of the psychophysical differences in auditory and visual stimuli, as shown in this paper, suggest that different stimulus features are detected, and remembered, at stimulation rates above and below STZ. Conclusion: The results motivate us to speculate that: 1) Stimulus repetition-rates above the STZ generate waveforms which underlie "fusion-memory" whereas rates below the STZ show neuronal processing in which "flash-memory" occurs. 2) These two memories differ in both duration and mechanism, though they may occur in the same cell groups. 3) The differences in neuronal processing may be related to "figure" and "ground" differentiation. We conclude that A-waves provide a novel measure of neural processes that can be detected on the human scalp, and speculate that they may extend clinical applications of evoked response recordings. If A-waves also occur in animals, it is likely that A-waves will provide new methods for comparison of activity of neuronal populations and single cells.

Place fields get progressively larger, and the probability of observing a field in a given environment gets progressively smaller. It was previously found that decoupling movement in space from ambulation, by having the animal actively ride on a mobile platform, results in marked enlargement of the spatial scale factor in the dorsal hippocampus and a reduction in the increase in theta rhythm power with running speed, suggesting that a self-motion signal determines the spatial scale at which the hippocampal population vector updates. These results led to the hypothesis that the gain of the self-motion signal may vary systematically along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, EEG theta rhythm and ensembles of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons were recorded from the extreme dorsal and middle portions of the hippocampus. Pyramidal cell population vectors representing successive locations became decorrelated over substantially shorter distances in the dorsal than in the middle hippocampus. Dorsal pyramidal cells had smaller place fields, higher mean and peak firing rates, and higher intrinsic oscillation frequencies during track running than that of middle pyramidal cells. Both dorsal pyramidal cells and interneurons had more elevated mean rates during running, compared with rest, than that of the corresponding cell classes in the middle hippocampus, and both cell classes increased their rates more as a function of speed in the dorsal hippocampus. The amplitude, but not the frequency of fissure recorded theta rhythm, increased more as a function of running speed in the dorsal than in the middle hippocampus. We conclude that variation in the neuronal response to movement speed is the likely basis for the systematic variation in spatial scaling along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus.

Resting state oscillatory brain dynamics in Parkinson's disease: An MEG study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; dementia; magneto encephalography (MEG); resting state; oscillations; frequency analysis	CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; CORTICAL LEWY BODIES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NUCLEUS BASALIS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NEOCORTICAL ACTIVITY; DEMENTIA; EEG	Objective: The pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) are still poorly understood. Altered resting state oscillatory brain activity may reflect underlying neuropathological changes. The present study using magneto encephalography (MEG) was set up to study differences in the pattern of resting state oscillatory brain activity in groups of demented and non-demented PD patients and healthy, elderly controls. Methods: The pattern of MEG background oscillatory activity was studied in 13 demented PD patients, 13 non-demented PD patients and 13 healthy controls. Whole head MEG recordings were obtained in the morning in an eyes closed and an eyes open, resting state condition. Relative spectral power was calculated using Fast Fourier Transformation in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Results: In the non-demented PD patients, relative theta power was diffusely increased and theta power concomitantly decreased relative to controls. gamma Power was decreased in central and parietal channels. In the demented PD patients, a diffuse increase in relative delta and to lesser extent theta power and a decrease in relative alpha, beta and to lesser extent gamma power were found in comparison to the non-demented PD group. In addition, reactivity to eye opening was much reduced in the demented PD group. Conclusions: Parkinson's disease is characterized by a slowing of resting state brain activity involving theta, beta and gamma frequency bands. Dementia in PD is associated with a further slowing of resting state brain activity, additionally involving delta and alpha bands, as well as a reduction in reactivity to eye-opening. Significance: The differential patterns of slowing of resting state brain activity in demented and non-demented PD patients suggests that, in conjunction with a progression of the pathological changes already present in non-demented patients, additional mechanisms are involved in the development of dementia in PD.

Large-amplitude, spatially correlated fluctuations in BOLD fMRI signals during extended rest and early sleep stages	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						BOLD; fMRI; fluctuation; resting state; connectivity	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT-MODE; ALPHA-RHYTHM; BRAIN-FUNCTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; OSCILLATIONS	A number of recent studies of human brain activity using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and EEG have reported the presence of spatiotemporal patterns of correlated activity in the absence of external stimuli. Although these patterns have been hypothesized to contain important information about brain architecture, little is known about their origin or about their relationship to active cognitive processes such as conscious awareness and monitoring of the environment. In this study, we have investigated the amplitude and spatiotemporal characteristics of resting-state activity patterns and their dependence on the subjects' alertness. For this purpose, BOLD fMRI was performed at 3.0 T on 12 normal subjects using a visual stimulation protocol, followed by a 27 min rest period, during which subjects were allowed to fall asleep. In subjects who were asleep at the end of the scan, we found (a) a higher amplitude of BOLD signal fluctuation during rest compared with subjects who were awake at the end of the scan; (b) spatially independent patterns of correlated activity that involve all of gray matter, including deep brain nuclei; (c) many patterns that were consistent across subjects; (d) that average percentage levels of fluctuation in visual cortex (VC) and whole brain were higher in subjects who were asleep (up to 1.71% and 1.16%, respectively) than in those who were awake (up to 1.15% and 0.96%) at the end of the scan and were comparable with those levels evoked by intense visual stimulation (up to 1.85% and 0.76% for two subject groups); (e) no confirmation of correlation, positive or negative, between thalamus and VC found in earlier studies. These findings suggest that resting-state activity continues during sleep and does not require active cognitive processes or conscious awareness. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One hundred fifteen PET scans were obtained using H2150 under continuous polygraphic monitoring during stages 2-4 of NREM sleep. Correlations between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and delta power (1.5-4 Hz) spectral density were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2). Delta power values obtained at central scalp locations negatively correlated during NREM sleep with rCBF in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the basal forebrain, the striatum, the anterior insula, and the precuneus. These regions embrace the set of brain areas in which rCBF decreases during slow wave sleep (SWS) as compared to Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness (Maquet, P., Degueldre, C., Defflore, G., Aerts, J., Peters, J.M., Luxen, A., Franck, G., 1997. Functional neuroanatomy of human slow wave sleep. J. Neurosci. 17, 2807-2812), supporting the notion that delta activity is a valuable prominent feature of NREM sleep. A strong association was observed between rCBF in the ventromedial prefrontal regions and delta power, in agreement with electrophysiological studies. In contrast to the results of a previous PET study investigating the brain correlates of delta activity (Hofle, N., Pans, T., Reutens, D., Fiset, P., Gotman, J., Evans, A.C., Jones, II.E., 1997. Regional cerebral blood flow changes as a function of delta and spindle activity during slow wave sleep in humans. J. Neurosci. 17, 4800-4808), in which waking scans were mixed with NREM sleep scans, no correlation was found with thalamus activity. This latter result stresses the importance of an extra-thalamic delta rhythm among the synchronous NREM sleep oscillations. Consequently, this rCBF distribution might preferentially reflect a particular modulation of the cellular processes involved in the generation of cortical delta waves during NREM sleep.

J	Dringenberg, HC; Sparling, JS; Frazer, J; Murdoch, J				Dringenberg, Hans C.; Sparling, Joseph S.; Frazer, Jev; Murdoch, Jennifer			Generalized cortex activation by the auditory midbrain: mediation by acetylcholine and subcortical relays	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							URETHANE-ANESTHETIZED RATS; BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NEOCORTICAL ACTIVATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; CORTICAL EEG; BRAIN-STEM; ASCENDING PROJECTIONS; CHEMICAL-STIMULATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	The inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical component of the ascending projection system carrying auditory information from the brainstem to the forebrain. Recent evidence indicates that, in addition to its role in auditory processing, the IC can exert a generalized, modulatory effect on the forebrain by activating the neocortical electrocorticogram (ECoG). Given the sparse direct projections from the IC to the cortex, it appears that the effect of the IC to produce ECoG activation is indirect, mediated by one or several neuromodulatory systems that have diffuse access to the entire cortical mantle. However, the anatomical relays that permit the IC to influence cortical activity have not been elucidated. In the present experiments, electrical stimulation of the IC suppressed slow, large amplitude oscillations in the ECoG of urethane anesthetized rats, replacing them with higher-frequency cortical activation. This effect was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), suggestive of a critical role of acetylcholine (ACh) release. Consistent with this hypothesis, localized lidocaine infusions (2%, 1 mu l) into the cholinergic basal forebrain complex strongly reduced ECoG activation elicited by IC stimulation. To identify additional relays between the IC and basal forebrain, the effects of lidocaine infusions into the superior colliculus, medial prefrontal cortex, midline thalamus, and dorsal raphe were also studied. Inactivation of the superior colliculus and dorsal raphe reduced IC-induced activation, while prefrontal cortex and thalamic infusions were ineffective. Concurrent basal forebrain and raphe inactivation produced effects similar to that of inactivation of the basal forebrain alone, suggesting that these two areas are arranged in series, rather than acting as independent, parallel pathways. These results suggest that the ability of the IC to induce ECoG activation is mediated, in large parts, by the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Consistent with anatomical evidence, the superior colliculus and dorsal raphe appear to provide important links to functionally connect the IC to the basal forebrain, allowing the IC to indirectly access the entire cortical mantle and enhance processing in neocortical networks.

However, recent studies have shown that generalized activating systems are not restricted to the reticular formation in that non-reticular brain systems (e.g., basal forebrain, amygdala, superior colliculus) can effectively produce ECoG activation. Here, we investigated the role of the inferior colliculus (IC) in regulating ECoG activation in rats. Urethane-anesthetized rats displayed continuous large amplitude ECoG activity with peak power in the delta frequency range (0.5-3.9 Hz). Electrical 100-Hz stimulation (0.1-0.5 mA) of 40/88 (46%) stimulation sites in the IC suppressed low frequency oscillations and induced ECoG activation (greater than or equal to50% suppression of peak delta power). Systematic mapping of different IC territories (central nucleus, external and dorsal cortex) revealed that stimulation of all IC parts was equally effective in producing activation. Chemical stimulation of the IC with intra-collicular glutamate infusions (50 mM, 0.5 mul) produces similar, but more consistent effects, with ECoG activation elicited in eight of nine rats. Pharmacological experiments were carried out in order to identify transmitters that mediate cortical activation in response to IC stimulation. The muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced, but did not abolish, activation, as did the serotonergic receptor antagonist methiothepin (1 mg/kg, i.p.). A combination of the two drugs produced a complete block of IC-induced ECoG activation. These experiments demonstrate that the IC contains a distributed network, spanning all IC territories, which can participate in regulating the generalized activation state of the rat neocortex. Rather than by some direct cortical projections, IC neurons appear to induce ECoG activation by acting through both cholinergic and serotonergic systems, thought to provide the final effector mechanisms for cortical activation.

The objective of this review is to critically evaluate a conceptual model that views sleep expression as the outcome of opponent processes-a circadian clock-dependent alerting process that opposes sleep during the daily wake period, and a homeostatic process by which sleep drive builds during waking and is dissipated during sleep after circadian alerting declines. This model is based primarily on the evidence that in a diurnal primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), ablation of the master circadian clock (the suprachiasmatic nucleus;, SCN) induces a significant expansion of total daily sleep duration and a reduction in sleep latency in the dark. According to this model, the circadian clock actively promotes wake but only passively gates sleep; thus, loss of circadian clock alerting by SCN ablation impairs the ability to sustain wakefulness and causes sleep to expand. For comparison, two additional conceptual models are described, one in which the circadian clock actively promotes sleep but not wake, and a third in which the circadian clock actively promotes both sleep and wake, at different circadian phases. Sleep in intact and SCN-damaged rodents and humans is first reviewed, to determine how well the data fit these conceptual models. Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies are then reviewed, to examine the evidence for direct and indirect interactions between the SCN circadian clock and sleep-wake circuits. Finally, sleep in SCN-ablated squirrel monkeys is re-examined, to consider its compatibility with alternative models of circadian regulation of sleep. In aggregate, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence suggests that in rodents and humans, the circadian clock actively promotes both wake and sleep, at different phases of the circadian cycle. The hypersomnia of SCN-ablated squirrel monkeys is unique in magnitude, but is not incompatible with a role for the SCN pacemaker in actively promoting sleep. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Synchronization of neural activity in they-band, associated with gestalt perception, has often been proposed as a putative mechanism to solve these problems, not only as to low-level processing, but also in higher cortical functions. In the present work, a network of Wilson-Cowan oscillators is used to segment simultaneous objects, and recover an object from partial or corrupted information, by implementing two gestalt rules: similarity and prior knowledge. The network consists of H different areas, each devoted to representation of a particular feature of the object, according to a topological organization. The similarity law is realized via lateral intra-area connections, arranged as a "Mexican-hat". Prior knowledge is realized via inter-area connections, which link properties belonging to a previously memorized object. A global inhibitor allows segmentation of several objects avoiding interference. Simulation results, performed using three simultaneous input objects, show that the network is able to detect an object even in difficult conditions (i.e., when some features are absent or shifted with respect to the original one). Moreover, the trade-off between sensitivity (capacity to detect true positives) and specificity (capacity to reject false positives) can be controlled acting on the extension of lateral synapses (i.e., on the level of accepted similarity). Finally, the network can also deal with correlated objects, i.e., objects which have some common features. Simulations performed using a different number of objects (2, 3, 4 or 5) suggest that the network is able to segment and recall up to four objects, but the oscillation frequency must increase, the lower the number of objects simultaneously present. The model, although quite simpler compared with neurophysiology, may represent a theoretical framework for the analysis of the relationships between object representation, memory, learning, and gamma-band activity. In particular, it extends previous studies on autoassociative memory since it exploits not only oscillatory dynamics, but also a topological organization of features. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The characteristics of the brain's spontaneous neuronal activity in perirolandic cortical areas were investigated in 32 patients who had a stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory of one hemisphere in the previous 10 days. Magnetic fields from both left and right rolandic areas were recorded at rest with open eyes. Total and band power properties, the individual alpha frequency (IAF) and the spectral entropy were analyzed and compared with a sex-age matched control group. In agreement with electroencephalographic literature, low frequency absolute powers were higher and high frequency were lower in the affected (AH) than in the unaffected hemisphere (UR), and also their values in both hemispheres differed from control values. An IAF reduction was found in AH with respect to UH. As new findings, the total power was higher in AH than in UH, after excluding 4 right-damaged patients with cortico-subcortical lesions, who showed a completely disorganized spectral pattern. Spectral entropy was lower in AH than in UH. Clinical severity correlated with the AH decrease of gamma band power, IAF and spectral entropy. Larger lesions were associated to worse clinical pictures and MEG alterations. A lesion affecting the MCA territory of one hemisphere induces a perilesional increase of the low-frequency rhythms' spectral power within the AH rolandic areas; the same effect was present also in the UH, indicating interhemispheric diaschisis. In the AH, results showed an increase of the total power and a reduction of the spectral entropy, suggesting a higher synchrony of local neuronal activity, a reduction of the intra-cortical inhibitory networks efficiency and an increase of neuronal excitability. Direct correlation linked gamma band activity preservation and less severe clinical status. Dependence of the clinical picture, and associated spectral alterations, on the lesion volume and not on the lesion level, suggests a diffuse neuronal impairment, rather than a selective structures damage, contributing to neurological status in the acute phase of stroke.

SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						semantic memory; lexical decision; event-related potentials	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY; WORDS	Introduction: An insight into the meaning of words is one of the central processes of semantic memory. To evaluate the access to the cognitive representation of the meaning of words, in the present study we used the lexical decision paradigm developed by Marcos. In this situation, the subject has to recognize if the presented stimulus corresponds to a word or a pseudo-word with the purpose of budding a model of normal processing. Once such a model of normal processing is obtained, the findings can be contrasted with pathologies in which semantic memory is altered. Method: The sample consisted of 32 healthy subjects (7 men, 25 women), right-handed and with no personal or familial history of neurological or psychiatric conditions. The average age of the subjects was 34.4 (+/- 9.56) years and they had an average educational level of 16.2 (+/- 4.4) years. The lexical decision paradigm employed in this study is constituted by 408 stimuli, 240 words and 168 pseudo-words. The criteria for word selection were: frequency, length, grammatical category and morphology Electroencephalogram (EEG) monopolar recording was obtained from 19 derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Fz, Cz and Pz), as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) for the word and pseudo-word sub-states. Results: In the first place, a chi-squared analysis was performed to establish whether significative differences existed between the rates of correct and incorrect answers for both sub-states. The value of chi-squared was 65.7 (gl = 1) and significant for p < 0.0001. A correlation value of 0.43 (p < 0.02) was found when the educational level and the percentage of correct answers in the sub-sate word were compared. On the other hand, for the pseudo-word sub-state, the value 0.24 was encountered for the same correlation, being statistically non-significant. Pearson's correlation coefficient was also calculated for the educational level variable compared to the mistakes committed when subjects were presented with frequent and infrequent words. In the case of infrequent words, a value of r = - 0.43 (p < 0.02) was obtained when the educational level and the number of mistakes were correlated. No correlation was found when the educational level and the number of mistakes commited for frequent words were compared (r = - 0.06). A multivariate variance analysis for repeated measures was performed to determine significant differences between the reaction times when recognizing words or pseudo-words. The outcome showed that all effects were significant in the following cases: reaction times for words and pseudo-words, notwithstanding whether they were correct or incorrect; comparison between correct and incorrect answers, independently of their being words or pseudo-words, as well as the interactions between both effects. To determine differences between average ERPs for both substates, Student's T-test was applied with Bonferroni's correction and p < 0.0002 as the significance level. Significant differences were encountered between the two sub-states, independently of the age or gender. In the 375-495 ms latency interval, a negative component was appreciated in the pseudo-words case, showing significant differences (p < 0.0002) in the following derivations: F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 01, 02, T3, T5, T6, Fz, Cz and Pz. Amplitude differences between the two sub-states were more evident in Pz and P3 derivations followed by Cz. In addition, a positive component in the 700-795 ms latency interval was detected (mainly in 795 ms) when pseudo-words were presented. Here, the significant differences (p < 0.0002) were manifest in the following derivations: F3, C3, P3, F7, T3, T5 and Pz. Amplitude differences between the two sub-states were mainly patent in Pz and P3 followed by C3. Discussion: When analyzing behavioral aspects, subjects made more mistakes when presented with words. However, individuals with less education were the ones committing more mistakes. From this we can infer that this variable may be associated with the range of lexical repertoire. A relation was encountered between educational level and word recognition. With regard to reaction times, significant differences were detected between both sub-states, since the recognition of both words and correct answers was achieved in shorter reaction times. Average reaction times for words and pseudo-words were 819.73 ms and 999.35 ms, respectively. Similarly, the latest potential component appeared in an interval of significant differences between 600 and 940 ms, though with a significance p < 0.0005 between 690 and 805 ms. This means that positiveness occurred much sooner than the response, implying that the activity underlying ERPs is related to a cognitive processing of information due to the paradigm used. The analysis of ERPs primary components for both sub-states shows that significant differences arise until 270 ms. The negative component in this study was present between 270 and 580 ms, rendering it similar to N400 given its latency (around 400 ms). Although well-defined in centro-parietal regions, its distribution was generalized, which corresponds to the results of studies using the semantic incongruence paradigm. According to the data from previous research on ERPs, N400 has been associated with the integration process. If this were the case, this association would be equivalent to the semantic incongruence within a lexical integration process described in conventional literature as a "semantic facilitator", only that this time it would be limited to the process of access to the lexicon, which can be interpreted as a discrimination of the answer by assigning a meaning to a word, that is, to process information in the semantic module. This negative component, may be related to the generalized response to brain activity when given a meaningless stimulus, i.e., a pseudo-word. Similarly, the wave amplitude may be related to the amount of activation necessary to gain access to the semantic representation of the stimulus in the memory. With regard to the positive component in this study, it is present between 600 and 940 ms and is interpreted as a late P300 (P3b), which has a latency in the 500-1400 ms interval. It is distributed over the centro-parietal region, making it a liable participant in the task categorization process, in which it is necessary to discriminate between the target from the non-target stimulus, and also reflects focalized attentional processes (voluntary) involved in the execution of the task. From the former, it is believed that this component may be related to attentional resources necessary to process the presentation of pseudo-words. Research dealing with the P600 component locate it within the context of statements and associate it with an anomaly in statement syntax. Therefore, even though the positive component lies within the P600 latency domain, this particular component was not considered as being present in this study, because a syntax incongruence paradigm was not used. Finally, the contribution of the present study lies in the finding of N400 and "P600" components, which have been reported when the "semantic facilitator" and the syntax incongruence paradigm were respectively used, but had not been observed when a lexical decision paradigm based on word recognition per se was utilized. Similarly, given that our results stem from a sample of healthy subjects, a comparison can be made with a patient population with semantic memory alterations.

Two main investigators helped by 5 sociology students were trained on a questionnaire by a psychiatrist skilled with public health matters. People taking part in the survey are epileptic patients who already used health services. Inclusions took place within 17 communes of four departments (Mono, Zou, Oueme, Atlantique) located in Southern part of Benin. The questionnaire used an Identity sheet and the Goldberg Depression Scale. Results are shown as mean +/- standard deviations, for quantitative values, and percents for qualitative ones. Comparisons of proportions in qualitative variables are carried out using chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of means rates between subject's groups are carried out with a Student t test or variance analysis. The correlations between two quantitative variables were assessed by linear correlation coefficient. Significance threshold chosen for the whole set of statistics analysis is 0.05. The majority of interviewed epileptic patients is young (average 32.6 +/- 11.5 years old). A male predominance exists (sex ratio 1.28). 93 % of interviewed persons live within their family, are married or cohabit (controls: 98.2 % ; cases : 87.9 %) ; 57.4 % are married (controls: 70 %; cases: 44 %). The most represented professional categories are craftsmen and shopkeepers (29.2 %) as well as farmers (19.5 %). Most of recruited patients live in an urban setting (55.4 %) and 63.6 % of interviewed persons had been living in the area of survey for over 10 years. The most represented religion within the sample is Christian religion (67.7 %), Animists (23.3 %) and Muslims (5.8 %). 97 % of epileptic patients reported they had one fit during the two years before the survey; roughly one half (48 %) had 2 to 5 fits and 41.5 % of them had more than 10 fits; only 14 % say they have had an EEG. Presence of an Anti Epileptic Drug (77.5 %) reduces anxiety and depression. Considering a severity threshold of 5 for anxiety and 2 for depression (8), proportions of epileptic patients displaying a severe anxiety (79.8 %) or a severe depression (89.6 %) are significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than in control subjects (12.3 % and 46.9 %). Comparison of average scores confirms the difference (p < 0.0001) between cases (5.8 +/- 2.0 and 2.3 +/- 1.9) and controls (4.7 +/- 2.4 and 2.0 +/- 2.1) regarding anxiety and depression. Neither the sex, nor age, nor life environment (urban/ rural), nor frequency of fits hold significant influence over anxiety and depression. However, results in this survey include higher average rates of anxiety and depression for women (6.3 +/- 1.8) than men (5.5 +/- 1.8), though such statement is only nearly significant (p = 0.06). Results of the survey confirm the other works on this topic about characteristics of depression for epileptic patients, though results here are higher than usual. Anxiety and depression are common troubles found in epileptic patient, both often occurring at the same time. Two distinct theories about this fact are opposed, first explain the connection of anxiety and depression with epilepsy because of the social and cultural burden upon an epileptic patient in those countries, the second theory is about depression and epilepsy sharing some neuroaminergical dysfunctions; these facts were not considered in this survey. When taking into account the thresholds of seriousness on Goldberg's scale (8), proportion of controls displaying a probably deeper depression is high (46.9 %) compared to usual hospital prevalence rates (4 to 25 %) found in Western Africa where survey in general population are scarce (2, 5, 18). It could either be a bias in the selection or the confirmation that family and relatives of an epileptic patient are enduring a great psychic pain too; finally, this high rate of severe depression within controls may suggest a need to adapt thresholds of Goldberg's scale to match African populations. This hypothesis is interesting regarding the results of some authors who validated this scale in population of aged people; they highlighted the fewer precision of two items (lost of interest, focus difficulties) and also a slight discriminatory weight for other few items (12). However the psychometric characteristics of Goldberg's scale are accurate (for depression subscale, a sensitivity of 88 % and a specificity of 68 %; for the whole scale, a sensitivity of 84 % and a specificity of 68 %) (16). It would be pertinent to carry out a study to validate Goldberg's scale within some African populations. This study also highlights the importance of psychological factors in epilepsy and suggests a specific global care of the disease.
