Event-related EEG time-frequency analysis: An overview of measures and an analysis of early gamma band phase locking in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						time-frequency analysis; EEG; power; phase	NEURAL SYNCHRONY; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; HUMANS; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PERCEPTION; SPECTRUM	An increasing number of schizophrenia studies have been examining electroencephalography (EEG) data using time-frequency analysis, documenting illness-related abnormalities in neuronal oscillations and their synchronization, particularly in the gamma band. In this article, we review common methods of spectral decomposition of EEG, time-frequency analyses, types of measures that separately quantify magnitude and phase information from the EEG, and the influence of parameter choices on the analysis results. We then compare the degree of phase locking (ie, phase-locking factor) of the gamma band (36-50 Hz) response evoked about 50 milliseconds following the presentation of standard tones in 22 healthy controls and 21 medicated patients with schizophrenia. These tones were presented as part of an auditory oddball task performed by subjects while EEG was recorded from their scalps. The results showed prominent gamma band phase locking at frontal electrodes between 20 and 60 milliseconds following tone onset in healthy controls that was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia (P = .03). The finding suggests that the early-evoked gamma band response to auditory stimuli is deficiently synchronized in schizophrenia. We discuss the results in terms of pathophysiological mechanisms compromising event-related gamma phase synchrony in schizophrenia and further attempt to reconcile this finding with prior studies that failed to find this effect.

As human scalp EEG screening is error-prone, automatic artifact detection is an issue of capital importance, to ensure objective and reliable results. In this paper we propose a new approach for discrimination of muscular activity in the human scalp quantitative EEG (QEEG), based on the time-frequency shape analysis. The impact of the muscular activity on the EEG can be evaluated from this methodology. We present an application of this scoring as a preprocessing step for EEG signal analysis, in order to evaluate the amount of muscular activity for two set of EEG recordings for dementia patients with early stage of Alzheimer's disease and control age-matched subjects.

According to the results of our analysis of the EEG experimental data, the various EEG components followed different variations of rules in different directional memory phases (i.e., learn, maintain, and reproduce). The results indicated that the directional control of the BCI system can use different EEG signals in time and frequency domains. The results of the present study provide basic data for determining directional control of the BCI system.

The method consists of three steps: first, empirical modes are extracted from the signals; those functions carry non-linear and non-stationary components in frequency limited bands. Second, the empirical modes are Hilbert transformed, resulting in very sharply localized ridges in the time-frequency plane; the obtained time-frequency representations are known as Huang-Hilbert spectra. At last, the latter are pairwise aligned by means of the stochastic-event synchrony method (SES), a recently proposed procedure to match pairs of multi-dimensional point processes. The level of similarity of two Huang-Hilbert spectra is quantified by three parameters: timing and frequency jitter of coincident ridges, and fraction of non-coincident ridges. The proposed method is used to detect steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) in electroencephalography (EEG) signals; numerical results indicate that the method is vastly more sensitive to SSVEP than classical synchrony measures, and therefore, it may prove to be useful in applications such as brain-computer interfaces. Although the paper mostly deals with EEG, the presented synchrony measure may also be applied to other kinds of time series.

For multicomponent Signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG), since the trajectory rotates around multi-centers in the complex plane, phase is not meaningful. Usually Fourier based (linear) time-frequency decomposition (e.g. wavelet transform) has been used to analyze the degree of phase synchronization in each time-frequency bin. Considering the nonlinear nature of neuron Oscillations, in this paper, we analyze phase synchronization from a different view point. by decomposing the signal into several intrinsic modes using empirical mole decomposition (EMD), each of which can be nonlinear and non-stationary. The results obtained from simulated signals and real EEG signal indicate that EMD might be more accurate to the real dynamics of the oscillation process than time-frequency decomposition.

Genetic contributions to long-range temporal correlations in ongoing oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ongoing oscillations; long-range temporal correlations; twins; heritability; detrended fluctuation analysis; EEG	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; ANALYTIC PHASE; BACKGROUND EEG; TIME-SERIES; DYNAMICS	The amplitude fluctuations of ongoing oscillations in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the human brain show autocorrelations that decay slowly and remain significant at time scales up to tens of seconds. We call these long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). Abnormal LRTC have been observed in several brain pathologies, but it has remained unknown whether genetic factors influence the temporal correlation structure of ongoing oscillations. We recorded the ongoing EEG during eyes-closed rest in 390 monozygotic and dizygotic twins and investigated the temporal structure of ongoing oscillations in the alpha-and beta-frequency bands using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The strength of LRTC was more highly correlated in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. Statistical analysis attributed up to similar to 60% of the variance in DFA to genetic factors, indicating a high heritability for the temporal structure of amplitude fluctuations in EEG oscillations. Importantly, the DFA and EEG power were uncorrelated. LRTC in ongoing oscillations are robust, heritable, and independent of power, suggesting that LRTC and oscillation power are governed by distinct biophysical mechanisms and serve different functions in the brain. We propose that the DFA method is an important complement to classical spectral analysis in fundamental and clinical research on ongoing oscillations.	[Linkenkaer-Hansen, Klaus; Smit, Dirk J.

The method is based on modeling the EEG time series by linear autoregressive (AR) models with time dependent parameters. Systems described by such linear models can be interpreted as a set of coupled stochastically driven oscillators with time dependent frequencies and damping coefficients. It is an open question to which extent the estimated frequencies and dampings correspond to true properties of oscillatory eigenmodes in the underlying networks. The present study investigates this relationship using simple neural network models to generate artificial data with controllable properties. We demonstrate that the method detects changes of the eigenmodes induced by slow parameter changes of the network very well. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Twenty-one adults looked at emotional (sad, happy, fearful) or neutral faces. The results demonstrated that the emotional face elicited a negative peak at approximately 230 ms (N230). Moreover EEG measures showed that motivational significance of face (stimulus type) can modulate the amplitude of EEG, especially for theta and delta. Regression analysis showed that theta oscillations mainly effect as oscillation activity at the N2 latency. Thus, this frequency band variation could represent a complex set of cognitive processes, whereby selective attention becomes focused on an emotional relevant stimulus.

Since manual screening of human EEGs is inherently error prone and might induce experimental bias, automatic artifact detection is an issue of importance. Automatic artifact detection is the best guarantee for objective and clean results. We present a new approach, based on the time-frequency shape of muscular artifacts, to achieve reliable and automatic scoring. The impact of muscular activity on the signal can be evaluated using this methodology by placing emphasis on the analysis of EEG activity. The method is used to discriminate evoked potentials from several types of recorded muscular artifacts-with a sensitivity of 98.8% and a specificity of 92.2%. Automatic cleaning of EEG data is then successfully realized using this method, combined with independent component analysis. The outcome of the automatic cleaning is then compared with the Slepian multitaper spectrum based technique introduced by Delorme et al (2007 Neuroimage 34 1443-9).

The recent availability of electrophysiological techniques, such as magnetoencephalography, high-resolution electroencephalography and intra- and post-operative recordings in PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, allowed new approaches to record neuronal activity. Furthermore, the new application of signal analysis tools, such as the fast Fourier transformation, coherence, phase shifts, as well as causality measures, gave tremendous new insights into mechanisms of frequency-dependent oscillatory coupling. This review highlights these new analysis approaches, reviews the noninvasive magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography and intra- and post-operative data on PD patients, and summarizes the modern hypothesis that PD results from pathological oscillatory synchronization in the human sensorimotor system.

Comparison of spectral analysis methods for characterizing brain oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						oscillations; EEG; wavelets; multitapers; P-episode	HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; TIME; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; TRANSFORMATION; INTEGRATION; SIMULATION	Spectral analysis methods are now routinely used in electrophysiological studies of human and animal cognition. Although a wide variety of spectral methods has been used, the ways in which these methods differ are not generally understood. Here we use simulation methods to characterize the similarities and differences between three spectral analysis methods: wavelets, multitapers and P-episode. P-episode is a novel method that quantifies the fraction of time that oscillations exceed amplitude and duration thresholds. We show that wavelets and P-episode used side-by-side helps to disentangle length and amplitude of a signal. P-episode is especially sensitive to fluctuations around its thresholds, puts frequencies on a more equal footing, and is sensitive to long but low-amplitude signals. In contrast, multitaper methods are less sensitive to weak signals, but are very frequency-specific. If frequency specificity is not essential, then wavelets and P-episode are recommended.

Although recent work has identified brain areas that respond to multimodal stimuli, the temporal features are not clear yet. Earlier event-related potential studies revealed crossmodal attention effects, but did not focus on mechanisms underlying crossmodal integration. Here, electroencephalography (EEG) activity in the gamma band was considered as a correlate of multimodal integration. Participants localized a tactile stimulus on their fingers while seeing visual stimuli on rubber hands with the same posture as their hands. EEG analyses using wavelet transform suggested that interelectrode phase synchrony in the gamma-band range (40-50 Hz) was related to behavioral indices of the intermodal illusion under consideration. The findings suggest a role of high-frequency oscillations in the integrative processing of stimuli across modalities.

In the present study, we tested whether feedback also modulates the organization of neuronal oscillations. Ten college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits and revised them on the basis of an exogenous performance feedback. The EEG signal time-locked to feedback was convolved with a family of complex wavelets. The time-varying spectral entropy of the resulting time-frequency representation was then computed. The results showed that feedback differentially modulated spectral organization at frontal and posterior scalp regions around 200 ms and in the 300-500 ms range. Spatio-temporal principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that feedback-specific modulations essentially resulted from the interplay between fronto-polar, fronto-central, and parieto-occipital components. Functional and methodological implications were discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we aimed to recover the SSEP induced by right and left peroneal nerve stimulations from smearing EEG recordings using independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with a temporal SSEP template or the proposed time-frequency SSEP template. Since the SSEP is inevitably contaminated by artifacts and environmental noise, we employed ICA to decompose the EEG into a set of independent sources from which the SSEP-related features were automatically selected by the proposed template for reconstruction. Our results from three normal subjects and four stroke patients demonstrated that the proposed method could remarkably suppress the artifacts and effectively reconstruct SSEP waveforms in comparison with the conventional averaging method.

EEG auditory event-related potentials were collected from 14 healthy volunteers, and the statistical values of wavelet-transformed EEG in gamma band were decomposed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to identify where the differences appeared in the time, frequency and spatial domains. The results showed that the changes of brain states caused by SD appeared around 40 Hz at about 400 ms after stimulation on prefrontal and frontal lobes. Negative effects of SD on neuronal activity and oscillation were observed. The analysis of the EEG data by the wavelet transform and PARAFAC can be an integrated way to estimate the change of brain states in the three domains.

J	Willems, RM; Oostenveld, R; Hagoort, P				Willems, Roel M.; Oostenveld, Robert; Hagoort, Peter			Early decreases in alpha and gamma band power distinguish linguistic from visual information during spoken sentence comprehension	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						language; visual; EEG; oscillation; frequency; meaning	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MEMORY TASK; HUMAN EEG; WORDS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES	Language is often perceived together with visual information. This raises the question on how the brain integrates information conveyed in visual and/or linguistic format during spoken language comprehension. In this study we investigated the dynamics of semantic integration of visual and linguistic information by means of time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal. A modified version of the N400 paradigm with either a word or a picture of an object being semantically incongruous with respect to the preceding sentence context was employed. Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis showed qualitatively similar N400 effects for integration of either word or picture. Time-frequency analysis revealed early specific decreases in alpha and gamma band power for linguistic and visual information respectively. We argue that these reflect a rapid context-based analysis of acoustic (word) or visual (picture) form information. We conclude that although full semantic integration of linguistic and visual information occurs through a common mechanism, early differences in oscillations in specific frequency bands reflect the format of the incoming information and, importantly, an early context-based detection of its congruity with respect to the preceding language context.

The predominant high-frequency burst oscillations (> 7 Hz) were detected for each patient by means of time-variant amplitude spectrum analysis. Thereafter, the instantaneous envelope (IE) and the instantaneous frequency (IF) were computed for these low- and high-frequency bands to quantify amplitude-frequency dependencies (envelope-envelope, envelope-frequency, and frequency-frequency correlations). Time-variant phase-locking, phase synchronization, and quadratic phase couplings are associated with the observed amplitude-frequency characteristics. Additionally, these time-variant analyses were carried out for modeled burst patterns. Coupled Duffing oscillators were adapted to each EEG burst and by means of these models data-based burst simulations were generated. Results are: (1) strong envelope-envelope correlations (IE courses) can be demonstrated; (2) it can be shown that a rise of the IE is associated with an increase of the IF (only for the frequency bands 0.5-2.5 and 7-11 or 8-12 Hz); (3) the rise characteristics of all individually averaged envelope-frequency courses (IE-IF) are strongly correlated; (4) for the 7-11 or 8-12 Hz oscillation these associations are weaker and the variation between the time courses of the patients is higher; (5) for both frequency ranges a quantitative amplitude-frequency dependency can be shown because higher IE peak maxima are accompanied by stronger IF changes; (6) the time range of significant phase-locking within the 7-11 or 8-12 Hz frequency bands and of the strongest quadratic phase couplings (between 0.5-2.5 and 7-11 or 8-12 Hz) is between 0 and 1,000 ms; (7) all phase coupling characteristics of the modeled bursts accord well with the corresponding characteristics of the measured EEG burst data. All amplitude-frequency dependencies and phase locking/coupling properties described here are known from and can be discussed using coupled Duffing oscillators which are characterized by autoresonance properties.

The proposed method is based on the use Of the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWV) good resolution combined with McAulay-Quatieri (MQ) sinusoidal model to identify a neural discharge. The initial results show the algorithm as a suitable method to develop an automatic detector based on graphics patterns parameterized by the features present in the neural discharges on the time-frequency plane. We obtained three features based on energy, frequency and tracking and the algorithm is tested in an application with epileptic EEGs. We can isolate a continuous energy trace with other oscillations when the epileptic seizure is beginning. This characteristic is always present in 16 different seizures from 6 epileptic patients.

EEG power spectrum analysis for monitoring depth of anaesthesia during experimental surgery	LABORATORY ANIMALS			English	Review						depth of anaesthesia; monitoring; electroencephalography; power spectrum analysis	PARADOXICAL-AROUSAL REACTION; AUDITORY-EVOKED RESPONSES; NITROUS-OXIDE ANESTHESIA; BISPECTRAL INDEX; SURGICAL STIMULATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; NOXIOUS-STIMULATION; RETICULAR-FORMATION; PROPOFOL INFUSION; EDGE FREQUENCY	The first attempts to introduce computerized power spectrum analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as an intraoperative anaesthesia monitoring device started approximately 30 years ago. Since that time, the effects of various anaesthetic agents, sedative and analgesic drugs on the EEG pattern have been addressed in numerous studies in human patients and different animal species. These studies revealed dose-dependent changes in the EEG power spectrum for many intravenous and volatile anaesthetics. Moreover, EEG responses evoked by surgical stimuli during relative light levels of surgical anaesthesia have been classified as 'arousal' and 'paradoxical arousal' reaction, previously referred to as 'desynchronization' and 'synchronization', respectively. Contrasting reports on the correlation between quantitative EEG (QEEG) variables derived from power spectrum analysis (i.e. spectral edge frequency, median frequency) and simultaneously recorded clinical signs such as movement and haemodynamic responses, however, limited the routine use of intraoperative EEG monitoring. In addition, the appearance of EEG burst suppression pattern and isoelectricity at clinically relevant concentrations/doses of newer general anaestheties (i.e. isoflurane, sevoflurane, propofol) may have weakened the dose-related EEG changes previously reported. Despite these findings, the EEG power spectrum analysis may still provide valuable information during intraoperative monitoring in the individual subject. The information obtained from EEG power spectrum analysis may be further supplemented by newer EEG indices such as bispectral index and approximate entropy or other neurophysiological monitors including auditory evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials.

The validity of the evoked model has been questioned by studies arguing that ERPs are generated at least in part by a reset of ongoing oscillations. But a proof of phase reset that is distinct from the 'artificial' influence of evoked components on EEG phase-has been proven difficult for a variety of methodological reasons. We argue that a theoretical analysis of the assumptions and empirical evaluation of predictions of the evoked and oscillatory ERP model offer a promising way to shed new light on mechanisms generating ERPs that goes well beyond attempts to prove phase reset. Research on EEG oscillations documents that oscillations are task relevant and show a common operating principle, which is the control of the timing of neural activity. Both findings suggest that phase reorganization of task relevant oscillations is a theoretical necessity. We further argue and show evidence that (i) task relevant oscillations exhibit a typical interactive and task relevant relationship between pre- and poststimulus power in the theta and alpha frequency range in a way that small prestimulus power is related to large poststimulus power and vice versa, (ii) ERP (interpeak) latencies and (iii) ERP amplitudes reflect frequency characteristics of alpha and theta oscillations. We emphasize that central assumptions of the evoked model cannot be substantiated and conclude that the ERPR model offers a new way for an integrative interpretation of ongoing and event-related EEG phenomena.

Since EEG signals contain a wealth of information about brain functions, there are many approaches in analyzing EEG signals with spectral techniques. We have used short time Fourier transform (STFT) at 19 channel's of EEG for 10 Autism disorders (6-11 years old) and 9 age matched control subjects. The values were assessed with variance analysis. Results are shown that alpha band (8-12Hz) has 89.5% discriminate between two groups. Coherence measures at between total pairs (171 pairs) of 19 channels in three frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) of EEG are shown that there are more abnormalities at connectivity between left hemisphere and right temporal lobe with other lobs.

These so-called microstates assumingly correspond to basic units of cognition and emotion. On the other hand, Global Field Synchronization (GFS) is a frequency domain measure to estimate functional synchronization of brain processes on a global level for each EEG frequency band [Koenig, T., Lehmann, D., Saito, N., Kuginuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Koukkou, M., 2001. Decreased functional connectivity of EEG theta-frequency activity in first-episode, neuroleptic-naive patients with schizophrenia: preliminary results. Schizophr Res. 50, 55-60.]. Using these time and frequency domain analyzes, several previous studies reported shortened microstate duration in specific microstate classes and decreased GFS in theta band in drug naive schizophrenia compared to controls. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes of these EEG parameters after drug treatment in drug naive schizophrenia. EEG analysis was performed in 21 drug-naive patients and 21 healthy controls. 14 patients were reevaluated 2-8 weeks (mean 4.3) after the initiation of drug administration. The results extended findings of treatment effect on brain functions in schizophrenia, and imply that shortened duration of specific microstate classes seems a state marker especially in patients with later neuroleptic responsive, while lower theta GFS seems a state-related phenomenon and that higher gamma GFS is a trait like phenomenon.

Although researchers have argued that this temporal coding is critical in human memory and perception, no supporting data from humans have been reported. This study provides the first analysis of the temporal relationship between brain oscillations and single-neuron activity in humans. Recording from 1924 neurons, we find that neuronal activity in various brain regions increases at specific phases of brain oscillations. Neurons in widespread brain regions were phase locked to oscillations in the theta-(4-8 Hz) andgamma-(30-90 Hz) frequency bands. In hippocampus, phase locking was prevalent in the delta( 1-4 Hz) and gamma-frequency bands. Individual neurons were phase locked to various phases of theta and delta oscillations, but they only were active at the trough of gamma oscillations. These findings provide support for the temporal-coding hypothesis in humans. Specifically, they indicate that theta and delta oscillations facilitate phase coding and that gamma oscillations help to decode combinations of simultaneously active neurons.

In the present study, the dynamic changes of intracranially recorded median-nerve somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and somatosensory-induced gamma-oscillations were animated on a three-dimensional MR image, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of these activities were analysed in 10 children being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. Visual and quantitative assessments revealed that short-latency SEPs and somatosensory-induced gamma-oscillations predominantly involved the post-central gyrus and less intensely involved the pre-central gyrus and the anterior parietal lobule. Formation of a dipole of N20 peak with opposite polarities across the central sulcus was well delineated in animation movies. High-frequency (100-250 Hz) somatosensory-induced gamma-oscillations emerged in the post-central gyrus at 13.6-17.5 ms after median-nerve stimulation, gradually slowed down in frequency around and below 100 Hz, and progressively involved the neighbouring areas. A substantial proportion of somatosensory-induced gamma-oscillations was initially phase-locked and the proportion of a non-phase-locked component gradually increased over time. The primary motor hand areas proven by cortical stimulation frequently coincided with the sites showing the largest N20 peak and the largest somatosensory-induced gamma oscillations. In vivo animation of SEPs and somatosensory-induced gamma oscillations both may be utilized to localize the primary sensory-motor hand area in pre-surgical evaluation. The dipole on SEPs is consistent with the previously accepted notion that the cortices along the central sulcus are activated. The high-frequency somatosensory-induced gamma-oscillations in the post-central gyrus may represent the initial neural processing for external somatosensory stimuli, whereas the subsequent lower-frequency oscillations might represent the reafferent cortical activity occurring in larger cortical networks.

Analysis of EEG background activity in Autism disease patients with Bispectrum and STFT measure	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL 3: ADVANCES IN COMMUNICATIONS	Electrical and Computer Engineering Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th WSEAS International Conference on Circuits	JUL 23-25, 2007	Agios Nikolaos, GREECE			Bispectrum; STFT; EEG; Autism	EPILEPSY	Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for the evaluation and treatment of neurophysiologic disorders. Careful analysis of the EEG records can provide insight and improved understanding of the mechanism causing disorders. In this study we have investigated the EEG background activity in patients with Autism disease using frequency analysis methods. We calculated Bispectrum tansform, short time Fourier transform (STFT) and also STFT at bandwidth of total spectrum (we named it STFT-BW) for 21 channel of EEG. Coefficients of the EEG in 10 Autism patients and 7 age control subjects with the same age were measured. These coefficient assessments with variance analysis. We did not find any significant differences between Autism patients and control subjects EEGs with Bispectrum and STFT. On the other hand, Autism patients had significantly difference STFT at bandwidth (STFT-BW). At electrodes FP1, F3 and T5 with (p < 0.01) and F7, T3 and 01 with (p < 0.05) had significantly differences. In addition our findings suggested that STFT-BW can discriminate 82.4% between normal and Autism subject with mahalanobis distance.

Electrophysiological markers of skill-related neuroplasticity	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG; skill learning; neuroplasticity	MULTIPLICATION FACTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; POWER-LAW; MEMORY; AUTOMATIZATION; RECOLLECTION; VERIFICATION; ACTIVATION; DIFFICULTY; LANGUAGE	Neuroplasticity involved in acquiring a new cognitive skill was investigated with standard time domain event-related potentials (ERPs) of scalp-recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and frequency domain analysis of EEG oscillations looking at the event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) of neural activity. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded before and after practice, while participants performed alphabet addition (i.e., E + 3 = G, true or false?). Participant's performance became automated with practice through a switch in cognitive strategy from mentally counting-up in the alphabet to retrieving the answer from memory. Time domain analysis of the ERPs revealed a prominent positive peak at similar to 300 ms that was not reactive to problem attributes but was reduced with practice. A second prominent positive peak observed at similar to 500 ms was found to be larger after practice, mainly for problems presented with correct answers. Frequency domain spectral analyses yielded two distinct findings: (1) a frontal midline ERS of theta activity that was greater after practice, and (2) a beta band ERD that increased with problem difficulty before, but not after practice. Because the EEG oscillations were not phase locked to the stimulus, they were viewed as being independent of the time domain results. Consequently, use of time and frequency domain analyses provides a more comprehensive account of the underlying electrophysiological data than either method alone. When used in combination with a well-defined cognitive/behavioral paradigm, this approach serves to constrain the interpretations of EEG data and sets a new standard for studying the neuroplasticity involved in skill acquisition.

Four children (aged 7, 9, 10 and 16 years) with intractable left-hemispheric focal epilepsy underwent extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) as well as language mapping using neurostimulation and auditory-language-induced gamma-oscillations on ECoG. The audible communication was recorded concurrently and integrated with ECoG recording to allow for accurate time lock on ECoG analysis. In three children, who successfully completed the auditory-language task, high-frequency gamma-augmentation sequentially involved: i) the posterior superior temporal gyrus when listening to the question, ii) the posterior lateral temporal region and the posterior frontal region in the time interval between question completion and the patient's vocalization, and iii) the pre-and post-central gyri immediately preceding and during the patient's vocalization. The youngest child, with attention deficits, failed to cooperate during the auditory-language task, and high-frequency gamma-augmentation was noted only in the posterior superior temporal gyrus when audible questions were given. The size of language areas suggested by statistically significant high-frequency gamma-augmentation was larger than that defined by neurostimulation. The present method can provide in vivo imaging of electrophysiological activities over the language network areas during language processes. Further studies are warranted to determine whether recording of language-induced gamma-oscillations can supplement language mapping using neurostimulation in presurgical evaluation of children with focal epilepsy.

Most of them fall in the domain of human-computer interfaces (HCIs) designed for interaction between brain, eyes, body and computer or robot. For brain signal acquisition several technologies have been applied, for example electroencephalography (EEG), magneto encephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Portability and cost effectiveness problems channeled BCI systems to exploit EEG signals mostly. This paper presents a methodology and recommended parameter setting, for representation in time-frequency scale of EEG signals. It refines the detection of event-related changes in the signals, revealing specific patterns of rhythms, for actual and intended physical movement. The result shows that, with well defined window length it is possible to improve localization of specific frequencies within the brain activity. This lead to the fact that actual muscle activity form could be identified from EEG signals. Using the referenced methodology a wide range of HCIs systems can be designed to perform specific tasks for the benefit of the end-user.

We used a Virtual Reality driving simulator consisted of a hydraulic hexapod motion platform to create practical driving events. We compared the EEG dynamics in response to kinesthetic stimulus while the platform was in motion, to that while the platform was stationary. The scalp-recorded EEG channel signals were first separated into independent brain sources using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and then studied with time-frequency analysis. Our results showed that independent brain processes near the somatomotor cortex exhibited alpha power decreases across sessions and subjects. Negative potentials phase-locked to the onsets of deviation events under motion conditions were observed in a central midline component. The results allow us to better understand different brain networks involved in driving, and provide a foundation for studying event-related EEG activities in the presence of kinesthetic stimuli.

To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of event-related brain responses, Most studies rely on across-trial averaging in the time domain, a procedure that is, however, blind to a significant fraction of the elicited cortical activity. Here, we outline the key concepts underlying the limitations of time-domain averaging and consider three alternative methodological approaches that have received increasing interest: time-frequency decomposition of the EEG (using the continuous wavelet transform), blind source separation of the EEG (using Independent Component Analysis) and the analysis of event-related brain responses at the level of single trials. In addition we provide practical guidelines on the implementation of these methods and on the interpretation of the results they produce. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Iannetti, G.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the pattern of functional organization of EEG broad bands and coherent activity during rest by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with closed and open eyes of 28 men and women. PCA revealed patterns of covariant oscillatory activity and functionally related regions with covariant coherent activity present during resting conditions, different for open and closed eyes. Different patterns of covariant oscillations within alpha frequencies were identified consistent with current notions on overlapping frequencies with different origin and behavioral context. Covariant coherent cortical networks were revealed congruent with functional systems described during cognitive processes; one, linking regions involved in visuo-motor coordination, another in language, and a third one in visuo-spatial processes suggesting that strong functional links are present during rest.

Without relying on head modeling BSS aims at estimating both the waveform and the scalp spatial pattern of the intracranial dipolar Current responsible of the observed EEG. In this review we begin by placing the BSS linear instantaneous model of EEG within the framework of brain volume conduction theory. We then review the concept and Current practice of BSS based on second-order statistics (SOS) and on higher-order statistics (HOS), the latter better known as independent component analysis (ICA). Using neurophysiological knowledge we consider the fitness of SOS-based and HOS-based methods for the extraction of spontaneous and induced EEG and their separation from extra-cranial artifacts. We then illustrate a general BSS scheme operating in the time-frequency domain using SOS only. The scheme readily extends to further data expansions in order to Capture experimental Source of variations as well. A simple and efficient implementation based on the approximate joint diagonalization of Fourier cospectral matrices is described (AJDC), We conclude discussing useful aspects of BSS analysis of EEG, including its assumptions and limitations.

Current methods for computing phase synchrony are limited to the estimation of the stability of the phase difference between pairs of Signals over a time window, within successive frequency bands. These approaches cannot quantify the synchrony across a group of electrodes and over time-varying frequency regions from multiple trials. In this paper, we address this issue by quantifying the frequency locking between groups of electrodes using a time-frequency based estimation of the instantaneous frequency. The instantaneous frequency maps of individual electrodes are combined to obtain the instantaneous frequency histogram as an estimate of the amount of frequency locking across electrodes. This analysis is then extended to the estimation of frequency locking across multiple electrodes and trials. Results are shown for both synthetic signal models and electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from control and schizophrenic subjects.

Careful analysis of the EEG records can provide insight and improved understanding of the mechanism causing disorders. In this study we have investigated the EEG background activity in patients with Autism disease using frequency analysis methods. We calculated LZ complexity, Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and also STFT at bandwith of total spectrum (we name it STFT_BW) for 19 channels of EEG. Coefficients of the EEG in 11 Autism patients and 10 age control subjects with the same age were measured. These coefficient assessments with variance analysis. We find no significant different between Autism disorders and control subjects EEGs with STFT. On the other hand, Autism disorders had significantly difference LZ complexity value (p<0.05) at electrodes F7, T3 and T5. STFT at bandwidth (STFT_BW) had excellent different.

The ERP results demonstrated that the emotional face elicited a negative peak at approximately 230 ms (N2). Moreover, EEG measures showed that motivational significance of face (emotional vs. neutral) could modulate the amplitude of EROs, but only for some frequency bands (i.e. theta and gamma bands). In a second phase, we considered the resemblance of the two EEG measures by a regression analysis. It revealed that theta and gamma oscillations mainly effect as oscillation activity at the N2 latency. Finally, a posterior increased power of theta was found for emotional faces.

Methods: We retrospectively studied nine children (four girls, five boys; 4-17 yr) who presented with intractable extrahippocampal localization-related epilepsy and who underwent extraoperative video subdural EEG (1000 Hz sampling rate) and cortical resection. We performed multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA) to evaluate the frequency, time course, and distribution of ictal HFOs. We compared ictal HFO changes before and after clinical onset and postsurgical seizure outcomes. Results: Seventy-eight of 79 seizures showed HFOs. We observed wide-band HFOs (similar to 250Hz, similar to 120 electrodes) in six patients either with partial seizures alone (three patients) or with epileptic spasms (three patients). Three patients with partial seizures that secondarily generalized had wide-band HFOs (similar to 170 Hz) before clinical onset and sustained narrow-band HFOs (60-164 Hz) with electrodecremental events after clinical onset (similar to 28 electrodes). In four postoperatively seizure-free patients, more electrodes recorded higher-frequency HFOs inside the resection area than outside before and after clinical seizure onset. In five patients with residual seizures, electrodes recorded more HFOs that were of higher or equal frequency outside the surgical area than inside after clinical onset. Conclusion: For partial seizures alone and epileptic spasms, more electrodes recorded only wide-band HFOs; for partial seizures that secondarily generalized, fewer electrodes recorded wide-band HFOs, but in these seizures electrodes also recorded subsequent sustained narrow-band ictal HFOs. Resection of those brain regions having electrodes with ictal, higher HFOs resulted in postsurgical seizure-free outcomes.

However, to date the test-retest reliability of these oscillations has not been studied systematically. Methods: We recorded EEG activity of 12 healthy volunteers in response to stimuli of different sizes. Each participant took part in two sessions separated by two weeks in time. To obtain an estimate of the reliability of evoked gamma band responses (GBRs), we compared frequency and magnitude of phase-locked EEG oscillations between sessions. Results: In response to large stimuli magnitude and frequency of the evoked GBR yielded significant reliability. However, this was not the case for Stimuli which were too small to evoke detectable GBRs. Conclusion: The results are in accordance with studies demonstrating a dependence of gamma oscillations on stimulus parameters. Significance: The current findings Suggest that using appropriate stimulation, the evoked gamma response has sufficient test-retest reliability for use in assessing clinical changes in neurophysiological status.

However, the precise timing and functional meaning of the resulting activations are poorly understood. We studied the electroencephalographic response time locked to positive and negative performance feedback in a hypothesis testing paradigm. The signal was convoluted with a family of complex wavelets. Intracranial sources of activity at various narrow-band frequencies were estimated in the 100- to 400-ms time window following feedback onset. Positive and negative feedback were associated to 1) early parahippocampo-cingular sources of alpha oscillations, more posteriorly located and long lasting for negative feedback and to 2) late partially overlapping neural. circuits comprising regions in prefrontal, cingular, and temporal cortices but operating at feedback-specific latencies and frequencies. The results were interpreted in the light of neurophysiological models of feedback and were used to discuss methodological issues in the study of high-level cognitive functions, including reasoning and decision making.

The method can be applied for transient activity (e.g. event-related potentials) as well as for oscillatory activity (e.g. gamma bursts), and for both evoked or induced activity. In order to benefit from all the structure present in the data, the method account-Is for (i) spatial structure of the data via multivariate decomposition, (ii) time-frequency structure via atomic decomposition and (iii) reproducibility across trials via a constraint on parameter dispersion. Moreover, a novel iterative method is introduced for estimating the initial time-frequency atoms used in the non-linear fit. Numerical experiments show that the method is robust to low signal-to-noise conditions, and that the introduction of the constraint on parameter dispersion significantly improves the quality of the fit.

Among the non-invasive techniques for probing human brain dynamics, electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measure of cortical activity with millisecond temporal resolution. Early attempts to analyse EEG data relied on visual inspection of EEG records. Since the introduction of EEG recordings, the volume of data generated from a study involving a single patient has increased exponentially. Therefore, automation based on pattern classification techniques have been applied with considerable success. In this study, a multi-step approach for the classification of EEG signal has been adopted. We have analysed sets of EEG time series recording from healthy volunteers with open eyes and intracranial EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy during ictal (seizure) periods. In the present work, we have employed a discrete wavelet transform to the EEG data in order to extract temporal information in the form of changes in the frequency domain over time - that is they are able to extract non-stationary signals embedded in the noisy background of the human brain. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Rough Sets have been used to reduce the data dimensionality. A multi-classifier scheme consists of LVQ2.1 neural networks have been developed for the classification task. The experimental results validated the proposed methodology.

A comparative study of automatic techniques for ocular artifact reduction in spontaneous EEG signals based on clinical target variables: A simulation case	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); electrooculography (EOG); ocular filtering; regression analysis; blind source separation (BSS); principal component analysis (PCA); independent component analysis (ICA)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EYE-MOVEMENT; REMOVAL; SEPARATION	Eye movement artifacts represent a critical issue for quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analysis and a number of mathematical approaches have been proposed to reduce their contribution in EEG recordings. The aim of this paper was to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of ocular filtering methods with respect to spectral target variables widely used in clinical and functional EEG studies. In particular the following methods were applied: regression analysis and some blind source separation (BSS) techniques based on second-order statistics (PCA, AMUSE and SOBI) and on higher-order statistics (JADE, INFOMAX and FASTICA). Considering blind source decomposition methods, a completely automatic procedure of BSS based on logical rules related to spectral and topographical information was proposed in order to identify the components related to ocular interference. The automatic procedure was applied in different montages of simulated EEG and electrooculography (EOG) recordings: a full montage with 19 EEG and 2 EOG channels, a reduced one with only 6 EEG leads and a third one where EOG channels were not available. Time and frequency results in all of them indicated that AMUSE and SOB] algorithms preserved and recovered more brain activity than the other methods mainly at anterior regions. In the case of full montage: (i) errors were lower than 5% for all spectral variables at anterior sites; and (ii) the highest improvement in the signal-to-artifact (SAR) ratio was obtained up to 40 dB at these anterior sites. Finally, we concluded that second-order BSS-based algorithms (AMUSE and SOBI) provided an effective technique for eye movement removal even when EOG recordings were not available or when data length was short.

The time-varying nature of the newborn EEG seizure can be characterized by time-frequency representations (TFRs) such as quadratic time-frequency distributions. The underlying time-frequency signatures of newborn EEG seizure, however, can be severely masked by short-time and high amplitude (STHA), or impulsive, artefacts. This type of artefact can be modelled as heavy-tailed noise. Robust time-frequency distributions (RTFDs) have been proposed as methods for TFRs which are robust to heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we investigate the use of RTFDs for representing the underlying time-frequency,characteristics of newborn EEG seizure in the presence of STHA artefacts.

Our previous works showed that Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) can effectively perform atomic decomposition of the time-varying EEG spectrum in space/frequency/time domain. In this study, we propose to use PARAFAC for extracting significant activities in EEG data that is concurrently recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and employ the temporal signature of the atom for investigating the relation between brain electrical activity and the changing of BOLD signal that reflects cerebral blood flow. We evaluated the statistical significance of dynamical effect of BOLD respect to EEG based on the modeling of BOLD signal by plain autoregressive model (AR), its AR with exogenous EEG input (ARX) and ARX with nonlinear term (ARNX).

Gamma amplitudes are coupled to theta phase in human EEG during visual perception	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related oscillations; phase; time-frequency analysis	BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES	Human subjects typically keep about seven items (plus or minus two) in short-term memory (STM). A theoretical neuronal model has been proposed to explain this phenomenon with physiological parameters of brain oscillations in the gamma and theta frequency range, i.e., roughly 30-80 and 4-8 Hz, respectively. In that model, STM capacity equals the number of gamma cycles (e.g., 25 ms for 40 Hz), which fit into one theta cycle (e.g., 166 ms for 6 Hz). The model is based on two assumptions: (1) theta activity should modulate gamma activity; and (2) the theta/gamma ratio should correlate with human STM capacity. The first assumption is supported by electrophysiological data showing that the amplitude of gamma oscillations is modulated by the phase of theta activity. However, so far, this has only been demonstrated for intracranial recordings. We analyzed human event-related EEG oscillations recorded in a memory experiment in which 13 subjects perceived known and unknown visual stimuli. The paradigm revealed event-related oscillations in the gamma range, which depended significantly on the phase of simultaneous theta activity. Our data are the first scalp-recorded human EEG recordings revealing a relationship between the gamma amplitude and the phase of theta oscillations, supporting the first assumption of the above-mentioned theory. Interestingly, the involved frequencies revealed a 7:1 ratio. However, this ratio does not necessarily determine human STM capacity. Since such a correlation was not explicitly tested in our paradigm, our data are not conclusive about the second assumption. Instead of theta phase modulating gamma amplitude, it is also conceivable that focal gamma activity needs to be downsampled to theta activity, before it can interact with more distant brain regions.

Although this "streaking effect" has been known for decades, the underlying neural network phenomena have remained largely unidentified. We examined the dynamics of human behavioral performance and its correlation with infraslow (0.01-0.1 Hz) fluctuations in ongoing brain activity. Full-band electroencephalography revealed prominent infraslow fluctuations during the execution of a somatosensory detection task. Similar fluctuations were predominant also in the dynamics of behavioral performance. The subjects' ability to detect the sensory stimuli was strongly correlated with the phase, but not with the amplitude of the infraslow EEG fluctuations. These data thus reveal a direct electrophysiological correlate for the slow fluctuations in human psychophysical performance. We then examined the correlation between the phase of infraslow EEG fluctuations and the amplitude of 1-40 Hz neuronal oscillations in six frequency bands. Like the behavioral performance, the amplitudes in these frequency bands were robustly correlated with the phase of the infraslow fluctuations. These data hence suggest that the infraslow fluctuations reflect the excitability dynamics of cortical networks. We conclude that ongoing 0.01-0.1 Hz EEG fluctuations are prominent and functionally significant during execution of cognitive tasks.	[Monto, Simo; Palva, Satu; Palva, J.

The time duration of a coherent signal is estimated using a time window that adapts its length and position to locally maximize the periodogram. Since this technique determines a signal's coherent length, it achieves optimal resolution in both the time and frequency domain. We apply this technique to analyze the EEG data of two seizure events. During the seizures, the dominant frequency evolved continuously from about 8 Hz to 1 Hz. Before the seizures, there existed a weak signal at 8 Hz, which was clearly manifested in the coherent time. These preliminary results suggest that APT is a useful EEG analysis tool.

This work investigates whether the semantic properties of words partly determine the topography of such networks. Subjects performed a visual lexical decision task while their EEG was recorded. We compared the EEG responses to nouns with either visual semantic properties (VIS, referring to colors and shapes) or with auditory semantic properties (AUD, referring to sounds). A time-frequency analysis of the EEG revealed power increases in the theta (4-7 Hz) and lower-beta (13-18 Hz) frequency bands, and an early power increase and subsequent decrease for the alpha (8-12 Hz) band. In the theta band we observed a double dissociation: temporal electrodes showed larger theta power increases in the AUD condition, while occipital leads showed larger theta responses in the VIS condition. The results support the notion that semantic representations are stored in functional networks with a topography that reflects the semantic properties of the stored items, and provide further evidence that oscillatory brain dynamics in the theta frequency range are functionally related to the retrieval of lexical semantic information.

In the monitoring system, a frequency domain inverse operator is preliminarily constructed, considering the subject's anatomical information and sensor configurations, and then the spectral current power at each cortical vertex is calculated for the Fourier transforms of successive sections of continuous data, when a particular frequency band is given. A preliminary offline simulation study using four sets of artifact-free, eye-closed, resting EEG data acquired from two dementia patients and two normal subjects demonstrates that spatiotemporal changes of cortical rhythmic activity can be monitored at the cortical level with a maximal delay time of about 200 ms, when 18 channel EEG data are analyzed under a Pentium4 3.4 GHz environment. The first pilot system is applied to two human experiments-( 1) cortical alpha rhythm changes induced by opening and closing eyes and ( 2) cortical mu rhythm changes originated from the arm movements - and demonstrated the feasibility of the developed system.

The essence of the method using the IEBW is to track bandwidths changes of EEG signals. The instantaneous equivalent band-widths are defined using positive time-frequency distributions. However, it is well known that non-negative bilinear distributions that satisfy the marginals do not exist. To solve the problem, Copula-based time-frequency distributions have been adopted and we have also modified the construction method suitable for non-stationary random signals. The method was applied to EEG analysis in the wakefulness maintenance state against sleepiness. In our present study, sporadic synchronization was shown in the EEG signals while the subjects were trying to maintain wakefulness against sleepiness. That is, synchronization and desynchronization seem to succeed each other in the period. The results imply that the proposed method can track the EBWs change of EEG signals.

The use of time-frequency distributions for epileptic seizure detection in EEG recordings	2007 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-16	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 22-26, 2007	Lyon, FRANCE	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			CLASSIFICATION; LONG	Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy, which is a serious brain dynamic disorder. The analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings provides valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. An epileptic seizure is usually identified by polyspike activity; rhythmic waves for a wide variety of frequencies and amplitudes as well as spike-and-wave complexes. The detection of all these waveforms in the EEG is a crucial component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-frequency analysis is particularly effective for representing various aspects of nonstationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. In this paper a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using time-frequency analysis, and classification using artificial neural network, is introduced. EEG segments are analyzed using a time-frequency distribution and then, several features are extracted for each segment representing the energy distribution over the time-frequency plane. The features are used for the training of a,neural network. Short-time Fourier transform and several time-frequency distributions are compared. The proposed approach is tested using a publicly available database and satisfactory results are obtained (89-100% accuracy).

However, it could not reflect the dynamic properties changing with time. Time-varying coherence analysis is a method developed on base of classic coherence analysis and signal's joint time-frequency representations in recent years. It was used to extract transient characteristics of the interactions among brain areas and describe the temporal, spatial and frequency relationships of brain activities. This paper discussed the probability of applying time-varying coherence to event related EEG to study the coordination mechanism of brain. Aimed at the applications of time-varying coherence analysis methods based on non-parameter estimation and multi-variant parameter model to EEG, we constructed the simulated EEG data, looked for the suitable approach for cognitive EEG and tried to apply it to the EEG data from classic Stroop effect. The results showed that appropriate time-varying analysis methods were effective tools for event related EEG to study the coordination between brain areas.

Each of these three studied events evoked differential EEG oscillatory changes. Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central electrodes, decreased high alpha activation on frontal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal electrodes. Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal electrodes, increased low alpha activation on frontal electrodes, increased high alpha activation on frontal, central, and parietal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal and central electrodes. It is suggested that the EEG oscillations evoked by picking up bananas reflect increased cortical activation and arousal; the oscillations evoked by falling off the edge of the game board reflect motor functions; and the oscillations evoked by reaching the goal reflect a relaxed state. Thus, EEG may turn out to be a valuable tool when examining psychological responses to video game events.

Reduced complexity space-time-frequency model for multi-channel EEG and its applications	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-11	IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	MAY 27-30, 2007	New Orleans, LA	IEEE				Searching for an efficient summarization of multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) behavior is a challenging signal analysis problem. Recently, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is reported as an efficient tool for extracting features of multi-channel EEG by simultaneously employing space-time-frequency knowledge, i.e. decomposing multi-channel EEG signal into a linear combination of its space-time-frequency feature. However, this decomposition scheme suffers from expensive computational load when applied to either long term or high number of channels EEG signals. In this paper, a reduced computational complexity space-time-frequency model for multi-channel EEG signal is proposed by dividing selected content into segments yielding additional segment signatures. By carefully selecting the number of segments, features extracted from the proposed model are comparable with those from the conventional space-time-frequency model while the time used in computation is reduced by more than 50%. Simulation results show that the proposed model can efficiently extract eye blink artifact from background EEG. Furthermore, classification accuracy when employing the proposed model to brain computer interface (BCI) application is also comparable with the conventional model.

In the animal brain it has been shown that the phase of cortical oscillations is related to the exact timing of neural activity. The potential role of oscillatory phase and phase synchronization for the explanation of cortical information processing has been largely underestimated in the human EEG until now. Here it is argued that EEG phase (synchronization) reflects the exact timing of communication between distant but functionally related neural populations, the exchange of information between global and local neuronal networks, and the sequential temporal activity of neural processes in response to incoming sensory stimuli. Three different kinds of phase synchronization are discussed: (i) phase coupling between brain sites, (ii) phase synchronization across frequencies, and (iii) phase-locking to external events. In this review recent work is presented demonstrating that EEG phase synchronization provides valuable information about the neural correlates of various cognitive processes, and that it leads to a better understanding of how memory and attention Processes are interrelated.

Development of the spontaneous activity transients and ongoing cortical activity in human preterm babies	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						FbEEG; DC-EEG; EEG; infraslow; neonatal; premature	DEVELOPING NETWORKS; EEG; INFANTS; PATTERNS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NEWBORN; CORTEX; BRAIN; WAVES; TERM	Recent experimental studies have shown that developing cortex in several animals species, including humans, exhibits spontaneous intermittent activity that is believed to be crucial for the proper wiring of early brain networks. The present study examined the developmental changes in these spontaneous activity transients (SAT) and in other ongoing cortical activities in human preterm babies. Full-band electroencephalography (FbEEG) recordings were obtained from 16 babies at conceptional ages between 32.8 and 40 wk. We examined the SATs and the intervening ongoing cortical activities (inter-SAT; iSAT) with average waveforms, their variance and power, as well as with wavelet-based time-frequency analyses. Our results show, that the low frequency power and the variance of the average waveform of SAT decrease during development. There was a simultaneous increase in the activity at higher frequencies, with most pronounced increase at theta-alpha range (4-9 Hz). In addition to the overall increase, the activity at higher frequencies showed an increased grouping into bursts that are nested in the low frequency (0.5-1 Hz) waves. Analysis of the iSAT epochs showed a developmental increase in power at lower frequencles in quiet sleep. There was an increase in a wide range of higher frequencies (4-16 Hz), whereas the ratio of beta (1630 Hz) and theta-alpha (4-9 Hz) range activity declined, indicating a preferential increase at theta-alpha range activity. Notably, SAT and iSAT activities remained distinct throughout the development in all measures used in our study. The present results are consistent with the idea that SAT and the other ongoing cortical activities are distinct functional entities. Recognition of these two basic mechanisms in the cortical activity in preterm human babies opens new rational approaches for an evaluation and monitoring of early human brain function. (c) 2007 IBRO.

The analysis of EEG data is difficult due to the fact that multiple neurons may be simultaneously active and the potentials from these sources are superimposed on the limited sensors. It is desirable to unmix the data into signals representing the behavior of the original individual neurons. This is a problem of underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS). Since EEG signals are non-stationary, in this paper a two-stage UBSS approach is proposed for the separation of EEG signals by taking advantage of the high resolution of time-frequency distributions. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the introduced approach at separating EEG signals in the time-frequency domain compared with independent component analysis (ICA).

Based oil a previously elaborated theory of electrocortical rhythmogenesis we developed a physiologically inspired method of EEG analysis that was hypothesized to be more sensitive in detecting and characterizing N2O effect than the bispectral index. through its combined EEG estimates of cortical input and cortical state. By evaluating sevoflurane-induced loss of consciousness in the presence of low brain concentrations of N2O in 38 elective surgical patients, N2O was associated with a statistically reduction in the input the frontal cortex received from other cortical and subcortical areas. In contrast the bispectral index responded only to low. but not to high, concentrations of N2O. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Liley, David T.

Effects of surface EMG rectification on power and coherence analyses: An EEG and MEG study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						power spectrum; frequency; electromyography (EMG); electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG)	CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; PHYSIOLOGICAL TREMOR; MOTOR CORTEX; HAND MUSCLE; AMPLITUDE; ELECTROMYOGRAMS; OSCILLATIONS; CONTRACTION	Coherence between electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is frequently examined to gain insights on neuromuscular binding. Commonly, EMG signals are rectified before coherence is computed. However, the appropriateness of EMG rectification in computing EMG-EEG/MEG coherence has never been validated. Since rectification is a non-linear operation and alters the EMG power spectrum, such a validation is important to ensure the accuracy of coherence calculation. In this study we experimentally investigated the effects of EMG rectification on EMG power spectra and its coherence with EEG/MEG signals. Subjects performed sustained isometric index finger abduction at similar to 5-10% maximal voluntary force (in both EEG-EMG and MEG-EMG experiments) and index finger tapping at similar to 2-4Hz (in EEG-EMG experiment only). Bipolar surface EMG data from the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and EEG/MEG signals from the contralateral primary sensorimotor area (C3) were recorded simultaneously. Power spectra and coherence with the EEGIMEG were calculated before and after EMG rectification. The results show that rectification shifts EMG power to lower frequencies, possibly enhancing peaks of motor unit firing. Coherences with the EEG/MEG signals were not significantly changed by EMG rectification, indicating EMG rectification is overall an appropriate procedure in power and coherence analyses.

The authors investigated EEG responses in schizophrenia patients and healthy comparison subjects following the application of TMS to the premotor cortex. Method: Sixteen schizophrenia patients and 14 healthy comparison subjects were recruited to participate in the study. Participants underwent three to five TMS/high- density EEG sessions at various TMS doses. The following three aspects of TMS-evoked responses were analyzed: amplitude, synchronization, and source localization. Results: Relative to healthy comparison subjects, schizophrenia patients had a marked decrease in evoked gamma oscillations that occurred within the first 100 msec after TMS, particularly in a cluster of electrodes located in a fronto-central region. These oscillations were significantly reduced in amplitude (calculated using global-mean field power and event-related spectral perturbation analysis) and synchronization (measured using intertrial coherence). Furthermore, source modeling analysis revealed that the TMS-evoked brain activation underlying these gamma oscillations in patients with schizophrenia did not propagate (as it did in healthy comparison subjects) and was mostly confined to the stimulated brain region. Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients showed a decrease in EEG-evoked responses in the gamma band when TMS was applied to directly stimulate the frontal cortex while these responses were recorded. Since EEG responses to direct cortical stimulation are not affected by an individual's motivation, attention, or cognitive capacity and are not relayed through peripheral afferent pathways, these findings suggest that there might be an intrinsic dysfunction in frontal thalamocortical circuits in individuals with schizophrenia.

Spectrotemporal analysis of evoked and induced electroencephalographic responses in primary auditory cortex (A1) of the awake monkey	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory evoked potentials; EEG; electroencephalography; gamma activity; tonotopic organization	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL PLANE; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; POPULATION RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; MACAQUE; REPRESENTATION; DYNAMICS	Electroencephalography is increasingly being used to probe the functional organization of auditory cortex. Modulation of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal by tones was examined in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake monkeys. EEG data were measured at 4 laminar depths defined by current source density profiles evoked by best frequency (BF) tones. Midlaminar multiunit activity was used to define the tuning characteristics of A1 sites. Presentation of BF tones increased EEG power across the range of frequencies examined (4-290 Hz), with maximal effects evident within the first 100 ms after stimulus onset. The largest relative increases in EEG power generally occurred at very high gamma frequency bands (130-210 Hz). Increases in EEG power for frequencies less than 70 Hz primarily represented changes in phase-locked activity, whereas increases at higher frequencies primarily represented changes in non-phase-locked activity. Power increases in higher gamma bands were better correlated with the A1 tonotopic organization than power increases in lower frequency bands. Results were similar across the 4 laminar depths examined. These findings highlight the value of examining high-frequency EEG components in exploring the functional organization of auditory cortex and may enhance interpretation of related studies in humans.

Using the techniques of EEG-EMG coherence and cumulant analysis and pooled coherence and cumulant analysis we demonstrate that between childhood, adolescence and adulthood there are increases in the prevalence and magnitude of coherence at frequencies between 15 and 35 Hz with corresponding development of a tri-phasic feature in the EEG-EMG cumulant. The results show for the first time that changes in the cortical similar to 20 Hz oscillatory drive to human motoneurone pools take place during motor development.

For this reason, the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the most dependable tool used for detecting seizures in newborns. Given nonstationary and multicomponent EEG signals, time-frequency (TF) based methods were found to be very suitable for the analysis of such signals. The TF domain techniques are utilized to extract TF signatures that are characteristic of EEG seizures. In this paper, multichannel EEG signals are processed using a TF matched filter to detect and to geometrically localize neonatal EEG seizures. The threshold used to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure is data-dependent and is set using the EEG background. Multichannel geometrical correlation, based on a concept of incidence matrix, was utilized to further enhance the performance of the detector.	[Khlif, M.

Previous studies found that some psychotropic drugs had EEG effects opposite to the EEG effects of the mental disorders treated with these drugs (key-lock principle). Objectives We performed a placebo-controlled pharmaco-EEG study on two conventional antipsychotics (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and four atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, perospirone, quetiapine, and risperidone) in healthy volunteers. We investigated differences between conventional and atypical drug effects and whether the drug effects were compatible with the key-lock principle. Methods Fourteen subjects underwent seven EEG recording sessions, one for each drug (dosage equivalent of 1 mg haloperidol). In a time-domain analysis, we quantified the EEG by identifying clusters of transiently stable EEG topographies (microstates). Frequency-domain analysis used absolute power across electrodes and the location of the center of gravity (centroid) of the spatial distribution of power in different frequency bands. Results Perospirone increased duration of a microstate class typically shortened in schizophrenics. Haloperidol increased mean microstate duration of all classes, increased alpha 1 and beta 1 power, and tended to shift the beta 1 centroid posterior. Quetiapine decreased alpha 1 power and shifted the centroid anterior in both alpha bands. Olanzapine shifted the centroid anterior in alpha 2 and beta 1. Conclusions The increased microstate duration under perospirone and haloperidol was opposite to effects previously reported in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a key-lock mechanism. The opposite centroid changes induced by olanzapine and quetiapine compared to haloperidol might characterize the difference between conventional and atypical antipsychotics.

Diffuse sleep spindles show similar frequency in central and frontopolar positions	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						sleep EEG; sleep spindles; automated analysis; frequency	RESOLUTION; CORTEX	The objective of the present work was to examine fronto-central spindle frequency. A previously validated spindle detector, providing an electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude independent spindle detection, was used to detect bilateral sleep spindles from sleep EEG recordings of ten healthy subjects with a time resolution of 0.33-s. A bilateral spindle detected centrally and frontopolarly simultaneously is called here a diffuse spindle. A bilateral spindle detected only frontopolarly or centrally at a given time is called a pure frontopolar and a pure central spindle, respectively. Spindle frequency was obtained with zero-padded discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Waveform phase angle of diffuse spindles was also examined. A total of 1230 diffuse spindles and 5316 pure central and 2595 pure frontopolar spindles were detected. The difference of median spindle frequency between central and frontopolar brain positions was clearly smaller in diffuse spindles than in pure spindles. Moreover, 34% of the diffuse spindles showed a similar frequency in central and frontopolar locations. This figure was up to 50.9% when including the 700 diffuse spindles fulfilling a strict anteroposterior (AP) timing criteria. The timing criteria selection in diffuse spindle analysis is a new functionality, enabled by the present spindle analysis method. Diffuse spindles showed coherent spindle oscillation in a large fronto-central area. Pure frontopolar spindles might be special cases of diffuse spindles, both of them seem to be generated in the nucleus medialis dorsalis (NMD) of the thalamus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics in response to distraction during driving. To study human cognition under specific driving task, we used Virtual Reality (VR) based driving simulation to simulate events including unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions (math) in real driving. For further assessing effects of the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the deviation onset and math presented on the EEG dynamics, we designed five cases with different SOA. The scalp-recorded EEG channel signals were first separated into independent brain sources by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Then, the Event-Related-Spectral-Perturbations (ERSP) measuring changes of EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the brain dynamics in time-frequency domains. Results showed that increases of theta band (5-7.8 Hz) and beta band (12.2-17 Hz) power were observed in the frontal cortex. Results demonstrated that reaction time and multiple cortical EEG sources responded to the driving deviations and math occurrences differentially in the stimulus onset asynchrony. Results also suggested that the theta band power increase in frontal area could be used as the distracted indexes for early detecting driver's inattention in the future.

Methods: We improved our time-frequency approach of classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks for BCI applications. The approach consists of Laplacian filtering, band-pass filtering and classification by correlation of time-frequency-spatial patterns. Results and Conclusions: Through off-line analysis of data collected during a "cursor control" experiment, we evaluated the capability of our new method to reveal major features of the EEG control for enhancement of MI classification accuracy. The pilot results in a human subject are promising, with an accuracy rate of 96.1%.

A neural mass model of spectral responses in electrophysiology	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CONNECTIONS; TRANSITION	We present a neural mass model of steady-state membrane potentials measured with local field potentials or electroencephalography in the frequency domain. This model is an extended version of previous dynamic causal models for investigating event-related potentials in the time-domain. In this paper, we augment the previous formulation with parameters that mediate spike-rate adaptation and recurrent intrinsic inhibitory connections. We then use linear systems analysis to show how the model's spectral response changes with its neurophysiological parameters. We demonstrate that much of the interesting behaviour depends on the non-linearity which couples mean membrane potential to mean spiking rate. This non-linearity is analogous, at the population level, to the firing rate-input curves often used to characterize singlecell responses. This function depends on the model's gain and adaptation currents which, neurobiologically, are influenced by the activity of modulatory neurotransmitters. The key contribution of this paper is to show how neuromodulatory effects can be modelled by adding adaptation currents to a simple phenomenological model of EEG. Critically, we show that these effects are expressed in a systematic way in the spectral density of EEG recordings. Inversion of the model, given such non-invasive recordings, should allow one to quantify pharmacologically induced changes in adaptation currents. In short, this work establishes a forward or generative model of electrophysiological recordings for psychopharmacological studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Exploring the variability of single trials in somatosensory evoked responses using constrained source extraction and RMT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						constrained source extraction; electroencephalography (EEG); Independent Component Analysis (ICA); magnetoencephalography (MEG); random matrix theory	MEDIAN NERVE; CORRELATION MATRIX; HUMAN BRAIN; ARTIFACTS; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULATION; SEPARATION; FREQUENCY; SPECTRUM; CORTEX	This paper describes the theoretical background of a new data-driven approach to encephalographic single-trial (ST) data analysis. Temporal constrained source extraction using sparse decomposition identifies signal topographies that closely match the shape characteristics of a reference signal, one response for each ST. The correlations between these ST topographies are computed for formal Correlation Matrix Analysis (CMA) based on Random Matrix Theory (RMT). The RMT-CMA provides clusters of similar ST topologies in a completely unsupervised manner. These patterns are then classified into deterministic set and noise using well established RMT results. The efficacy of the method is applied to EEG and MEG data of somatosensory evoked responses (SERs). The results demonstrate that the method can recover brain signals with time course resembling the reference signal and follow changes in strength and/or topography in time by simply stepping the reference signal through time.

Polysomnograms of eight healthy young volunteers were recorded during their normal nocturnal sleep using 26 scalp electrode sites. The recordings were analyzed for changes in gamma band EEG activity as a function of four sleep states (slow wave sleep, stage 2, tonic and phasic periods of the REM stage), electrode sites (six midline sites) and the time of occurrence (before and after rapid eye movement). The findings revealed that gamma band EEG activity is enhanced during REM sleep, particularly in the prefrontal regions during phasic periods of the REM stage, even after excluding the possible effects of peri-orbital activity. This result suggests that the prefrontal brain area is activated during the phasic periods of the REM stage. Moreover, results of this study show that the gamma band EEG activity is enhanced following the onset of REM. Taken together, these results suggest that enhancement of gamma band EEG activity is caused by processes such as ponto-geniculo-occipital activity, a lambda-like response and corollary discharge associated with REM.

The spectral crest factor (SCF) and the spectral turbulence (S) were calculated from the time-frequency distribution of the normalized power spectral density averaged over all MEG sensors. Results revealed statistically significant higher SCF and ST mean values for AD patients than controls (p < 0.05). This fact suggests a significant decrease in irregularity of AD patients' MEG activity. The standard deviation of SCF also provided significant differences (p < 0.05). This result indicates that AD patients showed a significantly higher variability than controls. The highest accuracy of 85.4% (90.5% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity) was achieved using simultaneously the mean value and the standard deviation of the SCF. We conclude that the variability of the spectral parameters can yield complementary information to the mean values, useful to help in AD detection.

The toolbox provides tools for data analysis and visualization of the most commonly used measures of time-frequency transformed event related data as well as data decomposition through non-negative matrix and multi-way (tensor) factorization. The decompositions provided can accommodate additional dimensions like subjects, conditions or repeats and as such they are perfected for group analysis. Furthermore, the toolbox enables tracking of phase locked activity from one channel-time-frequency instance to another as well as tools for artifact rejection in the time-frequency domain. Several other features are highlighted. ERPWAVELAB can freely be downloaded from www.erpwavelab.org, requires EEGLAB [Delorme A, Makeig S.

A matching pursuit-based signal complexity measure for the analysis of newborn EEG	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						matching pursuit; relative structural complexity; coherent dictionary; time-frequency; newborn EEG	SEIZURE DETECTION; FREQUENCY	This paper presents a new relative measure of signal complexity, referred to here as relative structural complexity (RSC), which is based on the matching pursuit (MP) decomposition. By relative, we refer to the fact that this new measure is highly dependent on the decomposition dictionary used by MP. The structural part of the definition points to the fact that this new measure is related to the structure, or composition, of the signal under analysis. After a formal definition, the proposed RSC measure is used in the analysis of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, firstly, a time-frequency decomposition dictionary is specifically designed to compactly represent the newborn EEG seizure state using MP. We then show, through the analysis of synthetic and real newborn EEG data, that the relative structural complexity measure can indicate changes in EEG structure as it transitions between the two EEG states; namely seizure and background (non-seizure).

This effect is well known as the Stroop effect. It is still an unresolved issue how the brain deals with interference in this type of task. To explore this question, an electroencephalogram (EEG) study was carried out. By analyzing several measures of EEG activity, two main findings emerged. First, the event-related potential (ERP) showed increased fronto-central negativity in a time window around 400 msec for incongruent items in contrast to congruent and neutral items. Source localization analysis revealed that a source in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributed most to the difference. Second, time-frequency analysis showed that theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) in the ACC increased linearly with increasing interference and that phase coupling between the ACC and the left prefrontal cortex was longer persistent for incongruent items compared to congruent and neutral items. These effects occurred at a time window around 600 msec. We conclude that interference between color naming and word meaning in the Stroop task manifests itself at around 400 msec and mainly activates the ACC. Thereafter, sustained phase coupling between the ACC and the prefrontal cortex occurs, which most likely reflects the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms.

Functional connectivity of the sensorimotor area in naturally sleeping infants	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						functional connectivity; fMRI; infant; sleep	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; NORMAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MOTOR CORTEX; DEFAULT MODE; NIH MRI; FMRI	Patterns of cortical functional connectivity in normal infants were examined during natural sleep by observing the time course of very low frequency oscillations. Such oscillations represent fluctuations in blood oxygenation level and cortical blood flow thus allowing computation of neurophysiologic connectivity. Structural and resting-state information were acquired for 11 infants, with a mean age of 12.8 months, using a GE 1.5 T MR scanner. Resting-state data were processed and significant functional connectivity within the sensorimotor area was identified using independent component analysis. Unilateral functional connectivity in the developing sensory-motor cortices was observed. Power spectral analysis showed that slow frequency oscillations dominated the hemodynamic signal at this age, with, on average, a peak frequency for all subjects of 0.02 Hz. Our data suggest that there is more intrahemispheric than interhemispheric connectivity in the sensorimotor area of naturally sleeping infants. This non-invasive imaging technique, developed to allow reliable scanning of normal infants without sedation, enabled computation of neurophysiologic connectivity for the first time in naturally sleeping infants. Such techniques permit elucidation of the role of slow cortical oscillations during early brain development and may reveal critical information regarding the normative development and lateralization of brain networks across time.

These processes, in turn, involve numerous structures of the brain. However, the relationship between regional brain activity and the occurrence of theta remains unclear. In the present study, simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings were used to investigate the functional topography of theta. EEG-theta was enhanced by mental arithmetic-induced workload. For the EEG-constrained fMRI analysis, theta-reference time-series were extracted from the EEG, reflecting the strength of theta occurrence during the time course of the experiment. Theta occurrence was mainly associated with activation of the insular cortex, hippocampus, superior temporal areas, cingulate cortex, superior parietal, and frontal areas. Though observation of temporal and insular activation is in accord with the theory that theta specifically reflects encoding processes, the involvement of several other brain regions implies that surface-recorded theta represents comprehensive functional brain states rather than specific processes in the brain. The results provide further evidence for the concept that emergent theta band oscillations represent dynamic functional binding of widely distributed cortical assemblies, essential for cognitive processing. This binding process may form the source of surface-recorded EEG theta.

Epileptic Seizure Detection	4TH KUALA LUMPUR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering	JUN 25-28, 2008	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA			Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Seizure detection; Classifier; Artificial neural network		Seizures are the phenomenon of rhythmic discharge from either a local area or the whole brain and the individual behavior usually lasts from seconds to minutes. Since seizures, in general, occur infrequently and unpredictably, automatic detection of seizures during long-term electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings is highly recommended. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional methods of frequency analysis are not successful for diagnostic purposes. This paper presents a method of analysis of EEG signals, which is based on time-frequency analysis. Selected segments of the EEG signals are analyzed using time-frequency methods and the features are extracted for each segment. These features are used as an input to the artificial neural network (ANN), which provides the final classification of the EEG segments concerning the existence of seizures or not. Also, this paper presents another method of analysis of EEG signals based on K-means nearest neighbor classifier and the performance of this classifier is tested on a prior labeled EEG database consisting of normal and epileptic samples. The performance indicates overall accuracy from 84% to 98%.	[Nayak, K. P.; Niranjan, U.

An inverse relation between event-related and time-frequency violation responses in sentence processing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cognitive and behavioral; neuroscience; N400; P600; semantic; grammatical; sentence processing; time-frequency analysis	BRAIN POTENTIALS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; THETA-RESPONSES; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY; BAND; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INCREASES	The relationship between semantic and grammatical processing in sentence comprehension was investigated by examining event-related potential (ERP) and event-related power changes in response to semantic and grammatical violations. Sentences with semantic, phrase structure, or number violations and matched controls were presented serially (1.25 words/s) to 20 participants while EEG was recorded. Semantic violations were associated with an N400 effect and a theta band increase in power, while grammatical violations were associated with a P600 effect and an alpha/beta band decrease in power. A quartile analysis showed that for both types of violations, larger average violation effects were associated with lower relative amplitudes of oscillatory activity, implying an inverse relation between ERP amplitude and event-related power magnitude change in sentence processing.

The exact compositions of EEG oscillations and their temporal behaviour were assessed using the probabilityclassification analysis of short-term EEG spectral pattems. The study reveals the dynamics of particular EEG oscillations throughout the conditions of opioid dependency, withdrawal and methadone-based treatment. It was shown that methadone maintenance treatment normalized considerably the composition of EEG oscillations and their percentage ratio and restored the temporal structure of patients' EEG comparable with healthy subjects. The importance of the methadone's ability to restore a normal temporal structure of the brain's activity is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High-density EEG coherence analysis using functional units applied to mental fatigue	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						multichannel EEG visualization; coherence analysis; mental fatigue	HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; SCALES	Electroencephalography (EEG) coherence provides a quantitative measure of functional brain connectivity which is calculated between pairs of signals as a function of frequency. Without hypotheses, traditional coherence analysis would be cumbersome for high-density EEG which employs a large number of electrodes. One problem is to find the most relevant regions and coherences between those regions in individuals and groups. Therefore, we previously developed a data-driven approach for individual as well as group analyses of high-density EEG coherence. Its data-driven regions of interest (ROIs) are referred to as functional units (FUs) and are defined as spatially connected sets of electrodes that record pairwise significantly coherent signals. Here, we apply our data-driven approach to a case study of mental fatigue. We show that our approach overcomes the severe limitations of conventional hypothesis-driven methods which depend on previous investigations and leads to a selection of coherences of interest taking full advantage of the recordings under investigation. The presented visualization of (group) FU maps provides a very economical data summary of extensive experimental results, which otherwise would be very difficult and time-consuming to assess. Our approach leads to an FU selection which may serve as a basis for subsequent conventional quantitative analysis; thus it complements rather than replaces the hypothesis-driven approach.

Brain Network Analysis From High-Resolution EEG Recordings by the Application of Theoretical Graph Indexes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						High-resolution electroencephalography (EEG); functional networks; graph theory	CORTICAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; POTENTIALS; COMPLEXITY; FMRI	The extraction of the salient characteristics from brain connectivity patterns is an open challenging topic since often the estimated cerebral networks have a relative large size and complex structure. Since a graph is a mathematical representation of a network, which is essentially reduced to nodes and connections between them, the use of a theoretical graph approach would extract significant information from the functional brain networks estimated through different neuroiniaging techniques. The present work intends to support the development of the "brain network analysis:" a mathematical tool consisting in a body of indexes based on the graph theory able to improve the comprehension of the complex interactions within the brain. In the present work, we applied for demonstrative purpose some graph indexes to the time-varying networks estimated from a set of high-resolution EEG data in a group of healthy subjects during the performance of a motor task. The comparison with a random benchmark allowed extracting the significant properties of the estimated networks in the representative Alpha (7-12 Hz) band. Altogether, our findings aim at proving how the brain network analysis could reveal important information about the time-frequency dynamics of the functional cortical networks.	[Fallani, F.

EEG and single-unit recordings were made from the dorsal hippocampus of awake, freely moving rats trained to forage for food. Bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of UBP304 (2.0 mu l, two times; 2.08 mM) caused a clear (similar to 25%) reduction in theta frequency that was dissociable from behavioral effects of the drug. The locations of firing fields of principal cells in the hippocampal formation were generally preserved, but both field firing rates and the precision of field organization decreased. UBP304 lowered the frequency of the theta modulation of hippocampal interneuron discharge, accurately matching the reduced frequency of the theta field oscillation. UBP308 [(R)-1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-3-(2-carboxythiophene-3-yl-methyl) pyrimidine-2,4-dione], the inactive enantiomer of UBP304, caused none of these effects. Our results suggest that GLU(K5) receptors have an important role in modulating theta activity. In addition, the effects on cellular responses provide both insight into the mechanisms of theta pacing, and useful information for models of temporal coding.

The spatial part (i.e., topography) is obtained by independent component analysis (ICA). We propose a frequency prewhitening procedure as a pre-processing step before ICA, which gives access to high frequency activity. The time-frequency part is obtained with a novel iterative procedure, which is an extension of the matching pursuit procedure. The method is evaluated on a simulated dataset presenting both low-frequency evoked potentials and high-frequency oscillatory activity. We show that the method is able to recover well both low-frequency and high-frequency simulated activities. There was however cross-talk across some recovered components due to the correlation introduced in the simulation.

Most of the existing measures define coherence based on the spectral energy distribution of the signals rather than the phase, and therefore cannot be reliably used as measures of neural synchrony. Moreover, the most common methods for quantifying coherence are formulated in the frequency domain and thus, do not take into account the time-varying nature of brain activity. Recently, coherence measures have been extended to account for the energy and the phase relationships between the given signals and the time-varying nature of the signals using the wavelet transform. In this paper, we extend this idea by introducing a new time-varying phase coherence measure based on Cohen's class of time-frequency distributions. This new measure is applied to both synthesized signals and electroencephalogram (EEG) data to show the effectiveness of the proposed measure in estimating phase changes and in quantifying the neural synchrony in the brain.

Delta and theta event-related oscillations (ERO) are the major contributors to the P300 signal. The total and evoked power in delta and theta bands in the 300 to 700 ins post-stimulus window (corresponding to the zone of P300 maxima) was compared between adolescent offspring of alcoholics (high-risk) and age-matched normal controls (low-risk), to assess the utility of the risk markers. Methods: EEG was recorded during the performance of a visual oddball task. The S-transform algorithm decomposed the EEG signals into different frequency bands and the group differences in total and evoked power in the oscillatory responses during the P300 time window (300 to 700 ins) were analyzed using a multivariate design. Similar analysis was performed on P300 peak amplitude for the target. Results: The high-risk group showed significantly lower parietal post-stimulus evoked and total power in the delta band for targets. A decrease in total power was seen centrally and parietally in the theta band. The P300 peak amplitude in the parietal electrodes was also significantly lower in the high-risk group. Conclusions: The decreased total theta power and total and evoked delta power for visual targets in high risk individuals may serve as an endophenotypic marker in the development of alcoholism and other disinhibitory disorders. The differences seen between the offspring of alcoholics and controls may have a cholinergic basis. The ERO measures appear to be more robust than the P300 amplitude in differentiating the groups.

In this study we used MEG to investigate how spontaneous oscillations in humans presented before visual stimuli modulate visual perception. Subjects had to report if there was a subtle difference in gray levels between two superimposed presented discs. We then compared the prestimulus brain activity for correctly ( hits) versus incorrectly ( misses) identified stimuli. We found that visual discrimination ability decreased with an increase in prestimulus alpha power. Given that reaction times did not vary systematically with prestimulus alpha power changes in vigilance are not likely to explain the change in discrimination ability. Source reconstruction using spatial filters allowed us to identify the brain areas accounting for this effect. The dominant sources modulating visual perception were localized around the parieto-occipital sulcus. We suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha power reflects functional inhibition imposed by higher level areas, which serves to modulate the gain of the visual stream.

Although electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms are modulated during working memory, the temporal relationship of EEG oscillations with the eliciting event has not been well studied. In particular, the dynamics of the neural network supporting memory processes may be best captured in induced oscillations, characterized by a loose temporal link with the stimulus. In order to differentiate induced from evoked functional processes, the present study proposes a time-frequency analysis of the 3 to 30 Hz EEG oscillatory activity in a verbal n-back working memory paradigm. Control tasks were designed to identify oscillatory activity related to stimulus presentation (passive task) and focused attention to the stimulus (detection task). Evoked theta activity (4-8 Hz) phase-locked to the visual stimulus was evidenced in the parieto-occipital region for all tasks. In parallel, induced theta activity was recorded in the frontal region for detection and n-back memory tasks, but not for the passive task, suggesting its dependency on focused attention to the stimulus. Sustained induced oscillatory activity was identified in relation to working memory in the theta and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands, larger for the highest memory load. Its late occurrence limited to nonmatched items suggests that it could be related to item retention and active maintenance for further task requirements. Induced theta and beta activities displayed respectively a frontal and parietal topographical distribution, providing further functional information on the fronto-posterior network supporting working memory.

Newborn EEG seizure detection using optimized time-frequency matched filter	2007 9TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND ITS APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and its Applications	FEB 12-15, 2007	Sharjah, U ARAB EMIRATES					In recent years, much effort has been made toward developing computerized methods to detect seizures. In adults, the clinical signs of seizures are well defined and easily recognizable. This is, however, not the case for newborns where the clinical signs are either subtle or completely absent. For this reason, the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the most dependable tool used for detecting seizures in newborns. Considering the non-stationary and multicomponent nature of the EEG signals, time-frequency (TF) based methods were found to be very suitable for the analysis of such signals. Using TF representation of EEG signals allows extracting TF signatures that are characteristic of EEG seizures. In this paper we present a TF method for newborn EEG seizure detection using a TF matched filter. The TF signatures of EEG seizures are used to construct time-frequency templates that are used by the matched filter to detect EEG seizures. The results obtained so far are very promising.

The cerebral hemoglobin concentration change was measured at 88 positions covering the whole head, by optical topography. We extracted the intrinsic correlation between EEGF and the cerebral hemoglobin concentration change without MAP contributions through cross-correlation and partial correlation analyses considering time lags. We found that increases in the power of the alpha rhythm in EEGF were correlated with increases in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and decreases in deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) and that increases in the power of the sigma rhythm in EEGF were correlated with decreases in oxy-Hb and increases in deoxy-Hb. The former correlations tended to appear in the transition from sleep stage 2 to sleep stage 1, and the latter correlations tended to appear in the transition from sleep stage I to sleep stage 2. The former correlations were found in the inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri and the latter correlations were found in the superior frontal, middle frontal, and angular gyri.

However, the mechanisms by which music modulates the neural activity associated with learning and memory remain largely unexplored. We evaluated coherent frontal oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while subjects were engaged in a modified version of Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Subjects heard either a spoken version of the AVLT or the conventional AVLT word list sung. Learning-related changes in coherence (LRCC) were measured by comparing the EEG during word encoding oil correctly recalled trials to the immediately preceding trial on which the same word was not recalled. There were no significant changes in coherence associated with conventional verbal learning. However, musical verbal learning was associated with increased coherence within and between left and right frontal areas in theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands. It is unlikely that the different patterns of LRCC reflect general performance differences; the groups exhibited similar learning performance. The results suggest that verbal learning with a musical template strengthens coherent oscillations in frontal cortical networks involved in verbal encoding. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We present a new time-frequency analysis of OAs found in the EOG. Our results indicate that in some tasks and subjects, frequencies up to 181Hz exist. Based on these results, we propose a minimum sampling rate for EOG. In addition, since EOG measurements typically contain signals other than OAs (including underlying EEG), we propose an alternate measurement of OAs based on a video-based eye tracker, and suggest a minimum frame rate for the use of such devices.

The seizure signals of interest are namely slow wave and sharp spike seizures. The performance of Stockwell Transform is compared to that of existing quadratic time-frequency representation, namely the Choi-Williams Distribution and the B Distribution, on both simulated and real EEG seizure signals. The results show that the Stockwell Transform yields distinctive, interference free time-frequency patterns corresponding to the neonatal EEG seizure signals. By capturing both high-frequency spike components and predominantly low frequency components of neonatal seizures concurrently and accurately, the Stockwell Transform is able to distinguish these two types of neonatal seizure signals with unique signatures. These signatures can then be effectively used for seizure modelling, detection and prediction.

TIME-FREQUENCY PARAMETRIZATION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; COHERENCY; BSI	This article presents a method to transform routine clinical EEG recordings to an alternative visual domain. The method is intended to support the classic visual interpretation of the EEG background pattern and to facilitate communication about relevant EEG characteristics. In addition, it provides various quantitative features. The EEG features used in the transformation include color-coded time-frequency representations of two novel symmetry measures and a synchronization measure, based on a nearest-neighbor coherence estimate. This triplet captures three highly relevant aspects of the dynamics of the EEG background pattern, which correlate strongly with various neurologic conditions. In particular, it quantifies and visualizes the spatiotemporal distribution of the EEG power in the anterioposterior and lateral direction, and the short-distance coherence. The potential clinical use is illustrated by application of the proposed technique to various normal and abnormal EEGs, including seizure activity and the transition to sleep. The proposed transformation visualizes various essential elements of EEG background patterns. Quantitative analysis of clinical EEG recordings and transformation to alternative domains assists in the interpretation and contributes to an objective interpretation.

Using ANN on EEG signals to predict working memory task response	11TH MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING 2007, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON 2007)	JUN 26-30, 2007	Ljubljana, SLOVENIA	Int Federat Med & Biomed Engn		EEG; artificial neural networks; working memory; response prediction; Sternberg task	LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; HUMANS	Many authors have shown that performing working-memory tasks causes an elevated neuronal activity in several areas of the human brain, which suggests information exchange between them. Since the information exchanged, encoded in brain waves is measurable by electroencephalography (EEG) it is reasonable to assume that it can be extracted with an appropriate method. In this paper we present a method for extracting the information using an artificial neural network (ANN), which we consider as a stimulus-response model. The EEG was recorded from three subjects while they performed a modified Sternberg task that required them to respond to each trial with the answer "true" or "false". The study revealed that a stimulus-response model can successfully be identified by observing phase-demodulated theta-band EEG signals I second prior to a subject's answer. The results showed that the model was able to predict the answers from the EEG signals with an average reliability of 75% for all three subjects. From this we concluded that stimulus-response model successfully observes the system states and consequently predicts the correct answer using the EEG signals as inputs.

The roles of EEG oscillations in learning relational information	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; POSITIVE PHASE; RHYTHM; TASK	Rhythmic brain activity has been implicated in learning and memory. Many models implicate theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) specifically in learning of relational information such as pairings and ordered lists. We tested this hypothesis in humans by recording electroencephalographic activity while participants studied nouns organised into pairs or triples for a later cued recall test. If theta is critical in learning structured information, then the amount of theta activity present during study of pairs and triples should covary with subsequent memory performance (accuracy and response times). Multivariate partial least squares analysis revealed three patterns of oscillatory activity associated with task conditions in different ways: a) Within subjects, successful study of pairs but not triples was associated with elevations in oscillations at multiple frequencies including theta, b) Frontal theta oscillations, in conjunction with beta oscillations, covaried with memory performance across subjects for both pairs and triples and c) Right-lateralized gamma oscillations in conjunction with low-frequency oscillations were associated with faster responding at the expense of accuracy across subjects for both pairs and triples. These findings support models that implicate theta oscillations in learning structured information rather than item information alone but similar to prior reports, suggest that theta oscillations explain individual variability better than trial-to-trial variability in behavior.

Methods: Multichannel EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG were recorded from sleep-deprived subjects exposed to real field driving conditions. A number of severe driving errors occurred during the experiments. The analysis was performed in two main dimensions: the macroscopic analysis that estimates the on-going temporal evolution of physiological measurements during the driving task, and the microscopic event analysis that focuses on the physiological measurements' alterations just before, during, and after the driving errors. Two independent neurophysiologists visually interpreted the measurements. The EEG data were analyzed by using both linear and nonlinear analysis tools. Results: We observed the occurrence of brief paroxysmal bursts of alpha activity and an increased synchrony among EEG channels before the driving errors. The alpha relative band ratio (RBR) significantly increased, and the Cross Approximate Entropy that quantifies the synchrony among channels also significantly decreased before the driving errors. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed significant variations of RBR by driving time in the frequency bands of delta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Most of the estimated EEG statistics, such as the Shannon Entropy, Kullback-Leibler Entropy, Coherence, and Cross-Approximate Entropy, were significantly affected by driving time. We also observed an alteration of eyes blinking duration by increased driving time and a significant increase of eye blinks' number and duration before driving errors. Conclusions: EEG and EOG are promising neurophysiological indicators of driver sleepiness and have the potential of monitoring sleepiness in occupational settings incorporated in a sleepiness countermeasure device. Significance: The occurrence of brief paroxysmal bursts of alpha activity before severe driving errors is described in detail for the first time. Clear evidence is presented that eye-blinking statistics are sensitive to the driver's sleepiness and should be considered in the design of an efficient and driver-friendly sleepiness detection countermeasure device.

It has been debated whether alpha activity plays a direct role in the neuronal processing required for a given task or whether it reflects idling and/or functional inhibition. Recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies have demonstrated that alpha activity increases parametrically with load during retention in working memory paradigms. While it is known that the parieto-occipital cortex is involved in the generation of the spontaneous alpha oscillations, it remains unknown where the sources of the memory-dependent alpha activity are located. We recorded brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) from human subjects performing a Sternberg memory task where faces were used as stimuli. Spectral analysis revealed a parametric increase in alpha activity with memory load over posterior brain areas. We then applied a source reconstruction technique that allowed us to map the parametric increase in alpha activity to the anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images of the subject. The primary sources of the memory-dependent alpha activity were in the vicinity of the parieto-occipital sulcus. This region is not directly involved in working memory maintenance of faces. Our findings are consistent with the notion that alpha activity reflects disengagement or inhibition of the visual dorsal stream. We propose that the disengagement reflected in alpha power serves to suppress visual input in order to devote resources to structures responsible for working memory maintenance.

Coupled oxygenation oscillation measured by NIRS and intermittent cerebral activation on EEG in premature infants	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; near infrared spectroscopy; premature infants; cerebral hemodynamics; vasomotion	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; BLOOD-FLOW; HEMOGLOBIN OXYGENATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; VASODILATOR AREA; BOLD SIGNAL; STIMULATION; MOTOR; DECREASE; BRAIN	Electroencephalography of premature neonates shows a physiological discontinuity of electrical activity during quiet sleep. Near infrared spectroscopy (LAIRS) shows spontaneous oscillations of hemoglobin oxygenation and volume. Similar oscillations are visible in term neonates and adults, with LAIRS and other functional imaging techniques (fMRI, Doppler, etc.), but are generally thought to result from vasomotion and to be a physiological artifact of limited interest. The origin and possible relationship to neuronal activity of the baseline changes in the LAIRS signal have not been established. We carried out simultaneous EEG-LAIRS recordings on six healthy premature neonates and four premature neonates presenting neurological distress, to determine whether changes in the concentration of cerebral oxy- and deoxy- and total hemoglobin were related to the occurrence of spontaneous bursts of cerebral electric activity. Bursts of electroencephalographic activity in neonates during quiet sleep were found to be coupled to a transient stereotyped hemodynamic response involving a decrease in oxy-hemoglobin concentration, sometimes beginning a few seconds before the onset of electroencephalographic activity, followed by an increase, and then a return to baseline. This pattern could be either part of the baseline oscillations or superimposed changes to this baseline, influencing its shape and phase. The temporal patterns of LAIRS parameters present an unique configuration, and tend to be different between our healthy and pathological subjects. Studies of physiological activities and of the effects of intrinsic regulation on the LAIRS signal should increase our understanding of these patterns and EEG-LAIRS studies should facilitate the integration of LAIRS into the set of clinical tools used in neurology.

Although the very premature infants with a normal outcome are not that numerous, their normal EEG pattern should be known, as EEG constitutes a basis for neurological prognosis. Background activity is first discontinuous but the discontinuity gradually decreases and the activity is completely continuous at 30 weeks of age, during active steep. At the same time, interburst intervals become shorter so that the proportion of time without EEG activity decreases. Based on EEG activity and eyes movements, a rough steep state differentiation appears as early as 25 weeks of gestational age and is complete at 30 weeks. The main EEG figures are high-voltage delta waves, whose frequency is slower and amplitude higher in younger infants. Temporal delta waves occur in sequences and are characteristic of the very premature infant; they progressively become smaller and less numerous and disappear around 27-28 weeks. In contrast, occipital delta waves remain numerous; they are of high voltage and usually bilaterally superimposed with fast rhythms. Both types of frontal delta waves that are seen in 24-27 weeks premature babies disappear with maturation. Bursts of synchronized delta waves, which are less numerous than localized delta waves, also disappear before 28 weeks of gestational age. Finally, diffuse theta bursts which are mainly recorded at 26-27 weeks, progressively focus on temporal areas with maturation. At 30 weeks, they are observed on temporal areas, mainly during slow-wave steep. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. ALL rights reserved.

Previous EEG-studies indicated the HFOs to reflect in part activity generated at the thalamus and within the thalamocortical radiation. Expecting impairment of thalamocortical impulse propagation in Parkinson's disease (PD) the present study aimed to explore the performance of the HFOs in a cohort of PD patients in comparison to an exactly age and sex-matched group of controls. To avoid motor interference and to minimize the influence of central tremor oscillators to the HFOs we selected PD patients Suffering from an akinetic rigid type of the disease. We recorded multichannel somatosensory evoked potentials and applied an advanced analysis combining source and time frequency analysis. Low frequency and HFO signals showed no significant differences between PD patients and the control group, neither in the Source waveforms evaluation nor in the time frequency analysis. Contrasting two former studies indicating enhanced HFOs in nonselected PD patients the present results differ most probably due to the lack of motor interference effects and the missing impact of central tremor-oscillators on the signals by selecting patients without tremor.

This allows to construct explicit filters for finding EEG waveforms, known from the visual analysis, in the matching pursuit decomposition of signals. In such a way detectors of relevant structures of both transient and oscillatory nature can be constructed in the space of physically meaningful parameters. This study presents evaluation of changes of power and frequency of sleep spindles and delta waves, related to the depth of the sleep, which were previously assessed in a qualitative way. We confirm quantitatively the decrease of frequencies of sleep spindles and delta waves with the depth of the sleep. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we used EEG-fMRI to determine the possible correlation between topographical movement-related EEG changes in brain oscillatory activity recorded from EEG electrodes over the scalp and fMRI-BOLD cortical responses in motor areas during finder movement. Thirty-two channels of EEG were recorded in 9 subjects during eyes-open condition inside a 1.5 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner using a MR-compatible EEG recording system. Off-line MRI artifact subtraction software was applied to obtain continuous EEG data during fMRI acquisition. For EEG data analysis we used the event-related-synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) approach to investigate where movement-related decreases in alpha and beta power are located. For image statistical analysis we used a general linear model (GLM) approach. There was a significant correlation between the positive-negative ratio of BOLD signal peaks and ERD values in the electrodes over the region of activation. We conclude that combined EEG-fMRI may be used to investigate movement-related oscillations of the human brain inside an MRI scanner and the movement-related changes in the EMG or EEG signals are useful to identify the brain activation sources responsible for BOLD-signal changes.

This method is based on various techniques: a time-frequency decomposition using sinusoidal filters which improve phase accuracy for low frequencies, a Bayesian approach for the estimation of significant synchrony changes, and a time-frequency-topography visualization technique which allows for easy exploration and provides detailed insights of a particular experiment. Particularly, we focus on in-phase synchrony using an instantaneous phase-lock measure. We also discuss some of the most common methods in the literature, focusing on their relevance to long-range synchrony analysis; this discussion includes a comparison among various synchrony measures. Finally, we present the analysis of a figure categorization experiment to illustrate our method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Blinking and movement of the eyes causes a strong electrical activity that can contaminate EEG recordings, particularly around the forehead but also as far as in occipital areas. Removal of such ocular artifacts is a considerable signal processing problem, since those artifacts overlap in frequency domain with EEG. In this paper we propose a signal reconstruction method based on a time frequency analysis tool known as the Hilbert-Huang spectrum. We demonstrate how our reconstruction scheme can be successfully applied to contaminated EEG data for the purposes of removing unwanted ocular artifacts.

Describing the nonstationarity level of neurological signals based on quantifications of time-frequency representation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); Kullback-Leibler distance; Shannon entropy; stationarity; time-frequency representation (TFR)	QUANTITATIVE EEG; INJURY	Most neurological signals including electroencephalogram (EEG), evoked potential (EP) and local field potential (LFP) have been known to be time varying and nonstationary, especially in some pathological conditions. Currently, the most widely used quantitative tool for such nonstationary signals is time-frequency representation (TFR) which demonstrates the temporal evolution of different frequency components. However, TFR does not directly provide a quantitative measure of nonstationarity level, e.g., how far the process deviates from stationarity. In this study, we introduced three different quantifications of TFR (qTFR) to characterize the nonstationarity level of the involving signals: 1) degree of stationarity (DS); 2) Shannon entropy (SE) of the marginal spectrum; and 3) Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between a TFR and a uniform distribution. These descriptors provide quantitative analysis of stationarity of a signal such that the stationarity of different signals could be compared. In this study, we obtained the TFRs of the EEG signals before and after the hypoxic-ischemic (111) brain injury and examined the stationarity of the EEG. DS, SE, and KLD can indicate the nonstationarity change of EEG at each frequency following the HI injury, especially in the upper delta-and lower theta-band (e.g., [2 Hz, 8 Hz]) as well as in the)32 band (e.g., [22 Hz-26 Hz]). Moreover, it is shown that the stationarity of the EEG changes differently in different frequencies following the HI injury.

EEG (electroencephalogram) is widely used to monitor the brain condition. Frequency analysis method is given as general EEG analysis method. DR analysis is to evaluate the deviation ratio of power spectrum of arbitrary frequency band. On the other hand, neural networks are used to analyze nonlinear systems because of their ability to capture the dynamics of complex system. In this study, we propose the application of moving average-type neural networks (MANN) to analyze the EEG and compare the result of MANN analysis with the one of DR analysis. In this time, we used the randomness to optimize the number of input units of MANNs. In MANN analysis method, the measured EEG is divided into overlapped period 20 seconds. A MANN is trained to predict the EEG using three previous samples in each period. After training, the connecting weights of each MANN are compared using the inner product to evaluate changes in brain condition. We used measured EEG in closing/opening eyes to analyze. According to the results, the usefulness of MANN analysis was confirmed. And MANN analysis has possibility to be able to apply to analysis of the other EEG data or the other nonlinear systems.

However, whether non-phase-locked neural oscillations are involved in empathic responses remains unknown. To investigate the functional role of nonphase-locked theta (3-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) oscillations in empathy for pain, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults who performed pain judgment of pictures of hands in painful or neutral situations. Wavelet analysis was used to calculate EEG spectral power with high time-frequency (TF) resolution. We found that, relative to neutral stimuli, painful stimuli induced increased theta event-related synchronization (ERS) at 200-500 ms but decreased alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) at 200-400 ms, providing evidence for the engagement of theta and alpha activity in empathy for pain. In addition, subjective ratings of perceived pain and self-unpleasantness positively correlated with theta band ERS but negatively correlated with alpha band ERD related to painful stimuli, suggesting that theta and alpha oscillations are respectively involved in emotional sharing and regulation during empathy for pain. Finally, the long-latency upper theta (6-8 Hz) and alpha band TF power significantly decreased by repeated exposure to painful stimuli, indicating short-term adaptive changes of empathy-related neural activity.

These systems were able to detect discrete stages (Stage MT, W, 1, 2, 3, 4, REM). However, they are not sufficient to extract much information in detail. Therefore, in order to extract more precise information for sleep stages, we have tried to analyze the sleep EEG in its time-frequency domain by employing a continuous wavelet transform based on Gabor wavelets. In this paper, a modified wavelet transform method is proposed. It has the feature that the damping coefficient of Gabor wavelets is adjusted by a sigmoid function. In the experiments, compared with the ordinary wavelet transform with some constant damping coefficients, it has been confirmed that the modified wavelet transform method can have the adequate frequency resolution for analyzing frequency components of sleep EEG.

Theta EEG dynamics of the error-related negativity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						error-related negativity; event-related potentials; theta; oscillations; phase-resetting; wavelet	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES	Objective: The error-related negativity (ERN) is a response-locked brain potential (ERP) occurring 80-100 ms following response errors. This report contrasts three views of the genesis of the ERN, testing the classic view that time-locked phasic bursts give rise to the ERN against the view that the ERN arises from a pure phase-resetting of ongoing theta (4-7 Hz) EEG activity and the view that the ERN is generated - at least in part - by a phase-resetting and amplitude enhancement of ongoing theta EEG activity. Methods: Time-domain ERP analyses were augmented with time-frequency investigations of phase-locked and non-phase-locked spectral power, and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) computed from individual EEG trials, examining time courses and scalp topographies. Simulations based on the assumptions of the classic, pure phase-resetting, and phase-resetting plus enhancement views, using parameters from each subject's empirical data, were used to contrast the time-frequency findings that could be expected if one or more of these hypotheses adequately modeled the data. Results: Error responses produced larger amplitude activity than correct responses in time-domain ERPs immediately following responses, as expected. Time-frequency analyses revealed that significant error-related post-response increases in total spectral power (phase- and non-phase-locked), phase-locked power, and ITPC were primarily restricted to the theta range, with this effect located over midfrontocentral sites, with a temporal distribution from approximate to 150-200 ms prior to the button press and persisting up to 400 ms post-button press. The increase in non-phase-locked power (total power minus phase-locked power) was larger than phase-locked power, indicating that the bulk of the theta event-related dynamics were not phase-locked to response. Results of the simulations revealed a good fit for data simulated according to the phase-locking with amplitude enhancement perspective, and a poor fit for data simulated according to the classic view and the pure phase-resetting view. Conclusions: Error responses produce not only phase-locked increases in theta EEG activity, but also increases in non-phase-locked theta, both of which share a similar topography. Significance: The findings are thus consistent with the notion advanced by Luu et al. [Luu P, Tucker DM, Makeig S. Frontal midline theta and the error-related negativity; neurophysiological mechanisms of action regulation. Clin Neurophysiol 2004; 115:1821-35] that the ERN emerges, at least in part, from a phase-resetting and phase-locking of ongoing theta-band activity, in the context of a general increase in theta power following errors.

The integration of electroencephalography, galvanic skin response and oximeter in a multichannel framework constitutes an effort in the path to identify emotional states via biosignals expression. To induce and detect specific emotions, gender-specific sessions were defined based on International Affective Picture System and performed in a controlled environment. Data was collected and visualized in real-time by the session instructor and stored for processing and analysis. Results granted by distinct analysis techniques showed that high frequency EEG waves are strongly related to emotions and are a solid ground to perform accurate emotion classification. They have also given strong indications that females are more sensitive to emotion induction. One might conclude that the attained success levels concerning relating emotions to biosignals are extremely encouraging not only to this research topic but also to the its application in domains such as multimedia entertainment, advertising and medical treatments.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining on EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the signal underlying information content illustration by representing time-frequency patterns on Wavelet Coherence qualitative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions on time-frequency spectrum during the specified task on BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns were classified using a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). This innovative characteristic of the process justify the feasibility of the proposed approach on another data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches on this field and researches on different non-stationary time series analysis.				tbassani@ppgia.pucpr.br; nievola@ppgia.pucpr.br	Nievola, Julio C/C-2244-2008; Nievola, Julio Cesar/R-2535-2019	Nievola, Julio Cesar/0000-0002-2212-4499					18	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-1778-0				2008							6	12						7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	BIY61					2022-08-02	WOS:000263713400002

Determining the occurrence and the frequency of occurrence of arousals from sleep is very important because it is directly related to the quality of sleep. In this paper we used twenty polysomnographic recordings of patients with respiratory sleep disorder. Six recordings were used as training sets and fourteen recordings were used as test sets. We extracted three types of features, which are six indices relating to sleep states, the powers of each of four frequency bands and variations of power of EEG frequency, using time-frequency analysis. We detected arousals from sleep using the above features and SVM classifier. From the results, the sensitivity of 79.65% and the specificity of 89.52% were obtained. The error between the total arousal time detected by the proposed method and the annotated data was 15.09 +/- 0.76 min and it showed the possibility of application for the detection of arousal from sleep using a single channel EEG signal.

J	Bartolomei, F; Chauvel, P; Wendling, F				Bartolomei, Fabrice; Chauvel, Patrick; Wendling, Fabrice			Epileptogenicity of brain structures in human temporal lobe epilepsy: a quantified study from intracerebral EEG	BRAIN			English	Article						partial epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; epileptogenic zone; seizure onset	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE-ONSET; SECONDARY EPILEPTOGENESIS; FOLDING PATTERNS; NEURAL NETWORKS; LOBECTOMY; CORTEX; REGION; MODEL; MRI	The identification of brain regions generating seizures (epileptogenic zone, EZ) in patients with refractory partial epilepsy is crucial prior to surgery. During pre-surgical evaluation, this identification can be performed from the analysis of intracerebral EEG. In particular, the presence of high-frequency oscillations, often referred to as rapid discharges, has long been recognized as a characteristic electrophysiological pattern of the EZ. However, to date, there has been no attempt to make use of this specific pattern to quantitatively evaluate the degree of epileptogenicity in recorded structures. A novel quantitative measure that characterizes the epileptogenicity of brain structures recorded with depth electrodes is presented. This measure, called Epileptogenicity Index (EI), is based on both spectral (appearance of fast oscillations replacing the background activity) and temporal (delay of appearance with respect to seizure onset) properties of intracerebral EEG signals. EI values were computed in mesial and lateral structures of the temporal lobe in a group of 17 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Statistically high EI values corresponded to structures involved early in the ictal process and producing rapid discharges at seizure onset. In all patients, these high values were obtained in more than one structure of the temporal lobe region. In the majority of patients, highest EI values were computed from signals recorded in mesial structures. In addition, when averaged over patients, EI values gradually decreased from structure to structure. For lateral neocortex, higher EI values were found in patients with normal MRI, in contrast with patients with hippocampal sclerosis. In this former sub-group of patients, a greater number of epileptogenic structures was also found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the duration of epilepsy and the number of structures disclosing high epileptogenicity suggesting that MTLE is a gradually evolving process in which the epileptogenicity of the temporal lobe tends to increase with time.

EEG of the very premature infant born at 24 to 30 weeks gestational age Definitions and normal data	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			French	Review						prematurity; very premature infant; EEG; physiology	FULL-TERM NEWBORNS; PRETERM INFANTS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; NEONATAL SLEEP; 1ST WEEK; PATTERNS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECORDINGS; MATURATION	This article aims at summarizing normal EEG criteria and their maturational pattern in premature infants of 24 to 30 weeks gestational age. Although very premature infants with a normal outcome are not numerous, their normal EEG patterns must be known, as EEG constitutes a basis for neurological prognosis. Background activity is first discontinuous. Discontinuity decreases thereafter with increasing age, so that some tong periods of continuous activity may be observed in active steep, around 30 weeks of age. Conversely, interburst intervals become shorter and the proportion of time without EEG activity is decreasing. Based on EEG activity and eye movements, a rough steep-state differentiation was described as soon as 25 weeks of gestational age and is completely achieved at 30 weeks. The main EEG figures are high-voltage delta waves of higher amplitude and slower frequency in younger infants. Temporal delta waves occur in sequences, these are very characteristic of the very premature infant; thereafter, they become smaller, less numerous and eventually disappear around 27-28 weeks. In contrast, occipital delta waves remain numerous and of high voltage, are usually bilateral and superimposed with fast rhythms. The two types of frontal delta waves that are observed in 24-27 weeks prematures disappear with maturation. Bursts of synchronized delta waves are less numerous than localized delta waves and also disappear before 28 weeks of age. Finally, diffuse theta bursts are mainly recorded at 26-27 weeks GA and become more localized in temporal areas with maturation. At 30 weeks, they are observed on temporal areas, mainly during stow-wave steep. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

At the cellular level, during SWS, a slow oscillation (<1 Hz) synchronizes firing patterns in large neuronal populations and is reflected on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as large-amplitude, low-frequency waves. By using simultaneous EEG and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we characterized the transient changes in brain activity consistently associated with slow waves (>140 mu V) and delta waves (75-140 mu V) during SWS in 14 non-sleep-deprived normal human volunteers. Significant increases in activity were associated with these waves in several cortical areas, including the inferior frontal, medial prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate areas. Compared with baseline activity, slow waves are associated with significant activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and brainstem, whereas delta waves are related to frontal responses. No decrease in activity was observed. This study demonstrates that SWS is not a state of brain quiescence, but rather is an active state during which brain activity is consistently synchronized to the slow oscillation in specific cerebral regions. The partial overlap between the response pattern related to SWS waves and the waking default mode network is consistent with the fascinating hypothesis that brain responses synchronized by the slow oscillation restore microwake-like activity patterns that facilitate neuronal interactions.

We aimed to investigate whether patients with febrile seizures (FS) show abnormalities of the gamma frequency steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) components evoked by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). We analyzed the magnitude and phase alignment of the 50-100 Hz SSVEP components elicited by IPS from 12 FS patients, 5 siblings of FS patients, and 15 control children between 6 and 36 months of age. Patients with FS showed significantly higher SSVEP magnitude and phase alignment values when compared to both the siblings and control groups. Detected abnormalities could either represent the direct consequence of seizures or indicate a preexisting tendency to hypersynchrony in FS patients. Future prospective studies could assess whether SSVEP abnormalities are associated with complex rather than simple FS, or have a prognostic value for the development of epilepsy following FS.

Because EEG recording and monitoring is relatively safe for the patients in deep coma, it is believed to be valuable for either reducing the risk of brain death diagnosis (while comparing other tests such as the apnea) or preventing mistaken diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to study several statistical methods for quantitative EEG analysis in order to help bedside or ambulatory monitoring or diagnosis. We apply signal processing and quantitative statistical analysis for the EEG recordings of 32 adult patients. For EEG signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to separate the independent source components, followed by Fourier and time-frequency analysis. For quantitative EEG analysis, we apply several statistical complexity measures to the EEG signals and evaluate the differences between two groups of patients: the subjects in deep coma, and the subjects who were categorized as brain death. We report statistically significant differences of quantitative statistics with real-life EEG recordings in such a clinical study, and we also present interpretation and discussions on the preliminary experimental results.

A computational study indicated that the phase precession enables a human object-place association memory with voluntary eye movements, although it is still an open question whether the human brain uses the dynamics. Here we elucidated subsequent memory-correlated activities in human scalp electroencephalography in an object-place association memory designed according the former computational study. Our results successfully demonstrated that subsequent memory recall is characterized by an increase in theta power and coherence, and further, that multiple theta synchronization networks emerge. These findings suggest the human theta dynamics in common with rodents in episodic memory formation.

The present study analyzed oscillatory power and phase synchronization of electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from subjects performing a working memory task. Subjects were required to maintain both verbal (letters) and spatial (locations) information of visual stimuli while the verbal and spatial information were either bound or separate. We found that frontal theta power, and large-scale theta phase synchronization between bilateral frontal regions and between the left frontal and right temporal-parietal regions were greater for maintaining bound relative to separate information. However, the same effects were not observed in the gamma band. These results suggest that working memory binding involves large-scale neural synchronization at the theta band. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Ten college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits, and revised them on the basis of an exogenous performance feedback. The EEG signal was convolved with a family of complex wavelets and induced brain potentials were extracted in the alpha range (8-13 Hz). The time-varying modulation of alpha activity time-locked to positive and negative feedback was analyzed in the 350-700 ms time-window. The results showed differential feedback-induced modulations of upper-alpha rhythms (>= 10 Hz) between 450 and 700 ms in parieto-occipital and central regions, and of lower-alpha rhythms (< 10 Hz) between 350 and 450 ms in central regions. These results were interpreted in terms of differential functional roles of feedback in short-term memory and active inhibition/disinhibition of resources for subsequent hypothesis testing. Some implications for cognitive models of feedback are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mazaheri, A; Jensen, O				Mazaheri, Ali; Jensen, Ole			Asymmetric amplitude modulations of brain oscillations generate slow evoked responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; EEG; magnetoencephalography; MEG; event-related potential; ERP; event-related field; ERF; alpha; beta; synchronization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; EEG ALPHA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYNCHRONIZATION; SENTENCES; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS	Electrophysiological data measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are widely used to investigate human brain activity in various cognitive tasks. This is typically done by characterizing event-related potentials/fields or modulations of oscillatory activity (e. g., event-related synchronization) in response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link between the two phenomena. An essential component of our theory is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate asymmetrically; e. g., peaks are more strongly modulated than troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory brain activity will not "average out" when multiple trials are averaged. Using MEG, we demonstrate that such asymmetric amplitude fluctuations of the oscillatory alpha rhythm explain the generation of slow event-related fields. Furthermore, we provide a physiological explanation for the observed asymmetric amplitude fluctuations. In particular, slow event-related components are modulated by a wide range of cognitive tasks. Hence, our findings provide new insight into the physiological basis of cognitive modulation in event-related brain activity.

Neural synchrony in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; neural oscillations; EEG; theta; beta; gamma	METAANALYSIS	Basic neuroscience research suggests that neural assemblies communicate with each other in the temporal domain and rely on the coincidence of neural activity to detect phasic relationships between groups of neurons. Clinical neuroscience research suggests that communication and coordination failures between different brain regions may account for a wide range of problems in schizophrenia, from psychosis to cognitive dysfunction. This theme issue presents: an overview of time-frequency analyses that are used by clinical neuroscientists studying neural oscillations in schizophrenia; a comprehensive review of the literature on schizophrenia and neural asynchrony; data supporting dysfunction of both the GABA and glutamate systems in contributing to neural synchrony dysfunction in schizophrenia; and an example of how neural activity oscillating at different frequencies can form a code, which when disrupted could account for various symptoms of the illness. These papers illustrate approaches to translational neuroscience that will increase our understanding of schizophrenia and provide neurobiological endpoints for developing novel treatments.

Data-driven visualization and group analysis of multichannel EEG coherence with functional units	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Symposium on Visualization (EuroVis '07)	MAY 23-25, 2007	Norrkoping, SWEDEN			information visualization; graphs and networks; applications	BRAIN DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PROPAGATION; FREQUENCY; CLIQUES	A typical data- driven visualization of electroencephalography ( EEG) coherence is a graph layout, with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing significant coherences between electrode signals. A drawback of this layout is its visual clutter for multichannel EEG. To reduce clutter, we define a functional unit ( FU) as a data- driven region of interest ( ROI). An FU is a spatially connected set of electrodes recording pairwise significantly coherent signals, represented in the coherence graph by a spatially connected clique. Earlier, we presented two methods to detect FUs: a maximal clique- based ( MCB) method ( time complexity O(3(n/3)), with n being the number of vertices) and a more efficient watershed- based ( WB) method ( time complexity O(n(2) log n)). To reduce the potential oversegmentation of the WB method, we introduce an improved WB ( IWB) method ( time complexity O(n(2) log n)). The IWB method merges basins representing FUs during the segmentation if they are spatially connected and if their union is a clique. The WB and IWB methods are both up to a factor of 100,000 faster than the MCB method for a typical multichannel setting with 128 EEG channels, thus making interactive visualization of multichannel EEG coherence possible. Results show that considering the MCB method as the gold standard, the difference between IWB and MCB FU maps is smaller than between WB and MCB FU maps. We also introduce two novel group maps for data- driven group analysis as extensions of the IWB method. First, the group mean coherence map preserves dominant features from a collection of individual FU maps. Second, the group FU size map visualizes the average FU size per electrode across a collection of individual FU maps. Finally, we employ an extensive case study to evaluate the IWB FU map and the two new group maps for data- driven group analysis. Results, in accordance with conventional findings, indicate differences in EEG coherence between younger and older adults. However, they also suggest that an initial selection of hypothesis- driven ROIs could be extended with additional data- driven ROIs.	[ten Caat, Michael; Roerdink, Jos B. T.

Paroxysmal fast activity: An interictal scalp EEG marker of epileptogenesis in children	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						PFA; Lennox-Gastaut; Hypsarrythmia; Fast ripples; Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Ictogenesis	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY SURGERY PATIENTS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; CLINICAL-FEATURES; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 100-500 HZ; SEIZURES; SLEEP; BRAIN	Purpose: High-frequency oscillations (>100 Hz) have been proposed as localized markers of epileptic networks, but require intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. This study explored if beta- and gamma-frequency paroxysmal fast activity (PFA), recorded interictally during non-REM steep, could be used as a scalp EEG marker of epileptogenesis in children. Methods: The presence and scalp location of PFA was visually identified in 681 patients with overnight video-EEG (age 0-18 years), and compared with ictal onset sites. The clinical features of patients with PFA were compared with patients without PFA along with evidence of PFA evolution in 35 patients who had multiple video-EEG records. Results: PFA was present in 16% of all patients and in 28% of those with seizures. PFA was more frequently observed in EEGs from patients 3 years of age or younger (>40%), and children with infantile spasms (85%). When present, PFA predicted if the patient had epilepsy with 97% accuracy, and was not found in individuals with non-epileptic events. PFA localized with EEG-ictal onset sites with 91% sensitivity and 82% accuracy. Ictal scalp EEG events began with beta- and gamma-frequencies in 80% of patients with PFA, and they had increased seizure frequencies compared with non-PFA cases. In patients with multiple video-EEG studies, PFA showed progression over increased numbers of electrodes in 74%, improvement in 15%, and remained unchanged in 12% and correlated with seizure evolution. PFA was not associated with other seizure types, anatomic location, type of antiepileptic drug, etiology, or histopathology. Conclusions: While relatively infrequent, interictal PFA was specific in identifying younger children with epilepsy, co-localized with the ictal onset sites on scalp video-EEG, and progressed and correlated with seizure severity.

Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially arising from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on EEG recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of eye artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well. This paper presents noise can filter using an artificial neural network for removal of blink interference from EEG signals. The input to the neural network, used in this work, is not a raw sampled signal. We used a simple EEG model expressed by the sinusoidal waves with the Markov process amplitude as the training data of NN. This EEG model in both a frequency domain and a time domain can be applied to quantitatively express the features of the EEG. After training, input to the neural network EEG signals containing blink as the test data. Results of computer simulations indicate that blink artifact is eliminated by this method. Removing artifacts from EEG signal may aid the work of medical doctors, because artifacts disturb their attention. Removing artifacts is also important in analysis of EEG signal. It may be used as a preprocessing in diagnostic system.

However, the respective contribution of phasic activity and phase resetting of ongoing EEG oscillation remains largely debated. We here applied the EEGlab procedure in order to quantify the contribution of electroencephalographic oscillation in the generation of the frontal N30 component of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) triggered by median nerve electrical stimulation at the wrist. Power spectrum and intertrial coherence analysis were performed on EEG recordings in relation to median nerve stimulation. Results: The frontal N30 component was accompanied by a significant phase-locking of beta/gamma oscillation (25-35 Hz) and to a lesser extent of 80 Hz oscillation. After the selection in each subject of the trials for which the power spectrum amplitude remained unchanged, we found pure phase-locking of beta/gamma oscillation (25-35 Hz) peaking about 30 ms after the stimulation. Transition across trials from uniform to normal phase distribution revealed temporal phase reorganization of ongoing 30 Hz EEG oscillations in relation to stimulation. In a proportion of trials, this phase-locking was accompanied by a spectral power increase peaking in the 30 Hz frequency band. This corresponds to the complex situation of 'phase-locking with enhancement' in which the distinction between the contribution of phasic neural event versus EEG phase resetting is hazardous. Conclusion: The identification of a pure phase-locking in a large proportion of the SEP trials reinforces the contribution of the oscillatory model for the physiological correlates of the frontal N30. This may imply that ongoing EEG rhythms, such as beta/gamma oscillation, are involved in somatosensory information processing.

Recently the mu rhythm by motor imagination has been used as a reliable EEG pattern for brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Considering the non-stationary characteristics of the motor imagery EEG, the EMD method is proposed to detect the mu rhythm during left and right hand movement imagination. By analyzing the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the mu rhythm can be detected. And by Hilbert marginal spectrum, the ERD/ERS phenomenon of mu rhythm can be found. The results in this paper demonstrate that the EMD method is a effective time-frequency analysis tool for non-stationary EEG signal.

In adults, the clinical signs of seizures are well defined and easily recognizable. But in newborns, these signs are either subtle or completely absent. For this reason, the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the most dependable tool used for detecting seizures in newborns. Considering the non-stationary and multicomponent nature of the EEG signals, time-frequency (TF) based methods were found to be very suitable for the analysis of such signals. Using TF representation of EEG signals allows extracting TF signatures that are characteristic of EEG seizures. In this paper we present a TF method for newborn EEG seizure detection using a TF matched filter. The threshold used to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure is data-dependent and is set using the EEG background. Multichannel geometrical correlation, based on a concept of incidence matrix, was utilized to further enhance the performance of the detector.	[Khlif, M.

It is important to monitor the brain condition to prevent from a sequela. EEG (electroencephalogram) analysis is one of the most familiar methods. The goal of this study is to develop integrated EEG analysis software. The software consists of data acquisition, waveform memory management, and data analysis components. At this point in time, it can display waveform, spectrum and topography changes of each frequency component for any electrode group, and DRT (deviation ratio topography) in real time. Moreover, the system warns the operator via alarm when the EEG changes significantly. In this study, we also propose the application of moving average-type neural networks (MANN) to analyze the EEG. In this method, the measured EEG is divided into overlapped period of 30 sec. A MANN is trained to predict the EEG using five previous samples in each period. After training, the connecting weights of each MANN are compared using the inner product to evaluate changes in brain condition. According to the results of clinical data analysis, the usefulness of both the MANN analysis and DRT analysis was confirmed.

The proximity of ECoG electrodes to EEG sources enhances their spatial resolution, as well as their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for high frequency EEG activity. ECoG recordings have therefore been used to study the event-related dynamics of brain oscillations in a variety of frequency ranges, and in a variety of functional-neuroanatomic systems, including cortical networks responsible for language. Synchronized gamma oscillations particularly in the high gamma range (>60Hz) was suggested to play a role in binding between cortical regions, essential part of efficient semantic network. The functional response properties of high gamma activity (HGA) are distinct from similar phenomena in lower frequencies. The HGA findings are consistent with its proposed binding role in models of neural computation. Preliminary studies suggest that interactions between gamma oscillations in macroscopic local field potentials (LFP) generated by different large-scale populations of neurons engaged by the same functional task occur in gamma frequencies at latencies consistent with the timing of task performance. The neuronal mechanisms underlying high gamma activity and its distinctive response properties in humans are still largely unknown, but their research through invasive means is expected to support and expand their potential clinical and research applications, including functional brain mapping, brain-computer interfaces, and neurophysiological studies of human cognition. In our lab studies we aim to asses HGA and compare it to event related potentials (ERP's) at different stages of linguistic processing from early sensory to late lexical and semantic stages of processing. The results of these studies indicate that HGA which is related to the semantic network activation distinguished spatially and temporally from the early sensory registration. HGA specific to semantic processing occurs mainly in late stages of processing and its cortical distribution is restricted in comparison to ERP's response of the same process.

The present research evaluates a set of analysis methods that have recently been used to provide evidence for this hypothesis. To evaluate these methods, we apply each of them to two simulated data sets: one set that includes theta phase resetting and a second that comprises phasic peaks embedded in EEG noise. The results indicate that the analysis methods do not effectively distinguish between the two simulated data sets. In particular, the simulated data set constructed from phasic peaks, though containing no synchronization of ongoing EEG activity, demonstrates properties previously interpreted as supporting the synchronized oscillation account of the ERN. These findings suggest that the proposed analysis methods cannot provide unambiguous evidence that the ERN is generated by phase resetting of ongoing oscillations.

For Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI, motor imagery is considered as one of the most effective ways. Different imagery activities can be classified based on the changes in mu and/or beta rhythms and their spatial distributions. However, the change in these rhythmic patterns varies from one subject to another. This causes an unavoidable time-consuming fine-tuning process in building a BCI for every subject. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) to solve the problem. First, we decompose the EEG signals into sub-bands using a filter bank. Subsequently, we apply a discriminative analysis to extract SBCSP features. The SBCSP features are then fed into Linear Discriminant Analyzers (LDA) to obtain scores which reflect the classification capability of each frequency band. Finally, the scores are fused to make decision. We evaluate two fusion methods: Recursive Band Elimination (RBE) and Meta-Classifier (MC). We assess our approaches on a standard database from BCI Competition III. We also compare our method with two other approaches that address the same issue. The results show that our method outperforms the other two approaches and achieves similar result as compared to the best one in the literature which was obtained by a time-consuming fine-tuning process.

Oscillations between 250 and 500 Hz, or fast ripples (FR), appeared related to the epileptic focus whereas ripples (80-200 Hz) were not. We report high-frequency oscillations recorded with intracranial macroelectrodes in seven patients with refractory focal epilepsy during slow-wave sleep. We characterize the relation of fast oscillations to the seizure focus and quantify their concordance with epileptiform transients, with which they are strongly associated. The patients were selected because interictal spikes were found within and outside the seizure onset zone. Visual inspection was used to identify and classify the ripples and FRs according to their relation to epileptiform spikes. Continuous-time wavelet analysis was used to compute their power. Ripples were present in all patients while FRs where found in five of the seven patients. Most ripples and FRs occurred at the same time as epileptiform transients. The rate of occurrence of ripples was higher within the seizure onset zone than outside in four of seven patients. The rate of FRs was much higher within the seizure onset zone than outside in four of the five patients with FRs ( in these four patients, FRs were almost inexistent outside the seizure onset zone). The power of ripples and FRs tended to be higher in the electrodes where their rate was also higher. These results indicate that FRs were more restricted to the electrodes located within the seizure onset zone, especially to the hippocampus, than ripples. In only one patient, FRs were more frequent outside the seizure onset zone; this patient was the only one with cortical dysplasia and the electrode with a high rate of FRs was inside the lesion. This study demonstrates that interictal ripples and FRs can be recorded with depth macroelectrodes in patients. Most occur at the time of epileptiform spikes but some are isolated. Ripples do not show a clear differentiation between the seizure onset zone and remote areas, whereas FRs have a higher rate and higher power in the seizure onset zone. Our results also suggest a special capacity of the abnormal hippocampus to generate FRs, although they were also recorded in other structures.

These systems can detect discrete stages (Stage MT, W, 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM). But, it is impossible to extract much information in detail by them. Therefore, we tried to continuous wavelet analysis applied to EEG signals in order to extract more precise information for the stages. We have proposed a modified wavelet transform method and an extraction method of time series of peak frequency based on time-frequency analysis. It was confirmed that the modified wavelet transform method was effective, although it was necessary to tune the parameter in the modified wavelet transform in order to get more effective features. In this paper, tuning method of modified wavelet transform is discussed from viewpoint of the feature extraction about human sleep EEG stages. Two types (linear and nonlinear) of tuning methods are proposed. And it is confirmed that nonlinear tuning method based on sigmoid function is effective through the experimental studies.

Normal sleep homeostasis and lack of epilepsy phenotype in GABA(A) receptor alpha 3 subunit-knockout mice	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						thalamo-cortical network; EEG rhythms; spectral analysis; gephyrin; spike-wave discharges; sleep deprivation	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; GABA(A) RECEPTOR SUBTYPE; RECIPROCAL INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS; RAT-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; GABAERGIC SYNAPSES; NETWORK SYNCHRONY; MESSENGER-RNAS; A RECEPTORS; MOUSE MODEL	Thalamo-cortical networks generate specific patterns of oscillations during distinct vigilance states and epilepsy, well characterized by electroencephalography (EEG). Oscillations depend on recurrent synaptic loops, which are controlled by GABAergic transmission. In particular, GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit are expressed predominantly in cortical layer VI and thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT) and regulate the activity and firing pattern of neurons in relay nuclei. Therefore, ablation of these receptors by gene targeting might profoundly affect thalamo-cortical oscillations. Here, we investigated the role of alpha 3-GABA(A) receptors in regulating vigilance states and seizure activity by analyzing chronic EEG recordings in alpha 3 subunit-knockout (alpha 3-KO) mice. The presence of postsynaptic alpha 3-GABA(A) receptors/gephyrin clusters in the nRT and GABA(A)-mediated synaptic currents in acute thalamic slices was also examined. EEG spectral analysis showed no difference between genotypes during non rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep or at waking-NREM sleep transitions. EEG power in the spindle frequency range (10-15 Hz) was significantly lower at NREM-REM sleep transitions in mutant compared with wild-type mice. Enhancement of sleep pressure by 6 h sleep deprivation did not reveal any differences in the regulation of EEG activities between genotypes. Finally, the waking EEG showed a slightly larger power in the 11-13-Hz band in alpha 3-KO mice. However, neither behavior nor the waking EEG showed alterations suggestive of absence seizures. Furthermore, alpha 3-KO mice did not differ in seizure susceptibility in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Strikingly, despite the disruption of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed intact inhibitory synaptic transmission in the nRT of alpha 3-KO mice. These findings show that the lack of alpha 3-GABA(A) receptors is extensively compensated for to preserve the integrity of thalamo-cortical function in physiological and pathophysiological situations.

We evaluated the electrophysiological reaction to magnetic stimulation during and 2-4 s after 20 trains of 20-pulses rTMS, using event-related power (ERPow) that reflects the regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies, and event-related coherence (ERCoh) that reflects the interregional functional connectivity of oscillatory neural activity. These event-related transformations were for the upper a (10-12 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) frequency ranges, respectively. For the a band, threshold rTMS and subthreshold rTMS induced an ERPow increase during the trains of stimulation mainly in frontal and central regions ipsilateral to stimulation. For the P band, a similar synchronization of cortical oscillations for both rTMS intensities was seen. Moreover, subthreshold rTMS affected a-band activity more than threshold rTMS, inducing a specific ERCoh decrease over the posterior regions during the trains of stimulation. For beta band, the decrease in functional coupling was observed mainly during threshold rTMS. These findings provide a better understanding of the cortical effects of high-frequency rTMS, whereby the induction of oscillations reflects the capacity of electromagnetic pulses to alter regional and interregional synaptic transmissions of neural populations.

Administration of GABAergic agonists abolished the theta rhythm recorded from HPC. This effect was reversible. A substantial difference in the recovery time course between frequency versus amplitude and power of hippocampal theta was observed. While theta frequency exhibited a rapid reappearance with a shallow slope, the power and amplitude showed a gradual recovery with a steeper slope. The PH injection of GABAergic antagonists produced HPC theta with increased power. These results demonstrate that both types of GABAergic receptors localized in PH are engaged in mechanisms responsible for generating hippocampal theta oscillations in freely behaving cats. The present study provides additional support for the essential difference between rats and cats in the programming of HPC theta amplitude and frequency. While the PH in rats is involved in programming the frequency of theta rhythm, the same region in cats mainly determines theta amplitude. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A method capable of predicting the occurrence of seizures from the electroencephalogram ( EEG) of epilepsy patients would open new therapeutic possibilities. Since the 1970s investigations on the predictability of seizures have advanced from preliminary descriptions of seizure precursors to controlled studies applying prediction algorithms to continuous multi-day EEG recordings. While most of the studies published in the 1990s and around the turn of the millennium yielded rather promising results, more recent evaluations could not reproduce these optimistic findings, thus raising a debate about the validity and reliability of previous investigations. In this review, we will critically discuss the literature on seizure prediction and address some of the problems and pitfalls involved in the designing and testing of seizure-prediction algorithms. We will give an account of the current state of this research field, point towards possible future developments and propose methodological guidelines for future studies on seizure prediction.

Local field potentials (LFPs), simultaneously recorded from distributed sites in the cerebral cortex of monkeys, are treated as signals generated by local neuronal assemblies. During the delay period of a visual pattern discrimination task, oscillatory assembly activity is manifested in the LFPs in the beta-frequency range (14-30 Hz). Coherence analysis has shown that these oscillations are phase synchronized in functional networks in the sensorimotor cortex in relation to maintenance of contralateral hand position, and in the visual cortex in relation to anticipation of the visual stimulus. Granger causality analysis has revealed information flow in the sensorimotor network that is consistent with a peripheral sensorimotor feedback loop, and in the visual network that is consistent with top-down anticipatory modulation of assemblies in the primary visual cortex.

The control (Before and After) conditions required the subject to maintain first dorsal interosseous muscle contraction without visual stimulation. In the visual task, a random series of visual stimuli were displayed on a screen while the subjects maintained the muscle contraction. The subjects were asked to ignore the stimuli in the Ignore condition and to count certain stimuli in the Count condition. Also, in the arithmetic task, the subjects were asked to perform a simple subtraction. The EEG-EMG coherence found at C-3 site at 13-30 Hz (beta) was increased and sustained in magnitude during the Ignore and Count conditions, respectively. To examine the cause of the change of coherence, changes of EEG and EMG spectral power were computed for each frequency band. There was little change in the EMG spectral power in any frequency bands. While the spectral power of EEG unchanged in the beta band, it significantly increased and decreased in the range of 8-12 Hz and of 31-50 Hz, respectively, for both Ignore and Count conditions, not only at the C3 site but at various sites as well. These results were in contrast to those obtained for the arithmetic task: the beta band EEG-EMG coherence was attenuated and the EEG spectral power at 4-7 Hz and at 31-50 Hz were significantly increased and decreased, respectively. As a conclusion, the present results are consistent with the idea that the enhanced 8-12 Hz/decreased 31-50 Hz oscillations affect strength of the beta band cortico-muscular synchronization by suppressing the visual processing.

One of the reasons for such inconsistencies may be methodological while performing EEG analysis. To overcome methodological limitations, in the present study we examined the composition of electroencephalographic (EEG) brain oscillations in broad frequency band (0.5-30 Hz) in 13 withdrawal opioid-dependent patients and 14 healthy subjects during resting condition (closed eyes). The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behaviour were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs). It was reported that early withdrawal had a generalized effect: the activity in all EEG channels was affected nearly equally. EEG of withdrawal patients was characterized by (a) different dominant SP types (had unique SP types which describe beta-frequency band), (b) increased number of SP types observed in each EEG channel, (c) a larger percentage of alpha(2)-, beta- and poly-rhythmic activity, and by a smaller percentage of delta-, theta- and alpha(1)-rhythmic activity, (d) predominantly right-sided asymmetry and (e) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha- and beta- brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for theta-activity when compared with control subjects. When taken together, these findings suggest a considerable reorganization of composition of brain oscillations, which reflects a disorganization process and an allostatic state with neuronal activation in EEG of opioid withdrawal patients.

Multiway analysis of Alzheimer's disease: Classification based on space-frequency characteristics of EEG time series	WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING 2008, VOLS I-II	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering 2008	JUL 02-04, 2008	Imperial Coll London, London, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Engineers	Imperial Coll London	multiway analysis; PARAFAC; classification of Alzheimer's patients; EEG	TENSOR FACTORIZATION; DEMENTIA	In this paper, we present a method to detect the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction. We used a multiway analysis to extract the spatial-frequency characteristics for classification of subjects. The filters obtained from a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model were used to describe the groups and reduce their description to meaningful features in frequency and space, helping the identification of subjects developing Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed 20-second steady state, artifact free EEG time series recorded over 21 leads from age-matched subjects. The subject database included 38 controls, 22 mild cognitive impairment subjects (MCI) and 23 Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). We applied a multiway analysis based on the PARAFAC model to extract the multilinear interactions between groups, frequency, and space. In a divide and conquer scheme, we obtained a classification accuracy of 74.7% comparing the control subjects to the demented subjects, and we obtained a classification accuracy of 75.6% comparing MCI subjects to AD patients. This approach combined the multilinear interaction within the tensor formed by subjects X frequency power X regions and provided an interesting interpretation and characterization of Alzheimer's disease in the early stages from a simple set of features. The multiway modeling of EEG recordings applied to the characterization and classification of Alzheimer's disease patients in the early stages has not been employed as yet Even though the classification results are modest compared with the available literature, this method could help extract more interesting features as well as summarize information for classification or diagnosis at a higher level than subject-by-subject EEG analysis. This method, if combined with other features, could reveal itself to be very promising for diagnosing Alzheimer's patients in the early stages. Moreover, it can be easily generalized as well as improved by numerous linear and nonlinear features of EEGs.	[Latchoumane, C. -F.

Cocaine cue versus cocaine dosing in humans: Evidence for distinct neurophysiological response profiles	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						cocaine; cues; ACTH; electroencephalography; craving; reward	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; SMOKED COCAINE; ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; ACTIVATION; OSCILLATIONS; QEEG; EEG	Subjective, physiological and electroencephalographic (EEG) profiles were studied in cocaine dependent study participants in response to cocaine cue exposure or a dose of smoked cocaine. Both stimuli increased subjective ratings of cocaine high and craving, enhanced negative affect, and boosted plasma ACTH and skin conductance levels. However, cocaine dose produced a greater increase in high and a more prolonged increase in plasma ACTH, while cocaine cue produced a decline in skin temperature. Both stimuli produced increases in absolute theta, alpha and beta EEG power over the prefrontal cortex. However, interhemispheric EEG coherence over the prefrontal cortex decreased during cocaine cue exposure but increased following cocaine dose. Moreover, correlation analysis of subjective, physiological and EEG responding to cocaine cue and dose revealed distinct profiles. Delta and theta activity were associated with negative affect during cocaine cue exposure, but were associated with cocaine craving and reward following cocaine dosing. In both conditions, alpha activity was marker for anxiousness but not high. These data demonstrate similar subjective, physiological responding in clinical laboratory states of cocaine craving and reward. However, differences in EEG response profiles, and their relationship to function, indicate distinct neurophysiological mediators of cocaine craving and reward within the prefrontal cortex.

As hypothesized, the EEG gamma band was useful for differentiating worry from baseline and relaxation. During worry induction, GAD patients showed higher levels of gamma activity than control participants in posterior electrode sites that have been previously associated with negative emotion. Gamma fluctuations in these electrode sites were correlated with subjective emotional experience ratings lending additional support to interpretations of negative affect. Following 14 weeks of psychotherapy, the GAD group reported less negative affect with worry inductions and the corresponding gamma sites that previously differentiated the clinical from control groups changed for the GAD patients in the direction of control participants. These findings suggest converging evidence that patients suffering from GAD experience more negative emotion during worry and that the EEG gamma band is useful for monitoring fluctuations in pathological worry expected to follow successful treatment.

Concurrent EEG and auditory startle reflex were recorded from 15 healthy participants during Pulse-Alone and Prepulse+Pulse trials with 60, 120, and 240 ms prepulse-pulse intervals. A significant PPI of the startle reflex on all Prepulse+Pulse trials was associated with a significant PPI of alpha oscillations at central and temporal locations and of gamma oscillations at frontal, central, and temporal locations on some Prepulse+Pulse trials. PPI of delta oscillations was not observed. These results confirm our recent finding stating that PPI functions as a sensory-motor as well as a sensory-cognitive gating mechanism because alpha and gamma oscillations mediate cognitive processes.

Bispectral analysis, a type of higher order spectral analysisi provides us with the ability to investigate such nonlinear interactions. Based on the fact that the bispectrum of a linear Gaussian process is zero, a surrogate data method was proposed to test the null hypothesis that the original data were generated by a linear Gaussian process. The method was first tested on two simulation examples. It was then applied to local field potential recordings from a monkey performing a visuornotor task. The analysis reveals nonzero bispectra for beta and gamma band activities in the premotor cortex. The rigorous statistical framework proves essential in establishing these results.

Visual P2 component is related to theta phase-locking	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						theta; oscillations; PLI; total power; phase-locking	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; MECHANISMS; COMPLEX; ALPHA	In this study we investigated the hypothesis whether P2-related differences tested in a visual priming paradigm are associated with theta phase-locking. We recorded the EEG from 31 electrodes and calculated phase-locking index and total power differences for frequencies between 2 and 20 Hz. ERPs (event-related potentials) were analyzed for P1, N1 and P2 components. P2 showed strongest task-related amplitude differences between congruent and incongruent targets. A source analyses was performed for the P2 component using sLoreta that revealed local generators of the P2 in parieto-occipital regions. Phase-locking analyses showed specific effects in the theta range (4-6 Hz) appearing in time windows at around the P2 component. We draw the conclusion that phase-locked theta reflect top-down regulation processes mediating information between memory systems and is in part involved in the modulation of the P2 component.

A novel approach to the detection of synchronisation in EEG based on empirical mode decomposition	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Time-frequency; Coherence; Phase synchrony; Empirical mode decomposition	VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; FIELD POTENTIALS; PHASE-LOCKING; COHERENCE; HYPOTHESIS; TRANSFORM; RESPONSES; CORTEX	Transient neural assemblies mediated by synchrony in particular frequency ranges are thought to underlie cognition. We propose a new approach to their detection, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a data-driven approach removing the need for arbitrary bandpass filter cut-offs. Phase locking is sought between modes. We explore the features of EMD, including making a quantitative assessment of its ability to preserve phase content of signals, and proceed to develop a statistical framework with which to assess synchrony episodes. Furthermore, we propose a new approach to ensure signal decomposition using EMD. We adapt the Hilbert spectrum to a time-frequency representation of phase locking and are able to locate synchrony successfully in time and frequency between synthetic signals reminiscent of EEG. We compare our approach, which we call EMD phase locking analysis (EMDPL) with existing methods and show it to offer improved time-frequency localisation of synchrony.

In this pilot study we explore whether similar ERS/ERD patterns emerge during language translation and which frequency bands sensitively respond to the difficulty of translation and the translation success. Thirteen female students of translation and interpreting were visually presented high and low frequency English words that had to be translated into German. Time-frequency representations of ERS/ERD between 2 and 50 Hz displayed a theta ERS response about 200-600 ms after word presentation, a beta ERD from about 400 ins, and alpha ERS and ERD patterns about 200-400 ms after word presentation. Statistical analyses of the ERS/ERD data in the theta (4-7 Hz), two alpha frequency bands (7-10 Hz and 10-13 Hz), and a beta band (20-30 Hz) predominantly revealed: (a) higher parietal theta ERS and frontal upper alpha ERD during the translation of low as compared to high frequency words, and (b) generally stronger ERD in the lower alpha band and larger left-hermispheric upper alpha ERD for successfully translated in contrast to not translated low frequency words. These findings provide first evidence of the sensitivity of the theta and alpha ERS/ERD measure to lexical-semantic processes involved in language translation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed algorithm adaptively segments the time axis by dividing the EEG data into non-uniform time segments over a dyadic tree. This is followed by grouping the expansion coefficients in the frequency axis in each segment. The most discriminative features are selected from the segmented time-frequency plane and fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The proposed algorithm achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.3% on six subjects by selecting the most discriminant subspaces for each one. For comparison, classification results based on an autoregressive model are also presented where the mean accuracy of the same subjects turned out to be 79.5%. Interestingly the subjects and two hemispheres of each subject are represented by distinct segmentations and features. This indicates that the proposed method can handle inter-subject variability when constructing brain-computer interfaces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Respiratory Cycle-Related EEG Changes during Sleep Reflect Esophageal Pressures	SLEEP			English	Article						Polysomnography; sleep apnea, obstructive; signal processing, computer-assisted; respiratory cycle-related EEG changes; respiration; esophageal pressure; electroencephalography	POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; CHILDREN	Study Objectives: Respiratory cycle-related EEG changes (RCREC) have been demonstrated during sleep by digital analysis and hypothesized to represent subtle inspiratory microarousals that may help to explain daytime sleepiness in patients with sleep-disordered breathing. We therefore examined for the first time associations between RCREC and esophageal pressure swings (Delta Pes) that reflect work of breathing. Design: Retrospective analysis Setting: Academic sleep laboratory Patients: Forty adults referred for suspected sleep disordered breathing Interventions: Polysomnography with esophageal pressure monitoring and automatic computation of Delta Pes using a novel algorithm. Results: Computed Delta Pes for nearly all respiratory cycles during sleep correlated well with visual scoring of selected respiratory cycle samples (Spearman rho = 0,86, P < 0.0001). The RCREC within the sigma EEG range (12.5-15.5 Hz) rather than that within other frequency ranges most often showed significant within-subject inverse correlations with Delta Pes. In contrast, in between-subject comparisons, beta (15.5-30.5 Hz) and to a lesser extent theta (4.5-7.5 Hz) RCREC, rather than sigma RCREC, showed significant inverse associations with mean Delta Pes. Conclusions: Variation within subjects of sigma RCREC with Delta Pes supports previous evidence that RCREC within this range may reflect microarousals exacerbated by increased work of breathing. Correlation of beta and theta, but not sigma RCREC with Delta Pes in between-subject comparisons is more difficult to explain but suggests that ranges other than sigma also deserve further investigation for clinical utility.

We recorded 10 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls for two consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory, using a 10-electrode EEG montage. Sixty seconds of REM sleep EEG without artifact were analyzed using FFT spectral analysis. Absolute and relative spectral amplitudes of five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta] and beta2) were extracted and compared between the two groups. Frequency bands with significant differences were correlated with BPRS positive and negative symptoms scores. Patients with schizophrenia showed lower relative alpha and higher relative beta2 spectral amplitudes compared to healthy controls over the averaged total scalp. Analysis using cortical regions showed lower relative alpha over frontal, central and temporal regions and higher relative beta2 over the occipital region. Absolute spectral amplitude was not different between groups for any given EEG band. However, absolute alpha activity correlated negatively with BPRS positive symptoms scores and correlated positively with negative symptoms scores. Since similar results have been reported following EEG spectral analysis during the waking state, we conclude that abnormalities of subcortical-cortical transfer of information in schizophrenia could be generated by mechanisms common to REM sleep and waking.

To obtain a reliable estimate of frontal theta power we applied ICA on band-pass filtered (2-9 Hz) EEG data. For each subject we selected the component that best matched the mid-frontal scalp topography associated with the frontal theta rhythm. We applied a time-frequency analysis on this component and used the time course of the frequency bin with the highest overall power to form a regressor that modeled spontaneous fluctuations in frontal theta power. No significant positive BOLD correlations with this regressor were observed. Extensive negative correlations were observed in the areas that together form the default mode network. We conclude that frontal theta activity can be seen as an EEG index of default mode network activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Scheeringa, Rene; Bastiaansen, Marcel C.

A method for spatiotemporal mapping of event-related modulation of cortical rhythmic activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; TASK-RELATED CHANGES; HUMAN BRAIN; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BOLD RESPONSE; MEG-DATA; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; LOCALIZATION; CORTEX	Cortical rhythmic activity can be systematically modulated by stimuli or tasks and may thus provide relevant information about brain function. Meaningful use of those phenomena requires characterization of both locations and time courses of event-related suppressions and increases of oscillatory activity. However, localization of the neural sources of cortical rhythms during intervals of very low levels of activity, and within short time intervals, is not a trivial matter. Hence, event-related modulation of rhythmic activity has typically been described at the level of magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensors or electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes, without reaching into the brain. Here, we introduce erDICS, an event-related version of Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources that allows spatial mapping of the level of oscillatory activity in the brain as a function of time, with respect to stimulus or task timing. By utilizing a time-resolved frequency-domain beamformer, erDICS yields the spatial distribution of both power suppressions and power increases. Permutation tests further reveal areas and time windows in which the modulations of oscillatory power are statistically significant, in individual subjects. We demonstrate the usability of erDICS on simulated and real MEG data. From the erDICS maps we identify areas showing salient event-related changes of rhythmic activity, represent them with equivalent current dipoles and calculate their contribution to the measured signal. Comparison of this multidipole model with the original signal yields a quantitative measure of goodness for the identified source areas and the analysis approach in general. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Biological signal (bio-signal) such as electroencephalogram (EEG) is known to exhibit nonlinear dynamics. Such signals cannot be modelled with traditional linear modelling techniques like autoregressive (AR) models as these models are known to provide only an approximation to the underlying properties of the non-linear signals. In this study, the suitability of EAR models as compared to AR models is shown using EEG signals in addition to several non-linear benchmark time series data where improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) values are indicated by the EAR models. Overall, the results indicate that use of EAR modelling which has yet to be exploited for bio-signal time series analysis has the huge potential in the characterisation and classification of EEG signals.

Correlation Between Fluctuations in Human Ultra-weak Photon Emission and EEG Alpha Rhythm	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha suppression; EEG; human; ultra-weak photon emission; biophotons	ANATOMIC CHARACTERIZATION; MUSCLE; MEDITATION; COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PATTERNS; CORTEX; PRACTITIONERS; OSCILLATIONS; RADICALS	"Ultra-weak photon emission" (UPE) recording is a technique that registers, non-invasively and on-line, reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluctuations. The objective of the present study was to perform simultaneous recordings in human subjects of UPE and EEG and to study a possible correlation between UPE and EEG fluctuations. Thirty-six EEG recordings of 1 h each were performed at P3 and P4 with simultaneous registration of UPE of the right dorsum hand utilizing a newly designed tabletop photomultiplier device. Both spectral, statistical and correlation analyses were performed. The data suggest significant correlations between fluctuations in photon emission and fluctuations in strength of alpha wave production in the 7-13 Hz frequency band and its 1-Hz sub-bands. Correlations between UPE and the whole alpha region were clarified when correlations were addressed UPE and specific 1-Hz sub-bands. Further clarification was observed with smaller fragments of time series data which suggested that the correlations were temporary. When one data row was shifted over defined lag periods compared to the other, different data emerged. The synchronization exhibits characteristics of a weak phase and frequency coupling, indicating that the systems are neither completely independent nor in a fixed mutual relationship. The synchronization also highlights that the weak coupling may involve slowly drifting and sliding phases. The data are discussed in relationship to mind - body interactions and the role of consciousness in health.	[Van Wijk, Roeland; Bosman, Saskia; Van Wijk, Eduard P.

The fact that seizures occur without warning in the majority of cases is one of the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. If it were possible to identify preictal precursors from the EEG of epilepsy patients, therapeutic possibilities and quality of life could improve dramatically. The last three decades have witnessed a rapid increase in the development of new EEG analysis techniques that appear to be capable of defining seizure precursors. Since the 1970s, studies on seizure prediction have advanced from preliminary descriptions of preictal phenomena and proof of principle studies via controlled studies to studies on continuous multiday recordings. At present, it is unclear whether prospective algorithms can predict seizures. If prediction algorithms are to be used in invasive seizure intervention techniques in humans, they must be proven to perform considerably better than a random predictor. The authors present an overview of the field of seizure prediction, its history, accomplishments, recent controversies, and potential for future development.

Many experimental protocols concerning specific EEG frequencies have been introduced and NF has been successfully applied to various clinical practices including epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcoholic abuse, etc. In addition to clinical application, NF has also contributed to research of the EEG such as the introduction of sensorimotor rhythm. In our previous works, a portable NF system had been developed, which consists of a portable EEG amplifier, a headband with dry electrodes placed on Fp1 and Fp2 sites, and various types of training programs such as car-racing, arrow-shooting, meditation, etc. And an EEG-analysis program based on time-frequency analysis had also been developed for evaluating performance of NF training. Especially, eight quotients, designated as brain quotients, play an important role in evaluation process, which characterize behaviors of EEG rhythms effectively. In this work, we extended the previous one to nonlinear dynamical analysis of the EEG for a better evaluation of the effect of NF training on brain functions. For this purpose, we calculated the correlation dimension (CD) and the Lyapunov exponent (LE) indicating the complexity and the level of chaos of the EEG, respectively. We obtained distributions of CD and LE for age groups from 10s to 60s and correlations between the nonlinear and the linear (brain quotients) coefficients. We also discussed reliability of our portable EEG measurement system by comparing with a generally used system. Finally, we suggested a proper index reflecting attention by considering event-related potential components, alpha rhythm, and sensorimotor rhythm.

An imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition may manifest itself in electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities in the high frequency range. The aim of this study was to investigate whether beta and gamma range EEG abnormalities are characteristic for young boys with autism (BWA). Methods: EEG was recorded during sustained visual attention in two independent samples of BWA from Moscow and Gothenburg, aged 3 to 8 years, and in age matched typically developing boys (TDB). High frequency EEG spectral power was analyzed. Results: In both samples, BWA demonstrated a pathological increase of gamma (24.4-44.0 Hz) activity at the electrode locations distant from the sources of myogenic artefacts. In both samples, the amount of gamma activity correlated positively with degree of developmental delay in BWA. Conclusions: The excess of high frequency oscillations may reflect imbalance in the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cortex. Given the important role of high frequency EEG rhythms for perceptual and cognitive processes, early and probably genetically determined abnormalities in the neuronal mechanisms generating high frequency EEG rhythms may contribute to development of the disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the specificity of the findings for autism.

Separating Cognitive Processes with Principal Components Analysis of EEG Time-Frequency Distributions	ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS, ARCHITECTURES, AND IMPLEMENTATIONS XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, and Implementantions XVIII	AUG 10-11, 2008	San Diego, CA	SPIE			ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEM; BAD OUTCOMES; FEEDBACK; BRAIN; TASK; LOSSES; REWARD; GAINS	Measurement of EEG event-related potential (ERP) data has been most commonly undertaken in the time-domain, which can be complicated to interpret when separable activity overlaps in time. When the overlapping activity has distinct frequency characteristics, however, time-frequency (TF) signal processing techniques can be useful. The current report utilized ERP data from a cognitive task producing typical feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 ERP components which overlap in time. TF transforms were computed using the binomial reduced interference distribution (RID), and the resulting TF activity was then characterized using principal components analysis (PCA). Consistent with previous work, results indicate that the FRN was more related to theta activity (3-7 Hz) and P300 more to delta activity (below 3 Hz). At the same time, both time-domain measures were shown to be mixtures of TF theta and delta activity, highlighting the difficulties with overlapping activity. The TF theta and delta measures, on the other hand, were largely independent from each other, but also independently indexed the feedback stimulus parameters investigated. Results support the view that TF decomposition can greatly improve separation of overlapping EEG/ERP activity relevant to cognitive models of performance monitoring.

This raises the question which signatures of neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range.

Scalp EEG recordings were obtained from six patients with history of intractable partial onset epilepsy treated with VNS as adjunctive therapy to medicines. Averaged scalp EEG samples were used as features for separation. SVM classification accuracy was used as a measure of EEG similarity to separate a time segment during the beginning of stimulation from all the successive non-overlapping time segments within a full VNS on/off cycle. This analysis was performed for all the automated VNS cycles occurring during approximately twenty-four hours of 25 channels of scalp EEG. The patient that resulted in the lowest degree of EEG pattern similarity had the highest VNS stimulation frequency and experienced a monthly seizure rate among the lowest of all six patients included in this study. The patient with the greatest degree of pattern similarity had the lowest VNS stimulation frequency, shortest VNS pulse width, and experienced the greatest monthly seizure rate of all six patients included in this study. It is possible that VNS exerts its therapeutic effect by mimicking a theorized seizure effect for which a seizure has been observed to "reset" the brain from an unfavorable preictal state to a more favorable interictal state. These encouraging results suggest that data mining tools may be able to extract EEG patterns which could be used as an electrographic marker of optimal VNS stimulation parameters.

The time-frequency analysis of single-trial ERP data allows to specify in a reliable manner whether the P3 reduction in schizophrenia is due to the decreased P3 response in single trials or due to the intertrial variability in the timing of the response. Since the delta response most strongly contributes to the P3 amplitude, we focused to the low frequency range of the time-frequency transformed data. EEG was recorded from chronic schizophrenia patients and matched healthy controls during a simple visual oddball task. The wavelet transforms of the averaged ERP and the single trials were computed to investigate the amplitudes of the evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) delta (1-3 Hz) responses, respectively. Evoked delta activity and P3 amplitude to target stimuli were both reduced significantly in patients with schizophrenia, whereas no such difference was obtained for the total delta activity. The significant reduction of the evoked delta response and the absence of such a difference in the total delta response of schizophrenia patients reveals that the delta band response is weakly phase-locked to stimulus in schizophrenia. This result suggests that the reduced P3 amplitudes in the averaged ERPs of schizophrenia patients result from a temporal jitter in the activation of neural circuits engaged in P3 generation.

Our work is based on a data structure, a graph, which sums up the brain activity in the spatial, temporal and frequency domains. From the information contained in the time-frequency map of EEG signals, a graph is constructed. In order to analyze the complexity of the signal, our method is based on a multi-scale approach with several levels of information extraction. To compare different EEG signals, we use techniques of graph-matching with our data structure. The developed algorithm is based on the A* algorithm that allows us to compare variations of the recorded EEG in term of latency, frequency, energy and activated areas. The results of this project show first, that the graph is an appropriate tool to reduce the cortical activity complexity, and second, that graph-matching offers some interesting perspectives in order to describe functional brain activity.

The background of this study is a recent debate about the functional meaning of evoked and induced gamma oscillations. Brain electrical source analysis (BESA) and low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) was performed on the basis of the event-related potential (ERP) data. A component at around 230 ms (termed C230) showed strongest differences between objects and scrambled objects. Time-frequency analyses were run across electrodes and within the dipole sources. We found increased gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) between 200 and 300 ms for real objects. This effect was strongest in a fronto-medial source. Induced gamma, as also shown in previous studies, reflects the more task-relevant mechanism where object representations become activated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The method, based on averaging of time-normalized smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distributions, is applied to data recorded from nine patients undergoing propofol anesthesia. An extensive representation of the frequency progression pattern related to the induction of anesthesia is given and the time-frequency characteristics that are consistent/not consistent between patients are determined. It is also illustrated how four different clinical end-points, generally used in the assessment of the depth of anesthesia, can be related to different phases of the frequency progression pattern. The method presented has importance in providing information about the neurophysiological phenomenon during induction of anesthesia and can therefore be used in the development of new monitoring algorithms.

Transient induced gamma-band response in EEG as a manifestation of miniature saccades	NEURON			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; OCULOMOTOR CONTROL; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; MICROSACCADES; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; ORIENTATION	The induced gamma-band EEG response (iGBR) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range similar to 200-300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic "spike potential." The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.

Wavelet Jensen-Shannon divergence as a tool for studying the dynamics of frequency band components in EEG epileptic seizures	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Jensen-Shannon divergence; wavelets analysis; EEG; epileptic seizure	INFORMATIONAL TOOLS; ENTROPY	We develop a quantitative method of analysis of EEG records. The method is based on the wavelet analysis of the record and on the capability of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to identify dynamical changes in a time series. The JSD is a measure of distance between probability distributions. Therefore for its evaluation it is necessary to define a (time dependent) probability distribution along the record. We define this probability distribution from the wavelet decomposition of the associated time series. The wavelet JSD provides information about dynamical changes in the scales and can be considered a complementary methodology reported earlier [O.A. Rosso, S. Blanco, A. Rabinowicz, Signal Processing 86 (2003) 1275; O.A. Rosso, S. Blanco, J. Yordanova, V. Kolev, A. Figliola, M. Schurmann, E. Basar, J. Neurosci. Methods 105 (2001) 65; O.A. Rosso, M.T. Martin, A. Figliola, K. Keller, A. Plastino, J. Neurosci. Methods 153 (2006) 163]. In the present study we have demonstrated it by analyzing EEG signal of tonic-clonic epileptic seizures applying the JSD method. The display of the JSD curves enables easy comparison of frequency band component dynamics. This would, in turn, promise easy and successful comparison of the EEG records from various scalp locations of the brain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particularly, with electroencephalogram (EEG), we can know the intension or mental state of human. To recognize those features, various parametric feature extraction methods such as central frequency, relative percent spectral energy band (RPEB), etc. is needed. In this paper, we propose an EEG signal classifier which handles time-domain EEG signal as a feature vector and reduces data dimension to create lower dimension features using in the classifier. We believe that the proposed method gives more reliable results than existing ones.

Five subjects were recruited for a non-continuous and consecutive 5 days of testing. The 10 minute ELF PEMF 0-100Hz frequency included the 'bundles' and delays, each lasting 20 msec. The skin impedance was recorded by applying the signal frequency sweep from 1Hz to 1MHz, using 'whole-body' Multiple Frequency Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (MF-BIA). The EEG activity was recorded from 16 channels, together with ECG using independent data acquisition system. The skin impedance, EEG and ECG data was analysed for 5-day exposure/control and before/after conditions. The results of this pilot study can be used for optimisation of ELF PEMF exposure time-window effect on the human body as well as to understand the underlying mechanisms of it's interaction with human biological system.

Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz. Methods: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed. Results: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms). Conclusions: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli. Significance: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.

Short-Time Fourier Transform or Wavelet transform has been used to analyze the EEG, but there is inherent uncertainty between time and frequency resolution. To cope with it, a random walk model with a quasi-parametric function is applied to the nonstationary signal. The scalp EEG is obtained during episodic memory retrieval task. Subject is required to press the button when a word pair remembered is displayed as visual stimuli. The experimental results show that the model order obtained by a random walk model is higher than model order by conventional AIC. Comparing to parameter estimation used model order by AIC, Our suggested method showed that a more realistic parameter estimation is obtained.	[Ku, Y.

Although it has been suggested that variations in mean EEG frequency are greater in the former, the existence of meaningful differences remains controversial. No evidence is as yet available for Parkinsons disease with dementia (PDD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether EEG abnormalities can discriminate between DLB, AD and PDD in the earliest stages of dementia and to do this 50 DLB, 50 AD and 40 PDD patients with slight cognitive impairment at first visit (MMSE >= 20) were studied. To improve clinical diagnostic accuracy, special emphasis was placed on identifying cognitive fluctuations and REM-sleep behaviour disorder. EEG variability was assessed by mean frequency analysis and compressed spectral arrays (CSA) in order to detect changes over time from different scalp derivations. Patients initial diagnoses were revised at a 2-year follow-up visit with neuroimaging evaluation. Initial diagnoses were confirmed in 36 DLB, 40 AD and 35 PDD patients. The most relevant group differences were observed between the AD and DLB patients in EEGs from posterior derivations (P < 0.001). Dominant frequencies were 8.3 +/- 0.6 Hz for the AD group and 7.4 +/- 1.6 Hz for the DLB group, in which most of the patients (88) exhibited a frequency band of 5.6-7.9 Hz. Dominant frequency variability also differed between the AD (1.1 +/- 0.4 Hz) and DLB groups (1.8 +/- 1.2 Hz, P < 0.001). Of note, less than a half (46) of the patients with PDD exhibited the EEG abnormalities seen in those with DLB. Graded according to the presence of alpha activity, five different patterns were identified on EEG CSA from posterior derivations. A pattern with dominant alpha bands was observed in patients with AD alone while, in those with DLB and PDD, the degree to which residual alpha and 5.6-7.9 bands appeared was related to the presence and severity of cognitive fluctuations. At follow-up, EEG abnormalities from posterior leads were seen in all subjects with DLB and in three-quarters of those with PDD. Of interest, in four patients initially labelled as having AD, in whom the occurrence of fluctuations and/or REM-sleep behaviour disorder during the 2-year follow-up had made the diagnosis of AD questionable, the initial EEG was characterized by the features observed in the DLB group. If revised consensus criteria for DLB diagnosis are properly applied (i.e. emphasizing the diagnostic weight of fluctuations and REM sleep behaviour disorder), EEG recording may act to support discrimination between AD and DLB at the earliest stages of dementia, since characteristic abnormalities may even precede the appearance of distinctive clinical features.

First, we reduce the artefacts in the scalp EEG using a novel filter that combines wavelet transforms and empirical mode decomposition. Then, the determinism in the recurrence plot is calculated. It is found that the determinism increases gradually with increasing the concentration of sevoflurane. Finally, a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model is built to describe the relationship between the concentration of sevoflurane and the processed EEG measure ('determinism' of the recurrence plot). A test sample of nine patients shows the recurrence in EEG data may track the effect of the sevoflurane on the brain. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To clarify the computational principle in these systems with essential nonlinearity, theta rhythms in rat hippocampus and in human scalp EEG were investigated. Recent discovery of grid cell and its contribution to place computation in the hippocampus were comprehensively understood by using a computational model with nonlinear oscillations. Human EEG theta (4-8 Hz) study also indicated the central role of synchronization for on demand module linking. Synchronization can crucially contribute to computation through unification among heterogeneous developing systems in real time. A basic principle toward intelligent system design was discussed for further study on the brain computation.

Two mechanisms (additive activity and phase reset) have been debated and considered as the only possible explanations for evoked responses. Here we present theoretical and empirical evidence of a third mechanism contributing to the generation of evoked responses. Interestingly, this mechanism can be deduced entirely from the characteristics of spontaneous oscillations in the absence of stimuli. We show that the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal alpha oscillations at rest are associated with changes in the mean value of ongoing activity in magnetoencephalography, a phenomenon that we term baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations. When stimuli modulate the amplitude of alpha oscillations, baseline shifts become the basis of a novel mechanism for the generation of evoked responses; the averaging of several trials leads to a cancellation of the oscillatory component but the baseline shift remains, which gives rise to an evoked response. We propose that the presence of baseline shifts associated with alpha oscillations can be explained by the asymmetric flow of inward and outward neuronal currents related to the generation of alpha oscillations. Our findings are relevant to the vast majority of electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic studies involving perceptual, cognitive and motor activity.

Current research efforts are primarily devoted to the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs), extracted from the ongoing EEG, in patients with schizophrenia and in clinically unaffected individuals who, due to their family history and current mental status, are at high risk for developing schizophrenia. In this article, we discuss the potential usefulness of ERPs and EROs as genetic vulnerability markers, as pathophysiological markers, and as markers of possible ongoing progressive cognitive and cortical deterioration in schizophrenia. Our main purpose is to illustrate that these neurophysiological measures can offer valuable quantitative biological markers of basic pathophysiological mechanisms and cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia, yet they may not be specific to current psychiatry's diagnosis and classification. These biological markers can provide unique information on the nature and extent of cognitive and brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, they can be utilized to gain deeper theoretical insights into illness etiology and pathophysiology and may lead to improvements in early detection and more effective and targeted treatment of schizophrenia. We conclude by addressing several key methodological, conceptual, and interpretative issues involved in this research field and by suggesting future research directions.

It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper.

Hemodynamic cerebral correlates of sleep spindles during human non-rapid eye movement sleep	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG)/functional MRI (fMRI); light sleep; neuroimaging; sleep physiology	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; HUMAN THALAMUS; BLOOD-FLOW; WAKE CYCLE; EEG; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; RESOLUTION; RHYTHMS	In humans, some evidence suggests that there are two different types of spindles during sleep, which differ by their scalp topography and possibly some aspects of their regulation. To test for the existence of two different spindle types, we characterized the activity associated with slow (11-13 Hz) and fast (13-15 Hz) spindles, identified as discrete events during non-rapid eye movement sleep, in non-sleep-deprived human volunteers, using simultaneous electroencephalography and functional MRI. An activation pattern common to both spindle types involved the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. No thalamic difference was detected in the direct comparison between slow and fast spindles although some thalamic areas were preferentially activated in relation to either spindle type. Beyond the common activation pattern, the increases in cortical activity differed significantly between the two spindle types. Slow spindles were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast spindles recruited a set of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. The recruitment of partially segregated cortical networks for slow and fast spindles further supports the existence of two spindle types during human non-rapid eye movement sleep, with potentially different functional significance.

We used EEG in 10 healthy subjects to investigate cortical activation during stimulation of acupuncture points (neiguan: PC-6) and nonacupuncture points. Our most interesting finding was the marked differences of amplitude of EEG power between acupuncture points and nonacupuncture points stimulation. Wavelet transform was used as the EEG signal processing method, because it has advantages in a time domain and frequency domain characteristics analysis. EEGs were collected from 16 channels, and the alpha-wave (8-13 Hz), beta-wave (13-30 Hz),theta-wave (4-8 Hz) and delta-wave (0.5-4 Hz) were used as standards for frequency bands. According to the experiment results, EEG signals increased considerably after acupuncture stimulation; in each frequency band, the average amplitude was higher after acupuncture stimulation; ECG heart rates were faster by at least 10% after acupuncture stimulation. Consequently, it will be possible to verify the function of acupuncture stimulation on neiguan (acupuncture points; PC-6) more effectively.

In I-hour sessions, 70-channel EEG data were recorded while participants attempted to use frequent compensatory trackball movements to maintain a drifting disc close to a bulls-eye at screen center. Disc trajectories were converted into two moving-average performance measures, root mean square distance of the disc from screen center in 4-s ('local') and in 20-s ('global') moving time windows. Maximally independent EEG processes and their equivalent dipole source locations were obtained using the EEGLAB toolbox (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab). Across subjects and sessions, independent EEG processes in occipital, somatomotor, and supplementary motor cortices exhibited tonic power increases during periods of high tracking error, plus additional phasic power increases in several frequency bands before and after trackball movements following disc 'perigees' (moments at which the disc began to drift away from the bulls-eye). These phasic activity increases, which were larger during high-error periods, reveal an intimate relation between EEG dynamics and top-down recognition of responding to threatening events. Thus during a continuous tracking task without impulsive stimulus onsets, sub-second scale EEG dynamics related to visuomotor task could be dissociated from slower spectral modulations linked to changes in performance and arousal. We tentatively interpret the observed EEG signal increases as indexing tonic and phasic modulations of the levels of task attention and engagement required to maintain visuomotor performance during sustained performance.

Changes in EMG coherence between long and short thumb abductor muscles during human development	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; LINKED KALLMANNS-SYNDROME; PHYSIOLOGICAL TREMOR; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; MIRROR MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; EEG; AGE	In adults, motoneurone pools of synergistic muscles that act around a common joint share a common presynaptic drive. Common drive can be revealed by both time domain and frequency domain analysis of EMG signals. Analysis in the frequency domain reveals significant coherence in the range 1-45 Hz, with maximal coherence in low (1-12 Hz) and high (16-32 Hz) ranges. The high-frequency range depends on cortical drive to motoneurones and is coherent with cortical oscillations at similar to 20 Hz frequencies. It is of interest to know whether oscillatory drive to human motoneurone pools changes with development. In the present study we examined age-related changes in coherence between rectified surface EMG signals recorded from the short and long thumb abductor muscles during steady isometric contraction obtained while subjects abducted the thumb against a manipulandum. We analysed EMG data from 36 subjects aged between 4 and 14 years, and 11 adult subjects aged between 22 and 59 years. Using the techniques of pooled coherence analysis and the chi(2) difference of coherence test we demonstrate that between the ages of 7 and 9 years, and 12 and 14 years, there are marked increases in the prevalence and magnitude of coherence at frequencies between 11 and 45 Hz. The data from subjects aged 12-14 years were similar to those obtained from adult controls. The most significant differences between younger children and the older age groups were detected at frequencies close to 20 Hz. We believe that these are the first reported results demonstrating significant late maturational changes in the similar to 20 Hz common oscillatory drive to human motoneurone pools.

The insulated interface to the brain signals in combination with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) enables a zero prep human machine interface triggered by brain signals. This paper presents a 28-channel EEG helmet system based on our capacitive electrodes measuring and analyzing SSVEPs even through scalp hair. Correlation analysis is employed to extract the stimulation frequency of the EEG signal. The system is characterized corresponding to the available detection time with different subjects. As demonstration of the use of capacitive electrodes for SSVEP measurements, preliminary online Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) results of the system are presented. Detection times lie about a factor of 3 higher than In galvanic EEG SSVEP measurements, but are low enough to establish a proper communication channel for Human Machine Interface (HMI).

Heart beats brain: The problem of detecting alpha waves by neuronal current imaging in joint EEG-MRI experiments	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; neuronal current imaging; alpha waves; ballistocardiogram	ARTIFACT REMOVAL; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BOLD-FMRI; LOCALIZATION; DIPOLE; MEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RECORDINGS; MECHANISM	It has been suggested recently that the influence of the neuro-magnetic field should make electrical brain activity directly detectable by MRI. To test this hypothesis, we performed combined EEG-MRI experiments which aim to localize the neuronal current sources of alpha waves (8-12 Hz), one of the most prominent EEG phenomena in humans. A detailed analysis of cross-spectral coherence between simultaneously recorded EEG and MRI time series revealed no sign of alpha waves. Instead the EEG-MRI approach was found to be hampered by artefacts due to cardiac pulsation, which extend into the frequency band of alpha waves. Separate brain displacement mapping experiments confirmed that not only the EEG but also the MRI signal is confounded by harmonies of the cardiac frequency even at 10 Hz and beyond. This well-known ballistocardiogram artefact cannot be avoided or eliminated entirely by available signal Processing techniques. Therefore we must conclude that current EEG-MRI methodology based on correlation analysis lacks not only the sensitivity but also the specificity required for the reliable detection of alpha waves.

Slow oscillations underlie characteristic features of the sleep EEG, such as slow waves and spindles. Here we show that, in sleeping subjects, slow waves and spindles can be triggered noninvasively and reliably by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). With appropriate stimulation parameters, each TMS pulse at < 1 Hz evokes an individual, high-amplitude slow wave that originates under the coil and spreads over the cortex. TMS triggering of slow waves reveals intrinsic bistability in thalamocortical networks during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, evoked slow waves lead to a deepening of sleep and to an increase in EEG slow-wave activity (0.5-4.5 Hz), which is thought to play a role in brain restoration and memory consolidation.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose a sleep EEG, which are usually typical nonlinear and non-stationary data, into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Based on these IMFs, the Hilbert spectrum of the EEG can be calculated easily and provides a high resolution time-frequency presentation. An algorithm is developed to detect spindles from a sleep EEG accurately, experiments of which show encouraging detection results.

Identifying Complex Brain Networks Using Penalized Regression Methods	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Information Entropy; PARAFAC; EEG inverse problem; Multiple penalized least squares model; Complex brain networks	VARIABLE SELECTION; CORTEX	The recorded electrical activity of complex brain networks through the EEG reflects their intrinsic spatial, temporal and spectral properties. In this work we study the application of new penalized regression methods to i) the spatial characterization of the brain networks associated with the identification of faces and ii) the PARAFAC analysis of resting-state EEG. The use of appropriate constraints through non-convex penalties allowed three types of inverse solutions (Loreta, Lasso Fusion and ENet L) to spatially localize networks in agreement with previous studies with PORI. Furthermore, we propose a new penalty based in the Information Entropy for the constrained PARAFAC analysis of resting EEG that allowed the identification in time, frequency and space of those brain networks with minimum spectral entropy. This study is an initial attempt to explicitly include complexity descriptors as a constraint in multilinear EEG analysis.

We showed that changes in the level of subject performance are accompanied by distinct changes in EEG spectrum of a class of bilateral posterior independent EEG components. During periods of high-error (drowsy) performance, tonic alpha band EEG power was significantly elevated, compared to that during periods of low-error (alert) performance. In addition, characteristic transient (phasic) alpha and other band increases and decreases followed critical task events, depending on current performance level. These performance-related and event-related spectral changes were consistently observed across subjects and sessions, and were remarkably similar across the two continuous sustained-attention tasks.

Recently, we proposed a method to detect and analyze these patterns using linear autoregressive models for short (approximate to 1 s) data segments. We analyzed the temporal organization of sleep spindles and discuss to what extent the observed interevent intervals correspond to properties of stationary stochastic processes and whether additional slow processes, such as slow oscillations, have to be assumed. We have found evidence for such an additional slow process, most pronounced in sleep stage 2.

They are most likely linked to epileptogenesis and have been found in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) of human ictal and interictal recordings. HFOs occur frequently at the time of interictal spikes, but were also found independently. This study analyses the relationship between spikes and HFOs and the occurrence of HFOs in nonspiking channels. Intracerebral EEGs of 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were studied using macroelectrodes. Rates of HFOs within and outside spikes, the overlap between events, event durations, and the percentage of spikes carrying HFOs were calculated and compared according to anatomical localization, spiking activity, and relationship to the SOZ. HFOs were found in all patients, significantly more within mesial temporal lobe structures than in neocortex. HFOs could be seen in spiking as well as nonspiking channels in all structures. Rates and durations of HFOs were significantly higher in the SOZ than outside. It was possible to establish a rate of HFOs to identify the SOZ with better sensitivity and specificity than with the rate of spikes. HFOs occurred to a large extent independently of spikes. They are most frequent in mesial temporal structures. They are prominent in the SOZ and provide additional information on epileptogenicity independently of spikes. It was possible to identify the SOZ with a high specificity by looking at only 10 min of HFO activity.

J	Mizuhara, H; Yamaguchi, Y				Mizuhara, Hiroaki; Yamaguchi, Yoko			Human cortical circuits for central executive function emerge by theta phase synchronization	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						theta phase synchronization; executive function; simultaneous fMRI and EEG; temporal structuring; cortical circuit	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG-ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; MECHANISMS; ARTIFACT; LOCKING; FMRI	Dynamic networking of brain regions is suggested to be one of the key factors involved in various brain computations. Central executive function typically requires instantaneous coordination among the medial prefrontal regions and other distant regions, depending on the on-going task situation. In human scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), the medial prefrontal area is estimated to be the current source of the theta rhythm, while there is no direct evidence that the theta rhythm is involved in the dynamic networking of central executive circuits. Here we hypothesize that the central executive circuit over the prefrontal and task-related cortices is dynamically linked by theta synchronization. By using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, we elucidated cortical circuits emerging with theta phase synchronization during free pacing repeated subtraction. Theta phase synchronization in the scalp EEG was found to emerge at two major clusters of electrode pairs, between the right frontal and left parietal sites and between the frontal and right parietal sites. The phase synchronization of two clusters is accompanied by fMRI responses in the cortical regions responsible for central executive function, working memory, visual imagery and cognitive action sequence. Here we report the first evidence that theta phase synchronization dynamically coordinates the central executive circuits, including the medial prefrontal cortex and relevant cortical regions.

These patients showed a decrease in the amplitude of P2 and N2 components and a delayed P3 latency compared to control subjects suggesting that the attentional orienting mechanism in the auditory modality is affected in MS. The PSD analysis showed that MS patients exhibited an increased power in beta and gamma bands. The combined analysis of frequency and time domain suggested diverse phenomena that occurred in the MS patient group related with the EEG background or the motivational status.

The effect of mobile phone electromagnetic fields on the alpha rhythm of human electroencephalogram	BIOELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						GSM900; acute exposure; EEG; alpha power	HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; ELF MAGNETIC-FIELD; RADIOFREQUENCY FIELDS; CELLULAR PHONES; RESTING EEG; FREQUENCY; EXPOSURE; EMISSIONS; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS	Mobile phones (MP) emit low-level electromagnetic fields that have been reported to affect neural function in humans; however, demonstrations of such effects have not been conclusive. The purpose of the present study was to test one of the strongest findings in the literature; that of increased "alpha" power in response to MP-type radiation. Healthy participants (N= 120) were tested using a double-blind counterbalanced crossover design, with each receiving a 30-min Active and a 30-min Sham Exposure I week apart, while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. Resting alpha power (8-12 Hz) was then derived as a function of time, for periods both during and following exposure. Non-parametric analyses were employed as data could not be normalized. Previous reports of an overall alpha power enhancement during the MP exposure were confirmed (relative to Sham), with this effect larger at ipsilateral than contralateral sites over posterior regions. No overall change to alpha power was observed following exposure cessation; however, there was less alpha power contralateral to the exposure source during this period (relative to ipsilateral). Employing a strong methodology, the current findings support previous research that has reported an effect of MP exposure on EEG alpha power.	[Croft, R. J.; Hamblin, D.

Based on the ability of accurately resolving the signal into desired time-frequency components, EEG signals are preprocessed and decomposed into a series of rhythms for many clinical applications. Specified dynamic EEG rhythms can be accurately filtered with designed wavelet structure. In addition, we present a wavelet packet entropy method for processing of EEG signal. Both relative wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet entropy are presented as the quantitative parameter to measure the complexity of the EEG signal. Several experiments with real EEG signals are carried out to show that the proposed method excels the common discrete wavelet decomposition. The presented procedure can isolate specific EEG rhythms accurately and is also regarded as an efficient method for analyzing non-stationary signals in practice.

Methods: Resting EEG was recorded in 30 healthy females (age: 27.1 +/- 5.5), 16-AN females (age: 26.4 +/- 9.5) and 12-BN females (age: 27.0 +/- 6.3). Cortical EEG sources (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2) were modeled by LORETA solutions. The statistical analysis was performed considering the factors Group, power Band, and region of interest (central, frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, limbic). Results: Alpha 1 sources in central, parietal, occipital and limbic areas showed a greater amplitude in Controls versus AN and BN groups. Alpha 2 sources in parietal, occipital and limbic areas showed a greater amplitude in Controls than in both AN and BN groups. Alpha 1 sources in temporal area showed a greater amplitude in Controls compared to both the BN and AN groups as well as in the BN group compared to AN group. Central alpha 1 source correlated significantly with BMI in patients. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that eating disorders are related to altered mechanisms of cortical neural synchronization, especially in rolandic alpha rhythms. Significance: To our knowledge this is the first study by LORETA able to detect modifications of cortical EEG activity in eating disorders.

Coupled oscillator networks were used for modeling. Parameters of the corresponding ordinary coupled differential equation (ODE) system are identified using EEG/MEG data and the resulting solution yields the modeled signals. This model-related analysis strategy provides information about the coupling quantity and quality between signal components (example 1, neonatal EEG during quiet sleep), allows identification of the possible contribution of hidden generator structures (example 2, 600-Hz MEG oscillations in somatosensory evoked magnetic fields), and can explain complex signal characteristics such as amplitude-frequency coupling and frequency entrainment (example 3, EEG burst patterns in sedated patients).

Peculiarities of EEG in Hard-of-Hearing Children of Primary School Age	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						bradyacusia; auditory afferentation; electroencephalography; EEG spectral composition; reaction of activation; interhemispheric asymmetry		Electroencephalographic examination of 7- to 9-year-old children with sensorineural deafness of degrees II and III included EEG recording in the resting state, in the course of reaction of activation ( at opening of the eyes), under conditions of rhythmic photostimulation with frequencies of 4, 6, 9, and 12 sec(-1), and under those of the hyperventilation test. The results allow us to conclude that systems responsible for generation of EEG in hard-of-hearing children demonstrate some functionally immaturity. The following facts confirm the above conclusion. As compared with the norm, greater normalized spectral powers (SPs) of the delta and theta rhythms, a higher intensity of electrogenesis ( integral power of oscillations) within all frequency ranges, and a smaller mean frequency of the dominant rhythm were typical of hard-of-hearing children. In these children, the reaction of activation in the majority of cases looked like incomplete suppression of the alpha rhythm. Upon rhythmic photostimulation, hard-of-hearing boys and girls demonstrated following of the rhythm at frequencies of 4 and 6 sec(-1), while children with normal hearing demonstrated that at 9 and 12 sec(-1) frequencies. The characteristics of EEG reactions under the conditions of the hyperventilation test reflected the immaturity of the fronto-thalamic controlling system, as well as certain dysfunction of lower brainstem regions in children with disorders of hearing.

This networks work in a critical state where short and long range connections coexist. Although PARAFAC is unique through Usual least squares estimation, the use of penalized least squares allows to incorporate this kind of knowledge into the decomposition. Here we propose the use of Information Entropy-based penalties for obtaining atoms with minimum spectral entropy. They offer sparse spectral signatures corresponding to networks oscillating in a well-defined (sharp) frequency band.

The single-channel approach is based on singular spectrum analysis(SSA) and the multichannel approach uses the extended infomax algorithm which is implemented in the open-source toolbox EEGLAB. Both approaches will be evaluated using artificial mixtures of a set of selected EEG signals. The latter were selected visually to contain as the dominant activity one of the characteristic bands of an electroencephalogram (EEG). The evaluation is performed both in the time and frequency domain by using correlation coefficients and coherence function, respectively.	[Teixeira, A. R.; Tome, A.

An enormous literature with findings of abnormal central processing in psychiatric diseases has been acquired during the last decades. However, the benefit of this research has been limited in part due to the unresolved problem of precise and correct localization of the underlying neural generators. The difficulty of correct localization is due to the fact that different constellations of cortical neuroelectric generators can produce identical EEG activity. Therefore, even concerning several major event related potentials no generally accepted knowledge about their cerebral generation exists. While correct localization can easily be obtained by imaging methods based on hemodynamic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), these techniques can not distinguish between different aspects of neural activity such as oscillation modes or stages of information processing that are only some milliseconds apart. Accordingly, the integration of simultaneous measurements of EEG and fMRI has become a methodological key issue today. EEG-fMRI may prove to be crucial in providing much deeper understanding of brain activity over the next decades. This review summarizes the basic physiology, methodological issues and interesting applications in psychiatry.

Across subjects, we find (i) an inverse relationship between IAF and the amplitude of the alpha-rhythm at rest. The IAF also predicts (ii) the amplitude of the visual evoked potential (VEP), as well as (iii) the amplitude of the alpha-rhythm during stimulation. Most importantly, (iv) IAF correlates with the oxygenation response to visual stimulation: A high IAF predicts a low alpha-amplitude at rest, a small VEP amplitude and a small oxygenation response. Conversely, a low IAF predicts high alpha-amplitude and larger electrophysiological and vascular responses to stimulation. Based on these findings, we assume that the relationship between IAF and neuronal and vascular response stems from the size of the network recruited for visual processing. The relation between IAF, alpha-amplitude, evoked potential and vascular response is discussed in the framework of a simple heuristic model. The results may partly explain the large intersubject variability observed in recently published concurrent EEG-fMRI studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Functional neural dynamics underlying auditory event-related N1 and N1 suppression response	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FRONTAL COMPONENTS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; EEG; CORTEX; WAVE; LOCALIZATION; INTEGRATION; MODULATION	Presenting tone triplets of identical stimuli preceded by silent intervals of 30 s produces a series of three N1 averaged event-related potentials (ERPs), the first being of greater amplitude (non-suppressed N1) than the second and third ones (suppressed N1). Maximal statistically independent components (ICs) of single-trial multi-electrode scalp EEG responses to triplets were obtained by ICA algorithm, and then each IC was searched for underlying brain structures by LORETA inverse solution, and for oscillatory contributions by time-frequency analysis. Non-suppressed N1 cortical mechanisms were broken down into five ICs, grouped in two time-windows (early-onset and late-onset) involving the participation of temporal, frontal and parietal structures, and sub-serving EEG oscillatory contributions of power enhancement and putative phase concentration of mainly theta, alpha and low beta bands. Suppressed N1 was due to the modulation of two above-mentioned early-onset ICs, involving temporal structures only, and mainly sub-serving oscillatory contributions of phase concentration of theta and alpha. Present results, showing quantifiable changes of IC descriptors - i.e. time window of activation, implied structures and oscillatory contributions - extracted from two distinct brain functional situations (non-suppressed versus suppressed N1), give support to the view that ICA is not merely a statistical "latent variables" model when applied to ERPs, but could help to capture underlying specific function subunits of brain dynamics.

Hippocampal atrophy and EEG markers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						MCI; hippocampal atrophy; EEG; alpha rhythm; theta rhythm; MRI; volume-based morphometry	INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; WORKING-MEMORY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; THETA; AGE; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: The present study evaluates the potential relationship between hippocampal atrophy and EEG brain rhythmicity, as assessed by relative band power and alpha frequency indices in a cohort of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Eighty-eight subjects falling within the definition of MCI patients were enrolled. All subjects underwent EEG recording and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Volumetric morphometry estimates of the hippocampal region were computed. Individual EEG frequencies were indexed by the theta/alpha transition frequency (TF) and the individual alpha frequency (IAF). The relative power was separately computed for delta, theta, alphal, alpha2 and alpha3 frequency bands. The MCI cohort was classified into four subgroups, based on the mean and standard deviations of the hippocampal volume of a normal elderly control sample. Results: The group with moderate hippocampal atrophy showed the highest increase in the theta power on frontal regions, and of the alpha2 and alpha3 powers on frontal and temporo-parietal areas. The analysis of the individual alpha frequency markers showed that the values for the alpha markers were highest in the group with the smallest hippocampal volume, whereas in the group with moderate hippocampal atrophy, these values were lower than in the group with severe atrophy. Conclusions: The relationship between hippocampal atrophy and EEG activity changes in MCI subjects is not proportional to the hippocampal atrophy. Therefore, EEG markers could represent a new tool for differential diagnosis. Significance: The hippocampal atrophy induces different brain synchronization/desynchronization patterns. EEG changes model the brain activity induced by a discrete change of the hippocampal volume. The changes in the EEG rhythmicity differ greatly from those in MCI patients with subcortical vascular damage. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Eysenck's, Spilberger's, Gray-Wilson's, and Goodman's questionnaries were used to assess personality and psychopathology. Using factor analysis, the covariance between spectral power measures was decomposed into factors reflecting common positive covariance and reciprocal relationships among, different frequency bands. The latter were treated as measures of inhibitory interactions between different oscillatory systems. In children, the common positive covariance was higher, and inhibitory interactions were weaker than in adults. In adults. trait anxiety was positively related to the strength of reciprocal relationship between alpha and delta oscillatory systems. In children, similar relationship was found between anxiety and the strength of reciprocal relationship between theta and delta oscillatory systems. Findings are discussed in terms of evolutionary interpretation of brain oscillations.	[Knyazev, G. G.; Slobodskoi-Plusnin, Ya. Yu.; Savostyanov, A. N.; Levin, E. A.; Bocharov, A.

For the precise localization of the current source of epileptic discharge, the question as to whether MEG is superior to electroencephalography (EEG) is often addressed. To answer this question, so many factors, both biologically and technically related, have to be taken into consideration. The biological factors include the magnitude of epileptic discharge, its distribution over the cortex, depth of its source from the head surface, and the proportion of large pyramidal neurons tangentially oriented with respect to the head surface within the cortical area. The technical factors include the quality of the recording instrument such as the number of sensors and the use of gradiometer vs. magnetometer, the employed method of source analysis, and availability of experts in each institute. As far as the importance of ictal recording is emphasized, long-term video/EEG monitoring is of utmost importance. Thus, it is concluded that, once the epileptogenic focus is identified by the video/EEG monitoring, then MEG is superior to EEG in order to precisely localize the current source of the interictal epileptic discharge. Another question often addressed is whether MEG can replace the invasive intracranial EEG recording or not. In addition to the above-described factors, different coverage of the cortical areas by MEG vs. invasive intracranial EEG recording has to be taken into account to explain some of the recent reports related to this question. MEG can be effectively applied to the investigation of cortical functions near the epileptogenic focus. It is especially so when combined with other non-invasive studies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition to the source analysis of magnetic fields related to various events or tasks, analysis of the task-related change of rhythmic cortical oscillations is a useful tool for studying higher cortical functions such as language in the presurgical evaluation.

There is evidence for two main functional subcomponents comprising the MMN, generated by temporal and frontal brain areas, respectively. Using data obtained in an MMN paradigm, we performed time-frequency analysis to reveal the changes in oscillatory neural activity in the theta band. The results suggest that the frontal component of the MMN is brought about by an increase in theta power for the deviant trials and, possibly, by an additional contribution of theta phase alignment. By contrast, the temporal component of the MMN, best seen in recordings from mastoid electrodes, is generated by phase resetting of theta rhythm with no concomitant power modulation. Thus, frontal and temporal MMN components do not only differ with regard to their functional significance but also appear to be generated by distinct neurophysiological mechanisms.

A recent intracranial study of patients performing a paradigmatic working memory task revealed that the maintenance of information involves a distributed network of oscillations in the gamma band (> 40 Hz). Using a similar task, we focused on the encoding stage and targeted a process referred to as short-term consolidation, which corresponds to the encoding of novel items in working memory. The paradigm was designed to manipulate the subjects' intention to encode: series of 10 letters were presented, among which only five had to be remembered, as indicated by visual cues preceding or following each letter. During this task we recorded the intracerebral EEG of nine epileptic patients implanted in mesiotemporal structures, perisylvian regions, and prefrontal areas and used time-frequency analysis to search for neural activities simultaneous with the encoding of the letters into working memory. We found such activities in the form of increases of gamma band activity in a set of regions associated with the phonological loop, including the Broca area and the auditory cortex, and in the prefrontal cortex, the pre- and postcentral gyri, the hippocampus, and the fusiform gyrus.

Such observations on interictal PET have not been fully explained by the frequency of interictal spike discharges alone. In the present Study using digital electrocorticography monitoring system with high-frequency sampling, we determined how well regression models using spectral ECoG measures and spike frequency derived from 651 intracranial electrode sites explained cortical glucose metabolic patterns in six children with nonlesional focal epilepsy. Univariate regression analysis demonstrated that spectral amplitudes at gamma ranges (32-64, 64-100, and 100-200 Hz) were tightly correlated with interictal glucose uptake in the given electrode site in all children. Spike frequency was negatively correlated with interictal glucose uptake in three patients, whose epileptogenic focus appeared hypometabolic and interictal epileptiform discharge often consisted of a spike followed by a subsequent delta-wave. Conversely, spike frequency was positively correlated with interictal glucose uptake in the other three patients, whose epileptogenic foci appeared more hypermetabolic compared to the surrounding regions and associated with frequent interictal spike bursts. The spatial pattern of interictal glucose metabolism in nonlesional focal epilepsy may be better explained by gamma-oscillations derived from epileptiform and physiological neuronal activities rather than the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges alone.

Independent component analysis of interictal fMRI in focal epilepsy: Comparison with general linear model-based EEG-correlated fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TEMPORAL CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; DEFAULT-MODE; TIME-SERIES; SCALP EEG; COMBINING EEG; SPIKES; CONNECTIVITY; SIGNAL	The general linear model (GLM) has been used to analyze simultaneous EEG-fMRI to reveal BOLD changes linked to interictal epileptic discharges (IED) identified on scalp EEG. This approach is ineffective when IED are not evident in the EEG. Data-driven fMRI analysis techniques that do not require an EEG derived model may offer a solution in these circumstances. We compared the findings of independent components analysis (ICA) and EEG-based GLM analyses of fMRI data from eight patients with focal epilepsy. Spatial ICA was used to extract independent components (IC) which were automatically classified as either BOLD-related, motion artefacts, EPI-susceptibility artefacts, large blood vessels, noise at high spatial or temporal frequency. The classifier reduced the number of candidate IC by 78%, with an average of 16 BOLD-related IC. Concordance between the ICA and GLM-derived results was assessed based on spatio-temporal criteria. In each patient, one of the IC satisfied the criteria to correspond to TED-based GLM result. The remaining IC were consistent with BOLD patterns of spontaneous brain activity and may include epileptic activity that was not evident on the scalp EEG. In conclusion, ICA of fMRI is capable of revealing areas of epileptic activity in patients with focal epilepsy and may be useful for the analysis of EEG-fMRI data in which abnormalities are not apparent on scalp EEG.

Steady state visual-evoked potentials (ssVEPs) can be recorded using an intensity modulated stimulus, resulting in an evoked brain response at a known frequency, i.e. the stimulation frequency. Given this property, the ssVEP is ideally suited for examining the relationship between single-trial fluctuations in phase/amplitude and the evoked brain potential resulting from averaging across trials. To address this issue, the current study investigated the contribution of single trial power and intertrial phase locking to ssVEP generation by presenting a peripheral flicker. Further, transient stimuli were presented during flicker and at three increasing latency lags following flicker offset to examine (1) to what extent a stimulus can disturb the ssVEP oscillation and (2) how phase alignment during P1-N1-P2 time windows is affected during presence of evoked oscillations. The former assessment evaluates the stability of ssVEPs and the latter the phase alignment processes to transient stimuli under experimentally induced background oscillations. We observed that ssVEPs are a result of phase alignment rather than single trial amplitude modulation. In addition, ssVEP oscillations were not disturbed by transient stimuli. Finally, phase alignment in P1-N1-P2 time windows was distorted during and shortly after steady state stimulation. We conclude that ssVEPs represent strongly phase locked oscillations sharing the same generation mechanisms as early evoked potentials.

Intelligent identification and classification of epileptic seizures using wavelet transform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial Neural Network; ANN; Daubechies; EEG; seizures; wavelet transform	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG	Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder. The need of the hour is an automated analysis of the Electroencephalographs (EEGs), which enhances efficiency of diagnosis. This paper presents simple and new approach for classifying the types of epileptic seizures. A set of feed forward neural network with wavelet feature extraction are used to process time, frequency to detect and classify the type of seizure like absence, Tonic-clonic, Febrile and Complex partial seizures. Tests of the system on EEG indicate a success rate of 94.3%. This method makes it possible as a real-time detector, which will improve the clinical service of Electroencephalographic recording.

We present a conjoined time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) method to explore the subtle brain neural connectivity by magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a self-paced finger lifting task. Surface electromyogram (sEMG) was obtained from the extensor digitorum communis. Both within-modality (MEG-MEG) and between-modality studies (sEMG-MEG) were conducted. The TFCMI method measures both the linear and nonlinear dependencies of the temporal dynamics of signal power within a pre-specified frequency band. Each single trial of MEG across channels and sEMG signals was transformed into time-frequency domain with use of the Morlet wavelet to obtain better temporal spectral (power) information. As compared to coherence approach (linear dependency only) in broadband analysis, the TFCMI method demonstrated advantages in encompassing detection for the mesial frontocentral cortex and bilateral primary sensorimotor areas, clear demarcation of event- and non-event-related regions, and robustness for sEMG - MEG between-modality study, i.e., corticomuscular communication. We conclude that this novel TFCMI method promises a possibility to better unravel the intricate functional organizations of brain in the context of oscillation-coded communication.

K.; Altinok, Ayse			Determining a continuous marker for sleep depth	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						cortical arousals; sleep staging; depth of sleep; power spectral density analysis; receiver operating characteristics		Detection and quantification of sleep arousals is an important issue, as the frequent arousals are known to reduce the quality of sleep and cause daytime sleepiness. In typical sleep staging, electroencephalograph (EEG) is the core signal and based on the visual inspection of the frequency content of EEG. non-rapid eye movement sleep is staged into four somewhat rough categories. In this study, we aimed at developing a continuous marker based on a more rigorous spectral analysis of EEG to measure or quantify the depth of sleep. In order to develop such a marker, we obtained the time-frequency map of two EEG channels around sleep arousals and identified the frequency bands that show the most change during arousals. We then evaluated classification performance of the potential signals for representing the depth of sleep, using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our comparisons based on the area under the curve values revealed that the sum of absolute powers in alpha and beta bands is a good continuous marker to represent the depth of sleep. Higher values of this marker indicate low-quality sleep and vice versa. We believe that use of this marker will lead to a better quantification of sleep quality. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using these unaveraged spectra, we were able to investigate in detail various aspects of the structure of ictal gamma rhythms that could not be examined using averaged spectra. The characteristics of the ictal gamma peaks (peak frequency, power, duration, and the number of peaks in each brain-region for each spasm) were statistically evaluated with respect to their differences among the brain regions and over the time-course of the clusters. Our findings were as follows: (1) Gamma peaks were clearly detected in most spectra and generally had a similar pattern in each spasm, which repeated in clusters. (2) The mean frequency of gamma peaks was 69.2 +/- 16.8 Hz, and the number of peaks in each brain region of each spasm was 1.83 +/- 1.16. (3) The occipitoparietal gamma peaks had significantly greater power and longer duration than the frontocentral peaks. (4) The frequency of the gamma peaks was higher in the mid phase of clusters than in the ending, and it tended to have a positive correlation with its latency from the preceding beta peak. An analysis of the ictal gamma rhythms might give some insight into the generative mechanism of spasms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These movement related HGB modulations may play an important role in sensorimotor cortex function. It is however currently not clear to what extent this type of neural activity can be detected using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) and how similar HGB responses in healthy human subjects are to those observed in epilepsy patients. Using the same arm reaching task, we have investigated spectral power changes both in intracranial ECoG recordings in epilepsy patients and in non-invasive EEG recordings optimized for detecting HGB activity in healthy subjects. Our results show a common HGB response pattern both in ECoG and EEG recorded above the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the side of arm movement. In both cases, HGB activity increased around movement onset in the 60-90 Hz range and became most pronounced at reaching movement end. Additionally, we found EEG HGB activity above the frontal midline possibly generated by the anterior supplementary motor area (SMA), a region that was however not covered by the intracranial electrodes used in the present study. In summary, our findings show that HGB activity from human sensorimotor cortex can be non-invasively detected in healthy subjects using EEG, opening a new perspective for investigating the role of high gamma range neuronal activity both in function and dysfunction of the human cortical sensorimotor network.

In order to facilitate clinical diagnosis and/or implement so-called brain computer interface (BCI), detecting the rhythmic activity from EEG data recorded in a noisy environment is crucial; however, classical signal processing techniques like linear filtering or the Fourier transform cannot detect such a rhythmic signal if the power of noise is so large. This paper presents a simple but practical method for extracting a rhythmic signal by fully exploiting the multi-variate nature of EEG data. The rhythmic component of interest is estimated as the weighted sum of multi-channel signals, and the optimal weights are then derived so as to maximize the power of the component. After the derivation is illustrated, adaptive weights, which give a new time-frequency analysis, are introduced. Moreover, the application to recently developed empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is presented. Experimental results on real EEG data support the analysis.

In particular, we investigated the differences in the prestimulus EEG between subjects who were able to discriminate between four shortly presented stimuli (Perceivers) and subjects who were not (Non-Perceivers). Additionally, we investigated the differences between the subjects perceived and unperceived trials. The results show that Perceivers exhibited lower prestimulus alpha power than Non-Perceivers. Analysis of the prestimulus EEG between perceived and unperceived trials revealed that the perception of a stimulus is related to low phase coupling in the alpha frequency range (8-12 Hz) and high phase coupling in the beta and gamma frequency range (20-45 Hz). Single trial analyses showed that perception performance can be predicted by phase coupling in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency range. The findings indicate that synchronous oscillations in the alpha frequency band inhibit the perception of shortly presented stimuli whereas synchrony in higher frequency ranges (>20 Hz) enhances visual perception. We conclude that alpha, beta and gamma oscillations indicate the attentional state of a subject and thus are able to predict perception performance on a single trial basis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We defined four elements in SWD based on the schema of Weir ( 1965): Spike 1 and 2, Positive Transient ( PT), and Wave. The EEG patterns of generalized type I and local type II SWD in cortical and thalamic areas were analyzed. Methods: EEGs were recorded in freely moving rats epidurally from different cortical regions and with deep electrodes from the specific and reticular thalamic nuclei. Grand average SWD waveforms were computed to assess spatiotemporal patterns of seizures. Results: SWD I in the frontal cortex comprised of a large Spike 2 + Wave, and in the thalamus PT + Wave. Small transient spikes were associated with SWD I in the anterior-middle part of the cortex. SWD II were found in the occipital cortex as a sequence of ( occasional) Spike 1 + PT + Wave. Conclusions: The EEG structure of SWD in WAG/Rij rats was comparable with that of epileptic patients, suggesting face validity of the WAG/Rij model. Fast transients spikes are an integrative part of SWD I. Time-amplitude linkage between cortical and thalamic counterparts of SWD I suggests a complex spatiotemporal organization of SWD I. The thalamus sustained SWD I, but not SWD II.

Scalp electrical recording during paralysis: Quantitative evidence that EEG frequencies above 20 Hz are contaminated by EMG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						neuromuscular blockade; very high frequency; gamma oscillations; EEG; spectra; auditory odd-ball	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; HUMANS; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; TASK	Objective: To identify the possible contribution of electromyogram (EMG) to scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms at rest and induced or evoked by cognitive tasks. Methods: Scalp EEG recordings were made on two subjects in presence and absence of complete neuromuscular blockade, sparing the dominant arm. The subjects undertook cognitive tasks in both states to allow direct comparison of electrical recordings. Results: EEG rhythms in the paralysed state differed significantly compared with the unparalysed state, with 10- to 200-fold differences in the power of frequencies above 20 Hz during paralysis. Conclusions: Most of the scalp EEG recording above 20 Hz is of EMG origin. Previous studies measuring gamma EEG need to be re-evaluated. Significance: This has a significant impact on measurements of gamma rhythms from the scalp EEG in unparalysed humans. It is to be hoped that signal separation methods will be able to rectify this situation. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA.

Event-related oscillations (ERO) provide an useful tool for detecting subtle abnormalities of cognitive processes with high temporal resolution. Methods: In the present report, event-related oscillations of patients with AD were analyzed by using a visual oddball paradigm. A total of 22 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and 20 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy control subjects were compared. AD group consisted from 11 untreated patients and 11 patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitor. Oscillatory responses were recorded from 13 scalp electrodes. Results: Significant differences in delta frequency range were seen between the groups by using repeated measures of ANOVA analysis [F(9.120) = 2.228; P = 0.022]. Post-hoc analyses using Wilcoxon test showed that at mid- and left central regions, (Cz, C3) peak amplitudes of delta responses of healthy subjects were significantly higher than either group. Also cholinesterase inhibitors did not have effect on delta oscillatory responses. Conclusions: Our findings imply that the delta oscillatory responses at central locations are highly instable in mild probable AD patients regardless of treatment when compared to the healthy aged controls. This study supports the importance of oscillatory event-related potentials for investigating AD brain dynamics.

Time-Frequency Analysis of EEG Signals for Human Emotion Detection	4TH KUALA LUMPUR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering	JUN 25-28, 2008	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA			EEG; Human Emotions; Wavelet Transform; Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM)		This paper proposes an emotion recognition system from EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The main objective of this work is to compare the efficacy of classifying human emotions using two discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based feature extraction with three statistical features. An audio-visual induction based protocol has been designed to acquire the EEG signals using 63 biosensors. Totally, 6 healthy subjects with an age group of 21-27 years old have been used in this emotion recognition experiment. In this work, we have used three statistical features (energy, Recoursing Energy Efficiency (REE) and Root Mean Square (RMS)) from the EEG signals for classifying four emotions (happy, disgust, surprise and fear). An unsupervised clustering called Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is used for distinguishing emotions. Results confirm the possibility of using "db4" wavelet transform based feature extraction with proposed statistical feature for assessing the human emotions from EEG signal.

Synchronized oscillations in the Gamma-Band (>30Hz; induced Gamma-Band Responses, iGBRs), are regarded as a plausible mechanism to re-integrate these regions into a meaningful cortical object representation. Using electroencephalography (EEG) it was demonstrated that the generators of iGBRs can be localized to temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. The present magnetoencephalogram (MEG) study intended to replicate these findings in order contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the possible functional difference of high-frequency signals as measured by both techniques. During a standard object recognition task we found an augmentation of the iGBR after the presentation of meaningful as opposed to meaningless stimuli at similar to 160-440 ms after stimulus onset. This peak was localized to inferior temporal gyri, superior parietal lobules and the right middle frontal gyrus. Importantly, most of these brain structures were significantly phase-locked to each other. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) they present further evidence for the view that iGBRs signify neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. (2) MEG is well suited to detect induced high-frequency oscillations with a very similar morphology as revealed by EEG recordings, thereby eliminating known problems with electroencephalographical methods (e.g. reference confounds). In contrast to the iGBR, the localization of event-related fields (ERFs) and evoked Gamma-Band Response (eGBRs) revealed generators in focal visual areas, and thus, seem to mirror early sensory processing.

In this paper, we describe a new method, called wavelet-based nonlinear similarity index (WNSI), to predict epileptic seizures using EEG recordings in real time. This method combines wavelet techniques and nonlinear dynamics. The test results of EEG recordings of rats and humans show that WNSI can track the hidden dynamical changes of brain electrical activity. Particularly, we found that it can obtain the best performance of seizure prediction at the beta (10-30 Hz) frequency band of EEG signals. A possible reason is suggested from the functional connectivity of the brain. In terms of this study, it is recommended that wavelet technique is very useful to improve the performance of epileptic seizures prediction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our main objective has been to select the adjustable analysis parameters such that the best possible correspondence between method output and standard visual sleep staging could be achieved. Sleep depth estimation was based on continuous monitoring of short-time EEG synchronization through the local mean frequency of the EEG. During the experiments, total amount of 752 different combinations of four adjustable parameters were compared based on all-night sleep EEG recordings of 15 healthy subjects. Optimization strategy applied was based on maximizing the weighted average of pair-wise separabilities of EEG mean frequency distributions in all the standard sleep stage pairs. Finally, robustness of the optimized parameters was verified with an independent dataset of 34 all-night sleep recordings. Our results show that clear topological differences between brain hemispheres and different electrode locations exist. Performance improvements of even 20-30% units can be achieved by proper selection of analysis parameters and the EEG derivation used for the analysis. Remarkable independence of system performance on the analysis window length leads to improved temporal resolution compared to that achieved through standard visual analysis. In addition to giving practical suggestions on the parameter selection, we also propose a possible method for improving stage separability especially between S2 and REM. (C) 2006 IPEM.

Some researchers expected that carnitine ingestion make increase locomotor activity of organism. But, these effects has not been confirmed for human. The purpose of this study is to examine the carnitine's effect for human by using of EEG. We used electroencephalogram (EEG) for this research. EEG is widely known as a brain activity analysis method. In this study, 16 electrodes were placed on the scalp by the International 10-20 system. We had arranged sample A and sample B for comparison. Sample A is solution of 1g carnitine / 100ml water. And, sample B is 100ml water. Subjects were 5 persons. Subjects didn't eat breakfast, and they didn't know which sample they drank. At first process of EEG recording, subjects ingested either sample A or B. Then, subject's EEG were recorded(5minutes) every 30 minutes until 180 min. Spectrum analysis of EEG was carried out about alpha wave(8 to 13 Hz) and theta wave(4 to 8 Hz). But, these frequency range differ slightly in individuals. Therefor, we plotted change in EEG power with time. We used this graph to decide accurate frequency range about alpha and theta wave. About alpha and theta wave, we compared FFT result of carnitine ingestion to water. As result of them, increase of theta wave in front electrodes for 2 of 5 subjects were observed. At this point, it is known that the carnitine concentration in blood becomes the maximum at 90 min after carnitine ingestion. The result implys that theta wave has a relation with carnitine concentration in blood. Further experiments are necessary to clarify this result as effect of carnitine.

Methods: Twelve OSA patients and 8 healthy controls were studied with the Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT) and subjective ratings of sleepiness (VAS and KSS) conducted every hour during 24 h of sustained wakefulness. Results: The waking EEG activity, mainly in the low (0.5-7.8 Hz) and fast (12.7-29.2 Hz) frequency band, increased as time awake progressed in both groups but more obviously in OSA patients. A similar pattern was observed for rated sleepiness in both groups. Moreover, VAS ratings of alertness were closely related to the awake theta, fast alpha and beta bands in controls but not in OSA patients. Conclusions: OSAS was associated with a wake-dependent increase in low (0.5-7.8 Hz) and fast (12.7-29.2 Hz) frequency range activity. Variations in behavioural sleepiness measured by VAS ratings closely reflect most of the waking EEG parameters in controls but not in OSA patients. Significance: In a sustained wakefulness paradigm, higher activity in delta, theta and beta bands associated with OSAS indicates that OSA patients show marked signs of higher sleepiness and stronger efforts than controls to stay awake, even though they tend to underestimate their sleepiness.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for discriminating two different vigilance states of the subjects, namely wake state and sleep state, during driving a car in a simulation environment. After filtering the EEG data into a specific frequency band, we use probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA) to reduce the data dimension. Then we model each vigilance state as a lower dimension Gaussian random variable by applying PPCA again. The feature related to class posterior probability is calculated for classification. The experimental results show satisfying time resolution (<= 5s) and high accuracy (>= 96%) across five subjects on both common frequency bands beta (19-26Hz) and gamma (38-42Hz), and a broad band (8-30Hz).

Here, we studied the relationship between delta-brushes in the somatosensory cortex and spontaneous movements of premature human neonates of 29-31 weeks postconceptional age using a combination of scalp electroencephalography and monitoring of motor activity. We found that sporadic hand and foot movements heralded the appearance of delta-brushes in the corresponding areas of the cortex (lateral and medial regions of the contralateral central cortex, respectively). Direct hand and foot stimulation also reliably evoked delta-brushes in the same areas. These results suggest that sensory feedback from spontaneous fetal movements triggers delta-brush oscillations in the central cortex in a somatotopic manner. We propose that in the human fetus in utero, before the brain starts to receive elaborated sensory input from the external world, spontaneous fetal movements provide sensory stimulation and drive delta-brush oscillations in the developing somatosensory cortex contributing to the formation of cortical body maps.

We represent multi-channel scalp EEG using a set of features. These features expected to have distinct trends during seizure and non-seizure periods include features from both time and frequency domains. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we rearrange multi-channel EEG signals as a third-order tensor called an Epilepsy Feature Tensor with modes: time epochs, features and electrodes. Second, we model the Epilepsy Feature Tensor using a multilinear regression model, i.e., Multilinear Partial Least Squares regression, which is the generalization of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to higher-order datasets. This two-step approach facilitates EEG data analysis from multiple electrodes represented by several features from different domains. Third, we identify which features are more significant for seizure recognition. Our results based on the analysis of 19 seizures from 5 epileptic patients demonstrate that multiway analysis of an Epilepsy Feature Tensor can detect (patient-specific) seizures with classification accuracy ranging between 77-96%.

Automatic detection of transient EEG events during sleep can be improved using a multi-channel approach	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						automatic EEG analysis; sleep microstructure; transient EEG events; automatic detection; sleep analysis	ALTERNATING PATTERN CAP; K-COMPLEX; NREM SLEEP; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; TIME	Objective: Automatic methods developed to detect transient EEG events during sleep may present a degree of arbitrariness in the choice of appropriate channels or amplitude thresholds for the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-channel and temporal coincidences approach. Methods: A two-step automatic detection (AD) of peculiar transient synchronized EEG events (TE) was performed in stage 2 and stage 3 sleep periods obtained from 10 normal sleep recordings and included: (a) detection of candidate TE from all the EEG traces and averaged signals, based on amplitude thresholds selections in both the time and frequency domains; (b) cross-checking of TE by evaluation of the coincidences in different EEG traces. TE found by AD but not confirmed by visual analysis (false positives, FP) and TE evidenced by visual analysis and missed by AD (false negatives, FN) were then counted. Results: AD performed in averaged signals significantly reduced the number of FP but slightly increased FN, compared to single-channel analysis. However, when TE were confirmed by inter-channel temporal coincidences, a significant reduction of total errors (FN + FP) was achieved. The minimum error was obtained after C3-A2 and C4-A1 averaging and signal cross-checking with at least three channels (C3-A2 or C4-A1, plus both O1-A2 and O2-A1). Conclusions: This study describes a novel method for automatic detection of transient EEG events occurring during sleep that takes into account all the available channels. Significance: This approach reduces the need of human supervision and may overcome most of the difficulties encountered by automatic methods based on single-channel analysis.

Development of Cortical Connections as Measured by EEG Coherence and Phase Delays	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						development of EEG coherence; EEG phase differences; cortical connections; two-compartmental model of cortico-cortical connectivity; complexity development	BRAIN INTERACTION; OSCILLATIONS	The purpose of this study was to explore human development of EEG coherence and phase differences over the period from infancy to 16 years of age. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 458 subjects ranging in age from 2 months to 16.67 years. EEG coherence and EEG phase differences were computed for the left and right hemispheres in the posterior-to-anterior direction (O1/2-P3/4, O1/2-C3/4, O1/2-F3/4, and O1/2-Fp1/2) and the anterior-to-posterior direction (Fp1/2-F3/4, Fp1/2-C3/4, Fp1/2-P3/4, and Fp1/2-O1/2) in the beta frequency band (13-25 Hz). Sliding averages of EEG coherence and phase were computed using 1 year averages and 9 month overlapping that produced 64 means from 0.44 years of age to 16.22 years of age. Rhythmic oscillations in coherence and phase were noted in all electrode combinations. Different developmental trajectories were present for coherence and phase differences and for anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior directions and inter-electrode distance. Large changes in EEG coherence and phase were present from similar to 6 months to 4 years of age followed by a significant linear trend to higher coherence in short distance inter-electrode distances and longer phase delays in long inter-electrode distances. The results are consistent with a genetic model of rhythmic long tern connection formation that occurs in cycles along a curvilinear trajectory toward adulthood. Competition for dendritic space, development of complexity, and nonlinear dynamic oscillations are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 29:1400-1415, 2008. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Here, we recorded intracranial EEG during a modified Flanker task from the MFC of two patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for the treatment of epilepsy. Performance on the task was associated with a suppression of beta (15-30 Hz) frequency oscillation power prior to and just following the response and an enhancement of theta (4-8 Hz) frequency power following the response. Beta (theta) power was anatomically distributed towards more dorsal/caudal (rostral/ventral) electrode sites along the cortex, suggesting all anatomical/ functional specialization along the medial frontal wall for pre-response versus post-response action monitoring. Inter-site phase coherence analyses demonstrated that the ventral/rostral MFC theta oscillations were coupled with theta oscillations observed at scalp electrodes Fz and Cz. One patient was tested before and after having epileptogenic tissue in the MFC surgically removed; task performance increased from chance levels to near-perfect, and an ERP conflict effect was observed only following surgery. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of MFC oscillations and their relation to surface EEG-recorded potentials during action monitoring. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address the functional contribution of HNK-1 to interneuron function in the adult brain, we recorded EEG and auditory-evoked potential in freely moving mice deficient for HNK-1 sulfotransferase (ST-/- mice) and in wild-type littermates. While ST-/- mice displayed normal theta oscillations, both cortical and hippocampal oscillations within the beta range were enhanced, and gamma oscillations showed an opposite trend. ST-/- mice had amplitudes of auditory-evoked potentials similar to control mice, but the latencies of their hippocampal responses were shorter. Morphological analysis revealed a decreased density of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampal CA3 subfield of ST-/- mice, which may contribute to the observed changes in networks oscillations. These findings reveal alterations in ST-/mice that differ from EEG abnormalities of mice deficient in the HNK1 carrier molecule tenascin-R. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previously this effect has been suggested to be due to increased readiness in somatosensory cortex. Presently, we examine whether regularity of stimulus occurrence increases the proprioceptive evoked response as an indication of increased readiness. This is achieved through detailed analysis of both evoked and induced responses in the time-frequency domain. Electroencephalography in a 64 channels montage was recorded in four-teen healthy subjects. Two paradigms were explored: A Regular alternation between hand of presentation and a Random sequence of hand of presentation. The ERPWAVELAB toolbox was used for decomposition of the wavelet transformed data (7 to 47 Hz, -300 to +1S00 ms)" yielding the evoked amplitude (AvVvrT) and inter-trial phase coherence as well as the increase of nontime-locked activity (induced). After initial exploration of the AvVVT and Induced collapsed files of all subjects using two-way factor analyses (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization), further data decomposition was performed in restricted windows of interest (WOI). Main effects of side of stimulation, onset or offset, regularity and habituation on the evoked and induced activity are described for each WOI. The Regular paradigm evoked more activity than Random in the fast beta range (18-28 Hz) (mean: normalized amplitude 0.38 at 90 ins and 20.9 Hz) including increased phase precision. The findings confirm the possibility of modulation of middle-latency activity by regularity and suggest that this is due to facilitation of activity in secondary somatosensory cortices. Future studies need to examine whether the increased amplitude is associated with increased perceptual acuity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We explored individual differences in EEG reactivity to determine whether it is positively or negatively correlated with BOLD across subjects. Methods: A Sternberg working memory task with 2, 4, or 6 digits was administered to 18 subjects in separate fMRI and EEG sessions. Memory load-dependent theta and alpha reactivity was quantified and used as a regressor to reveal brain areas exhibiting EEG-fMRI correlation across subjects. Results: Theta increases localized to medial prefrontal cortex, and correlated negatively with BOLD in that region and in other "default mode" areas. Alpha modulation localized to parietal-occipital midline cortex and also correlated negatively with BOLD. Conclusions: Individual tendencies to exhibit memory load-dependent oscillations are associated with negative BOLD responses in certain brain regions. Significance: Positive BOLD responses and increased EEG oscillations do not necessarily arise in the same regions. Negative BOLD responses may also relate to cognitive activity, as traditionally indexed by increased EEG power in the theta band. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The generators of these excess EEG oscillations are localized in the cortical pain matrix. Since cortex and thalamus are tightly interconnected anatomically, we asked how thalamic activity and EEG are functionally related in these patients. During the surgical intervention in ten patients with neurogenic pain, local field potentials were recorded from the posterior part of the central lateral nucleus (CL). The highest thalamocortical coherence was found in the 4- to 9-Hz theta frequency band (median 7.7 Hz). The magnitude of thalamocortical theta coherence was comparable to the magnitude of EEG coherence between scalp electrode pairs. Median thalamocortical theta coherence was 27%, reached up to 68% and was maximal with frontal midline scalp sites. The observed high thalamocortical coherence underlines the importance of the thalamus for the synchronization of scalp EEG. We discuss the pathophysiology within the framework of a dysrhythmic thalamocortical interplay, which has important consequences or the choice of therapeutic strategy in patients with chronic and severe forms of neurogenic pain.

The algorithm is based on the recognition of rhythmic activities associated with ictal states in surface EEG recordings. Using a moving-window analysis, we first decomposed each EEG segment into a wavelet packet tree. Then, we extracted the coefficients corresponding to the frequency hand of interest defined for rhythmic activities. Finally, a normalized index sensitive to both the rhythmicity and energy of the EEG signal was derived, based on the resulting coefficients. In our study, we evaluated this combined index for real-time detection of epileptic seizures using a dataset of similar to 11.5 hours of multichannel scalp EEG recordings from three patients and compared It to our previously proposed wavelet-based index. In this dataset, the novel combined index detected all epileptic seizures with a false detection rate of 0.52/hr.

Current synchrony measures depend on the energy of the signals rather than the phase, and cannot be reliably used as measures of neural synchrony. Moreover, the current methods are insufficient since they are limited to pairs of signals. These approaches cannot quantify the synchrony across a group of electrodes and over time-varying frequency regions. In this paper, we propose two new measures for quantifying the synchrony between both pairs and groups of electrodes using time-frequency analysis. The proposed measures are applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data to quantify neural synchrony.

A sudden "STOP" signal appeared during the trial which warned the subject to change the direction of the spot movement. Phase was measured from narrow frequency bands (f +/- 2.5 Hz) by convolution with a complex Morlet wavelet designed for f. Frequency f was chosen form theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands (6, 10, 17 and 37 Hz respectively). It was found that the mean number of synchronized pairs depends only on the frequency band; while the dominance of phase synchronization (the number of derivations with which each of them is synchronized simultaneously) depends on the frequency band and on the type of spot movement as well. The latter method provides complex characteristics of the phase synchronization dynamics. The analysis of dominance is sensitive, it provides information about the localization of the dominance on the scalp and it estimates the intensity of participation of each area in the synchronization process.

We analyzed data of a visual feature detection task and will show 1) phase concentration in the alpha frequency range, 2) ongoing alpha activity prior to stimulus onset, 3) evoked alpha oscillation in the ERP, 4) lack of power increase during phase concentration, 5) decrease in amplitude variance during early evoked components preceding a decrease in power, and 6) the same cortical sources for induced prestimulus power and evoked poststimulus power. Because none of these data provide unequivocal evidence for phase reset, we additionally tested the basic assumption of the evoked model, which is the additivity of the evoked response an the basis of a simulation approach. Our findings suggest that nonadditive processes-typical for a phase reset-are involved in the generation of the ERP. Thus, together with the other findings this study provides unequivocal evidence for phase resetting in the human EEG.

EEG patterns and their relationship to other physiologic signals serve as templates for normal brain organization and maturation, subserving multiple interconnected neuronal networks. Interpretation of serial EEG-sleep patterns also helps track the continuity of brain functions from intrauterine to extrauterine time periods. Recognition of the ontogeny of behavioral and electrographic patterns provides insight into the developmental neurophysiological expression of neural plasticity. Sleep ontogenesis from neonatal and infancy periods documents expected patterns of postnatal brain maturation, which allows for alterations from genetically programmed neuronal processes under stressful and/or pathological conditions. Automated analyses of cerebral and noncerebral signals provide time- and frequency-dependent computational phenotypes of brain organization and maturation in healthy or diseased states. Research pertaining to the developmental origins of health and disease can use these computational phenotypes to design longitudinal studies for the assessment of gene-environment interactions. Computational strategies may ultimately improve our diagnostic skills to identify special-needs children and to track the neurorehabilitative care of the high-risk fetus, neonate, and infant.

Tracking and detection of epileptiform activity in multichannel ictal EEG using signal subspace correlation of seizure source scalp topographies (vol 43, pg 764, 07)	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Correction						Blind source separation; Independent component analysis; Spatial topography; Source tracking and detection; EEG analysis; epilepsy	SPIKE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; DISCHARGES; SYSTEM	Conventional methods for monitoring clinical (epileptiform) multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals often involve morphological, spectral or time-frequency analysis on individual channels to determine waveform features for detecting and classifying ictal events (seizures) and inter-ictal spikes. Blind source separation (BSS) methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA), are increasingly being used in biomedical signal processing and EEG analysis for extracting a set of underlying source waveforms and sensor projections from multivariate time-series data, some of which reflect clinically relevant neurophysiological (epileptiform) activity. The work presents an alternative spatial approach to source tracking and detection in multichannel EEG that exploits prior knowledge of the spatial topographies of the sensor projections associated with the target sources. The target source sensor projections are obtained by ICA decomposition of data segments containing representative examples of target source activity, e.g. a seizure or ocular artifact. Source tracking and detection are then based on the subspace correlation between individual target sensor projections and the signal subspace over a moving window. Different window lengths and subspace correlation threshold criteria reflect transient or sustained target source activity. To study the behaviour and potential application of this spatial source tracking and detection approach, the method was used to detect (transient) ocular artifacts and (sustained) seizure activity in two segments of 25-channel EEG data recorded from one epilepsy patient on two separate occasions, with promising and intuitive results.

Through a review of the relevant literature, the author introduces the reader to the most important theories of coherent perception ('binding'), and makes an attempt to show how synchronization of EEG-registrable oscillatory activities from various frequency bands might explain binding. Finally, a number of clinical problems are also mentioned, regarding which the presented theoretical framework might deserve further consideration.

However, SSVEP is still influenced by the same frequency component in the spontaneous EEG, and it is meaningful to find a parameter that can avoid or decrease this influence to improve the transfer rate and the accuracy of the SSVEP-based BCI. In this work, with wavelet analysis, a new parameter named stability coefficient (SC) was defined to measure the stability of a frequency, and then the electrode with the highest stability was selected as the signal electrode for further analysis. After that, the SC method and the traditional power spectrum (PS) method were used comparatively to recognize the stimulus frequency from an analogous BCI data constructed from a real SSVEP data, and the results showed that the SC method is better for a short time window data.

J	Qin, L; Wang, YD				Qin, Li; Wang, Yuedong			NONPARAMETRIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS WITH APPLICATIONS TO SEIZURE CHARACTERIZATION USING EEG TIME SERIES	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; GACV; GML; locally stationary process; permutation test; smoothing parameter; smoothing spline; SS ANOVA	SMOOTHING SPLINE ANOVA; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; PERIODOGRAM; LIKELIHOOD; EPILEPSY; MODELS	Understanding the seizure initiation process and its propagation pattern(s) is a critical task in epilepsy research. Characteristics of the preseizure electroencephalograms (EEGs) such as oscillating powers and high-frequency activities are believed to be indicative of the seizure onset and spread patterns. In this article, we analyze epileptic EEG time series using nonparametric spectral estimation methods to extract information on seizure-specific power and characteristic frequency [or frequency band(s)]. Because the EEGs may become nonstationary before seizure events, we develop methods for both stationary and local stationary processes. Based on penalized Whittle likelihood, we propose a direct generalized maximum likelihood (GML) and generalized approximate cross-validation (GACV) methods to estimate smoothing parameters in both smoothing spline spectrum estimation of a stationary process and smoothing spline ANOVA time-varying spectrum estimation of a locally stationary process. We also propose permutation methods to test if a locally stationary process is stationary. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed direct methods, especially the direct GML. are stable and perform better than other existing methods. We apply the proposed methods to the intracranial electroencephalograms (IEEGs)	[Qin, Li] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Program Biostat, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Wang, Yuedong] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA		Qin, L (corresponding author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Program Biostat, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.	lqin@fhcrc.org; yuedong@pstat.ucsb.edu			Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; NSF	Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))	Supported by the Career Development Funds from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Trar scranial magnetic stimulation; Seizure; Rat; EEG	EPILEPSIA PARTIALIS CONTINUA; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; MOTOR CORTEX; PULSE STIMULATION; HUMANS; BRAIN; AFTERDISCHARGES; EXCITABILITY; INHIBITION; DEPRESSION	Objective: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model. Methods: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10 mg/kg). Rats (n = 21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with shorn rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups. Results: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P = 0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P = 0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In Contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P > 0.2). Conclusions: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS. Significance: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive Protocols. We also offer a proof of principle that real-time analysis of EEG can be used to guide rTMS to suppress individual Seizures.

Single-trial EEG dynamics of object and face visual processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED RESPONSES; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; PHASE DIFFERENCES; ALPHA; COMPONENT; RESET; N170	There has been extensive work using early event-related potentials (ERPs) to study visual object processing. ERP analyses focus traditionally on mean amplitude differences, with the implicit assumption that all of the neuronal activity of interest is evoked by the stimulus in a time-locked manner from trial to trial. However, several recent studies have suggested that visual ERP components might be explained to a large extent by the partial phase resetting of ongoing activity in restricted frequency bands. Here we apply that approach to the neural processing of visual objects. We examine the single-trial dynamics of the EEG signal elicited by the presentation of noise textures, houses and faces. We show that the brain response to those stimuli is best explained by amplitude increase that is maximal in the 5- to 15-Hz frequency band. The results indicate also the presence of a substantial increase in phase coherence in the same frequency band. However, analyses of residual activity, after subtracting the mean from single trials, show that this increase in phase coherence is not due to phase resetting per se, but rather to the presence of the ERP +noise in each trial. In keeping with this idea, a simulation demonstrates that a purely evoked model of the ERP produces quantitatively very similar results. Finally, the stronger response to faces compared to other objects (the `N170 face effect') can be explained by a pure modulation of amplitude centered in the 5- to 15-Hz band. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Exploring event-related brain dynamics with tests on complex valued time-frequency representations	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						event related brain dynamics; EEG; intertrial coherence; complex statistics; phase locking; local FDR	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PHASE-RESET; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA; GAMMA; THETA; TASK	A question subject to intense debate is whether scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials are due to phase resetting of the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) or rather to the superimposition of time-locked components on background activity. The two hypotheses are usually assessed by means of statistics in the time-frequency domain, for example, through wavelet transformation of multiple EEG trials that yield for each time and frequency a scatter plot of complex values coefficients. Currently, intertrial phase correlation (phase locking or phase coherence) is taken as evidence for phase resetting at a given frequency and latency. Here we present a formal analysis using a complex t-statistic to illustrate that such measures are, in effect, tests for the mean vector of the repeated trials, and as such on their own are inappropriate measures of phase resetting. We also propose simple t-like statistics for testing changes in (i) the mean (presence of an event-related potential), (ii) the amplitude variance (presence of (de)synchronization) and (iii) the concentration of phases (phase locking). The first two statistics are found to be proper measures of the presence of a non-zero mean activity and induced activity, respectively. In the third case, two different tests are introduced: one based on measuring the alignment of coefficients in the complex plane and another derived from the argument that phase locking persists when the mean of the coefficients is removed. Both statistics gave unambiguous evidence of the presence of phase locking suggesting that they constitute promising tools in the analysis of event-related brain dynamics.

Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded (56 channels; EB-Neuro) in 14 elite fencing athletes and in 14 non-athletes during visuo-spatial-motor demands (i.e. subjects had to react to pictures of fencing and karate attacks). The task was performed after pre-stimulus 15- (placebo) or 10-Hz (experimental) flickering audio-visual stimulation lasting I min and after no stimulation (baseline). Results: With reference to the baseline condition, only the 10-Hz stimulation induced a negative correlation between pre-stimulus alpha power and reaction time in the fencing athletes and non-athletes as a single group. The higher the enhancement of alpha power before the pictures, the stronger the improvement of the reaction time. The maximum effects were observed in right posterior parietal area (P4 electrode) overlying sensorimotor integrative cortex. Similar results were obtained in a control experiment in which eight elite karate subjects had to react to pictures of karate and basket attacks. Conclusions: The present results suggest that a preliminary 10-Hz sensory stimulation can modulate EEG alpha rhythms and sensorimotor performance in both elite athletes and non-athletes engaged in visuo-spatial-motor demands. Significance: Identification of the EEG state of sporting experts prior to their performance provides a plausible rationale for the modulation of alpha rhythms to enhance sporting performance in athletes and sensorimotor performance in patients to be rehabilitated.

Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia changes the pattern of electroencephalographic bicoherence growth during sevoflurane anaesthesia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						brain, electroencephalography; brain, hypothalamus; ventilation, hyperventilation	NEURONS IN-VITRO; MECHANISMS; EEG; DEPOLARIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PROPOFOL; CURRENTS	Background. Hyperventilation, with the resulting hypocapnia, reduces cerebral blood flow and causes slowing of the EEG activity. However, neuronal oscillating properties including the thalamocortical network during hyperventilation have not been elucidated. To assess these features provoked by hyperventilation, the present study examined quadratic phase coupling features by means of bicoherence analysis. Methods. Twenty-two patients were anaesthetized using sevoflurane 1.5% combined with remifentanil or epidural anaesthesia. After a stable normocapnic period, hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation, and the raw EEG signals were collected. Bispectral analysis (bicoherence) and power spectrum analysis were performed before and after hypocapnia. Results. Mean (SD) peak bicoherence in the delta-theta area increased from 35.6 (10.9)% during normocapnia to 43.8 (10.9)% during hypocapnia (P < 0.05), whereas mean (SD) peak bicoherence in the alpha area decreased from 42.8 (14.4)% during normocapnia to 37.5 (12.3)% during hypocapnia (P < 0.05). Normalized power in the delta-theta frequencies on the power spectrum increased from 60.2 (13.1)% to 72.5 (12.7)% (P < 0.05). Bispectral index and spectral edge frequency changed from 45.9 (7.0) to 40.1 (5.6) (P < 0.05) and from 15.0 (2.3) to 14.0 (2.5) Hz (P < 0.05), respectively. No significant differences in these values were observed between the two types of anaesthesia. Conclusions. Hypocapnia enlarged bicoherence growth in the delta-theta frequency range, suggesting the contribution of subcortical oscillating mechanisms in regulating EEG during hyperventilation.

Also, emotional discrimination by theta was more distributed on the posterior sites of the scalp for the emotional stimuli. Thus, this frequency band variation could represent a complex set of cognitive processes whereby selective attention becomes focused on an emotional-relevant stimulus.

Because light exerts an alerting response in humans, which correlates with a decrease in waking EEG theta/alpha-activity and a reduction in sleep EEG delta activity, we hypothesized that EEG activity in these frequency bands show interhemispheric asymmetries after unilateral bright light (1,500 lux) exposure. A 2-h hemi-field light exposure acutely suppressed occipital EEG alpha activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere activated by light. Subjects felt more alert during bright light than dim light, an effect that was significantly more pronounced during activation of the right than the left visual cortex. During subsequent sleep, occipital EEG activity in the delta and theta range was significantly reduced after activation of the right visual cortex but not after stimulation of the left visual cortex. Furthermore, hemivisual field light exposure was able to shift the left predominance in occipital spindle EEG activity toward the stimulated hemisphere. Time course analysis revealed that this spindle shift remained significant during the first two sleep cycles. Our results reflect rather a hemispheric asymmetry in the alerting action of light than a use-dependent recovery function of sleep in response to the visual stimulation during prior waking. However, the observed shift in the spindle hemispheric dominance in the occipital cortex may still represent subtle local use-dependent recovery functions during sleep in a frequency range different from the delta range.

A combination of visual evoked potential (VEP) analyses and analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent spectral power) was carried out. Significant differences were found for the N2 component of VEP for optic flow versus random visual motion within and between groups. Both adults and infants showed shorter latencies for structured optic flow than random visual motion, and infants showed longer latencies, particularly for random visual motion, and larger amplitudes than adults. Both groups also showed significant differences in induced activity when TSE of the two motion stimuli (optic flow and random visual motion) was compared with TSE of a static dot pattern. Infants showed an induced decrease in the amplitudes in theta-band frequency, while adults showed an induced increase in beta-band frequency. Differences in induced activity for the two motion stimuli could, however, not be observed. Brain activity related to motion stimuli is different for infants and adults and the differences are observed both in VEPs and in induced activity of the EEG. To investigate how changes in locomotor development are related to accompanying changes in brain activity associated with visual motion perception, more data of infants with different experiences in self-produced locomotion are required.

Muscle responses to transcranial stimulation in man depend on background oscillatory activity	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL TRAJECTORIES; HUMAN CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; PRECISION GRIP TASK; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DESCENDING VOLLEYS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION; CONSCIOUS HUMANS; CORTICOSPINAL VOLLEYS	Muscle responses to transcranial stimulation show high sweep-to-sweep variability, which may reflect an underlying noise process in the motor system. We examined whether response amplitude correlated with the level of prestimulus background EMG, and network oscillations. Transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation was delivered to primary motor cortex whilst human subjects performed a precision grip task known to promote beta-band (similar to 20 Hz) cortical oscillations. Responses were recorded from two intrinsic hand muscles. Response magnitude correlated significantly with the level of background EMG (mean r(2) = 0.20). Using a novel wavelet method, we quantified the amplitude and phase of oscillations in prestimulus sensorimotor EEG. Surprisingly, response magnitude showed no significant correlation with EEG oscillations at any frequency. However, oscillations in the prestimulus EMG were significantly correlated with response size; the correlation coefficient had peaks around 20 Hz. When oscillations in one muscle were used to predict response amplitude in a different muscle, correlations were substantially smaller. Finally, for each recording, we calculated the best possible prediction of response size obtainable from up to 20 measures of prestimulus EEG and EMG oscillations. Such optimal predictions had low correlation coefficients (mean r(2) = 0.2; 76% were below 0.3). We conclude that prestimulus oscillations, mainly in the beta-band, do explain some of the variability in responses to transcranial stimulation. Oscillations may likewise increase the noise of natural motor processing, explaining why this form of network activity is usually suppressed prior to dynamic movements. However, the majority of the variation is determined by other factors, which are not accessible by noninvasive recordings.

J	Kamousi, B; Amini, AN; He, B				Kamousi, Baharan; Amini, Ali Nasiri; He, Bin			Classification of motor imagery by means of cortical current density estimation and Von Neumann entropy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; RESOLUTION EEG; POTENTIALS; TASKS	The goal of the present study is to employ the source imaging methods such as cortical current density estimation for the classification of left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks, which may be used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The scalp recorded EEG was first preprocessed by surface Laplacian filtering, time-frequency filtering, noise normalization and independent component analysis. Then the cortical imaging technique was used to solve the EEG inverse problem. Cortical current density distributions of left and right trials were classified from each other by exploiting the concept of Von Neumann entropy. The proposed method was tested on three human subjects (180 trials each) and a maximum accuracy of 91.5% and an average accuracy of 88% were obtained. The present results confirm the hypothesis that source analysis methods may improve accuracy for classification of motor imagery tasks. The present promising results using source analysis for classification of motor imagery enhances our ability of performing source analysis from single trial EEG data recorded on the scalp, and may have applications to improved BCI systems.

There is now considerable evidence that auditory hallucination (AH) reflects dysfunctional gamma and beta frequency oscillations. Gamma oscillations are thought to reflect internally driven representations of objects, and the Occurrence Of Subsequent beta oscillations cat) reflect the modification of the neuronal circuitry used to encode the sensory Perception. The purpose of this study was to test whether AH in schizophrenia patients is reflected in abnormalities in D2 in their EEG, especially in the gamma and beta frequency bands. Methods Twenty-five schizophrenia patients with a history of treatment-refractory AH over at least the past 2 years, and 23 schizophrenia patients with no AH (N-AH) within the past 2 years were recruited for the study. Artifact-free 30-s EEG epochs during rest were examined for D2. Results The AH patients showed significantly increased gamma frequency D2 in Fp2 and decreased beta frequency D2 in the 113 region compared with the N-AH patients. These results imply that gamma Frequency D2 in the right prefrontal cortex is more chaotic and that beta frequency D2 in the left parietal cortex is more coherent (less chaotic) in AH patients than in N-AH patients. Conclusion Our study supports the previous evidence indicating that gamma and beta oscillations are pivotal to AH, and also shows the distinctive dimensional complexity between the right prefrontal and left parietal cortexes as the underlying biological correlates of AH in schizophrenia patients.

Every few seconds, the vehicle drifted away from the center of the left lane, and subjects were instructed to steer back to the lane center. The error of each drifting event was measured by the maximum absolute distance from the vehicle's position at deviation onset. EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis and time-frequency analysis [1]. An independent component with equivalent dipole sources located bilaterally in lateral occipital cortex exhibited multi-scale brain dynamics. Tonic (similar to 20s) alpha-band power increased in high-error compared to low-error epochs, while phasic (similar to 1s) alpha power was suppressed briefly after deviation onset, then increased strongly just before response offset. Other components also exhibited distinct tonic and/or phasic activity patterns relating to deviation onsets or response onsets.

High-level representations such as time-frequency maps convey a wealth of useful information, but they involve a large number of parameters that make statistical investigations of many signals difficult at present. In this paper, we describe a method that performs drastic reduction in the complexity of time-frequency representations through a modelling of the maps by elementary functions. The method is validated on artificial signals and subsequently applied to electrophysiological brain signals (local field potential) recorded from the olfactory bulb of rats while they are trained to recognize odours. From hundreds of experimental recordings, reproducible time-frequency events are detected, and relevant features are extracted, which allow further information processing, such as automatic classification.

Twenty unmedicated "migraine without aura" patients and a matched group of healthy controls were investigated in this explorative study. 19-channel EEG was recorded against the linked ears reference and was on-line digitized. 60 x 2-s epochs of eyes-closed, waking-relaxed activity were subjected to spectral analysis and a source localization method, low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Absolute power was computed for 19 electrodes and four frequency bands (delta: 1.5-3.5 Hz, theta: 4.0-7.5 Hz, alpha: 8.0-12.5 Hz, beta: 13.0-25.0 Hz). LORETA "activity" (=current source density, ampers/meters squared) was computed for 2394 voxels and the above specified frequency bands. Group comparison was carried out for the specified quantitative EEG variables. Activity in the two groups was compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis for each frequency band. Statistically significant (uncorrected P < 0.01) group differences were projected to cortical anatomy. Spectral findings: there was a tendency for more alpha power in the migraine that in the control group in all but two (F4, C3) derivations. However, statistically significant (P < 0.01, Bonferroni-corrected) spectral difference was only found in the right occipital region. The main LORETA-finding was that voxels with P < 0.01 differences were crowded in anatomically contiguous cortical areas. Increased alpha activity was found in a cortical area including part of the precuneus, and the posterior part of the middle temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. Decreased alpha activity was found bilaterally in medial parts of the frontal cortex including the anterior cingulate and the superior and medial frontal gyri. Neither spectral analysis, nor LORETA revealed statistically significant differences in the delta, theta, and beta bands. LORETA revealed the anatomical distribution of the cortical sources (generators) of the EEG abnormalities in migraine. The findings characterize the state of the cerebral cortex in the pain-free interval and might be suitable for planning forthcoming investigations.

Our motivation is the relation between the brain rhythms (certain frequency bands of the EEG signals) and a person's ongoing cognitive processes. We demonstrate that wavelet coefficients of specific EEG channels, scales and lime shifts have an enhanced discriminating, capability and present art algorithm for predicting a person's quick or late reaction in an oddball experiment.

Several methods exist to examine cross-frequency coupling, although each has its limitations, typically by being flexible only over time or over frequency. Here, a method for assessing transient cross-frequency coupling is presented, which allows one to test for the presence of multiple, dynamic, and flexible cross-frequency coupling structure over both time and frequency. The method is applied to intracranial EEG data, and strong coupling between gamma (similar to 40-80 Hz) and upper theta (similar to 7-9 Hz) was observed. This method might have useful applications in uncovering the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processes. Q 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previously, somatosensory gamma oscillations have only been evoked by electrical stimuli. We conjectured that a natural proprioceptive stimulus also would be able to evoke gamma oscillations. EEG was recorded using 64 channels in 14 healthy subjects. In each of three runs a stimulus of 100 g load increment in each hand was presented in 120 trials. Data were wavelet transformed and runs collapsed. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) was computed as the best measure of precision of evoked oscillations. The window of interest was 25-75 Hz and 0-200 ms. ITPC maxima were determined by visual inspection and these results were compared to results of multi-way factor analyses. The predicted 40 Hz activity was observed 60 ms after stimulus onset in the parietal region contralateral to stimulus side and additionally an unexpected 20 Hz activity was observed slightly lateralized in the frontal central region. The gamma phase locking may be a manifestation of early somatosensory feature integration. The analyses suggest that the high frequency activity consists of two distinct underlying oscillatory processes, in need of further investigation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such integration can exist across a number of functional domains, with different frequency rhythms associated with each domain. Here, evidence is summarized which shows that delta oscillations depend on activity of motivational systems and participate in salience detection. Theta oscillations are involved in memory and emotional regulation. Alpha oscillations participate in inhibitory processes which contribute to a variety of cognitive operations such as attention and memory. The importance of inhibitory functions associated with alpha oscillations increases during the course of evolution. In ontogenesis, these functions develop later and may be more sensitive to a variety of detrimental environmental influences. In a number of developmental stages and pathological conditions, a deficient alpha and/or increased slow-wave activity are associated with cognitive deficits and a lack of inhibitory control. It is shown that slow-wave and alpha oscillations are reciprocally related to each other. This reciprocal relationship may reflect an inhibitory control over motivational and emotional drives which is implemented by the prefrontal cortex. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Additionally, a comparative analysis of three time-frequency distributions, smooth pseudo Wigner-Ville (SPWVD), Choi-Williams (CWD) and Born-Jordan distribution (BJD) is presented in this study. SPWVD showed higher capacity for eliminating the cross terms independently of the signal. After applying Hilbert transformation to real signals BJD and CWD lost some important mathematic properties as marginals, on the contrary PSWVD remains unchanged. BJD showed results comparable with CWD. During arousal episodes, analogous energy distribution and spectral indexes were obtained by the three time-frequency representations. Arousals with chin activity presented stronger changes in RR intervals and LF (related to sympathetic activity) component, being statistically different with respect to arousal without chin activity, only around the period of maximum change in beta activity on the EEG. These results suggest a more evident stress for the heart when an arousal is related to external muscular activity.	[Mendez, M. O.; Bianchi, A.

A brain-death diagnosis is made by well-defined process and some precise criteria. The process takes a long time and involves risky tests. As it preliminary EEG test, the proposed method can be easily applied in the bedside of a patient using small number of electrodes. In this method, the amplitude variation of the Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS) with respect to a frequency range of interest is extracted, then the amplitude variations in neighboring channels are compared. Experimental results show that the EMD-based method works well ill extracting a signal which represents brain activity.

In more than 90% of the SI neurons, the slow oscillation of the inward currents (0.1-2.5 Hz) with the duration of several hundreds of a millisecond was observed at the holding membrane potential of -70 mV. The reversal potential of the inward currents was approximately 0 mV and was suppressed by application of an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist. In most cases (> 90%) the inward current was synchronized with positive wave of the surface EEG recorded from ipsilateral and even contralateral cortical regions. The frequency as well as duration of the slow oscillation decreased by a volatile anesthetic agent, isoflurane (1.5-5.0%), and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were almost abolished at the highest concentration. Intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (25 mg/kg) also decreased the frequency of the slow oscillation without affecting short EPSCs. When gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors were activated by local microinjection of muscimol (3 x 10(-3) M, 1-10 mu L) into the thalamus, the frequency of the slow oscillation markedly decreased, but was not abolished completely. These findings suggest that the slow oscillation of the inward currents is generated by the summation of glutamatergic EPSCs, and affected by isoflurane and pentobarbital differently. In addition, GABAergic system in the thalamus can affect the frequency, but is not essentially implicated in the genesis of the slow oscillation.

From these segments, the local time-frequency structures of the signal are estimated by using a four-parameter chirplet decomposition. Entitled the windowed adaptive chirplet transform (windowed ACT), this approach is applied to the analysis of visual evoked potentials (VEPs). It can provide a unified and compact representation of VEPs from the transient buildup to the steady-state portion with less computational cost than its non-windowed counterpart. This paper also details a method to select the optimal window length for signal segmentation. This approach will be useful for long-term signal monitoring as well as for signal feature extraction and data compression.

This task has been previously analyzed by conventional event-related potential (ERP) computation, and Slow Potentials (SPs) were seen to be highly variable across subjects in topography and generators [Basile LF, Brunetti EP, Pereira JF Jr, Ballester G, Amaro E Jr, Anghinah R, Ribeiro P, Piedade R, Gattaz WE (2006) Complex slow potential generators in a simplified attention paradigm. Int J Psychophysiol. 61(2):149-57]. We obtained 124-channel EEG recordings from 12 individuals and computed latency-corrected peak averaging in oscillatory bursts. We used currentdensity reconstruction to model the generators of attention-related activity that would not be seen in ER-Ps, which are restricted to stimulus-locked activity. We intended to compare a possibly found spectral correlate of attention, in topographic variability, with stimulus-related activity. The main results were (1) the detection of two bands of attention-induced beta range oscillations (around 25 and 21 Hz), whose scalp topography and current density cortical distribution were complex multi-focal, and highly variable across subjects (topographic dispersion significantly higher than sensory-related visual theta induced band-power), including prefrontal and posterior cortical areas. Most interesting, however, was the observation that (2) the generators of task-induced oscillations are largely the same individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during the pre-stimulus baseline. We concluded that attention-related electrical cortical activity is highly individual-specific, and possibly, to a great extent already established during mere resting wakefulness. We discuss the critical implications of those results, in combination with results from other methods that present individual data, to functional mapping of cortical association areas.

Our studies have been focussed on two areas: studies of variability and correlations in the oscillations during resting conditions of normal subjects, and the abnormalities related to type I diabetes. Recordings in normal subjects showed that also under standardized conditions with regular cycles of closed and open eyes, there is a temporal variability of the spectral components in EEG that necessitates samples > 124 s in order to achieve estimates of alpha power with a coefficient of variation < 0.1 in all recording channels (brain regions). The temporal variability in alpha and beta power demonstrates long-range temporal correlations, i.e., periods of large power (alpha or beta) are more likely to be followed by large power, and vice versa. The long-range temporal correlations were reproducible, especially during the closed-eyes condition, stronger in males than females, and not age dependent. In patients with type I diabetes, the alpha and beta power components were both decreased with similar nadirs in the posterior temporal regions, and the slow spectral components were increased in the frontal regions. The cognitive function was presently not studied but in a group of adolescents with diabetes we found a correlation between the presence of slow activity and the number of hypoglycaemic episodes. The loss of alpha and beta power was highly correlated which initiated a study of the normal alpha-beta correlation. A significant 1:2 phase synchronization was present between alpha and beta oscillations with a phase tag of about pi/2 in all electrode derivations. The strong frequency relationship between the resting beta and alpha oscillations suggested that they are generated by a common mechanism. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, during the performance of a particular mental task, different factors such as concentration, attention, level of consciousness and the difficulty of the task, may be affecting the changes in the EEG activity. Accordingly, training the subject to consistently and reliably produce and control the changes in the EEG signals is a critical issue in developing a BCI system. In this work, we used meditation practice to enhance the mind controllability during the performance of a mental task in a BCI system. The mental states to be discriminated are the imaginative hand movement and the idle state. The experiments were conducted on two groups of subject, meditation group and control group. The time-frequency analysis of EEG signals for meditation practitioners showed an event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta rhythm before imagination during resting state. In addition, a strong event-related synchronization (ERS) of beta rhythm was induced in frequency around 25 Hz during hand motor imagery. The results demonstrated that the meditation practice can improve the classification accuracy of EEG patterns. The average classification accuracy was 88.73% in the meditation group, while it was 70.28% in the control group. An accuracy as high as 98.0% was achieved in the meditation group.

Alpha and beta bands were investigated in three temporal intervals: a sensory period, a delay period and a saccade preparation period time locked with saccade onset. Modulations of ERD/ERS power, coupled with the task, reached the largest amplitudes over the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. Differences of oscillatory activity in the alpha bands revealed an intriguing pattern of asymmetry in parieto-occipital areas. Rightward saccades induced a larger desynchronization with respect to the leftward saccades in the left hemisphere, but not in the right. If representative, these findings are congruent to the established right-hemisphere dominance of the brain areas that direct attention. Moreover differences between the two alpha types emerged in the frontal areas before and during the saccade preparation periods, indicative of differential engagement of these areas depending on the task demands. In conclusion, the present approach shows that planning eye movements is linked with covert orienting of spatial attention and may supply a useful method for studying eye movements and selective attention-related processes.

Our purpose was to differentiate the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of extracranial muscle contractions from those of intracranial epileptogenic discharges. Methods: Using intracranial video-EEG (IVEEG), we recorded seizures in a 17-year-old boy with left mesial-temporal lobe epilepsy. We used multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA) to differentiate extracranial HFOs of craniofacial muscle activities from intracranial HFOs recorded ictally and interictally. Results: During I I seizures, IVEEG showed low-amplitude fast waves (similar to 60 Hz) starting at the left mesial-temporal electrodes. Ictal facial grimacing projected low-amplitude (similar to 20 mu V) fast waves (similar to 160 Hz) on inferior lateral-temporal electrodes. Interictal chewing projected medium-amplitude (similar to 100 mu V) fast waves (similar to 140 Hz) correlating to mouth movements. MBFA topographic power spectrograms revealed a sustained, consistent ictal fast-frequency band from electrodes in the seizure-onset zone and randomly scattered HFOs without a specific frequency band from ictal and interictal extracranial muscle contractions. Conclusions: MBFA power spectrograms differentiated randomly scattered muscle HFOs without a specific frequency band at electrodes close to temporal muscles from ictal epileptic HFOs with a sustained, fast-frequency band in the seizure-onset zone.

CDSA was presented for the first time in 1987 by M. Salinsky and coauthors. This method was adapted to display frequency course and voltage of EEG signal during sleep. The overnight sleep records of 35 healthy volunteers of both sexes (23 women, 12 men; aged 19-26) were analyzed in order to verify the modification of CDSA method. We propose to use combining the hypnogram and CDSA method significantly increases the informative value of data and results in enhanced quality of sleep analysis.

Our working hypothesis is that, at difference of non-athletes, athletes are characterized by enhanced cortical information processing as indexed by the amplitude reduction of EEG oscillations at alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz) during open- referenced to closed-eyes condition (event-related desynchronization, ERD). Balance during quiet standing was indexed by body "sway area". Correlation between alpha ERD and event-related change of the sway area was computed by a nonparametric test (p < 0.05). It was found that alpha ERD (10-12 Hz) is stronger in amplitude in the karate and fencing athletes than in the non-athletes at ventral centro-parietal electrodes of the right hemisphere (p < 0.02). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant correlation in the karate athletes between right ventral centro-parietal alpha ERD and body sway area (r=0.61; p < 0.008): specifically, the greater the alpha ERD, the greater the percentage reduction of the body sway area when the visual inputs were available. These results suggest that parasylvian alpha ERD of the right hemisphere may reflect the cortical information processing for the balance in elite athletes subjected to a long training for equilibrium control.

In this study, using three-dimensional (3-D) maze tasks for spatial navigation in health subjects, we carried out quantification of Fin theta rhythm with a new method using a combination of time-frequency analysis (wavelet transform, WT) and singular values decomposition (SVD). And we also attempted to clarify relationship between turning points or 3-D maze tasks and Fin theta rhythm with the proposed method. Nine healthy subjects participated in the EEG measurement with 3-D maze tasks. We obtained informed consent from all subjects. The tasks were navigating 3-D mazes with four different turning points (turning points: 7, 9, 11, 13) for 5 min, respectively. We examined the quantification of Fin theta rhythm with two conditions (singular value is over 85% and duration of Fm theta rhythm is longer than 1s), which were defined by the proposed method. It was found that appearance ratio of the Fm theta rhythm increased with changing difficulty (increasing turning points). It is confirmed that the proposed method is useful for quantifying appearance of Fm theta rhythm during spatial navigation.	Tokyo Denki Univ, Hatoyama, Saitama, Japan; [Kim, B.

It has been suggested that the auditory evoked gamma-band response (GBR) is affected by attention and apart from auditory cortex activity a frontal or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) generator could be involved. It was the aim of the present study to address three questions: (1) is there a neural generator of the early evoked GBR in the dorsal (d)ACC? (2) Are there different activation patterns in the dACC and the auditory cortex areas in response to task difficulty? (3) Is it possible to detect an influence of early ACC-gamma-band activity (GBR timeframe) to later auditory information processing (N1 timeframe)? In the present EEG/ERP-study we have investigated 30 healthy subjects using six auditory reaction tasks with increasing difficulty and mental effort demands. In the MANOVA analysis we found a significant main effect of task difficulty on both the GBR amplitude (F = 7.75; p < 0.001) and the auditory evoked N1 potential (F = 7.00; p < 0.001) with higher amplitudes in the more difficult tasks. In the LORETA region of interest (ROI) analysis, this effect was only due to increased dACC-activity during the GBR-timeframe. For the ROI analysis during the NI timeframe, in addition to a strong effect of task difficulty in the dACC a similar main effect was found in the auditory association area 22. These findings are in line with a top-down influence of dACC-activity to the auditory association area 22 during the earIv evoked GBR. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Delta responses of 21 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and 16 healthy elderly controls were evaluated by an active oddball paradigm. Averaged and single sweep potentials were analyzed during target tone processing. As far as time domain averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) are concerned, no significant group differences were observed for N100 and P200 components (both latency and amplitude); also, N200 and P300 amplitude did not differ between groups, whilst N200 and P300 latency were significantly prolonged in AD patients. Concerning delta frequency component of the averaged ERPs, no significant differences between groups were obtained for delta response amplitude as well as delta response topography (Fz, Cz, Pz). Analysis of delta responses was performed for single sweep maximal peak-to-peak amplitude. Significant between groups differences were revealed at the level of single sweep amplitude at the 3 midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz), during target tone processing. In particular, the difference between healthy controls and AD subjects was at the level of stimulus-related delta amplitude changes: in all locations a significant enhancement of the delta response is recorded in healthy subjects (especially at the frontal location), whilst this delta reactivity was not detectable in AD patients. From a clinical point of view, the lack of delta reactivity might relate to a decision-making function impairment since mild Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Algorithm for the Automated Detection of Epileptic Seizures in Long-Term Scalp EEG Recordings in Clinical Routine	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Article						EEG; epilepsy; presurgical evaluation; seizure detection; time frequency analysis	NEURAL-NETWORK; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM	Very recently we described an efficient and robust algorithm for the offline-detection of epileptic seizures for long-term scalp EEG recordings in 19 patients [1]. The aim of this present Study was to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a larger number of patients with different types of seizures and without requiring any a priori information about the seizures. For the detection of characteristic electrographic changes of the seizures we have developed an algorithm based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for the computation of the integrated EEG power in two frequency bands (3-12 Hz, 12-18 Hz). The integrated power has been calculated for three different standardised multi-channel seizure detection montages (referenced against the average Fz-Cz-Pz, common average, bipolar) for the right and left hemispheres, respectively. For the calculations, the same fixed parameters have been used for all patients. An appropriate method for artefact rejection has been applied. In the study all EEG data recorded from the patients have been analysed. The seizure performance sensitivity and selectivity (number of false-positive errors/h, FPH) have been determined. 45 patients suffering from intractable epileptic seizures were included in the study. A total of 7161 h of scalp recordings containing 302 seizures were investigated. The highest averaged sensitivity has been obtained for the referenced Fz-Cz-Pz montage in the frequency band 3-12 Hz and was 80.6%, while the selectivity FPH was 0.21/h. The other seizure detection montages yielded lower values for the sensitivity. The proposed method for the detection of epileptic seizures might be able to make a significant contribution to the diagnostic gain of long-term scalp EEG monitoring during presurgical evaluation.

Spontaneous very low frequency oscillations (VLFO: <0.2 Hz) in functional magnetic-resonance imaging are proposed to identify a default-mode network of resting brain activity. Activity in this network has been related to lapses of attention during goal-directed tasks and may provide a basis for ADHD. This study assessed the relation between scalp-recorded EEG VLFO at rest and ADHD. Methods. 13 young adults with high- and 11 with low self-ratings of ADHD participated. Direct current EEG was recorded during a five minute rest session and was retested after approximately 1 week. Results. A consistent and temporally stable pattern of VLFOs was observed across specific scalp regions in low-ADHD participants. High-ADHD participants had less VLFO power across these locations, especially where inattention self-ratings were high. Inattention was not related to VLFO power in other locations. Discussion. Initial evidence is provided for a pattern of VLFOs at rest which is associated with inattention symptoms.	[Helps, S.; Karl, A.; Sonuga-Barke, E. J.

However, most of the existing physiological signal monitoring systems can only record the signals without the capability of automatic analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system that can acquire and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in real-time to monitor human physiological as well as cognitive states, and, in turn, provide warning signals to the users when needed. The BCI system consists of a four-channel biosignal acquisition/amplification module, a wireless transmission module, a dual-core signal processing unit, and a host system for display and storage. The embedded dual-core processing system with multitask scheduling capability was proposed to acquire and process the input EEG signals in real time. In addition, the wireless transmission module, which eliminates the inconvenience of wiring, can be switched between radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth according to the transmission distance. Finally, the real-time EEG-based drowsiness monitoring and warning algorithms were implemented and integrated into the system to close the loop of the BCI system. The practical online testing demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed system with the ability of real-time processing, automatic analysis, and online warning feedback in real-world operation and living environments.

Identified rhythmic patterns can be analyzed by fast-Fourier transformation (FFT) and amplitude/ power spectra can be displayed. FFT-phase maps help to differentiate and localize the sources of rhythmic patterns. Inverse source analysis with superposition on individual 3D-MRI can be readily applied to identify the center of activation of cortical areas generating interictal and/or ictal epileptic activities. Currently available methods, like single dipole fitting, multiple source analysis, or various distributed source models have different advantages and pitfalls. If used in combination they can help to identify the region of onset. However, non-invasive EEG is too much smeared to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of the activated cortical area.

Enhanced correlations between SW and FW have been related to anxiety, behavioral inhibition and high basal cortisol levels. However, the direct effects of cortisol on SW-FW coupling have not been experimentally studied yet. The present study investigated whether cortisol. administration increases SW-FW coupling. Resting state EEG recordings were obtained from 40 right-handed healthy male subjects with extreme low or high scores on a behavioral inhibition scale, after placebo and cortisol (50 mg) administration. As expected, cortisol resulted in a significant increase in correlation between SW (delta) and FW (beta) activity compared to placebo. In addition, delta-beta correlation was significantly higher in high compared to low behaviorally inhibited subjects in both conditions. These results suggest that cortisol can modify brain activity, increasing a pattern associated with anxiety and behavioral inhibition. This is in line with findings associating cortisol with behavioral inhibition and anxiety. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To examine whether schizophrenic patients have abnormalities in frequency-domain, event-related alpha attenuation, as well as in time-domain EEG phenomena, such as event-related potential, we compared alpha power change and P300 elicited simultaneously in response to the presentation of target tones in an auditory oddball paradigm between patients with schizophrenia and normal control subjects. In both patients and controls, alpha power was smaller during the time window of 512 ms following targets than following non-targets, particularly at the parietal and the posterior temporal locations (Pz, T5, and T6). The size of alpha attenuation measured as percent reduction in alpha power produced by targets relative to non-targets was smaller in patients than in controls at the posterior temporal locations. The size of alpha attenuation showed no correlation with P300 amplitude or latency in either patients or controls. Furthermore, in patients, the size of alpha attenuation showed no correlation with symptom severity, while P300 amplitude was correlated negatively with the positive subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. These findings suggest that the symptom-independent reduction in event-related alpha attenuation in schizophrenia may be useful as an electrophysiological index of the impairment of neural processes distinct from that indexed by symptom-dependent P300 abnormalities.

On the basis of findings showing that the frequency characteristic of the P1 component lies in the alpha range and that alpha oscillation is functionally associated with inhibition, we predict that the P1 component also reflects inhibitory processes. This hypothesis is tested in two experiments, a spatial-cuing task and a visual-semantic categorization task. The results of the cuing task demonstrate that in a similar way as alpha power, the P1 component is larger over task-irrelevant ipsilateral sites. For the categorization task, we found that the P1 component, in a similar way to alpha oscillations, is larger for task-irrelevant, distorted pictures. We conclude that the P1 component may be generated at least in part by evoked alpha oscillations and reflects inhibition in the sense of suppressing task-irrelevant processes.

However, the timing of the underlying cellular events, which is an alternation of active and silent states of thalamocortical network, can be assessed only approximately from the phase of slow waves. Is it possible to detect, using the UP or EEG, the timing of each episode of cellular activity or silence? With simultaneous recordings of the UP and intracellular activity of 2-3 neocortical cells, we show that high-gamma-range (20-100 Hz) components in the UP have significantly higher power when cortical cells are in active states as compared with silent-state periods. Exploiting this difference we have developed a new method, which uses the LFP signal to detect episodes of activity and silence of neocortical neurons. The method allows robust, reliable, and precise detection of timing of each episode of activity and silence of the neocortical network. It works with both surface and depth EEG, and its performance is affected little by the EEG prefiltering during recording. These results open new perspectives for studying differential operation of neural networks during periods of activity and silence, which rapidly alternate on the subsecond scale.

Increased EEG gamma band activity in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						EEG; induced gamma band; Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; sensitivity; reliability	HUMAN SCALP; OSCILLATIONS; DEMENTIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; ATTENTION; HUMANS; TERM; INHIBITION; DONEPEZIL	High frequency (30-70 Hz) gamma band oscillations in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG) are thought to reflect perceptual and cognitive processes. It is therefore interesting to study these measures in cognitive impairment and dementia. To evaluate gamma band oscillations as a diagnostic biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 15 psychoactive drug naive AD patients, 20 MCI patients and 20 healthy controls participated in this study. Gamma band power (GBP) was measured in four conditions viz. resting state, music listening, story listening and visual stimulation. To evaluate test-retest reliability (TRR), subjects underwent a similar assessment one week after the first. The overall TRR was high. Elevated GBP was observed in AD when compared to MCI and control subjects in all conditions. The results suggest that elevated GBP is a reproducible and sensitive measure for cognitive dysfunction in AD in comparison with MCI and controls.	[van Deursen, J. A.; Vuurman, E. F. P.

Through implementation in a software programming environment and testing on a sample of patient data sets, we demonstrate the potential of this technique. Its ability to naturally decompose electrical signals of both the heart (ECG) and brain (invasive EEG) into clear frequency and amplitude variations are shown.

The signal is investigated as a stochastic process, and approximated by a set of deterministic components contaminated by the noise which is modelled as a parametric autoregressive process. Separation of the deterministic part of time series from stochastic noise is obtained by an application of matching pursuit algorithm combined with testing for the residuum's weak stationarity (in mean and in variance) after each iteration. The method is illustrated by an application to simulated nonstationary data.

Image clips were selected from a broad area image and presented in rapid succession (12/s) in 4.1-s bursts. Participants indicated by subsequent button press whether or not each burst of images included a target airplane feature. Image clip creation and search path selection were designed to maximize user comfort and maintain user awareness of spatial context. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract a set of independent source time-courses and their minimally-redundant low-dimensional informative features in the time and time-frequency amplitude domains from 128-channel EEG data recorded during clip burst presentations in a training session. The naive Bayes fusion of two Fisher discriminant classifiers, computed from the 100 most discriminative time and time-frequency features, respectively, was used to estimate the likelihood that each clip contained a target feature. This estimator was applied online in a subsequent test session. Across eight training/test session pairs from seven participants, median area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, by tenfold cross validation, was 0.97 for within-session and 0.87 for between-session estimates, and was nearly as high (0.83) for targets presented in bursts that participants mistakenly reported to include no target features.

Among the brain signal monitoring systems best suited for this challenging task, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are the most realistic, since both are non-invasive, EEG is portable and MEG could provide more specific information that could be later exploited also through EEG signals. The first two BCI steps require set up of the appropriate experimental protocol while recording the brain signal and then to extract interesting features from the recorded cerebral activity. To provide information useful in these BCI stages, our aim is to provide an overview of a new procedure we recently developed, named functional source separation (FSS). As it comes from the blind source separation algorithms, it exploits the most valuable information provided by the electrophysiological techniques, i.e. the waveform signal properties, remaining blind to the biophysical nature of the signal sources. FSS returns the single trial source activity, estimates the time course of a neuronal pool along different experimental states on the basis of a specific functional requirement in a specific time period, and uses the simulated annealing as the optimization procedure allowing the exploit of functional constraints non-differentiable. Moreover, a minor section is included, devoted to information acquired by MEG in stroke patients, to guide BCl applications aiming at sustaining motor behaviour in these patients. Relevant BCI features spatial and time-frequency properties - are in fact altered by a stroke in the regions devoted to hand control. Moreover, a method to investigate the relationship between sensory and motor hand cortical network activities is described, providing information useful to develop BCI feedback control systems. This review provides a description of the FSS technique, a promising tool for the BCI community for online electrophysiological feature extraction, and offers interesting information to develop BCI applications to sustain hand control in stroke patients.

Testing for nested oscillation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						intracranial EEG; phase coupling; cross-frequency coupling; oscillations	FREQUENCY; MEMORY; PHASE; EEG; EXCITABILITY; RHYTHMS	Nested oscillation occurs when the amplitude of a faster rhythm is coupled to the phase of a slower rhythm. It has been proposed to underlie the discrete nature of perception and the capacity of working memory and is a phenomenon observable in human brain imaging data. This paper compares three published methods for detecting nested oscillation and a fourth method proposed in this paper. These are: (i) the modulation index, (ii) the phase-locking value (PLV), (iii) the envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) and (iv) a general linear model (GLM) measure derived from ESC. We applied the methods to electrocorticographic (ECoG) data recorded during a working-memory task and to data from a simulated hippocampal interneuron network. Further simulations were then made to address the dependence of each measure on signal to noise level, coupling phase, epoch length, sample rate, signal nonstationarity, and multi-phasic coupling. Our overall conclusion is that the GLM measure is the best all-round approach for detecting nested oscillation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Penny, W.

Binocular rivalry reveals a dissociation between the subjective experience and induced gamma oscillations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; human electroencephalography; synchrony; visual cortex	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL RESPONSES; CORTICAL AREAS; TRAVELING-WAVES; BAND RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION; EEG; STRIATE	Binocular rivalry occurs when separate incompatible images are presented, one to each eye. The subjective experience of viewing these stimuli is not of a fused image, rather the perceiver experiences either one or the other percept alternating across time. Manipulation of rivalry transfer, through an abrupt focal contrast change, causes the emerging percept to radiate across the declining image. This spreading percept transition has been likened to a wave of neural excitation propagating across the excitable medium of the visual cortex [H.R. Wilson et al. (2001) Nature, 412, 907-910; S.H. Lee et al. (2005) Nat. Neurosci., 8, 22-23]. Electrophysiologically, scalp-recorded gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) have been reported to persist for several hundred milliseconds in response to changes in the subjective experience induced by alterations in incoming sensory information (moving-bar stimuli). Here, we used electroencephalographic recordings in the human and binocular rivalry transition to assess the role of scalp-recorded gamma in purely subjective changes in the visual experience. Despite the protraction of perceptual binding over a 900 ms period, no deviation in the pattern of induced gamma was observed from that reported during the perceptual closure of static images. These results suggest that localized scalp-recorded gamma oscillations are dissociable from the subjective visual experience.

We show that slow and fast delta waves (0-2 Hz and 24 Hz respectively) and high frequency components of the EEG (8-20 Hz) are correlated with each other and there is a kind of phase locking between them that varies with depth of anesthesia. Our analyses show that maximum amplitudes of high frequency components of the EEG signal are appeared in different phases of slow and fast delta waves when the concentration of Desflurane and Propofol anesthetic agents varies in a patient. There are some slight differences in using slow and fast components of delta waves. For instance, when depth of anesthesia changes, biphasic responses of the EEG have more influences on results of the fast delta wave method. In addition, this method obtains more robust and less noisy results compared with the slow delta wave method. Since phase angle between fast EEG oscillations and delta waves indicates the status of information processing in the brain and it changes in various unconsciousness levels, it may improve the performance of other classic methods of determining depth of anesthesia.

Heart-rate variability as a quantitative measure of hypnotic depth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOSIS			English	Article							EEG ACTIVITY; HYPNOSIS; ANALGESIA; PAIN; EXPERIENCE	The authors investigated whether heart-rate variability can serve as a device for real-time quantitative measurement of hypnotic depth. This study compared the continuous self-rated hypnotic depth (SRHD) of 10 volunteers with heart rate, amplitude, and frequency changes from a time-frequency analysis of heart-rate variability (HRV). The authors found significant linear relationships between SRHD and the high-frequency (HF) component of HRV. Specifically, SRHD was correlated negatively with the frequency of the HF component and positively with the amplitude of the HF component. Unexpectedly, the average temporal trend in SRHD fit well (R-2 = .99) to the step response of a first-order system with a 4-minute time constant. The findings suggest that the reactivity of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system reflected in HRV could become part of a real-time, quantitative measure of hypnotic depth.

In particular, modulations of the spectral content that take place in the EEG of patients with multiple sclerosis remitting-relapsing (RRMS) and benign multiple sclerosis (BMS) during a visuospatial task need to be observed. Methods: The sample consisted of 19 patients with RRMS, 10 with BMS, and 21 control subjects. All patients were free of medication and had not relapsed within the last month. The power spectral density (PSD) of different EEG bands was calculated by Fast-Fourier-Transformation (FFT), those analysed being delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Z-transformation was performed to observe individual profiles in each experimental group for spectral modulations. Lastly, correlation analyses was performed between QEEG values and other variables from participants in the study (age, EDSS, years of evolution and cognitive performance). Results: Nearly half (42%) the RRMS patients showed a statistically significant increase of two or more standard deviations (SD) compared to the control mean value for the beta-2 and gamma bands (F = 2.074, p = 0.004). These alterations were localized to the anterior regions of the right hemisphere, and bilaterally to the posterior areas of the scalp. None of the BMS patients or control subjects had values outside the range of +/- 2 SD. There were no significant correlations between these values and the other variables analysed (age, EDSS, years of evolution or behavioural performance). Conclusion: During the attentional processing, changes in the high EEG spectrum (beta-2 and gamma) in MS patients exhibit physiological alterations that are not normally detected by spontaneous EEG analysis. The different spectral pattern between pathological and controls groups could represent specific changes for the RRMS patients, indicative of compensatory mechanisms or cortical excitatory states representative of some phases during the RRMS course that are not present in the BMS group.

Methods: We selected 23 infants who were followed for at least 2 years. Selected EEG recordings underwent autospectra, coherence, and phase analyses in order to assess the changes during follow-up. Results: Short discharges of fast-rhythms (331 +/- 190 ms) with a lateralized onset were detected in 18 of the 23 infants (78.3%). There were no significant differences in the parameters characterizing ICTAL beta-activity (frequency, duration, inter-hemispheric coherence, or transfer time) between the infants with or without seizure recurrence. However, beta-discharges with a consistent location formed part of the ICTAL EEG in all 10 infants with seizure recurrence, but only in eight (61.5%) of those who remained seizure-free (SF) (p < 0.05). In all but one of the infants experiencing seizure recurrence, the ICTAL discharges associated with the late seizures apparently originated from the same hemisphere as that involved at the beginning of the spasm-associated beta-activity, although the precise location varied. Conclusions: Spectral, coherence and phase analyses detected spasm-associated runs of lateralized beta-rhythms in many of our infants with West syndrome. This ICTAL pattern significantly correlated with seizure recurrence. The consistent lateralization of the ICTAL EEG events associated with both the early spasms and late seizures suggests that EEG beta-activities should be considered as indicating local cortical dysfunction in infants who fail to respond to early treatment and often progress toward severe epilepsy.

Recent research suggests that high-frequency oscillations (HFO), in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-1000 Hz) frequency range, may be signatures of epileptogenic brain and involved in the generation of seizures. However, most research investigating HFO in humans comes from microwire recordings, whose relationship to standard clinical intracranial EEG (iEEG) has not been explored. In this study iEEG recordings (DC -9000 Hz) were obtained from human medial temporal lobe using custom depth electrodes containing both microwires and clinical macroelectrodes. Ripple and fast-ripple HFO recorded from both microwires and clinical macroelectrodes were increased in seizure generating brain regions compared to control regions. The distribution of HFO frequencies recorded from the macroelectrodes was concentrated in the ripple frequency range, compared to a broad distribution of HFO frequencies recorded from microwires. The average frequency of ripple HFO recorded from macroelectrodes was lower than that recorded from microwires (143.3 +/- 49.3 Hz versus 116.3 +/- 38.4, Wilcoxon rank sum P<0.0001). Fast-ripple HFO were most often recorded on a single microwire, supporting the hypothesis that fast-ripple HFO are primarily generated by highly localized, sub-millimeter scale neuronal assemblies that are most effectively sampled by microwire electrodes. Future research will address the clinical utility of these recordings for localizing epileptogenic networks and understanding seizure generation.	[Worrell, Greg A.; Stead, S.

Increasingly, studies are identifying relations between inconsistent handedness, mixed hemispheric lateralization, and dissociative symptomatology in both clinical and nonclinical populations. The current study explored whether a nonclinical sample of individuals scoring high in dissociation would display an inconsistent handedness in conjunction with a left hemispheric lateralization as measured by electroencephalography. Twenty-seven participants (12 males and 15 females) aged between 20 and 59 years (M = 29.1 year, SD = 11.2 years), completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale and Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire Revised after determining laterality. As predicted, inconsistently handed participants scoring high in dissociation displayed left hemispheric lateralization across frontal, central, and parietal regions. Conversely, right lateralization was found within A frequency band across temporal regions. The study provides a good framework for future research investigating the neurophysiological correlates underpinning dissociative symptomatology.

State I indicates heightened alertness and is frequently present during the first few minutes of time on task. State 2 indicates normal alertness, often following and lasting longer than State 1. State 3 indicates fatigue, usually following State 2, but sometimes alternating with State I and State 2. Thirty-channel EEGs were recorded from 16 subjects who performed up to 180 min of nonstop computer-based mental arithmetic. Alert or fatigued states were independently confirmed with measures of subjects' performance and pre- or post-task mood. We found convergent evidence for a three-state model of fatigue using Bayesian analysis of two different types of EEG features, both computed for single 13-s EEG epochs: 1) kernel partial least squares scores representing composite multichannel power spectra; 2) amplitude and frequency parameters of multiple single-channel autoregressive models.

Method: Cluster analysis with quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) variables was used to subtype drug-naive, non-medicated, and medicated schizophrenic, depressed and alcoholic patients with psychotic symptoms, from the USA and Germany. QEEG source localization brain images were computed for each cluster. Results: Psychotic patients with schizophrenia, depression and alcoholism, and drug-naive schizophrenic patients, were distributed among six clusters. QEEG images revealed one set of brain regions di. erentially upregulated in each cluster and another group of structures downregulated in the same way in every cluster. Conclusion: Subtypes previously found among 94 schizophrenic patients were replicated in a sample of 390 non-schizophrenic as well as schizophrenic psychotics, and displayed common neurobiological abnormalities. Collaborative longitudinal studies using these economical methods might improve di. erential understanding and treatment of patients based upon these features rather than clinical symptoms.

The analysis of LRTC provides a quantitative index of statistical dependencies in oscillations on different time scales. We analyzed LRTC in resting EEG signals in depressed outpatients and healthy controls. Methods: The participants in this study were 11 non-depressed, age-matched controls, and 11 unmedicated unipolar depressed patients. EEG data were obtained from each participant during 5-min resting baseline periods with eyes closed and then analyzed with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a scaling analysis method that quantifies a simple parameter to represent the correlation properties of a time series. The scaling exponent, the result of DFA, provides a quantitative measure of LRTC from the EEG. Results: The present study demonstrates that all the scaling exponents in depressed patients and healthy controls were greater than 0.5 and less than 1.0, regardless of condition. Furthermore, the scaling exponents of depressed patients have relatively higher values in whole brain regions compared to healthy controls, with significant differences at F3, C3, T3, T4 and 01 channels (p < 0.05). Finally, a significant linear correlation was observed between the severity of depression and the scaling exponent over most of the channels, except O2. Conclusions: These results suggest that the brain affected by a major depressive disorder shows slower decay of the LRTC, and that the persistence of the LRTC of EEG in depressed patients was associated with the severity of depression over most of the cortical areas. Significance: The DFA method may broaden our understanding of the psychophysiological basis of depression. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We present a novel adaptive spatial filtering algorithm optimized for robust source time-frequency reconstruction from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with real MEG data from a self-paced finger movement task. The algorithm reliably reveals modulations both in the beta band (12-30 Hz) and a high gamma band (65-90 Hz) in sensorimotor cortex. The performance is validated by both across-subjects statistical comparisons and by intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) data from two epilepsy patients. We also revealed observed high gamma activity in the cerebellum. The proposed algorithm is highly parallelizable and runs efficiently on modern high performance computing clusters. This method enables noninvasive five-dimensional imaging of space, time, and frequency activity in the brain and renders it applicable for widespread studies of human cortical dynamics.

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of tactile spatial-selective attention on spatiotemporal aspects of evoked neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We employed simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 14 right-handed subjects during bilateral index finger Braille stimulation to investigate the relationship between attentional effects on somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) components and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The 1st reliable EEG response following left tactile stimulation (P50) was significantly enhanced by spatial-selective attention, which has not been reported before. FMRI analysis revealed increased activity in contralateral S1. Remarkably, the effect of attention on the P50 component as well as long-latency SEP components starting at 190 ms for left stimuli correlated with attentional effects on the BOLD signal in contralateral S1. The implications are 2-fold: First, the correlation between early and long-latency SEP components and the BOLD effect suggest that spatial-selective attention enhances processing in S1 at 2 time points: During an early passage of the signal and during a later passage, probably via re-entrant feedback from higher cortical areas. Second, attentional modulations of the fast electrophysiological signals and the slow hemodynamic response are linearly related in S1.

We propose a new technique for the classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) activity for non-invasive BCI. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network that includes a Fourier transform between hidden layers in order to switch from the time domain to the frequency domain analysis in the network. The first step allows the creation of different channels. The second step is dedicated to the transformation of the signal in the frequency domain. The last step is the classification. It uses a hybrid rejection strategy that uses a junk class for the mental transition states and thresholds for the confidence values. The presented results with offline processing are obtained with 6 electrodes on 2 subjects with a time segment of Is. The system is reliable for both subjects over 95%, with rejection criterion.

With respect to every EEG trials caused by the same stimulus, the computation of all trails will be very enormous. In order to explore more significant information about even- evoked oscillatory activities, we introduced the approach of statistical parametric mapping for power-concentrated brain regions and interactivations among them, and applied them to the study of bimodal audio-visual speech cognitive task. The results gave explanations to the power and connectivity change of event-evoked oscillatory activities which matched ERP component in cognitive process. This study may provide a basis for future studies to reveal the underlying neural processes and neural networks associated with specialized cognitive state.

Methods: Heart rate and sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in controls and patients with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome that were matched for age, gender, sleep parameters, and blood pressure. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram sleep recordings to obtain power values every 20 s. Synchronization likelihood was computed between time series of the normalized high frequency spectral component of RR-intervals and all electroencephalographic frequency bands. Detrended fluctuation analysis was applied to the synchronizations in order to qualify their dynamic behaviors. Results: For all sleep bands, the fluctuations of the synchronization between sleep EEG and heart activity appear scale free and the scaling exponent is close to one as for 1/f noise. We could not detect any effect due to sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Conclusions: The synchronizations between the high frequency component of heart rate variability and all sleep power bands exhibited robust fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal behavior of 1/f noise type. No effects of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome were observed in these synchronizations. Significance: Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome does not affect the interdependence between the high frequency component of heart rate variability and all sleep power bands as measured by synchronization likelihood.

In contrast, the early auditory-evoked gamma oscillation (AGO) was reported to be unaffected in a sample of unmedicated, mostly first-episode schizophrenics, but it is unknown whether this oscillation is abnormal in chronic, medicated patients. We investigated these issues by examining the VGO and AGO in chronic schizophrenic (SZ) and matched healthy control (HQ subjects. Methods: Subjects (21 HC, 23 SZ) performed visual and auditory oddball tasks. Visual stimuli were letters, and auditory stimuli were simple tones. Event-related spectral measures (phase locking factor and evoked power) were computed on Morlet wavelet-transformed single epochs from the standard trials. Results: VGO phase locking at occipital electrodes was reduced in SZ compared with HC. In contrast, AGO phase locking and evoked power did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The VGO deficit may be a general phenomenon in schizophrenia, whereas the AGO evoked by simple tone stimuli does not appear to be abnormal in chronic, medicated schizophrenia patients.

Adaptive segmentation using wavelet transform	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Engineering	APR 11-12, 2007	Lahore, PAKISTAN	IEEE				In many applications analysis of nonstationary signals requires the signal to be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs. Segmentation can be performed by spiliting the signal at time instants of change in the amplitude or frequency content of the signal. In this paper, the signal is decomposed into signals with different frequency bands using wavelet transform. The nonlinear energy operator is then applied on the decomposed signals, which combines the amplitude and frequency contents of the signal. The proposed technique is applied on synthetic signal and real EEG data to evaluate its performance. On segmenting nonstationary signals. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms the recently published method in decomposing nonstationary signals.

Modeling the effects of synaptic strength on sleep slow waves	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep homeostasis; synaptic plasticity; slow oscillation; SWA; computer model	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DEPRESSION; VIVO; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; NEURONS	Study Objectives: Sleep slow-wave activity (SWA, electroencephalogram [EEG] power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz) is homeostatically regulated, increasing with wakefulness and declining with sleep. Sleep SWA is thought to reflect sleep need, but the mechanisms of its homeostatic regulation remain unknown. Based on a recent hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a decrease in cortical synaptic strength can account for changes in sleep SWA. Design: A large-scale computer model of the sleeping thalamocortical system was used to reproduce in detail the cortical slow oscillations underlying EEG slow waves. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: N/A. Interventions: Simulated reductions in the strength of corticocortical synapses. Measurements and Results: Decreased synaptic strength led to (1) decreased single cell membrane potential oscillations and reduced network synchronization, (2) decreased rate of neural recruitment and decruitment, and (3) emergence of local clusters of synchronized activity. These changes were reflected in the local EEG as (1) decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, (2) decreased wave slope, and (3) increased number of multipeak waves. Spectral analysis confirmed that these changes were associated with a decrease in SWA. Conclusions: A decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for changes in sleep SWA and is accompanied by characteristic changes in slow-wave parameters. Experimental results from rat cortical depth recordings and human high-density EEG show similar changes in slow-wave parameters with decreasing SWA, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may indeed be a net decrease in synaptic strength.

J	Hung, CS; Anderson, C; Horne, JA; McEvoy, P				Hung, Ching-Sui; Anderson, Clare; Horne, James A.; McEvoy, Patrick			Mobile phone 'talk-mode' signal delays EEG-determined sleep onset	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						sleep; EEG; microwaves; mobile phone	FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; BRAIN; WAKEFULNESS; EXPOSURE; SAR	Mobile phones signals are pulse-modulated microwaves, and EEG studies suggest that the extremely low-frequency (ELF) pulse modulation has sleep effects. However, 'talk', 'listen' and 'standby' modes differ in the ELF (2, 8, and 217 Hz) spectral components and specific absorption rates, but no sleep study has differentiated these modes. We used a GSM900 mobile phone controlled by a base-station simulator and a test SIM card to simulate these three specific modes, transmitted at 12.5% (23 dBm) of maximum power. At weekly intervals, 10 healthy young adults, sleep restricted to 6 h, were randomly and single-blind exposed to one of: talk, listen, standby and sham (nil signal) modes, for 30 min, at 13:30 h, whilst lying in a sound-proof, fit bedroom, with a thermally insulated silent phone beside the right ear. Bipolar EEGs were recorded continuously, and subjective ratings of sleepiness obtained every 3 min (before, during and after exposure). After exposure the phone and base-station were switched off, the bedroom darkened, and a 90 min sleep opportunity followed. We report on sleep onset using: (i) visually scored latency to onset of stage 2 sleep, (ii) EEG power spectral analysis. There was no condition effect for subjective sleepiness. Post-exposure, sleep latency after talk mode was markedly and significantly delayed beyond listen and sham modes. This condition effect over time was also quite evident in 1-4 Hz EEG frontal power, which is a frequency range particularly sensitive to sleep onset. It is possible that 2, 8, 217 Hz modulation may differentially affect sleep onset. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Axmacher, N; Elger, CE; Fell, J				Axmacher, Nikolai; Elger, Christian E.; Fell, Juergen			Ripples in the medial temporal lobe are relevant for human memory consolidation	BRAIN			English	Article						hippocampus; ripples; intracranial EEG; memory consolidation; phase-locking	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; EPILEPTIC HIPPOCAMPUS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BEHAVING RAT; SHARP WAVES; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VITRO	High-frequency oscillations (ripples) have been described in the hippocampus and rhinal cortex of both animals and human subjects and have been linked to replay and consolidation of previously acquired information. More specifically, studies in rodents suggested that ripples are generated in the hippocampus and are then transferred into the rhinal cortex, and that they occur predominantly during negative half waves of neocortical slow oscillations. Recordings in human epilepsy patients used either microelectrodes or foramen ovale electrodes; it is thus unclear whether macroelectrodes, which are routinely used for pre-surgical investigations, allow the recording of ripples as well. Furthermore, no direct link between ripples and behavioural performance has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram with macroelectrodes from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex contralateral to the seizure onset zone in II epilepsy patients during a memory consolidation task while they were having an afternoon nap, i.e. a sleep period of similar to 1 h duration. We found that ripples could reliably be detected both in the hippocampus and in the rhinal cortex and had a similar frequency composition to events recorded previously with microelectrodes in humans. Results from cross-correlation analysis revealed that hippocampal events were closely locked to rhinal events and were consistent with findings on transmission of ripples from the hippocampus into the rhinal cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal ripples were significantly locked to the phase of hippocampal delta band activity, which might provide a mechanism for the reported phase-locking to neocortical slow oscillations. Ripples occurred with the highest incidence during periods when subjects lay awake during the nap time. Finally, we found that the number of rhinal, but not hippocampal, ripples was correlated with the number of successfully recalled items (post-nap) learned prior to sleep. These data confirm previous recordings in animals and humans, but move beyond them in several respects: they are the first recordings of ripples in humans during a cognitive task and suggest that ripples are indeed related to behavioural performance; furthermore, they propose a mechanism for phase-locking of ripples to neocortical slow waves via phase coupling to hippocampal delta activity; finally, they show that ripples can be recorded reliably with standard macroelectrodes in the human brain.

On the basis of this model an ICA decomposition is calculated for a combined MEG and EEG signal F vector using the TDSEP algorithm. A single modality demixing procedure is developed to classify ICA components to be multi-modality sources detected by EEG and MEG simultaneously or to be single mode sources. Under this premise, data from 10 subjects are analysed and four exemplary types of sources are selected. We found that these sources represent physically meaningful multi- and single-mode signals: Alpha oscillations, heart activity, eye blinks, and slow signal drifts.

Although gamma power typically increases with load, the load dependency of the lower frequency theta and alpha bands is uncertain. We obtained intracranial electroencephalography measurements from 1453 electrode sites in 14 epilepsy patients performing a Sternberg task, in order to characterize the anatomical distribution of load-related changes across the frequency spectrum. Gamma power increases occurred throughout the brain, but were most common in the occipital lobe. In the theta and alpha bands, both increases and decreases were observed, but with different anatomical distributions. Increases in theta and alpha power were most prevalent in frontal midline cortex. Decreases were most commonly observed in occipital cortex, colocalized with increases in the gamma range, but were also detected in lateral frontal and parietal regions. Spatial overlap with group functional magnetic resonance imaging results was minimal except in the precentral gyrus. These findings suggest that power in any given frequency band is not a unitary phenomenon; rather, reactivity in the same frequency band varies in different brain regions, and may relate to the engagement or inhibition of a given area in a cognitive task.

This algorithm is composed of four steps. Step 1, active wakefulness, is specified when activity is detected by monitoring the animal with an infrared locomotion sensor. Step 2, NREM, is decided by an EEG delta power greater than the threshold. Step 3, REM, is specified by a higher EEG theta/(delta + theta) ratio and a lower EMG integral than the threshold values and Step 4, an undefined epoch, is classified as a state of quiet wakefulness. This algorithm was found to be in > 90% agreement with the waveform recognition procedure and decreased processing time to 40 min for 24-h recording data from eight animals. New software, SleepSign ver. 3, was designed to calculate automatically the three threshold values based on percentage of time spent in each sleep stage thus far reported in rodents.

In this paper, we present a novel adaptive spatial filtering algorithm optimized for robust source time frequency reconstruction from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography ( EEG) data. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with simulated sources and is also applied to real MEG data from a self-paced finger movement task. The algorithm reliably reveals modulations both in the beta band (12-30 Hz) and high gamma band (65-90 Hz) in sensorimotor cortex. The performance is validated by both across-subjects statistical comparisons and by intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) data from two epilepsy patients. Interestingly, we also reliably observed high frequency activity (30-300 Hz) in the cerebellum, although with variable locations and frequencies across subjects. The proposed algorithm is highly parallelizable and runs efficiently on modern high-performance computing clusters. This method enables the ultimate promise of MEG and EEG for five-dimensional imaging of space, time, and frequency activity in the brain and renders it applicable for widespread studies of human cortical dynamics during cognition.

Adaptation in human visual cortex as a mechanism for rapid discrimination of aversive stimuli	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						electroencephalography; classical conditioning; emotion; perception; large-scale brain oscillations; adaptation	EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; GAMMA-RESPONSES; STARTLE REFLEX; ATTENTION; TASK; EMOTION; MODULATION	The ability to react rapidly and efficiently to adverse stimuli is crucial for survival. Neuroscience and behavioral studies have converged to show that visual information associated with aversive content is processed quickly and accurately and is associated with rapid amplification of the neural responses. In particular, unpleasant visual information has repeatedly been shown to evoke increased cortical activity during early visual processing between 60 and 120 ms following the onset of a stimulus. However, the nature of these early responses is not well understood. Using neutral versus unpleasant colored pictures, the current report examines the time course of short-term changes in the human visual cortex when a subject is repeatedly exposed to simple grating stimuli in a classical conditioning paradigm. We analyzed changes in amplitude and synchrony of large-scale oscillatory activity across 2 days of testing, which included baseline measurements, 2 conditioning sessions, and a final extinction session. We found a gradual increase in amplitude and synchrony of very early cortical oscillations in the 20-35 Hz range across conditioning sessions, specifically for conditioned stimuli predicting aversive visual events. This increase for conditioned stimuli affected stimulus-locked cortical oscillations at a latency of around 60-90 ms and disappeared during extinction. Our findings suggest that reorganization of neural connectivity on the level of the visual cortex acts to optimize early perception of specific features indicative of emotional relevance.

An efficient, robust and fast method for the offline detection of epileptic seizures in long-term scalp EEG recordings	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; presurgical evaluation; seizure detection; time frequency analysis	ORGANIZING NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM	Objective: A robust and fast algorithm for the offline detection of epileptic seizures in scalp EEG is described. It is aimed for seizure detection with high sensitivity and low number of false detections in long-term EEG data without a priori information. Methods: To capture the characteristic electrographic changes of seizures, we developed an efficient method based on power spectral analysis techniques. The integrated power is calculated in two frequency bands for three multi-channel seizure detection montages (referenced against the average of Fz-Cz-Pz, common average, bipolar) using the same parameters for all montages and all patients taking into account an appropriate artifact rejection. Results: A total of 3248 h of scalp recordings containing 148 seizures from 19 patients were examined. The averaged sensitivity was 90.9% and selectivity (false-positive errors/h, FPH) was 0.29/h of the Fz-Cz-Pz montage; the other montages yielded lower sensitivities but even better selectivity values. Conclusions: Taking into account that the method has been performed in a standardized way with fixed parameters for all patients and montages the obtained values for sensitivity are quite high while the selectivity is acceptably low. The parameters can additionally be tuned to patient specific seizures. It is assumed that this may further improve the seizure detection performance. Significance: The proposed method may enhance the clinical use for the detection of seizures in scalp EEG long-term monitoring during presurgical evaluation.

Characterization of the 7-12 Hz EEG oscillations during immobile waking and REM sleep in behaving rats	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mu rhythm; EEG; spectral analysis; natural life; rat; waking; REM sleep	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MU RHYTHM; WAKEFULNESS; NUCLEUS	Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether the mu rhythm is also seen in the EEG of alert, undrugged and freely moving rats. The mu rhythm is a salient neocortical synchrony with dominant frequency in the 8-13 Hz band, initially recorded over the parietal and frontal areas of humans and subsequently investigated in monkeys and cats using the term sensorimotor rhythm. In the rat, these oscillations have been described only at single-unit level in the trigeminal system or in the cerebellar hemispheres. Methods: In order to identify this rhythm, according to the "functional topography" approach, we examined the shape, spectral content, spatial distribution in power spectra, and functional reactivity. Rats were implanted with multiple electrodes along the antero-posterior axes. Monopolar recordings and simultaneous continuous 24-h video were taken in natural dark-light cycles for 6 consecutive days. Brain mappings based on quantitative spectral analysis were made. Results: Spontaneous well-defined 7-12 Hz EEG oscillations were found during immobile wakefulness and REM sleep. Comparable features of these patterns indicated that they are largely analogous to the mu rhythm. Conclusions: The conservation of mu rhythm in the EEG across mammalian species with different cortical extension suggests that it is functionally important. Significance: Given the great interest aroused by the properties of the mirror neurons, reflected by the mu rhythm, the detailed characterization of this rhythm in rats during natural life may prove useful in prospective evolutionary studies.

Gamma band activity (GBA) offers an adequate tool for studying cortical activation patterns during emotional face information processing. In the present study brain oscillations were analyzed in response to facial expression of emotions. Specifically, GBA modulation was measured when twenty subjects looked at emotional (angry, fearful, happy, and sad faces) or neutral faces in two different conditions: supraliminal (10 ms) vs subliminal (150 ms) stimulation (100 target-mask pairs for each condition). The results showed that both consciousness and significance of the stimulus in terms of arousal can modulate the power synchronization (ERD decrease) during 150-350 time range: an early oscillatory event showed its peak at about 200 ms post-stimulus. GBA was enhanced by supraliminal more than subliminal elaboration, as well as more by high arousal (anger and fear) than low arousal (happiness and sadness) emotions. Finally a left-posterior dominance for conscious elaboration was found, whereas right hemisphere was discriminant in emotional processing of face in comparison with neutral face.

Automated tools are required to characterize these events. We present a new algorithm tuned to detect HFOs from 30 to 85 Hz, and validate it against human expert electroencephalographers. Methods: We randomly selected 28 3-min-single-channel epochs of intracranial EEG (IEEG) from two patients. Three human reviewers and three automated detectors marked all records to identify candidate HFOs. Subsequently, human reviewers verified all markings. Results: A total of 1330 events were collectively identified. The new method presented here achieved 89.7% accuracy against a consensus set of human expert markings. A one-way ANOVA determined no difference between the mean F-measures of the human reviewers and automated algorithm. Human kappa statistics (mean kappa = 0.38) demonstrated marginal identification consistency, primarily due to false negative errors. Conclusions: We present an HFO detector that improves upon existing algorithms, and performs as well as human experts on our test data set. Validation of detector performance must be compared to more than one expert because of interrater variability. Significance: This algorithm will be useful for analyzing large EEG databases to determine the pathophysiological significance of HFO events in human epileptic networks.

Relevant within these are the studies aimed at exploring the physiological substratum of the propagation and reduction of cerebral-namely, corticocortical-communication flows. However, the preferential direction of the information flow between brain hemispheres is as yet largely unknown. It is the aim of the present research to study the communication flows between brain hemispheres, their directionality, and their regional variations across wake-sleep states. A second aim is to investigate the possibility of an association between different brain rhythms and different preferred directions of the information flow. Scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded in 10 normal volunteers from wakefulness to early sleep stages (viz., resting wakefulness, sleep stages 2 and 4, and rapid eye movement [REM] of the first sleep cycle). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), sigma (12-15 Hz), and beta (16-30 Hz). The direction of the interhemispheric information flow was evaluated by computing directed transformation function from these EEG rhythms. Interhemispheric directional flows varied as a function of the state of consciousness (wake and early sleep stages) and in relation to different cerebral areas. Across wake to sleep states, we found that delta and beta rhythms convey interhemispheric signals with opposite directions: preferred right to left hemisphere direction for delta and left to right for beta rhythms. A log correlation confirmed that the trend of low to high EEG frequencies-traditionally associated with an increasing state of vigilance-was significantly related to the direction of the communication flow from the left to right hemisphere. This evidence might open the way for a variety of research lines on different psychophysiological and pathological conditions. a	Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Psicol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Med Interna & Sanita Pubbl, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; Univ Roma, Neurol Clin, Rome, Italy; Osped Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli, Dip Neurosci, AFaR, Rome, Italy; Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fisiol Umana & Farmacol, Rome, Italy; IRCCS Ctr Giovanni Dio Fatebenefratelli, Brescia, Italy		Bertini, M (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Psicol, Via Marsi 78, I-00185 Rome, Italy.	mario.bertini@uniroma1.it	Sanguansri, Luz/B-6630-2011; De Gennaro, Luigi/L-8711-2015; Ferrara, Michele/AAB-7574-2022; Rossini, Paolo M./D-4994-2013; Curcio, Giuseppe/M-1635-2014; Babiloni, Claudio/AAC-5324-2022; Fabrizio, Vecchio/K-7527-2016	Sanguansri, Luz/0000-0003-1908-7604; De Gennaro, Luigi/0000-0003-3613-6631; Ferrara, Michele/0000-0003-2304-7576; Rossini, Paolo M./0000-0003-2665-534X; Babiloni, Claudio/0000-0002-5245-9839; Fabrizio, Vecchio/0000-0002-6004-9522; Curcio, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2248-781X; Moroni, Fabio/0000-0003-0587-0614					41	13	13	0	7	OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC	CARY	JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA	1047-3211			CEREB CORTEX	Cereb.

Neural redundancy and plastic remodelling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modem neurophysiological techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index normal and abnormal brain aging to facilitate non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies. The present review provides a perspective of these issues by assaying different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results with functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, with applications at the individual level also suggested. Integrated approaches utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost and non-invasive evaluation of at-risk populations. Practical implications of the methods are emphasized. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Nineteen normal subjects participated in a sleep-deprivation protocol with recordings of the waking Cz-A1-2 EEG in 36 sessions at 1-hour intervals starting at 10:00 AM. Each session consisted of a 2-minute eyes-closed period, followed by a 4-minute eyes-open period. Electrooculogram, self-ratings (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Visual Analog Scale for Global Vigor), and tympanic temperature were also recorded. Results: Changes in sleepiness and alertness are paralleled by increases in slow eye movements and theta and delta EEG power. The beginning of the rise of delta, theta, and slow eye movement activity corresponded to the nadir of temperature, peaking at TOO AM. Cross-correlational analyses showed that changes in slow eye movements were strictly phase locked to those in slow-frequency EEG bands and in subjective measures. The comparison of time intervals that were equivalent with respect to circadian phase confirms the effects of the increased sleepiness on slow eye movement activity and on the other measures. The temporal concordance of the different physiologic and subjective measures is also reflected in the individual time courses. Individual and group analyses converged in indicating that slow eye movements can be considered reliable indexes of sleepiness but only in the eyes-closed condition. Conclusions: Results suggest that subjective and EEG changes associated with higher sleepiness are paralleled by an increase in slow eye movement activity, but this relationship exists almost exclusively with the eyes closed. Hence, its use in practical and operational contexts seems limited.

This possibility has generated interest in experiments aiming to improve deficits in clinical settings, as well as deficits in the cognitive domain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the on-line effects of low frequency (I Hz) TMS on the EEG oscillatory activity in the healthy human brain, focusing particularly on the outcome of these modulatory effects in relation to the duration of the TMS stimulation. To this end, we used the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) approach to determine the patterns of oscillatory activity during two consecutive trains of sham and real TMS. Each train of stimulation was delivered to the left primary motor cortex (MI) of healthy subjects over a period of 10 min, while EEG rhythms were simultaneously recorded. Results indicated that TMS induced an increase in the power of brain rhythms that was related to the period of the stimulation, i.e. the synchronization of the a band increased with the duration of the stimulation, and this increase was inversely correlated with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude. In conclusion, low frequency TMS over primary motor cortex induces a synchronization of the background oscillatory activity on the stimulated region. This induced modulation in brain oscillations seems to increase coherently with the duration of stimulation, suggesting that TMS effects may involve short-term modification of the neural circuitry sustaining MEPs characteristics.

A robust minimum variance beamforming approach for the removal of the eye-blink artifacts from EEGs	2007 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-16	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 22-26, 2007	Lyon, FRANCE	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			EOG ARTIFACTS	In this paper a novel scheme for the removal of eye-blink (EB) artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on the robust minimum variance beamformer (RMVB) is proposed. In this method, in order to remove the artifact, the RMVB is provided with a priori information, i.e., an estimation of the steering vector corresponding to the point source EB artifact. The artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently reconstructed by deflation. The a priori knowledge, namely the vector corresponding to the spatial distribution of the EB factor, is identified using a novel space-time-frequency-time/segment (STF-TS) model of EEGs, provided by a four-way parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the EB artifact from raw EEG measurements.

J	Celka, P				Celka, Patrick			Statistical analysis of the phase-locking value	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						coherence time; multicomponent signal; phaselocking value; synchronization	SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG	The phase-locking value (PLV) is an important measure of synchronization when studying biosignals and especially electrical brain activities. Because the physical interpretation of the instantaneous phase of broadband signals leads to difficulties, most applications using the PLV deal with narrowband signals. The paper presents a statistical analysis of the PLV under the influence of Gaussian, Uniform and Laplace noise when added to the instantaneous phases and frequencies of mono- and two-component signals. We derive analytical expressions for the PLV values for these conditions and show that the PLV is rapidly dropping with increasing noise variance: broadening the frequency spectrum. We show that the noise influence on the instantaneous frequency is much more pronounced than on the instantaneous phase. We also introduce the concept of PLV-coherence time by analogy to optical coherence. Finally, we show that two signals with identical factitious instantaneous frequency as found in multicomponent signals can be phase locked leading to possible wrong interpretations of the PLV.

Here, measures of synchronization (power, coherence) and nonlinear cross-frequency phase coupling (m:n phase locking measured with bicoherence and cross-bicoherence) were computed on 62-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data during a paradigm in which unexpected, highly-deviant, novel sounds were randomly intermixed with frequent standard and infrequent target tones. Low frequency resolution analyses showed no significant changes in phase coupling for any stimulus type, though significant changes in power and synchrony did occur. High frequency resolution analyses, on the other hand, showed significant differences in phase coupling, but only for novel sounds compared to standard tones. Novel sounds elicited increased power and coherence in the delta band together with m:n phase locking (bicoherence) of delta:theta (1:3) and delta:alpha (1:4) rhythms in widespread fronto-central, right parietal, temporal, and occipital regions, Cross-bicoherence revealed that globally synchronized delta oscillations were phase coupled to theta oscillations in central regions and to alpha oscillations in right parietal and posterior regions. These results suggest that globally synchronized low frequency oscillations with phase coupling to more localized higher frequency oscillations provide a neural mechanism for the orienting response.

To disentangle the cortical activation patterns of warming and heating, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the electroencephalograph ic 10 and 20 Hz oscillations with the time resolution of hundreds of milliseconds. Sixty heat (from 32 to 50.5 degrees C, rate of change 6 degrees C/s) and warm (from 32 to 42 degrees C, 6 degrees C/s) stimuli were applied on the right thenar using contact thermode. EEG was recorded from 111 scalp electrodes in 12 healthy subjects, and analyzed using event-related desynchronization and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography methods. During warming, the amplitudes of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations over the contralateral primary sensorimotor (SI/MI) and premotor cortices decreased, and the amplitude of 20 Hz oscillations in the anterior cingulate and ipsilateral premotor cortex increased. Heating was associated with additional profound amplitude decreases of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations over SI/MI and premotor cortex, and by amplitude increase of 20 Hz oscillations originating in the posterior cingulate cortex. Results suggest biphasic amplitude changes of the cortical oscillations during ramp increase of temperature attributable to the periods of warming and heating. The amplitude decreases of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations in SI/MI and premotor cortex possibly aid in preparation of motor withdrawal reaction in an event that temperature should reach intolerable pain. Synchronization of the 20 Hz oscillations in the anterior and especially in the posterior cingulate cortex may aid suppression of unwanted movements. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The EEG was recorded in 12 mild AD patients and in an age-matched healthy control group (24 subjects) in both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Frequency spectra, Omega-complexity and Synchronization likelihood were calculated on the data. In the patients a significant decrease of the relative alpha and increase of the theta power were found. Remarkably increased Omega-complexity and lower Synchronization likelihood were observed in AD in the 0.5-25 Hz frequency ranges. It is concluded that both spectral- and EEG-complexity changes can be found already in the early stage of AD in a wide frequency range. Application of conventional EEG analysis methods in combination with quantification of EEG-complexity may improve the chances of early diagnosis of AD. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This experimental design allowed us to examine the effects of associative learning, presentation of the conditioning stimuli, and presentation of the unconditioned stimuli on sleep-wake states. During the 24 hr after training, fear-conditioned mice had approximately 1 hr more of nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and less wakefulness than mice receiving exposure to conditioning stimuli or immediate shock treatment. Mice receiving conditioning stimuli had more delta power during NREM sleep, whereas mice receiving fear conditioning had less theta power during rapid-eye-movement sleep. These results demonstrate that a single trial of fear conditioning alters sleep-wake states and EEG oscillations over a 24-hr period, supporting the idea that sleep is modified by experience and that such changes in sleep-wake states and EEG oscillations may play a role in memory consolidation.

Recent work from our group and others suggests that high-frequency epileptic oscillations (HFEOs) arise from brain regions constituting epileptic networks, and may be important to seizure generation. HFEOs are brief 50-500 Hz pathologic events measured in intracranial field and unit recordings in patients with refractory epilepsy. They are challenging to detect due to low signal to noise ratio, and because they occur in multiple channels with great frequency. Their morphology is also variable and changes with distance from intracranial electrode contacts, which are sparsely placed for patient safety. Thus reliable, automated methods to detect HFEOs are required to localize and track seizure generation in epileptic networks. We present a novel method for mapping the temporal evolution of these oscillations in human epileptic networks. The technique combines a particle swarm optimization algorithm with a neural network to create features that robustly detect and track HFEOs in human intracranial EEG (IEEG) recordings. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on IEEG data from six patients, one pediatric and five adult, and compare it to an existing method for detecting high-frequency oscillations.

To investigate the potential neurophysiological correlates of such deficits we compared QEEG power between 12 participants with aMCI and 12 healthy matched controls. EEG was acquired during performance of a modified Sternberg word recognition task with low and high memory load conditions. While recognition accuracy of aMCI participants was lower than that of controls, this difference was not significant. Nevertheless the aMCI group demonstrated significantly lower theta power at a number of electrode sites and significant correlations were observed between power at these sites and neuropsychological assessment scores. Furthermore in the aMCI sample only, theta power was significantly lower under high versus low memory load. Given current interpretations of the neural generator(s), as well as the role(s), of theta oscillations in cognitive processes, the present data indicate that aMCI may be associated with disruptions in the operation of neurocognitive networks (e.g., MTL-neocortical), particularly under high cognitive load.

Measuring directional coupling between EEG sources	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Directional coupling; EEG sources; Multivariate Autoregressive Model (MVAR); Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Alpha rhythm	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; INFORMATION-FLOW; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; CAUSAL RELATIONS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; BRAIN; COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MODEL	Directional connectivity in the brain has been typically computed between scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, neglecting the fact that correlations between scalp measurements are partly caused by electrical conduction through the head volume. Although recently proposed techniques are able to identify causality relationships between EEG sources rather than between recording sites, most of them need a priori assumptions about the cerebral regions involved in the EEG generation. We present a novel methodology based on multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) able to determine the temporal activation of the intracerebral EEG sources as well as their approximate locations. The direction of synaptic flow between these EEG sources is then estimated using the directed transfer function (DTF), and the significance of directional coupling strength evaluated with surrogated data. The reliability of this approach was assessed with simulations manipulating the number of data samples, the depth and orientation of the equivalent source dipoles, the presence of different noise sources, and the violation of the non-Gaussianity assumption inherent to the proposed technique. The simulations showed the superior accuracy of the proposed approach over other traditional techniques in most tested scenarios. Its validity was also evaluated analyzing the generation mechanisms of the EEG-alpha rhythm recorded from 20 volunteers under resting conditions. Results suggested that the major generation mechanism underlying EEG-alpha oscillations consists of a strong bidirectional feedback between thalamus and cuneus. The precuneus also seemed to actively participate in the generation of the alpha rhythm although it did not exert a significant causal influence neither on the thalamus nor on the cuneus. All together, these results suggest that the proposed methodology is a promising non-invasive approach for studying directional coupling between mutually interconnected neural populations.

The SD wave was accompanied by significant decrease in the power of the EEG gamma band (37-47 Hz) in all observed cortical areas. A curve of decline of gamma activity power had distinct fore and back fronts, so the time of SD appearance in different cortex areas and it's spread succession could be well determined. In the long-term experiments SD waves were characterized by normal (i.e. successive) spread through the cortex mainly in initial three-four experiments. In the subsequent tests latency of SD waves in different cortex areas changed and disturbance of propagation became obvious. Sometimes SD arose rapidly (due 0.5-2 min) on the whole dorsal neocortical surface, when the standard injection of the KCl was done. In the most of experiments the delay of the SD wave appearance was prolonged till 6-9 min or no SD wave occur at some cortical regions. C, Week epileptiform activity could conduct abnormalities in the SD. In many instances electrophysiological signs of the cortical excitability changes were absent. However the modified spatial SD characteristic and spontaneous occurrence of the repeated. SD waves indicated the increased functional inhomogeneities of the neighboring cortical areas. So, spectral EEG analysis in awake rabbits made it possible to characterize the SD wave both in case of its normal propagation through the cortex and in unusual forms of this reaction.	[Korolleva, V.

Two tests were presented: (1) creation of many visual images on the basis of two simple geometrical figures (the model of divergent thinking) and (2) classification of a figure element with one of the offered standard samples (convergent thinking). The number of created images or correctly classified elements for five minutes served a criterion of performance productivity. It was found that performance of the divergent test with high productivity (as compared to low productivity) was characterized by a greater increase in non-linear interactions between the cortical potentials, especially in the axis right frontal - left occipital areas. At the same time, under conditions of high productivity, the number of active narrow-frequency spectral-coherent EEG bands increased. The data confirm the notion of neurophysiological organization of creative processes, according to which creative processes require the intensification of retrieval operations (both conscious and unconscious), based on extensive interhemispheric interaction and involvement of a system of EEG coherent structures oscillating with different frequencies.

This state called failed-back surgery syndrome (FBSS) cannot be effectively treated by pharmacotherapy. Electric stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord is applied to relieve the pain. According to the medical hypothesis, oscillatory activity, which might be related to the analgesic effects, may occur in the cortex during the stimulation. To confirm the presence of the SCS induced oscillations, a new method of detection was designed for this purpose. The analysis of EEG data was performed using power spectral density, confidence intervals, visualization and group statistic for its verification. Parameters of the method were experimentally optimized to maximize its reliability. During ongoing SCS, statistically significant changes were detected and localized at the stimulation frequency, and/or its subharmonic or zipper harmonic over central midline electrodes in eight patients.

The head of 15 healthy male subjects was unilaterally exposed for 30 min prior to sleep to a pulse-modulated EMF (GSM handset like signal) with a 10 g-averaged peak spatial specific absorption rate of (1) 0.2 W kg(-1), (2) 5 W kg(-1), or (3) sham exposed in a double-blind, crossover design. During exposure, subjects performed two series of three computerized cognitive tasks, each presented in a fixed order [simple reaction time task, two-choice reaction time task (CRT), 1-, 2-, 3-back task]. Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance.

The aim of this study was to predict behavioral time from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded by the same electrodes. LFPs reflect mainly postsynaptic potentials. Since LFPs integrate activity of many neurons surrounding the electrode, they can contain information about motor preparation and execution, and the temporal intervals involved in the motor task. In particular, LFP oscillations that are modulated during movements have been reported in monkey motor cortex. In our experiment, the monkeys performed self paced movements of their hands. They had to withhold movements for at least 2.5s to receive a reward. This task was accompanied by modulations of the LFP frequency in the 10-20 Hz range. Nonlinear analysis methods approximate entropy (ApEn), correlation dimension (CD), and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) - were used for quantify complexity (ApEn), dimensional dynamics (CD), and chaotic dynamics (LLE) in the LFP activity. ApEn and CD were modulated during movements. ApEn and CD were higher in task periods preceding movement onset. LLE also showed significant modulations: it was lower during the delay period of the task. Thus, nonlinear features of LFPs are correlated with motor timing. We suggest using nonlinear analyses of LFPs as a supplement of algorithms based on neuronal data in the design of brain-machine interfaces.	[Lebedev, M.; Nicolelis, M. A.

Spindle oscillations are known to be related to the sedative actions of the reticular thalamic nucleus with links to thalamocortical neurons. This study was designed to examine the effect of ketamine on the spindle oscillations to understand the simultaneous sedative effect and EEG activation that occurs with ketamine, by comparing the EEG in emergence. Methods Anesthesia was induced with propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system (3.5 mu g/ml). Seventeen patients, scheduled for non-cranial surgery under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia, were randomly divided into two groups: (i) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol alone (n = 8) and (ii) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol and intravenously administered ketamine (n = 9). The EEG was continuously monitored and EEG indices and power spectra were determined. Results Propofol alone caused the alpha-peaks of the power spectra to occur at an average frequency of 10.4 +/- 0.9 Hz; the addition of ketamine shifted the peaks to higher frequencies of 15.1 +/- 1.4 Hz (P < 0.05). On the other hand, when the EEG was activated by discontinuation of propofol, the corresponding alpha-peaks disappeared. Conclusions Ketamine increased the frequencies of alpha-spindle waves induced by propofol, but did not block their formations. The phenomena have the possibility to underlie the cooperative effect between propofol and ketamine concerning sedation and anesthesia.

Methods: Interictal EEG activity in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (hippocampus, entorhinal. cortex and amygdala) was obtained from intracerebral. recordings performed in 21 patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE group). This group was compared with a "control" group of patients (non-MTLE group) in whom depth-EEG recordings of MTL show that seizures did not start from the MTL. Comparison criteria were based on spectral properties and statistical coupling (nonlinear correlation coefficient h 2) of MTL signals. Results: Power spectral. density analysis showed a significant decrease in the theta frequency sub-band (p = 0.01) in the MTLE group. Nonlinear correlation (h(2)) vatues were found to be higher in the MTLE group than in the NMTLE group to (P = 0.0014). This effect was significant for theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies. Correlation values were not correlated with the frequency of interictal spikes (IS) and significant differences between groups were stilt measureable even when spikes were suppressed from analyzed EEG periods. Discussion: This study shows that, during the interictal. state, the EZ in MTLE is characterized by a decrease of oscillations in the theta sub-band and by a general increase of signal. interdependencies. This last finding suggests that the EZ is characterized by network of neuronal assemblies with a reinforced functional connectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective is to predict left and right movements and accelerate the communication in a brain-computer interface (BCT). The features are attained by localizing the fast Fourier transformations (FFT) of the signals to specific windows localized in time. An interpolation approach is applied to reduce intra-class variations by smoothing the spectra for each signal. Some important parameters such as the overlaps of the FFT window, the points of interpolation during feature extraction are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The time-frequency features are classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The approach achieves a good performance when quantified by classification accuracy (CA) rate, and has the potential to improve the performance of a brain-control based meal assistance system.

Thirty-nine subjects were divided into two groups. One group was presented with reward, another one with punishment cues. The subjects also filled out the Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales. In high Drive scorers, as compared to low Drive scorers, the increase of theta and HFO in the frontal cortical area was higher in the reward and lower in the punishment situation. Increase of theta-gamma coupling was shown in low Drive subjects in the punishment and in high Drive subjects in the reward situation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intravenous valproate aborts glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks: a clinical and quantitative EEG study	CEPHALALGIA			English	Article						EEG; glyceryltrinitrate; migraine; sodium valproate	SODIUM VALPROATE; HEADACHE; PROPHYLAXIS; TRIAL	We evaluated EEG changes and pain relief in migraineurs with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-induced attacks treated with intravenous sodium valproate (iSVP). EEG frequency analysis was performed in 45 migraineurs without aura and in 19 controls at baseline, at the time of maximum GTN-induced headache, and 30 min after 300 mg iSVP. Nineteen migraineurs presented early specific headache (migraine identical to spontaneous attacks; MSp) and 26 presented early non-specific headache (MnSp). During attacks in MSp there was an increase of theta [16.6% (14.8-19.3) to 19.4% (17.4-22.1), P = 0.02] and delta activity [3.6% (3.1-4.4) to 5.4% (3.9-6.5), P = 0.009], whereas there was no decrease in alpha [41.4% (36.2-45.1) to 39.7% (34.7-44.8)] or beta activity [37.6% (34.7-40.3) to 35.1% (33.5-38.8)]. iSVP reduced migraine from severe/moderate to mild/no pain in 17 (90%) MSp patients, and was associated with reversion of the slow rhythmic activity to baseline levels [theta 16.9% (14.6-18.9); delta 3.2% (3-4.1)]. There was no change in EEG frequency activity after administration of GTN or iSVP in controls and in MnSp. iSVP is well tolerated and effective in treating GTN-induced migraine in migraineurs without aura, and appears to restore the disturbances of cortical electrogenesis associated with these attacks.

The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential (ERP) modulation that distinguishes losses from wins, but little is known about the effects of outcome probability on these ERP responses. Further, little is known about the frequency characteristics of feedback processing, for example, event-related oscillations and phase synchronizations. Here, we report an EEG experiment designed to address these issues. Subjects engaged in a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which we manipulated, across blocks, the probability of winning and losing to each of two possible decision options. Behaviorally, all subjects quickly adapted their decision-making to maximize rewards. ERP analyses revealed that the probability of reward modulated neural responses to wins, but not to losses. This was seen both across blocks as well as within blocks, as learning progressed. Frequency decomposition via complex wavelets revealed that EEG responses to losses, compared to wins, were associated with enhanced power and phase coherence in the theta frequency band. As in the ERP analyses, power and phase coherence values following wins but not losses were modulated by reward probability. Some findings between ERP and frequency analyses diverged, suggesting that these analytic approaches provide complementary insights into neural processing. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms of feedback processing may differ between wins and losses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ERC estimates the direction, intensity, spectral content, and temporal course of brain activity propagation within a cortical network. ERC is based upon the short-time directed transfer function (SDTF), which is measured in short EEG epochs during multiple trials of a cognitive task, as well as the direct directed transfer function (dDTF), which distinguishes direct interactions between brain regions from indirect interactions via brain regions. ERC uses new statistical methods for comparing estimates of causal interactions during prestimulus "baseline" epochs and during poststimulus "activated" epochs in order to estimate event-related increases and decreases in the functional interactions between cortical network components during cognitive tasks. The utility of the ERC approach is demonstrated through its application to human electrocorticographic recordings (ECoG) of a simple language task. ERC analyses of these ECoG recordings reveal frequency-dependent interactions, particularly in high gamma (>60 Hz) frequencies, between brain regions known to participate in the recorded language task, and the temporal evolution of these interactions is consistent with the putative processing stages of this task. The method may be a useful tool for investigating the dynamics of causal interactions between various brain regions during cognitive task performance.

Hippocampal theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity has been correlated with sensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and memory functions. The present study was aimed at determining if theta is also generated locally within the parasubiculum versus volume conducted from adjacent structures. In urethan-anesthetized rats, the phase-reversal of theta activity between superficial and deep layers of the parasubiculum was demonstrated using differential recordings from movable bipolar electrodes that eliminate the influence of volume-conducted activity. Parasubicular theta was abolished by atropine, and was in phase with theta in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region. Whole cell current-clamp recordings in brain slices were then used to determine if parasubicular theta may be generated in part by membrane potential oscillations in layer II neurons. Membrane potential oscillations occurred in most layer II neurons, including four putative interneurons, when cells were held at near-threshold voltages using current injection. The frequency of oscillations increased from 3.2 to 6.1 Hz when bath temperature was raised from 22 to 32 degrees C, and oscillations persisted in the presence of blockers of fast ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. Oscillations are therefore likely generated by intrinsic, voltage-dependent ionic conductances. These results indicate that theta field activity is generated locally within the parasubiculum and that intrinsic membrane potential oscillations, synchronized by local inhibitory inputs, may contribute to the generation of this activity.

The occurrence of these phenomena seems to be a salient characteristic of the healthy human brain and alterations in different pathologies has been described. Here we show how the filtering stages implemented in the systems for digital EEG influence the estimation of the DFA parameters used to characterize the brain signals. In consequence, we conclude that it is important to consider these filtering effects before interpreting the results obtained from digital EEG recordings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Existence and stability of limit cycles in a macroscopic neuronal population model	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						human EEG; mathematical modelling; macroscopic population model; normal forms; global stability; limit cycle oscillations; epilepsy	ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; WAVES	We present rigorous results concerning the existence and stability of limit cycles in a macroscopic model of neuronal activity. The specific model we consider is developed from the Ki set methodology, popularized by Walter Freeman. In particular we focus on a specific reduction of the KII sets, denoted RKII sets. We analyse the unfolding of supercritical Hopf bifurcations via consideration of the normal forms and centre manifold reductions. Subsequently we analyse the global stability of limit cycles on a region of parameter space and this is achieved by applying a new methodology termed Global Analysis of Piecewise Linear Systems. The analysis presented may also be used to consider coupled systems of this type. A number of macroscopic mean-field approaches to modelling human EEG may be considered as coupled RKII networks. Hence developing a theoretical understanding of the onset of oscillations in models of this type has important implications in clinical neuroscience, as limit cycle oscillations have been demonstrated to be critical in the onset of certain types of epilepsy.

Phase-locking within human mediotemporal lobe predicts memory formation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Memory; Rhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Intracranial EEG; Phase-locking	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; WORD RECOGNITION; HIPPOCAMPAL; POTENTIALS; ALPHA; RESET	Lesion and imaging studies have demonstrated that encoding of declarative memories, i.e. consciously accessible events and facts, is supported by processes within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus. two substructures of the mediotemporal lobe (MR). Successful memory, formation has, for instance been shown, to be accompanied by the rhinal N400 component, followed by a hippocampal positivity, as well as by transient rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization. However, it has been an open question, which mediotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) measures predict memory formation most accurately. Therefore, we analyzed and compared the association of different mediotemporal EEG measures with successful memory formation. EEG characteristics were extracted from intracranial rhinal and hippocampal depth recordings in 31 epilepsy patients performing a Continuous Word recognition paradigm. Classical event-related potential measures, rhinal-hippocampal synchronization, as well as inter-trial phase-locking and power changes within rhinal cortex and hippocampus were evaluated. We found that inter-trial phase-locking is superior to other EEG measures in predicting subsequent memory. This means that memory formation is related to the precise timing of EEG phases within the MTL with respect to stimulus onset. In particular, early rhinal and hippocampal phase-locking in the alpha/beta range reaching its Maximum already between 100 and 300 ms after stimulus onset appears to be a precursor of successful memory formation. Our data Suggest that early mediotemporal phase adjustments constitute a relevant mechanism underlying declarative memory encoding. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this method, in order to remove the artifact, the source extraction algorithm is provided with an estimation of the column of the mixing matrix corresponding to the point source eye-blink artifact. The eye-blink source is first extracted and then cleaned, artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently reconstructed by a deflation method. The a priori knowledge, namely, the vector, corresponding to the spatial distribution of the eye-blink factor, is identified by fitting a space-time-frequency (STF) model to the EEG measurements using the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis method. Hence, we call the BSE approach semiblind signal extraction (SBSE). This approach introduces the possibility of incorporating PARAFAC within the blind source extraction framework for single trial EEG processing applications and the respected formulations. Moreover, aiming at extracting the eye-blink artifact, it exploits the spatial as well as temporal prior information during the extraction procedure. Experiments on synthetic data and real EEG measurements confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the eye-blink artifact from raw EEG measurements.

Disturbance of consciousness, epilepsia, dementia, cerebrovascular disease and cerebral infarction are included as a useful clinical example of EEG inspection. It is thought that it leads to the early detection and treatment of the above disease by analyzing EEG. However, there is a possibility that artifact may mix in EEG. When the brain wave is measured, the artifact by the heart beat, the blink, muscle noise, line noise, and the eye movement may be contained. The data of the part is rounded down when the characteristic of artifact (the peak of amplitude, frequency component, variance, and gradient) exceed a decided threshold and the recurrent part of other input signals (EOG, EMG, and ECG) is subtracted from measurements, etc. as artifact removal method. And so this study considers the artifact removal that uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA). It doesn't need other input signals. ICA is a statistical method that is useful for removing artifacts. ICA has various algorithms. FastICA is used in this study. FastICA has the best overall performance in terms of both separation quality and computation times. This study uses and simulates ICA to the measured brain waves. Future work is how to apply the separated brain waves.

Computational models have succeeded in proposing plausible mechanisms to explain the sudden emergence of hypersynchronized oscillations at similar to 3Hz (or 5-10 Hz in some species), which are associated with 'spikeand-wave' complexes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The underlying mechanisms of such seizures involve thalamocortical loops, the particular oscillatory properties of thalamic neurons and the particular biophysical properties of some receptor types (such as the GABA(B) receptor). Here, we overview these mechanisms step by step, starting from the genesis of hypersynchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. We next consider how cortical circuits can generate spike-and-wave EEG patterns. These mechanisms are then merged together in thalamocortical loops, where we emphasize the central role played by the 'feedback' projections from cortex to thalamus. If for some reason the corticothalamic feedback becomes too strong, thalamic circuits can switch to a slower and hypersynchronized oscillatory mode, which in turn entrains the whole thalamocortical system into hypersynchronized oscillations with spike-and-wave EEG patterns. We suggest that the key to explain absence seizures is this switching mechanism of thalamic circuits, induced by exceedingly strong corticothalamic feedback. Such a switch was identified in experiments in vitro, in which oscillatory properties could be controlled by stimulating corticothalamic fibers. According to this mechanism, absence seizures result from anomalously high cortical excitability with a physiologically intact thalamus.

Investigations of human EEG response to viewing fractal patterns	PERCEPTION			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY; ATTENTION; DIMENSION; SCENES	Owing to the prevalence of fractal patterns in natural scenery and their growing impact on cultures around the world, fractals constitute a common feature of our daily visual experiences, raising an important question: what responses do fractals induce in the observer? We monitored subjects' EEG while they were viewing fractals with different fractal dimensions, and the results show that significant effects could be found in the EEG even by employing relatively simple silhouette images. Patterns with a fractal dimension of 1.3 elicited the most interesting EEG, with the highest alpha in the frontal lobes but also the highest beta in the parietal area, pointing to a complicated interplay between different parts of the brain when experiencing this pattern.

Electroencephalographic and respiratory activities during acute intermittent hypoxia in anesthetized rats	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Pneumology	MAY 10-12, 2007	Wuppertal, GERMANY			EEG; intermittent hypoxia; respiratory activity	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA; HALOTHANE; FREQUENCY; SLEEP	Cortical activity and respiratory responses to intermittent hypoxia were studied in anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats. Respiratory responses to hypoxic exposure consisted of stimulation of phrenic and hypoglossal activity and a subsequent decline of the activity up to apnea. The respiratory response to hypoxia was accompanied by a gradual decrement of the total power of EEG. Relative EEG power increased in the delta frequency range and decreased in the remaining frequency ranges. During hypoxic bradypnea or apnea, the total power of EEG strongly diminished or ceased. Each episode of hypoxia caused similar respiratory and cortical effects. However, in comparison with the baseline level, the total power of EEG decreased gradually while the power of the delta frequency range increased in subsequent hypoxic episodes. EEG activity after the last hypoxic exposure recovered within 40-60 min. We conclude that hypoxia initially induces modest changes in the cortical activity that grow with the severity of hypoxia. The persistence of changes in EEG activity following intermittent hypoxia may contribute to disorders present in the sleep apnea syndrome.

Four different movements were performed: extension, flexion, pronation and supination. Two-class single trial classification was performed on six possible combinations of two movements (extension-flexion, extension-supination, extension-pronation, flexion-supination, flexion-pronation, pronation-supination). Both real and imaginary movements were analysed. The analysis was done in the joint time-frequency domain using the Gabor transform. Feature selection was based on the Davis-Bouldin Index (DBI) and feature classification was based on Elman's recurrent neural networks (ENN). The best classification results, near 80% true positive rate, for imaginary movements were achieved for discrimination between extension and any other type of movement. The experiments were run with 10 able-bodied subjects. For some subjects, real movement classification rates higher than 80% were achieved for any combination of movements, though not simultaneously for all six combinations of movements. For classification of the imaginary movements, the results suggest that the type of movement and frequency band play an important role. Unexpectedly, the delta band was found to carry significant class-related information.

B.; Mesbah, Mostefa; Boashash, Boualem			Time-frequency analysis of heart rate variability for neonatal seizure detection	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; ABNORMALITIES	There are a number of automatic techniques available for detecting epileptic seizures using solely electroencephalogram ( EEG), which has been the primary diagnosis tool in newborns. The electrocardiogram ( ECG) has been much neglected in automatic seizure detection. Changes in heart rate and ECG rhythm were previously linked to seizure in case of adult humans and animals. However, little is known about heart rate variability (HRV) changes in human neonate during seizure. In this paper, we assess the suitability of HRV as a tool for seizure detection in newborns. The features of HRV in the low-frequency band (LF: 0.03-0.07 Hz), mid-frequency band (MF: 0.07-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency band (HF: 0.15-0.6 Hz) have been obtained by means of the time-frequency distribution (TFD). Results of ongoing time-frequency (TF) research are presented. Based on our preliminary results, the first conditional moment of HRV which is the mean/central frequency in the LF band and the variance in the HF band can be used as a good feature to discriminate the newborn seizure from the nonseizure.

Regional analysis of spontaneous MEG rhythms in patients with Alzheimer's disease using spectral entropies	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						magnetoencephalogram; time-frequency distribution; Shannon spectral entropy; Tsallis spectral entropy; Renyi spectral entropy	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; BRAIN-INJURY; EEG SIGNALS; TASK-FORCE; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Ageing is the greatest known risk factor for this disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of AD is expected to increase in western countries due to the rise in life expectancy. Nowadays, a low diagnosis accuracy is reached, but an early and accurate identification of AD should be attempted. In this sense, only a few studies have focused on the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) AD patterns. This work represents a new effort to explore the ability of three entropies from information theory to discriminate between spontaneous MEG rhythms from 20 AD patients and 21 controls. The Shannon (SSE), Tsallis (TSE), and Renyi (RSE) spectral entropies were calculated from the time-frequency distribution of the power spectral density (PSD). The entropies provided statistically significant lower values for AD patients than for controls in all brain regions (p < 0.0005). This fact suggests a significant loss of irregularity in AD patients' MEG activity. Maximal accuracy of 87.8% was achieved by both the TSE and RSE (90.0%, sensitivity; 85.7%, specificity). The statistically significant results obtained by both the extensive (SSE and RSE) and non-extensive (TSE) spectral entropies suggest that AD could disturb long and short-range interactions causing an abnormal brain function.

In a recent case report it was demonstrated that alpha frequency oscillations appear in PPN after the administration of levodopa in PD, indicating a possible physiological role of these oscillations. Here we confirm this result and investigate the functional connectivity and reactivity of subcortical alpha activity by recording UP activity from the PPN area and EEG in six patients with PD while at rest and in four of them while they performed ipsi- and contralateral self-paced joystick movements. Levodopa strongly promoted 7-11 Hz oscillatory synchronization in the region of PPN and coupling of this activity with similar activity in the cortical EEG. Such coupling was bidirectional. Moreover, the 7-11 Hz oscillatory synchronization in the PPN area increased about 3 s prior to self-paced movements, but only following levodopa treatment. These findings suggest that alpha oscillations in the PPN area may represent a physiological pattern of activity. The subcortical oscillations are coupled to cortical alpha activity and possibly allied to motor related attentional processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

External manipulation in its classic sense may suspend the resting state, and hence the object of interest will evade. Naturally, unless in a final and irreversible state, biological rest will always be an endogenously dynamic process. Combining two modalities, electroence-phalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to simultaneously measure the brain's activity from two angles, one can be chosen to be interpreted as the independent variable and the other as the dependent variable, and without external manipulation the brain's spontaneous dynamics can be studied. The EEG, for example, observes endogenous modulations of vigilance and detects spontaneous events such as sleep spindles or epileptic discharges and can be used as the independent variable, i.e., to form a regressor to interrogate the fMRI data (dependent variable). The opposite is possible as well, and data fusion attempts try using all data both as dependent and independent variables at the same time. This review limits itself to an exemplary discussion of simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies in humans, and among a variety of proposed resting state networks only discusses a few, especially those for which non-resting state literature has proposed a functional meaning: the "default mode" network and an attentional network. It will be shown that one EEG feature can correlate with different fMRI activation maps and that a single resting state network may be associated with a variety of EEG patterns giving insight into the function of different resting states and the relationship between the two modalities in themselves.

Only subtle differences between languages were expected, since cognates have been assumed to have shared conceptual representations in the bilingual memory. Encoding elicited theta and alpha frequency ERS and beta frequency ERD responses in both languages. Retrieval elicited theta ERS and alpha and beta ERD responses. Some statistically significant differences between encoding and retrieval in Finnish versus Swedish emerged: greater theta and alpha ERS responses were observed during encoding in Swedish than during encoding in Finnish. During between-language retrieval, later-appearing theta ERS and alpha ERD responses were elicited as compared to within-language retrieval. These delayed oscillatory responses might reflect the involvement of central executive attentional functions in relation to language switching. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: We studied retrospectively 39 consecutive patients with surgically proven HS-MTLE. All had both interictal and ictal SPECTs with the tracer injection during a complex partial seizure (CPS) typical of MTLE semiology. According to initial ictal discharge (IID) frequency on scalp EEG, two lateralizing patterns were identified: (a) a sustained regular 5- to 9-Hz rhythm with a restricted temporal or subtemporal distribution (group 1); and (b) an irregular 2- to 5-Hz rhythm with a widespread distribution (group 2). We performed group analysis by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of paired ictal-interictal SPECTs to identify regions of significant ictal hyperperfusion and compared clinical characteristics, tracer-injection time, semiology, pathologic HS grade, and surgical outcome between two groups. Results: Of the 39 patients, 19 patients (10 males, nine right HS) were designated as group 1, and the remaining 20 patients (eight males, seven right HS), group 2. Group 1 showed hyperperfusion mainly confined to the ipsilateral temporal lobe, whereas group 2 showed widespread hyperperfusion in the extratemporal structures such as ipsilateral basal ganglia, brainstem, and bilateral thalamus, in addition to the ipsilateral temporal lobe. No significant difference was found between two groups in clinical characteristics, injection time, pathologic HS grade, and surgical outcome. Among semiologic features, dystonic limb posturing was more frequently observed in group 2 (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Scalp EEG IID frequency in HS-MTLE can be an important determining factor of ictal hyperperfusion patterns. The lack of difference in surgical outcome between two groups implies that different hyperperfusion patterns, according to their IID frequencies, reflect only preferential pathways of ictal propagation rather than intrinsic epileptogenic region.

Electrophysiological signatures of resting state networks in the human brain	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						brain rhythms; multimodal imaging; resting fluctuations	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE; ALPHA-RHYTHM; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; FMRI; EEG	Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have documented a dynamic baseline of intrinsic (not stimulus- or task-evoked) brain activity during resting wakefulness. This baseline is characterized by slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of functional imaging signals that are topographically organized in discrete brain networks, and by much faster (1-80 Hz) electrical oscillations. To investigate the relationship between hemodynamic and electrical oscillations, we have adopted a completely data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneous electro-encephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using independent component analysis on the fMRI data, we identified six widely distributed resting state networks. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations associated with each network were correlated with the EEG power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. Each functional network was characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature that involved the combination of different brain rhythms. Moreover, the joint EEG/fMRI analysis afforded a finer physiological fractionation of brain networks in the resting human brain. This result supports for the first time in humans the coalescence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks as suggested by biophysical studies.

In such cases, relevant behaviors can occur at different times during free-running recordings and should be put together by the time of analysis. Here, we developed a MATLAB semi-automated toolbox to quantitatively analyze the temporal progression of brain oscillatory activity in multiple free-running LFP recordings obtained during spontaneous behaviors. The algorithm works by selecting UP epochs at user-defined onset times (locked to behavior, drug injection time, etc.), calculates their time-frequency spectra, detects long-lasting oscillatory events and calculates linear coherence between pair of electrodes. As output, it generates several table-like text and tiff image files, besides group descriptive statistics. To test the algorithm, we recorded hippocampus and amygdala LFPs from rats in different behavioral states: awake (AW), sleep (SWS, slow-wave sleep and REMS, rapid-eye movement sleep) and tonic-clonic seizures. The results show that the software reliably detects all oscillatory events present in up to seven user-defined frequency bands including onset/offset time and duration. It also calculates the global spectral composition per epoch from each subject and the linear coherence (with confidence intervals) as a measure of spectral synchronization between brain regions. The output files provide an easy way to do within-subject as well as across-subject analysis. The routines will be freely available for downloading from our website http://www.neuroimage.usp.br/BPT/.

Modifications of EEG in Humans Performing Cyclic Movements by the Fingers of the Right Arm: Effect of Local Contralateral Cooling	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; frequency EEG components (rhythms); voluntary movements; rhythmic movements; cold stimulation	VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; POWER; PATTERNS	In a group of 11 volunteers, we examined changes in EEG during voluntary cyclic movements of the fingers of the right arm providing the movement of a flexible ring-like cord. The performance of full rotation of the ring for the first and the second time was considered the first and the second phase of the test, Ph1 and Ph2, respectively. This motor test was realized under different conditions, namely in the absence of additional somatic stimulation (condition 1) and in the course of intense, but non-painful, local cooling of the fingers of the left arm (condition 2). Independently of the conditions of the motor test, the spectral power (SP) of the 2-4-Hz rhythm increased (especially within Ph2), while SPs of the theta2, alpha1, and alpha2 rhythms in the course of Ph1 decreased. Within Ph2 under condition 1, the SP of theta1 oscillations intensified. A drop in the SP of alpha oscillations in the course of Ph1 with respect to the background state was observed only under condition 1 and was clearer in the alpha2 rhythm. Under condition 2, as compared with condition 1, the SP of the theta1 rhythm and values of the theta1/alpha1 and theta1/alpha2 SP ratios decreased within both phases of the test. These shifts probably reflected mobilization of the attention resources in the course of realization of the movements under conditions of additional sensory stimulation. During cooling (condition 2), the indices of interindividual variability of changes in the SPs within the Ph2 of the motor test increased for the alpha rhythms and decreased for delta oscillations, as compared with the respective values within the first phase.

Spike-rate adaptation and neuronal bursting in a mean-field model of brain activity	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article							FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; DYNAMICS; WAVES; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; EEG	Spike-rate adaptation is investigated within a mean-field model of brain activity. Two different mechanisms of negative feedback are considered; one involving modulation of the mean firing threshold, and the other, modulation of the mean synaptic strength. Adaptation to a constant stimulus is shown to take place for both mechanisms, and limit-cycle oscillations in the firing rate corresponding to bursts of neuronal activity are investigated. These oscillations are found to result from a Hopf bifurcation when the equilibrium lies between the local maximum and local minimum of a given nullcline. Oscillations with amplitudes significantly below the maximum firing rate are found over a narrow range of possible equilibriums.

Physiological arousal and attention during a week of continuous sleep restriction	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sleep restriction; Sleepiness; Performance; EEG; Spectral analysis; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; WAKING EEG; PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS; DEPRIVATION; TASK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; WAKEFULNESS; FREQUENCIES	Waking brain physiology underlying deficits from continuous sleep restriction (CSR) is not well understood. Fourteen good sleepers participated in a 21-day protocol where they slept their usual amount in a baseline week, had their time in bed restricted by 33% in a CSR week, and slept the desired amount in a recovery week. Participants slept at home. completing diaries and wearing activity monitors to verify compliance. Each day participants completed an RT task and mood and sleepiness ratings every 3 h. Laboratory assessment of electrophysiology and performance took place at the end of baseline, three times throughout the CSR week. and at the beginning of recovery. Participants reported less sleep during CSR which was confirmed by activity monitors. Correspondingly, well-being and neurobehavioural performance was impaired. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed significantly reduced arousal between the 1st and 7th days of restriction and linear effects at anterior sites (Fp2, Fz, F8, T8). At posterior sites (P4, P8), reductions occurred only later in the week between the 4th and 7th nights of restriction. Both the immediate linear decline in arousal and precipitous drop later in the week were apparent at central sites (C4, Cz). Thus, frontal regions were affected immediately, while parietal regions showed maintenance of function until restriction was more severe. The P300 ERP component showed evidence of reduced attention by the 7th day of restriction (at Pz, P4). EEG and ERPs deficits were more robust in the right-hemisphere, which may reflect greater vulnerability to sleep loss in the non-dominant hemisphere. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Functional exploration of the brain by fMRI - Theoretical approach of spectral analysis	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			French	Article						fMRI; spectral analysis; coherency; phase; functional connectivity	BOLD HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TIME-SERIES; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COHERENCE; MOTOR; SIGNAL; TREMOR; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) permits to obtain physiological information about MRI signal, which is modulated by electrical, biochemical, and physiological properties of the cerebral. tissue. It is possible to characterize the brain interactions from an fMRI signal. Particularly, the use of a spectral. analysis at a given frequency allows access to the time series chronology, which occurs within various activated areas of the brain. Thus, spectral. parameters such as coherency and phase shift may be calculated from presupposed stationary stochastic signals and of an estimate of the cross-spectral power density function. Coherency describes a correlation structure in frequency domain between signals and thus allows obtaining an accurate estimate of the phase retation (time delay), which connects the signals between them. We describe in the last part of the article a calculation method integrating spectral information obtained previously and which makes it possible to evaluate the intensity of the existing interaction between two distinct cerebral areas.

Litt, Eliasmith, Kroon, Weinstein, and Thagard (2006) criticize the Penrose-Hameroff "Orch OR" quantum computational model of consciousness, arguing instead for neurocomputation as an explanation for mental phenomena. Here I clarify and defend Orch OR, show how Orch OR and neurocomputation are compatible, and question whether neurocomputation alone can physiologically account for coherent gamma synchrony EEG, a candidate for the neural correlate of consciousness. Orch OR is based on quantum computation in microtubules within dendrites in cortex and other regions linked by dendritic-dendritic gap junctions ("dendritic webs") acting as laterally connected input layers of the brain's neurocomputational architecture. Within dendritic webs, consciousness is proposed to occur as gamma EEG-synchronized sequences of discrete quantum computational events acting in integration phases of neurocomputational "integrate-and-fire" cycles. Orch OR is a viable approach toward understanding how the brain produces consciousness.

Anticipation of natural stimuli modulates EEG dynamics: physiology and simulation	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Beta; Gamma; Gain; Threshold; EEG; Vision	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; GAIN MODULATION; RESPONSES; TASK; MODEL; TIME; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION	In everyday life we often encounter situations in which we can expect a visual stimulus before we actually see it. Here, we study the impact of such stimulus anticipation on the actual response to a visual stimulus. Participants were to indicate the sex of deer and cattle on photographs of the respective animals. On some trials, participants were cued on the species of the upcoming animal whereas on other trials this was not the case. Time frequency analysis of the simultaneously recorded EEG revealed modulations by this cue stimulus in two time windows. Early (approximate to 100 ms) spectral responses (approximate to 20 Hz) displayed strongest stimulus-locking for stimuli that were preceded by a cue if they were sufficiently large. Late (approximate to 300 ms; 40 Hz) responses displayed enhanced amplitudes in response to large stimuli and to stimuli that were preceded by a cue. For late responses, however, no interaction between cue and stimulus size was observed. We were able to explain these results in a simulation by prestimulus gain modulations (early response) and by decreased response thresholds (late response). Thus, it seems plausible, that stimulus anticipation results in a pretuning of local neural populations.

Modeling and investigation of neural activity in the thalamus	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						thalamus; interneuron; spindle instability; RE nucleus; brain dynarnics	NUCLEUS-RETICULARIS THALAMI; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; RHYTHM	Although it is known that electroencephalographic (EEG) spindle oscillations are generated and maintained in the thalamus. the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In this paper, a physiologically based continuum model is used to explore the role of the thalamus in generation of EEG rhythms, particularly spindle oscillations. Furthermore, local interneurons (LIs) which were not previously included in such modeling are studied. A previous continuum model is extended to incorporate Us within relay nuclei and self-connections of the reticular (RE) nucleus into investigation of the roles and functions of groups of thalamic neurons. The isolated thalamus is analysed into five distinct classes Of Substructures. Analysis of the properties of waves generated, leads to the main results that: (1) an isolated RE nucleus cannot generate spindle oscillations, but it is essential to generation of spindle oscillations in cooperation with the relay cells; (2) the Us can also generate spindle oscillations in conjunction with the relay cell; (3) the self-connection loop within the LI population and the one within the RE nucleus both make spindle oscillations easier to produce than in the absence of these connections; (4) the Us have similar effects to the RE nucleus, except that they are purely inhibitory, whereas the latter has both direct inhibitory effects on relay cells, and indirect net excitatory effects by inhibiting Us which inhibit relay cells, and (6) self-connections arnongst the Us have equivalent effects to self-connections within the RE nucleus.

Despite its increasing use in cognitive research and the numerous evidences of the existence of sex differences in EEG, EEG stability has been mainly investigated in men. Particularly, studies on stability of coherent activity are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate within-subject reliability and inter-session stability of resting EEG over a nine-month period in women. Methods: Within-subject reliability and inter-session stability were analyzed for absolute power and inter- and intrahemispheric coherent activity at central and posterior regions, once a month, in resting conditions, with eyes open and closed. Results: Within-subject reliability was very high (r > 0.89) for all subjects and EEG parameters. Inter-session stability was higher with eyes closed and for interhemispheric coherent activity, and poorer with eyes open especially in the alpha band. Conclusions: Present results indicate high reliability of the pattern of power and coherent activity of each individual woman during rest, and group stability of EEG activity with eyes closed at least over a nine-month period. Significance: These results provide information on EEG stability in women over a long period. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Such characterization leads to a new technical development of ictal source analysis for the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. The present new ictal source analysis method consists of three parts. First, a three-dimensional source scanning procedure is performed by a spatiotemporal FINE source localization method to locate the multiple sources responsible for the time evolving ictal rhythms at their onsets. Next, the dynamic behavior of the sources is modeled by a multivariate autoregressive process (MVAR). Lastly, the causal interaction patterns among the sources as a function of frequency are estimated from the MVAR modeling of the source temporal dynamics. The causal interaction patterns indicate the dynamic communications between sources, which are useful in distinguishing the primary sources responsible for the ictal onset from the secondary sources caused by the ictal propagation. The present ictal analysis strategy has been applied to a number of seizures from five epilepsy patients, and their results are consistent with observations from either MRI lesions or SPECT scans, which indicate its effectiveness. Each step of the ictal source analysis is statistically evaluated in order to guarantee the confidence in the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The method delivers a number, termed oscillation score, that estimates the degree to which a neuron is oscillating in a given frequency band. Moreover, it can also reliably identify the oscillation frequency and strength in the given band, independently of the oscillation in other frequency bands, and thus it can handle superimposed oscillations on multiple scales (theta, alpha, beta, gamma, etc.). The method is relatively simple and fast. It can cope with a low number of spikes, converging exponentially fast with the number of spikes, to a stable estimation of the oscillation strength. It thus lends itself to the analysis of spike-sorted single-unit activity from electrophysiological recordings. We show that the method performs well on experimental data recorded from cat visual cortex and also compares favorably to other methods. In addition, we provide a measure, termed confidence score, that determines the stability of the oscillation score estimate over trials.

Design: A 5-day session comprising an adaptation night, a baseline night, two nights of sleep fragmentation, and a recovery night. Setting: Chronobiology laboratory. Participants: Twenty-four healthy subjects aged 19-34 years: 12 morning types and 12 evening types selected by questionnaire. Each group included 6 men and 6 women with a habitual sleep duration of 7 to 9 hours. Interventions: Two nights of behavioral sleep fragmentation induced by forced 5-min awakenings every half-hour. Measurements and Results: Each night of polysomnography recording lasted 8 hours and was based on each subject's preferred sleep schedule. On both nights of sleep fragmentation, stage 1 sleep increased, while both total sleep time and minutes of slow wave sleep decreased. No difference was observed in sleep architecture between morning types and evening types during sleep fragmentation nights or during recovery night. Spectral analysis of all-night NREM sleep EEG showed that during the recovery night, morning types had a larger fronto-central increase in low frequency activities and a larger centro-parietal decrease in 14-15 Hz activity than evening types. The largest group difference was for slow wave activity in the fronto-central area during the first part of the sleep episode. Conclusions: These results add further support to a postulated difference in homeostatic sleep regulation between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher homeostatic response to sleep disruption.

Repeated blockade of GABA(A) receptors in the medial septal region induces epileptiform activity in the hippocampus	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						hippocampal interneurons; EEG; theta rhythmicity; oscillations; bicuculline; muscimol	RAT SEPTOHIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; BAND COMPLEX; THETA-RHYTHM; IN-VIVO; ACETYLCHOLINE; INTERNEURONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; INNERVATION	Changes in the activity of putative interneurons of the stratum oriens of the hippocampus and hippocampal EEG after the delivery of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (1.0 nmol/l mu l) to the medial septal region were investigated in awake rabbits. The injection of bicuculline produced a sharp increase in the firing rate in 94.3% of hippocampal cells. The effect of bicuculline on the neuronal theta rhythmicity depended on the number of injections. The first five daily infusions decreased the theta activity in 85.7% of cells. On the fourth to fifth experimental days paroxysmal discharges and 8-15 Hz oscillations were recorded in the hippocampal EEG. Six to seven further daily bicuculline injections following a brief diminution of theta activity produced a sharp augmentation of theta oscillations in 78.9% of cells and provoked seizures. Immediately before seizures, stabilization of theta bursts and an increase in burst frequency was usually observed in putative interneurons. During seizures, neuronal rhythmic activity was either disordered and then turned into seizure discharges or was inhibited, partially or completely. In the hippocampal EEG, the power of theta rhythm before seizures usually strongly increased compared with controls. Injection of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (30 nmol/l mu l) 15 min before bicuculline infusion prevented the development of seizures. These findings suggest that the interplay between septal neurons via GABA(A) receptors is critical in the tuning of septal output signals that insure generation of natural theta rhythm as well as adequate functioning of the hippocampus.

Quantitative EEG power and asymmetry increase 36 h before a migraine attack	CEPHALALGIA			English	Article						migraine; headache; EEG; QEEG; migraine cycle	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; TOPOGRAPHIC FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; ACUTE CONFUSIONAL MIGRAINE; BRAIN-STEM ACTIVATION; THALAMOCORTICAL ACTIVITY; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; DYNAMIC CHANGES; HEADACHE; SLEEP; HABITUATION	The aim was to estimate ictal, pre- and postictal brain function changes in migraine in a blinded paired quantitative EEG (QEEG) study. EEG recordings (n = 119) from 40 migraineurs were retrospectively classified as ictal, interictal, preictal or postictal. delta, theta, alpha and beta power, and hemispheric asymmetry in frontocentral, temporal and occipitoparietal regions were calculated from artefact-free EEG. Power and power asymmetry were calculated for two time-windows, 36 and 72 h before/after the attack, and compared with the interictal values. Frontocentral delta power increased (P = 0.03), whereas frontocentral theta and alpha power tended to increase (P < 0.09) within 36 h before the next attack compared with the interictal period. Occipitoparietal (alpha and theta) and temporal (alpha) power were more asymmetric before the attack compared with the interictal baseline (P < 0.04). Ictal posterior alpha power increased slightly (P = 0.01). Postictal power and power asymmetry were not significantly different from interictal baseline. EEG activity seems to change shortly before the attack. This suggests that migraineurs are most susceptible to attack when anterior QEEG delta power and posterior alpha and theta asymmetry values are high. Changed activity patterns in cholinergic brainstem or basal forebrain nuclei and thalamo-cortical connections before the migraine attack are hypothesized.	[Bjork, M.

In this method, in order to remove the artifact, the RMVB is provided with a priori information, namely, an estimation of the steering vector corresponding to the point source EB artifact. The artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently reconstructed by deflation. The a priori knowledge, the vector corresponding to the spatial distribution of the EB factor, is identified using the STF model of EEGs, provided by the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method. In order to reduce the computational complexity present in the estimation of the STF model using the three-way PARAFAC, the time domain is subdivided into a number of segments, and a four-Way array is then set to estimate the STF-time/segment ITS) model of the data using the four-way PARAFAC. The correct number of the factors of the STF model is effectively estimated by using a novel core consistency diagnostic- (CORCONDIA-) based measure. Subsequently, the STF-TS model is shown to closely approximate the classic STF model, with significantly lower computational cost. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the EB artifact from raw EEG measurements.

TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review							LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; NETWORK MECHANISMS; SLEEP OSCILLATION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DELTA-WAVES; IN-VIVO; RHYTHMS; MEMORY	The slow (<1 Hz) oscillation, with its alternating 'up' and 'down' states in individual neurons, is a defining feature of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Although this oscillation is well preserved across mammalian species, its physiological role is unclear. Electrophysiological and computational evidence from the cortex and thalamus now indicates that slow-oscillation 'up' states and the 'activated' state of wakefulness are remarkably similar dynamic entities. This is consistent with behavioural experiments suggesting that slow-oscillation 'up' states provide a context for the replay, and possible consolidation, of previous experience. In this scenario, the T-type Ca2+ channel-dependent bursts of action potentials that initiate each 'up' state in thalamocortical (TC) neurons might function as triggers for synaptic and cellular plasticity in corticothalarnic networks.

Impulsivity, anxiety, and individual differences in evoked and induced brain oscillations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; evoked oscillations; induced oscillations; impulsivity; behavioral inhibition	BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; ALPHA-SYNCHRONIZATION; GALE HYPOTHESIS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS; PERSONALITY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; EXTRAVERSION; PERFORMANCE	There is much evidence to confirm the view that slow waves of delta and theta ranges are linked to activation whereas alpha oscillations are somehow related to inhibition processes. In the domain of individual differences, impulsive behavior is frequently associated with increased spectral power of slow oscillations whereas Behavioral Inhibition (BI) may be associated with higher reactivity within alpha band. Here it is hypothesized that Impulsivity would predispose to higher responding in low frequencies whereas BI would predispose to higher responding within alpha band. In a sample of 51 subjects, evoked and induced responses to auditory stimuli were studied in two experimental sessions: 1) in a simple discrimination task and 2) in a stop-signal task in which subjects had to be ready to withdraw the prepared motor response. Impulsive subjects showed higher baseline delta, theta and alpha power and higher magnitude of induced responses in low frequencies. They also showed lower phase-locking in low frequencies to auditory stimuli and higher phase-locking to the overt behavioral response onset. High BI scorers showed higher baseline alpha power and higher desynchronization in this frequency band in response to stimuli. The reported findings appear to support the idea that low frequency oscillations are associated with behavioral approach and alpha with behavioral inhibition tendencies but these associations are only valid for induced responses to stimuli.

A failure to stop and attention fluctuations: An evoked oscillations study of the stop-signal paradigm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; evoked oscillations; stop-signal task; inhibition; attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ERP COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; EEG; IMPULSIVITY; CHILDREN	Objective: It is not always clear whether inhibition or attention deficit underlies a failure to stop a prepared motor response. One possible way to approach this question is to resort to measures of evoked oscillations since functional correlates of different frequency oscillations are relatively well understood. Methods: The present study examined event-related oscillations during a stop-signal task in non-clinical adults. In 25% of trials of an auditory discrimination tasks subjects had to refrain from a prepared motor response. Results: In successful stop trials, the Go N2 peaked later and the Stop N2 peaked earlier than in failed stop trials. Relative to successful, failed stop trials were associated with a larger N1-N2 and Go P3, and a smaller Stop P3 in the central and posterior cortical regions. The latter effect was exclusively determined by evoked delta oscillations, whereas all other frequency bands contributed to enhanced responses in failed comparative to successful stop trials. Conclusions: The sum of presented evidence seems to show that success or failure to stop mostly depends on how the subject prepares for the Go and Stop stimuli in advance. If attention is more directed towards the Stop signal, the stopping succeeds, otherwise it fails. Significance: These data may contribute to understanding the cognitive basis of successful and unsuccessful stopping performance. (C) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Human EEG very high frequency oscillations reflect the number of matches with a template in auditory short-term memory	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						40 Hz; auditory; EEG; frequency-modulated sound; gamma activity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; VISUAL-DISCRIMINATION TASK; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; MODULATED TONES; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; RESPONSES; STIMULI; PERCEPTION; PHASE	Auditory perception comprises bottom-up as well as top-down processes. While research in the past has revealed many neural correlates of bottom-up processes, less is known about top-down modulation. Memory processes have recently been associated with oscillations in the gamma-band of human EEG (30 Hz and above) which are enhanced when incoming information matches a stored memory template. Therefore, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) and gamma-band activity in 17 healthy participants in a Go/NoGo-task. They listened to four frequency-modulated (FM) sounds which varied regarding the frequency range traversed and the direction of frequency modulation. One sound was defined as target and required a button press. The results of ERPs (N1, P2, N2, and P3) were consistent with previous studies. Analysis of evoked gamma-band responses yielded no significant task-dependent modulation, but we observed a stimulus dependency, which was also present in a control experiment: The amplitude of evoked gamma responses showed an inverted U-shape as a function of stimulus frequency. Investigation of total gamma activity revealed functionally relevant responses at high frequencies (90 Hz to 250 Hz), which showed significant modulations by matches with STM: Complete matches led to the strongest enhancements (starting around 100 ms after stimulus onset) and partial matches resulted in intermediate ones. The results support the conclusion that very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs) are markers of active stimulus discrimination in STM matching processes and are attributable to higher cognitive functions.

The objective of this study was to design a fuzzy rule based system which integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) features to quantitatively estimate the DOA. The proposed method is based on the analysis of single-channel EEG using frequency and time domain methods. A clinical study was conducted on 22 patients to construct subsets of reference data corresponding to four well-defined anesthetic states: awake, moderate anesthesia, surgical anesthesia and isoelectric. Statistical analysis of features was used to design input membership functions (MFs). The input space was partitioned with respect to the derived MFs and the training data was used to label the partitions and extract efficient fuzzy if-then rules. Consequently, the fuzzy rule-base index (FRI) is derived between 0 (isoelectric) to 100 (fully awake) using fuzzy inference engine and designed output MFs. We also applied the same features to an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) derived without any prior knowledge. The results show that FRI correlates more with the clinically accepted DOA index, CSITM (CSM, Danmeter, Denmark). In addition to this achievement the main idea behind this study is to simplify the mutual knowledge exchange between the human expert and the machine, leading to enhance both interpretability of the results and performance of the system.

Increased EEG spectral power density during sleep following short-term sleep deprivation in pigeons (Columba livia): evidence for avian sleep homeostasis	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						bird; evolution; pallium; phylogeny; sleep function; slow-wave activity	BASE-LINE CONDITIONS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; PALLIOPALLIAL CONNECTIVITY; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; THETA ACTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; EVOLUTION; MAMMALS; BIRDS; RAT	Birds provide a unique opportunity to evaluate current theories for the function of sleep. Like mammalian sleep, avian sleep is composed of two states, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep that apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds. Despite this resemblance, however, it has been unclear whether avian SWS shows a compensatory response to sleep loss (i.e., homeostatic regulation), a fundamental aspect of mammalian sleep potentially linked to the function of SWS. Here, we prevented pigeons (Columba livia) from taking their normal naps during the last 8 h of the day. Although time spent in SWS did not change significantly following short-term sleep deprivation, electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA; i.e., 0.78-2.34 Hz power density) during SWS increased significantly during the first 3 h of the recovery night when compared with the undisturbed night, and progressively declined thereafter in a manner comparable to that observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. SWA was also elevated during REM sleep on the recovery night, a response that might reflect increased SWS pressure and the concomitant 'spill-over' of SWS-related EEG activity into short episodes of REM sleep. As in rodents, power density during SWS also increased in higher frequencies (9-25 Hz) in response to short-term sleep deprivation. Finally, time spent in REM sleep increased following sleep deprivation. The mammalian-like increase in EEG spectral power density across both low and high frequencies, and the increase in time spent in REM sleep following sleep deprivation suggest that some aspects of avian and mammalian sleep are regulated in a similar manner.

Callosal responses of fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during slow oscillation in cats	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neuronal types; neocortex; sleep oscillations; silent states; active states	NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; IN-VIVO; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; SLEEP OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; IMPACT; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS	The cortically generated slow oscillation consists of long-lasting hyperpolarizations associated with depth-positive electroencephalogram (EEG) waves and neuronal depolarizations accompanied by firing during the depth-negative EEG waves. It has previously been shown that, during the prolonged hyperpolarizations, the transfer of information from prethalamic pathways to neocortex is impaired, whereas the intracortical dialogue is maintained. To study some of the factors that may account for the maintenance of the intracortical information transfer during the hyperpolarization, intracellular recordings from association areas 5 and 7 were performed in anesthetized cats, and the synaptic responsiveness of fast-rhythmic-bursting, regular-spiking and fast-spiking neurons was tested using single pulses to the homotopic sites in the contralateral areas. During the long-lasting hyperpolarizations callosal volleys elicited in fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons, but not in regular-spiking or fast-spiking neurons, large-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic potentials crowned by single action potentials or spike clusters. Our data show that callosal volleys excite and lead to spiking in fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during prolonged hyperpolarizations, thus enabling them to transmit information within intracortical networks during slow-wave sleep.

J	Urakami, Y				Urakami, Yuko			Relationships cerebral cortex between sleep spindles and activities of as determined by simultaneous EEG and MEG recording	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	37th Congress of the Japan-Epilepsy-Society	OCT 30-31, 2003	Sendai, JAPAN	Japan Epilepsy Soc		sleep spindles; equivalent current dipoles; EEG; MEG	FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; TOPOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; YOUNG; OSCILLATIONS; RESOLUTION; HUMANS; BRAIN	The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationships between the distributions and cortical sources of two types of spindles in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and how cortical activating areas contribute to the distribution of spindles. Spontaneous activities during sleep stage 2 were recorded from 7 normal subjects by simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings. Two types of spindles with frequency-specific topographic differences (fast spindles and slow spindles) were defined by EEG, and, subsequently, the sources of spindles were estimated as equivalent current dipoles using MEG. Activation centered in four areas, the precentral and postcentral areas in posterior frontal cortex and parietal cortex of each hemisphere. However, these areas were not always activated simultaneously. Fast spindles were associated with more frequent activation of postcentral areas with stronger activation strengths, whereas slow spindles were associated with more frequent activation of precentral areas with stronger activation strengths. When spindles were distributed symmetrically in amplitude between the hemispheres on both EEG and MEG, the four areas were activated equally and simultaneously. When spindles exhibited asymmetric distributions with amplitude differences above 30% between hemispheres, the cortical areas were activated with variable temporal relationships. Two types of spindle oscillations observed in the MEG had a common neural basis at the cortical level, with variability in patterns of activation and activation strengths resulting in the differences in distribution observed on the EEG and MEG. The differences in cortical activation patterns and activation strengths between the two types of spindles suggest that two distinct forms of spindle bursts propagate to cortex through different underlying neuronal circuits. Defining the cortical activating areas for spindles by MEG is valuable to consider the underlying neural basis.

A 16-mm(2) 96 microelectrode array with 400-mu m interelectrode spacing was implanted in five patients undergoing invasive EEG monitoring for medically refractory epilepsy. High spatial resolution data from the allay were analyzed in conjunction with simultaneously acquired data from standard intracranial electrode grids and strips. mu EEG recorded from within the epileptogenic zone demonstrates discharges resembling both interictal epileptiform activity ("microdischarges") and electrographic seizures ("microseizures") but confined to cortical regions as small as 200 mu m(2). In two patients. this activity appeared to be involved in the initiation or propagation of electrographic seizures. The authors hypothesize that microdischarges and microseizures are generated by small cortical domains that form the substrate of epileptogenic cortex and play important roles in seizure initiation and propagation. and propagation.

Results for target letters showed a decrease in the amplitude of alpha-band (10-11 Hz) activity and an increase in theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (40-44 Hz) activities around 350 ms after stimulation. P2 and late positive component presented a higher amplitude to target than to repeated nontarget letters. Alpha reduction was inversely related to theta and late positive component increase. Moreover, gamma oscillation amplitude was directly related to theta amplitude. The findings suggest the importance of occipitoparietal alpha reduction for the development of task-related neuronal activity.

Alteration of behavior in mice by muscimol is associated with regional electroencephalogram synchronization	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; topography; EEG spectral analysis; GABA(A) agonist; sedation; catalepsy	SLEEP REGULATION; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; HZ OSCILLATION; PRION PROTEIN; EEG; EPILEPSY; MECHANISMS; ANESTHESIA; THALAMUS	We tested the hypothesis that the effects of GABAergic agonists on behavior and the electroencephalogram (EEG) result from an increased regional synchronization in cortical circuits. The relationship between regional EEG topography, EEG synchronization and alteration of behavior was investigated by administering male C57BL/6 mice (n=7) a high, 3 mg/kg i.p. dose of muscimol, a selective GABAA agonist. Parietal and frontal cortical EEG, electromyogram, infrared and running wheel activity were recorded for 3 h before and 9 h after injection. Muscimol consistently elicited biphasic behavioral changes. Initially, it induced a catalepsy-like state lasting 96.0 +/- 12.4 min. This state was followed by a hyperactivity period of 49.7 +/- 5.4 min, during which the mice engaged in vigorous wheel running. During catalepsy, the EEG exhibited high amplitude waves which showed a consistent phase relationship between the frontal and parietal derivation. Moreover, the typical regional differences between the EEG spectra of the two derivations were abolished, and a redistribution of EEG power toward lower frequencies (<3 Hz) occurred in both derivations. In contrast, during hyperactivity the parietal EEG was dominated by theta-activity (7-9 Hz), which is typical for running behavior, while high amplitude slow waves, resembling the normal non-rapid eye movement sleep EEG pattern, predominated in the frontal EEG. The data indicate that the GABAergic system is involved in the regulation of cortical synchronization of neuronal activity and suggest a link between regional EEG synchronization and behavioral states.

Retinoic acid signaling affects cortical synchrony during sleep. Science 310, 111-113.) has suggested that vitamin A (retinol and its derivatives) is genetically involved in the electroencephalogram (EEG) delta oscillation during sleep. However, this finding has not yet been confirmed by other studies. In this study, we attempted to record the sleep EEG and behavior, and to quantify striatal monoamines in mice fed a vitamin A-deficient (VAD) diet for 4 weeks, in order to clarify the linkage between the delta oscillation and vitamin A. VAD mice demonstrated a significant decrease in the delta power of the EEG. However, 6-h sleep deprivation caused the recovery of the delta power in VAD mice to a level similar to that of the control. VAD also caused the decrease of spontaneous activity throughout 24-h period. Furthermore, dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid, a metabolite of dopamine, was decreased significantly in the striatal tissue of VAD mice. Our present results suggest that the deficiency of vitamin A causes the attenuation of delta power in NREM sleep and spontaneous activity. These attenuations may be related to the alteration of striatal dopaminergic function. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different patterns and amplitudes are observed in aroused, sleepy, epileptic or other brain states. Differences in amplitude are generally attributed to differences in synchrony among generators. The degree of EEG synchrony is measured by the correlation between electrodes placed over different cortical regions. We present a new way to quantitatively assess the degree of synchronization of these generators via multichannel recordings. We illustrate how situations where there are several groups of generators with different inter-group and intra-group synchronies can be analyzed. Finally, we present a way to identify the organization of groups exhibiting topographic organization. Although the model presented here is highly simplified, several methods are based on averaging activity over increasingly larger areas. These types of measurements may be applied as well to EEG and ECoG recordings.

Cortical epileptogenic zone is usually localized from ictal recordings with intracranial electrodes, causing a significant burden to patients and health care. Growing literature suggests that epileptogenic networks exhibit aberrant dynamics also during seizure-free periods. We examined if neocortical epileptogenic regions can be circumscribed by quantifying local long-range temporal (auto-) correlations (LRTC) with detrended fluctuation analysis of seizure-free ongoing subdural EEG activity in 4 frequency bands in 5 patients. We show here with subdural EEG recordings that the LRTC are abnormally strong near the seizure onset area. This effect was most salient in neocortical oscillations in the beta frequency band (14-30 Hz). Moreover, lorazepam, a widely used antiepileptic drug, exerted contrasting effects on LRTC (n = 2): lorazepam attenuated beta-band LRTC near the epileptic focus, whereas it strengthened LRTC in other conical areas. Our findings demonstrate that interictal neuronal network activity near the focus of seizure onset has pathologically strong intrinsic temporal correlations. The observed effect by lorazepam on beta-hand activity suggests that the antiepileptic mechanism of benzodiazepines may be related to the normalization of LRTC within the epileptic focus. We propose that this method may become a promising candidate for routine invasive and noninvasive presurgical localization of epileptic foci.

Distinguishing low frequency oscillations within the 1/f spectral behaviour of electromagnetic brain signals	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							FULL-BAND EEG	Background: It has been acknowledged that the frequency spectrum of measured electromagnetic (EM) brain signals shows a decrease in power with increasing frequency. This spectral behaviour may lead to difficulty in distinguishing event-related peaks from ongoing brain activity in the electro-and magnetoencephalographic (EEG and MEG) signal spectra. This can become an issue especially in the analysis of low frequency oscillations (LFOs) -below 0.5 Hz -which are currently being observed in signal recordings linked with specific pathologies such as epileptic seizures or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in sleep studies, etc. Methods: In this work we propose a simple method that can be used to compensate for this 1/f trend hence achieving spectral normalisation. This method involves filtering the raw measured EM signal through a differentiator prior to further data analysis. Results: Applying the proposed method to various exemplary datasets including very low frequency EEG recordings, epileptic seizure recordings, MEG data and Evoked Response data showed that this compensating procedure provides a flat spectral base onto which event related peaks can be clearly observed. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the proposed filter is a useful tool for the analysis of physiological data especially in revealing very low frequency peaks which may otherwise be obscured by the 1/f spectral activity inherent in EEG/MEG recordings.

In contrast, no EEG correlates have been identified related to the processing of monetary gains orpositive feedback. This result is puzzling considering the large number of brain regions involved in the processing of rewards. In the present study we used a gambling task to investigate this issue with trial-by-trial wavelet-based time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalographic signal recorded non-invasively in healthy humans. Using this analysis a mediofrontal oscillatory component in the beta range was identified which was associated to monetary gains. In addition, standard time-domain ERP analysis showed an MFN for losses that was associated with an increase in theta power in the time-frequency analysis. We propose that the reward-related beta oscillatory activity signifies the functional coupling of distributed brain regions involved in reward processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, they were not use the rich phase dynamics in the EEG. Phase synchronization was opposed to use for classification of motor imagery. In suitable time window, the electrodes of C3, C4 and central regions to match were selected and then Hilbert transform signal processing method was used for extracting the degree of phase synchronization between two electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by calculating the so-called phase locking value (PLV). The support vector machine (SVM) was used for classification of the motor imagery by a feature selection algorithm. It shows that the satisfactory results are obtained with single-trial accuracies of 92.5% and that synchronization differences between motor imagery depends upon frequency selection, length of data and electrode selection.

Electroencephalographic analysis of manifestations of hidden forms of paroxysmal syndrome in the wakefulness-sleep cycle in rats	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						rats of Krushinskii-Molodkina line; wakefulness-sleep cycle; spectral EEG analysis; generalized tonicoclonic convulsions; paroxysmal syndrome	EPILEPSY; KRUSHINSKY; PATHOLOGY; STRAIN	An electroencephalographic study of the brain activity in the wakefulness-sleep cycle was carried out on rats of Krushinskii-Molodkina line (KM) with hereditary predisposition to audiogenic convulsions and on Wistar rats that were insensitive to the convulsiogenic sound effect, but with epileptiform manifestations appearing on the background of cadmium intoxication and administration of kainic acid into the caudate nucleus head. There were revealed several EEG patterns whose presence was an indicator of formation of disorders of the CNS activity of the paroxysmal character in the animals. It has been established that in the phase of the rat rapid-wave sleep, a high representation of episodes with predominance of alpha-diapason EEG oscillations can be considered a specific non-paroxysmal abnormality due to the presence of convulsive syndrome in these animals. There was shown a long steady decrease of sensitivity of KM rats to the convulsiogenic sound effect, which appeared after multiple audiogenic generalized tonicoclonic convulsive attacks, correlated with a decrease of the degree of theta-diapason oscillations and with an increase of representation of alpha-diapason waves on EEG in the state of the animal quiet wakefulness. The role of disintegration in activity of the ascending activating brain systems in the animal and human paroxysmal syndromes is discussed.

There is compelling evidence indicating that sleep plays a crucial role in the consolidation of new declarative, hippocampus-dependent memories. Given the increasing interest in the spatiotemporal relationships between cortical and hippocampal activity during sleep, this study aimed to shed more light on the basic features of human sleep in the hippocampus. Methodology/Principal Findings. We recorded intracerebral stereo-EEG directly from the hippocampus and neocortical sites in five epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluations. The time course of classical EEG frequency bands during the first three NREM-REM sleep cycles of the night was evaluated. We found that delta power shows, also in the hippocampus, the progressive decrease across sleep cycles, indicating that a form of homeostatic regulation of delta activity is present also in this subcortical structure. Hippocampal sleep was also characterized by: i) a lower relative power in the slow oscillation range during NREM sleep compared to the scalp EEG; ii) a flattening of the time course of the very low frequencies (up to 1 Hz) across sleep cycles, with relatively high levels of power even during REM sleep; iii) a decrease of power in the beta band during REM sleep, at odds with the typical increase of power in the cortical recordings. Conclusions/Significance. Our data imply that cortical slow oscillation is attenuated in the hippocampal structures during NREM sleep. The most peculiar feature of hippocampal sleep is the increased synchronization of the EEG rhythms during REM periods. This state of resonance may have a supportive role for the processing/consolidation of memory.

During the last few years there has been a debate about the neural fundamentals of ERPs. Two models have been proposed: The evoked model states that additive evoked responses which are completely independent of ongoing background electroencephalogram generate the ERP. On the other hand the phase reset model suggests a resetting of ongoing brain oscillations to be the neural generator of ERPs. Here, evidence for either of the two models is presented and validated, and their possible impact on cognitive neuroscience is discussed. In addition, future prospects on this field of research are presented. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is coherent with electromyographic activity (EMG) during tonic contraction, but whether the cortical beta-oscillations are primarily motor or sensorimotor in function remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that cortical beta-activity is associated with an up-regulation of sensory inputs that may be relevant to the organization of the motor response. We recorded cortical somatosensory potentials (SEPs) elicited by electrical stimuli to the median nerve at the wrist triggered by increases of electroencephalographic (EEG) beta-activity in the contralateral fronto-central EEG and compared these to SEPs presented at random intervals. The involvement of motor cortex in the triggering EEG activity was confirmed by a simultaneous elevation of cortico-spinal synchrony in the beta-band. The negative cortical evoked potential peaking at 20 ms and the positive evoked potential peaking at 30 ms after median nerve shocks were increased in size when elicited after phasic increases in beta-activity. The functional coupling of sensory and motor cortices in the beta-band was confirmed in recordings of electrocorticographic activity in two patients with chronic pain syndromes, suggesting a means by which beta-activity may simultaneously influence cortical sensory processing, motor output and promote sensory-motor interaction.

Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) responses were examined separately for targets and non-targets in four different memory load conditions (0-, 1-, 2- and 3-back). The presentation of all stimuli in all memory load conditions elicited long-lasting theta frequency (similar to 4 - 6 Hz) ERS responses which were of greater magnitude for the target stimuli as compared to the non-target stimuli. Alpha frequency range (similar to 8 - 12 Hz) ERD responses were observed in all memory load conditions for both targets and non-targets. The duration of these alpha ERD responses increased with increasing memory load and reaction time. In all memory load conditions, early appearing beta rhythm (similar to 14 - 30 Hz) ERD responses were elicited, and with increasing memory load, these beta ERD responses became longer in duration. Additionally, beta ERS responses were observed in the 0- and 1-back memory load conditions. The current results reveal a complex interplay between brain oscillations at different frequencies during a cognitive task performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whether compromised attentional selectivity or abnormal target detection causes schizophrenia subjects' poor performance on visual attention tasks, therefore, is unknown. To address this issue, we measured the neural activity (using electroencephalography) of 17 schizophrenia and 17 healthy subjects during a target identification task. Participants viewed superimposed images (horizontal and vertical bars differing in color) and attended to one image to identify bar width changes in specific locations. Bars were frequency tagged so attention directed to unique parts of the images could be tracked. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) were used to quantify attention-related neural activity to specific parts of the visual images. Behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to the target events were used to quantify target detection abilities. For both schizophrenia and healthy subjects, attending to specific parts of the attended image enhanced brain activity related to attended bars and reduced activity evoked by unattended bars. Activity in relation to the spatially overlapping unattended image was unaffected. Schizophrenia patients, however, were impaired on target detection abilities on both behavioral and brain activity measures. Target-related behavioral and brain activity measures were highly correlated in both groups. These findings indicate that deficient target detection rather than compromised attentional selectivity accounts for previously reported visual attention deficits in schizophrenia.

In agreement with a recent hypothesis, in the first of 3 companion papers, large-scale computer simulations of the sleeping thalamocortical system showed that a decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for the decline in SWA. In the model, the reduction in SWA was accompanied by decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, decreased wave slopes, and increased number of waves with multiple peaks. In a second companion paper in the rat, local field potential recordings during early and late sleep confirmed the predictions of the model.(4) Here, we investigated the model's predictions in humans by using all-night high-density (hd)-EEG recordings to explore slow-wave parameters over the entire cortical mantle. Design: 256-channel EEG recordings in humans over the course of an entire night's sleep. Setting: Sound-attenuated sleep research room Patients or Participants: Seven healthy male subjects Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: During late sleep (non-rapid eye movement [NREM] episodes 3 and 4, toward morning), when compared with early sleep (NREM sleep episodes I and 2, at the beginning of the night), the analysis revealed (1) reduced SWA, (2) fewer large-amplitude slow waves, (3) decreased wave slopes, (4) more frequent multipeak waves. The decrease in slope between early and late sleep was present even when waves were directly matched by wave amplitude and slow-wave power in the background EEG. Finally, hd-EEG showed that multipeak waves have multiple cortical origins. Conclusions: In the human EEG, the decline of SWA during sleep is accompanied by changes in slow-wave parameters that were predicted by a computer model simulating a homeostatic reduction of cortical synaptic strength.

However, the relationships between memory consolidation and hippocampal EEG features remain unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of both procedural and declarative learning on qualitative and quantitative measures of sleep by recording stereo-EEG (SEEG) directly from the hippocampus and the neocortex in a group of epileptic patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluations. Following a baseline night, sleep was recorded after administration of a declarative (paired-associate word list learning task) and a procedural (sequential finger tapping) task. Patients were tested before going to bed (test) and after sleep in the following morning (retest). At retest, we found that patients recalled correctly more word pairs Compared to the pre-sleep test (declarative task), and they were slightly faster in performing the motor task (procedural task). Standard polysomnography showed an increase in the amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) only after Procedural learning, paralleled by an increase of hippocampal SEEG power in the very low frequency range (VLF, 0.5-1 Hz) during the first NREM sleep cycle. Moreover, procedural performance enhancement and SEEG power increase in the hippocampal VLF were significantly correlated, indicating a link between procedural memory consolidation and slow hippocampal SEEG rhythms. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of synaptic homeostasis occurring during sleep, suggesting that hippocampal slow oscillations are associated with local processes of post-learning synaptic downscaling.

This research suggests that specific changes in neuronal synchrony occur during cognitive processing, distinguished by emergence of fast oscillations in the gamma frequency range. To determine whether the development of high-frequency brain oscillations can be related to the development of cognitive abilities, we studied the power spectra of resting EEG in children 16, 24 and 36 months of age. Individual differences in the distribution of frontal gamma power during rest were highly correlated with concurrent language and cognitive skills at all ages. Gamma power was also associated with attention measures; children who were observed as having better inhibitory control and more mature attention shifting abilities had higher gamma power density functions. We included a group of children with a family history of language impairment (FH+) and thus at higher risk for language disorders. FH+ children, as a group, showed consistently lower gamma over frontal regions than the well-matched FH- controls with no such family history (FH-). We suggest that the emergence of high-frequency neural synchrony may be critical for cognitive and linguistic development, and that children at risk for language impairments may lag in this process.

However, it remains unclear whether frequency-specific characteristics exist in the resting-state fMRI signal. in this study, fMRI signals in five functional brain networks (sensorimotor, 'default mode', visual, amygdala, and hippocampus) were decomposed into various frequency bands within a low-frequency range (0-0.24 Hz). Results show that the correlations in cortical networks concentrate within ultra-low frequencies (0.01-0.06 Hz) while connections within limbic networks distribute over a wider frequency range (0.01-0.14 Hz), suggesting distinct frequency-specific features in the resting-state PORI signal within these functional networks. Moreover, the connectivity decay rates along the frequency bands are positively Correlated with the physical distances between connected brain regions and seed points. This distance-frequency relationship might be attributed to a larger attenuation of synchrony of brain regions separated with longer distance and/or connected with more synaptic steps.

The classification algorithm of the EEG signals has attracted much attention. In this paper, an experiment is designed on imaginary left or right hand movements and a new algorithm is proposed to identify different EEG patterns. Butterworth filter has been applied to retrieve the useful signals. Interference noise has been eliminated using a digital filter. The wavelet entropy is treated as one feature in our approach. The adaptive autoregressive model combined with the event-related desynchronization is used in our research to obtain the other feature. Two obtained features reflect time domain and frequency domain features of EEG signal, and will be used by a BP neural network for training. Simulation has been carried out and the results of the simulation show that this approach can restrain noise disturbance and can effectively express mental states. When used in the classification of special events in brain-computer interface, this approach has some advantage. Moreover, it can be used for the online analysis.

In this work, we verified the effects of zinc chelation in an animal model of epileptogenesis induced by amygdala rapid kindling. The basolateral. amygdala was electrically stimulated ten times per day for 2 days. A single stimulus was applied on the third day. Stimulated animals received injections of PBS or the zinc chelator diethildythiocarbamate acid (DEDTC) before each stimulus series. Animals were monitored with video-EEG and were perfused 3 h after the last stimulus for subsequent neo-Timm and Ftuoro-Jade B analysis. Zinc chelation decreased the duration of both behavioral seizures and electrical after-discharges, and also decreased the EEG spikes frequency, without changing the progression of behavioral seizure severity. These results indicate that the zinc ion may have a facilitatory role during kindling progression. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To systematically assess the relationship between the onset and end of this period and spontaneous hippocampal activity, we used silicon depth electrodes in unanaesthetized head-fixed rats from postnatal day (P)2 to P18. At all ages, hippocampal sharp waves (SPWs) were prominent in the EEG. Beginning at P6, however, marked changes in SPWs and associated oscillations were detected. SPW-related 'gamma tails' (60-100 Hz) and 'ripples' (140-200 Hz) were first observed at P6 and P7, respectively, and both oscillations persisted up to P18. Transiently, between P6 and P11, SPW duration decreased and the occurrence of SPW doublets increased. In addition, between P8 and P11, a subset of rats exhibited 'spontaneous potentiated SPWs' characterized by double polarity reversals, enhanced likelihood of gamma tails, and population spikes. Having identified a suite of transient hippocampal features consistent with a window of increased excitability, we next assessed whether electrographic seizure activity would be most easily induced during this period. To do this, kainic acid (KA; 200 ng/infusion) was infused into the hippocampus contralateral to the recording probe. KA did not induce seizure activity until P7 and reached peak effectiveness at P9. Thereafter, sensitivity to KA declined. All together, these findings provide in vivo neurophysiological support for the notion of a developmental window of heightened seizure susceptibility during the second postnatal week, and also suggest that spontaneous nonpathological hippocampal activity can be used to mark the onset and end of this period.

Electrocortical and electrodermal responses covary as a function of emotional arousal: A single-trial analysis	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dense-array EEG; emotion; motivation; arousal; picture perception; skin conductance response	EVOKED-POTENTIAL TOPOGRAPHY; VISUAL CORTICAL AREAS; HUMAN AMYGDALA; BRAIN; MODULATION; FEAR; EEG; CONNECTIONS; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	Electrophysiological studies of human visual perception typically involve averaging across trials distributed over time during an experimental session. Using an oscillatory presentation, in which affective or neutral pictures were presented for 6 s, flickering on and off at a rate of 10 Hz, the present study examined single trials of steady-state visual evoked potentials. Moving window averaging and subsequent Fourier analysis at the stimulation frequency yielded spectral amplitude measures of electrocortical activity. Cronbach's alpha reached values >.79, across electrodes. Single-trial electrocortical activation was significantly related to the size of the skin conductance response recorded during affective picture viewing. These results suggest that individual trials of steady-state potentials may yield reliable indices of electrocortical activity in visual cortex and that amplitude modulation of these indices varies with emotional engagement.

We analyzed time series of coupled nonlinear model systems and multi-channel, multi-day electroencephalographic recordings from epilepsy patients that we used as local perturbations to our media. We show that the method allows one to estimate the degree of zero-lag phase synchronization even in noisy signals and can be applied for the analysis of human electroencephalograms with the aim of epileptic seizure prediction.

The tool uses cross wavelet transform, coherence, bi-spectrum/bicoherence and phase synchronization. Using specimen data recorded from the hippocampus of a rat with experimentally induced focal epilepsy, linear and non-linear correlations between neuronal oscillations in the CA1 and CA3 regions have been computed. The results of this real case study show that the computational tool can successfully analyse and quantify the temporal interactions between neuronal oscillators and could be employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying epilepsy.

The paper discusses major aspects of performing research using EEG/ERP based experiments including the recording of the signals, removing noise, estimating ERP signals, and signal analysis for better understanding of the neural correlates of processes involved in creativity. Important factors to be kept in mind to record clean EEG signal in creativity research are discussed. The recorded EEG signal can be corrupted by various sources of noise and methodologies to handle the presence of unwanted artifacts and filtering noise are presented followed by methods to estimate ERPs from the EEG signals from multiple trials. The EEG and ERP signals are further analyzed using various techniques including spectral analysis, coherence analysis, and non-linear signal analysis. These analysis techniques provide a way to understand the spatial activations and temporal development of large scale electrical activity in the brain during creative tasks. The use of this methodology will further enhance our understanding the processes neural and cognitive processes involved in creativity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The added value of simultaneous EEG and amplitude-integrated EEG recordings in three newborn infants	NEONATOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram; amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram; pitfalls	CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; FULL-TERM INFANTS; PREDICTIVE VALUE; SEIZURES; BIRTH; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ASPHYXIA	Amplitude-integrated electroencephalograms (aEEGs) recorded by cerebral function monitors (CFMs) are used increasingly to monitor the cerebral activity of newborn infants with encephalopathy. Recently, new CFM devices became available which also reveal the original EEG signals from the same leads. To date it was unclear whether this single-lead EEG provides additional information towards interpreting the aEEG traces more accurately. Our report deals with three cases in which the single-lead EEG from the CFM device did indeed reveal important additional information not provided by the aEEG alone. In cases 1 and 3, the aEEGs showed drifting of the baseline to higher amplitudes. The single-lead EEG revealed that this was due to muscle artefacts, high-frequency oscillation ventilation and the electrocardiogram rather than to cerebral activity. Hence, without knowledge of the EEG, the aEEG trace might have been misinterpreted as being fairly normal. Case 2 showed paroxysmal elevation of the lower margin of the amplitude on the aEEG which looked like epileptic activity. However, additional information from the single-lead EEG revealed that it was due to muscle artefacts. Thus, simultaneously recorded EEG can help to interpret seizure-like episodes on the aEEG. Conclusion: Simultaneously recorded single-lead EEGs can help to interpret aEEG traces more accurately. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

J	Aarabi, A; Grebe, R; Wallois, F				Aarabi, Ardalan; Grebe, Reinhard; Wallois, Fabrice			A multistage knowledge-based system for EEG seizure detection in newborn infants	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						feature extraction; feature selection; mutual information; relevance; redundancy; EEG; classification; pattern recognition; seizure detection; newborn	NEONATAL SEIZURES; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Objective: Automatic seizure detection has attracted attention as a method to obtain valuable information concerning the duration, timing, and frequency of seizures. Methods currently used to detect EEG seizures in adults show high false detection rates in neonates because they lack information about specific age-dependent features of normal and pathological EEG and artifacts. This paper describes a novel multistage knowledge-based seizure detection system for newborn infants to identify and classify normal and pathological newborn EEGs as well as seizures with a reduced false detection rate. Methods: We developed the system in a way to make comprehensive use of spatial and temporal contextual information obtained from multichannel EEGs. The system development consists of six major stages: (i) EEG data collection and bandpass filtering; (ii) automatic artifact detection; (iii) feature extraction from segments of non-seizure and seizure activities; (iv) feature selection via the relevance and redundancy analysis; (v) EEG classification and pattern recognition using a trained multilayer back-propagation neural network; and (v) knowledge-based decision-making to examine each of possible EEG patterns from a multi-channel perspective. The system was developed and tested with the EEG recordings of 10 newborns aged between 39 and 42 weeks. Results: The overall sensitivity, selectivity, and average detection rate of the system were 74%, 70.1%, and 79.7%, respectively. The average false detection of 1.55/h was also achieved by the system with a feature reduction up to 80%. Conclusions: The expert rule-based decision-making subsystem accompanying the classifier helped to reduce the false detection rate, reject a wide variety of artifacts, and discriminate various patterns of EEG. Significance: This paper may serve as a guide for the selection of discriminative features to improve the accuracy of conventional seizure detection systems for routine clinical EEG interpretation and brain activity monitoring in newborns especially those hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care units.

Mu and alpha EEG rhythms during the arrest reaction in microgravity	MICROGRAVITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of Science on European Soyuz Missions to the ISS	JUN 27-30, 2006	Toledo, SPAIN				POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN VESTIBULAR CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; HUMANS; SPACE; REPRESENTATIONS; MODULATION	Mu and alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are the most prominent electroencephalographic rhythms observed in awake, relaxed subjects. Different cortical sources may participate in these oscillations and appear to be modulated by the sensorimotor context and Junctional demands. In microgravity, the marked reduction in multimodal graviceptive inputs to cortical networks participating in the representation of space could be expected to affect these spontaneous rhythms. Here, we deport the results of an experiment conducted over the course of 3 space flights, in which we quantified the power of the mu and alpha rhythms in relation to the arrest reaction (i.e. in 2 distinct physiological states: eyes open and eyes closed). We observed that the power of the spontaneous mu and alpha rhythms recorded in the eyes-closed state in the sensorimotor areas (mu rhythm) and in the parieto-occipital cortex (alpha rhythm) increased in microgravity. The suppression coefficient produced by eye-opening/closure state transition also increased in microgravity. These results are discussed in terms of current theories on the source and the physiological significance of these EEG rhythms.

We recorded the cortical brain activity from 40 subjects (M:F=20:20) during local and global stimuli cognition process. The stimuli were generated based on the modified version of Navon's hierarchical structured stimuli [1]. We found the differences in 4 similar to 8 Hz theta oscillation during the task between male and female groups in sLORETA patterns, particularly in the right temporal cortex. We also found the similar theta oscillation patterns in power spectrum analysis: higher synchronized theta activity between posterior parietal lobe and frontal lobe was found in female group than that of male group. These findings suggest higher dependence on local-global stimulation cognition and memory recall in female. We suggest that sLORETA can be a good tool for detecting local-global stimulus cognition and be a good diagnostic for the neuropsychiatric disorders related to the local-global processing such as Obsessive-compulsive disorder and Posttraumatic stress disorder.

We explore the possibility that such linkages may be manifest in the interictal EEG apart from epileptiform disturbances or visually evident focal abnormalities. We analyzed samples of interictal intracranial EEG (ICEEG) recorded from subdural grids in nine patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy, measuring interelectrode synchrony using the mean phase coherence algorithm. This analysis revealed areas of elevated local synchrony, or "hypersynchrony" which had persistent spatiotemporal characteristics that were unique to each patient. Measuring local synchrony in a subdural grid results in a map of the cortical surface that provides information not visually apparent on either EEG or structural imaging. We explore the relationship of hypersynchronous areas to the clinical evidence of seizure localization in each case, and speculate that local hypersynchrony may be a marker of epileptogenic cortex, and may prove to be a valuable aid to clinical ICEEG interpretation.

These oscillations are highly heritable, are modulated by genes controlling neurotransmitters in the brain, and provide links to associative and integrative brain functions. These enclophenotypes represent traits that are less complex and more proximal to gene function than either diagnostic labels or traditional cognitive measures, providing a powerful strategy in searching for genes in psychiatric disorders. These intermediate phenotypes identify both affected and unaffected members of an affected family, including offspring at risk, providing a more direct connection with underlying biological vulnerability. Our group has utilized heritable neurophysiological features (i.e., brain oscillations) as endophenotypes, making it possible to identify susceptibility genes that may be difficult to detect with diagnosis alone. We have discussed our findings of significant linkage and association between brain oscillations and genes in GABAergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic systems (GABRA2, CHRM2, and GRM8). We have also shown that some oscillatory indices from both resting and active cognitive states have revealed a common subset of genetic foci that are shared with the diagnosis of alcoholism and related disorders. Implications of our findings have been discussed in the context of physiological and pharmacological studies on receptor function. These findings underscore the utility of quantitative neurophysiological endophenotypes in the study of the genetics of brain function and the genetic diathesis underlying complex psychiatric disorders.

The heritabilities of the bipolar EEG spectral power ranged from 0.10 to 0.63 in 38 electrode-pairs, and those of monopolar power ranged from 0.23 to 0.68 in 19 electrodes in six frequency bands from theta to high beta. The bipolar data shows significantly greater topographic variation compared to that of the monopolar data. The mean of bivariate genetic correlations were consistently lower for the bipolar data and the coefficients of variation consistently higher when compared to those of the monopolar data for each of the frequency bands. The results from the bipolar derivations are in greater accord with genetic findings in brain anatomy and show the possibility of multiple genetic sources for the phenotypic variability of EEG activity.

Here, we studied the interconnection of slow shifts (0.01 Hz high-pass) in surface EEG and hippocampal shifts as emerging in an event-related EEG biofeedback paradigm. Hippocampal EEG activity was monitored by depth electrodes implanted in four epilepsy patients for presurgical evaluation. Trials were sorted according to the near-DC shifts occurring at the surface position Cz, which was the feedback electrode, into positive, indistinct (i.e., small or biphasic) and negative shifts. We found significant hippocampal near-DC shifts being positively or negatively correlated to the shifts in surface EEG in all four patients. The amplitudes of the hippocampal near-DC shifts were several times larger than the surface shifts. The polarity of the shifts appears to depend on the location of the electrode contacts with respect to the hippocampal subfields. The finding that neocortical and hippocampal near-DC shifts are interconnected may open new perspectives for the prediction and control of mediotemporal lobe seizures. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We estimated the additive genetic heritability of resting bipolar EEG power spectra in a large sample of non-twin sibling pairs. The corresponding heritabilities ranged between 0.220 and 0.647 and were highly significant at all 38 electrode pairs for theta (3-7 Hz), low-alpha (7-9 Hz), high-alpha (9-12 Hz), low-beta (12-16 Hz), middle-beta (1620 Hz) and high-beta (20-28 Hz) frequency bands. The heritabilities were the highest in the high-alpha and low-beta bands at most electrode pairs. The heritabilities were most variable across the head in the three beta bands. Other heritability patterns were also identified within each frequency band. Our results suggest that substantial proportions of the variability in the bipolar EEG measures are explained by genetic factors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data Mining in EEG: Application to Epileptic Brain Disorders	DATA MINING IN BIOMEDICINE	Springer Series in Optimization and Its Applications		English	Article; Book Chapter						Chaos Theory; Data Mining; Optimization; Electroencephalogram; Classification; Seizure prediction	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; SEIZURES; OPTIMIZATION	Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders. At least 40 million people or about 1% of the population worldwide currently suffer from epilepsy. Despite advances in neurology and neuroscience, approximately 25-30% of epileptic patients remain unresponsive to anti-epileptic drug treatment, which is the standard therapy for epilepsy. There is a growing body of evidence and interest in predicting epileptic seizures using intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a tool for evaluating the physiological state of the brain. Although recent studies in the EEG dynamics have been used to demonstrate seizure predictability, the question of whether the brain's normal and pre-seizure epileptic activities are distinctive or differentiable remains unanswered. In this study, we apply data mining techniques to EEG data in order to verify the classifiability of the brain dynamics. We herein propose a quantitative analysis derived from the chaos theory to investigate the brain dynamics. We employ measures of chaoticity and complexity of EEG signals, including Short-Term Maximum Lyapunov Exponents, Angular Frequency, and Entropy, which were previously shown capable of contemplating dynamical mechanisms of the brain network. Each of these measures can be used to display the state transition toward seizures, in which different states of patients can be classified (normal, pre-seizure, and post-seizure states). In addition, optimization and data mining techniques are herein proposed for the extraction of classifiable features of the brain's normal and pre-seizure epileptic states from spontaneous EEG. We use these features in study of classification of the brain's normal and epileptic activities. A statistical cross validation is implemented to estimate the accuracy of the brain state classification. The results of this study indicate that it may be possible to design and develop efficient seizure warning algorithms for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Creativity related cortex activity in the remote associates task	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						creativity; EEG mapping; beta; alpha; theta; attention systems	EEG-ALPHA; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; NEUROBIOLOGY; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; SEX	The involvement of different oscillating neuronal systems during verbal creative thinking was investigated by multi-channel EEG measuring. The remote associates task (RAT) as a model of creative thinking in comparison to the resting condition and the simple associates task (SAT) was used. The EEG coherence along with spectral power density estimates were evaluated in each of the six frequency bands in 4-30 Hz range. We have found out RAT-related EEG changes mainly in the theta 1, alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 2 bands. The RAT-induced cortical activation was differed from the SAT-induced EEG pattern by (i) widespread enhancement of power and coherence in the beta 2, (ii) the 01 power increase in the frontal cortex, and (iii) increased desynchronization of the alpha 1, alpha 2 mainly over posterior cortex together with the alpha 1 coherence decrease in the prefrontal sites. Originality scores of the verbal associates positively correlated with an increase of coherence focused in the fronto-parietal regions of both hemispheres in the beta 2 and in the left parieto-temporal loci in the alpha 1. Additionally, more original responses positively correlated with amplitude of the alpha 1 mostly in the left hemisphere. We propose that widespread cortical integration of multi-component internal processing has been simultaneously mediated during creative verbal thinking. The selectively distributed theta, alpha, and beta oscillations reflect intra- and inter-hemispheric communication networks with different functional relations to the RAT solving. The theta 1 and alpha 1 rhythms seem to specifically relate to top-down information processing such as deliberate sustained attention and working-memory-retention during defocused attention, respectively, whereas larger interregional synchrony in the beta 2 band may mediate 'differential' attention to diffusely activating alternative meanings of words and remote associates from coarse semantic coding.

We aimed to study deviations from the norm of different resting EEG parameters in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We compared spectral parameters of the resting EEG of PD patients (n = 24, median age 67 years) to those of healthy controls (n = 34, median age 62 years). On average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2-100 Hz, and the dominant peak was shifted towards lower frequencies. Maximal differences appeared in the 6-9 Hz theta band in all electrodes. Frontal electrodes contributed most to this difference in the 4-6 Hz theta, 12-18 Hz beta and 30-45 Hz gamma bands. On an individual basis, the combination of six spectral power band parameters discriminated between patient and control groups and 72% of all subjects were classified correctly. Using LORETA source analysis, the generators of this power difference were localized to fronto-insulotemporal cortical areas in the theta and beta bands, and to interhemispheric frontal (supplementary motor area, SMA) and cingulate areas in the 30-45 Hz gamma band. We calculated spectral coherence between electrode pairs in a frontal, central and parietal region of interest (ROI). In the frontal ROI, coherence was enhanced significantly in the patient group in the theta, high beta and gamma bands. In the parietal ROI, patients showed lower coherence around 10 Hz. We demonstrate a deviation from the norm of different resting EEG parameters in PD patients. This evidence can be integrated in the context of a pathophysiological chain reaction initiated in the substantia nigra and resulting in a cortical aberrant dynamics rooted in enhanced dysrhythmic thalamocortical interactions.

Quantification and visualisation of differences between two motor tasks based on energy density maps for brain-computer interface applications	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						BCI; energy density map; ERD/ERS; EEG; motor task; mental tasks	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; TIME-FREQUENCY MICROSTRUCTURE; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; ERD/ERS PATTERNS; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; ERD; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; IMAGERY	Objective: To determine the most discriminative features for a brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on statistically significant differences between two energy density maps calculated from EEG signals during two different motor tasks. Methods: EEG was recorded in ten healthy volunteers while performing different cue based, 3 s sustained, real and imaginary right hand movements. Energy density maps were calculated over fixed 240 ms and 2 Hz time-frequency windows (called resets) for each movement and statistically significant resets were determined. After that, normalised energy values of the statistically significant resets were compared between two real as well as between two imaginary movements using a parametric test. Results: The largest differences between energy density maps between two motor tasks were noticed on electrode location Cp3 in the higher alpha and the beta bands (i.e., 12-30 Hz), for both real and imaginary movements. The method reduced a total number of discriminative features between two motor tasks to fewer than 2% for the imaginary and fewer than 3% for the real movements on the electrode location Cp3. Conclusions: The method can be used for visualisation and feature extraction for BCI and other applications where event related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) maps should be compared. Significance: If a reliable on-line classification of imaginary movements of the same limb would be achieved it could be combined with classification of movements of different parts of the body.

J	Hughes, SW; Crunelli, V				Hughes, Stuart W.; Crunelli, Vincenzo			Just a phase they're going through: The complex interaction of intrinsic high-threshold bursting and gap junctions in the generation of thalamic alpha and theta rhythms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Mu rhythm; dendrites; metabotropic glutamate receptor; gap junctions	NEURONS IN-VITRO; EEG ALPHA; ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY TASK; HAND AREA; OSCILLATIONS; CAT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CORTEX	Rhythms in the a frequency band (8-13 Hz) are a defining feature of the human EEG during relaxed wakefulness and are known to be influenced by the thalamus. In the early stages of sleep and in several neurological and psychiatric conditions a rhythms are replaced by slower activity in the theta (3-7 Hz) band. Of particular interest is how these alpha and theta rhythms are generated at the cellular level. Recently we identified a subset of thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) which exhibit rhythmic high-threshold (>-55 mV) bursting at similar to 2-13 Hz and which are interconnected by gap junctions (GJs). These cells combine to generate a locally synchronized continuum of alpha and theta oscillations, thus providing direct evidence that the thalamus can act as an independent pacemaker of alpha and theta rhythms. Interestingly, GJ coupled pairs of TC neurons can exhibit both in-phase and anti-phase synchrony and will often spontaneously alternate between these two states. This dictates that the local field oscillation amplitude is not simply linked to the extent of cell recruitment into a single synchronized neuronal assembly but also to the degree of destructive interference between dynamic, spatially overlapping, competing anti-phase groups of continuously bursting neurons. Thus, the waxing and waning of thalamic alpha/theta rhythms should not be assumed to reflect a wholesale increase and reduction, respectively, in underlying neuronal synchrony. We argue that these network dynamics might have important consequences for relating changes in the amplitude of EEG alpha and theta rhythms to the activity of thalamic networks.

For this purpose, activity was segmented into three different time windows: of 62.5, 250 and 500 ms. Two strategies were used: one a statistical comparison of changes between T-REM, Ph-REM and PRE-EM; the other a descriptive approach using principal component analysis. Significant findings showed that both EEG and MEG gamma activity are higher directly before eye movement onset in PRE-EM periods and during Ph-REM than during T-REM; temporal coupling of electrical activity between the frontal and parietal regions is decreased, while temporal coupling between the right frontal and midline is increased. just before eye movement onset, larger recording sites become related. For the first time, results showed a close temporal link between power and temporal coupling of fast oscillations and rapid eye movements in REM sleep, indicating increased activation, uncoupling between the left frontal executive areas and posterior sensory association regions and increased coupling between the right frontal attentional and midline alerting systems. Brain activity is reorganized by phasic events. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These four parameters, i.e. the dilation, chirprate, modulation and translation, have clear physical meanings and to optimize these parameters is an extremely difficult task. In this paper, a fast procedure is introduced without explicitly exploring these parameters over the continuous search space. Here, these four parameters together with a phase parameter for real signal are assigned with random values across their full ranges, creating a large library of candidate Gabor atoms. Then a fast algorithm is used to select atoms from the library that best approximate the nonstationary signal. The computational complexity of the method is only linearly related with the library size, the number of signal points and the number of used atoms. The proposed method is applied to several benchmark problems from life systems, including the bat signals, EEG signals and speech signals. The simulation results confirm its efficacy.

It has been argued that these oscillations could be explained by recurrent feedback between different levels of visual processing. We simulated two layers of simple spiking neurons in a minimal network. Synaptic strengths of feedforward as well as feedback connections were systematically varied. The network was stimulated with patterns that were either completely or partially represented by convergent connections between the layers, or that were not represented in the connectivity pattern of the network. Transient, stimulus-locked spike trains with a frequency of approximate to 40 Hz were observed for stimuli that were represented in the connectivity pattern of the network, but not for stimuli that were not represented in the connectivity pattern.

Methods: Twelve young OSAS patients (mean age 38.2 +/- 2.0 y) and 13 older OSAS patients (mean age 62.2 +/- 1.9 y) along with 13 young controls (mean age 35.8 +/- 2.0 y) and 14 older controls (mean age 60.2 +/- 2.0 y) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation followed by a waking EEG recording. As a global index of cortical slowing, a ratio of slow-to-fast frequencies was calculated in all cortical regions. Daytime performance was assessed using the four choice reaction time test. Results: Differences in waking EEG and in daytime performance were analyzed by ANOVAs with Group and Age as factors. Waking EEG did not yield a Group by Age interaction. OSAS patients had higher ratios across all regions than controls. Similarly, daytime performance revealed no Group by Age interaction. However, OSAS patients showed more lapses than controls and older subjects were slower than younger subjects. Conclusions: Our results indicate that age does not interact with OSAS to worsen the severity of cortical slowing, but age can add to the OSAS effect to worsen daytime performance deficits in OSAS patients. Significance: The daytime performance deficits observed particularly in elderly OSAS patients warrant a careful clinical assessment of these patients to prevent accidents and injuries.

According to some recent reports, the phase characteristics of the signals play an important rote in the information transfer and coding. The mechanism of phase shifts, regarding the information processing, is also known as the phase coding of information. Objective: The authors would like to show that etectroencephalographic (EEG) signals, measured during the performance of different gripping-force control tasks, carry enough information for the successful prediction of the gripping force, as applied by the subjects, when using a methodology based on the phase demodulation of EEG data. Since the presented methodology is non-invasive it could be used as an alternative approach for the development of BCIs. Materials and methods: In order to predict the gripping force from the EEG signals we used a methodology that uses subsequent signal processing methods: simplistic filtering methods, for extracting the appropriate brain rhythm; principal component analysis, for achieving the linear independence and detecting the source of the signal; and the phase-demodulation method, for extracting the phase-coded information about the gripping force. A fuzzy inference system is then used to predict the gripping force from the processed EEG data. Results: The proposed methodology has clearly demonstrated that EEG signals carry enough information for a successful prediction of the subject's performance. Moreover, a cross-validation showed that information about the gripping force is encoded in a very similar way between the subjects tested. As for the development of BCIs, considering the computational time to pre-process the data and train the fuzzy model, a real-time online analysis would be possible if the real-time non-causal limitations of the methodology could be overcome. Conclusion: The study has shown that phase coding in the human brain is a possible mechanism for information coding or transfer during visuo-motor tasks, while the phase-coded content about the gripping forces can be successfully extracted using the phase-demodulation approach. Since the methodology has proven to be appropriate for the case of this study it could also be used as an alternative approach for the development of BCIs for similar tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Several algorithms have been proposed to suppress these artefacts and most of them have shown important improvements with respect to uncorrected signals. However, the relative performances of these algorithms have not been properly assessed. In particular, it is not known to what extent such algorithms deteriorate the EEG signal of interest. In this study, we propose to cross-validate different methods proposed for artefact correction, using a forward model to generate EEG and MR-related artefacts. The methods are assessed under various experimental conditions (described in terms of EEG sampling rate, artefacts amplitude, frequency band of interest, etc.). Using experimental data, we also tested the performance of the correction methods for alpha rhythm imaging and for epileptic spike reconstruction. Results show that most of the methods allow the observation of the modulation of alpha rhythms and the identification of spikes, despite subtle differences between algorithms. They also show that over-filtering the data may degrade the EEG. Our results indicate that the optimal artefact removal technique should be chosen according to whether one is interested in fast (> 10 Hz) vs. slow (< 10 Hz) oscillations or in evoked vs. ongoing activity.

Imaging functional brain connectivity patterns from high-resolution EEG and fMRI via graph theory	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain connectivity; partial directed coherence; fMRI; high-resolution EEG; stroop task; graph theory	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COLOR-WORD INTERFERENCE; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; ATTENTION; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; MODEL	We describe a set of computational tools able to estimate cortical activity and connectivity from high- resolution EEG and fMRI recordings in humans. These methods comprise the estimation of cortical activity using realistic geometry head volume conductor models and distributed cortical source models, followed by the evaluation of cortical connectivity between regions of interest coincident with the Brodmann areas via the use of Partial Directed Coherence. Connectivity patterns estimated on the cortical surface in different frequency bands are then imaged and interpreted with measures based on graph theory. These computational tools were applied on a set of EEG and fMRI data from a Stroop task to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. The present findings suggest that the methodology is able to identify differences in functional connectivity patterns elicited by different experimental tasks or conditions.

We asked whether task-induced EEG spectra remain stable over more than a year. We recorded EEG in 41 healthy adults who performed a modified Sternberg task. In 20 subjects EEG was recorded in a second session with retest intervals 12-40 months. For electrodes AFz, Cz and Pz peak frequency and peak height were determined. We compared the curve shape of power spectra by regressing spectra pairwise onto each other and calculated a t-value. The t-value and pairwise differences in peak frequency and peak height between all sessions were entered into a generalized linear model (GLM) where binary output represents the recognition probability. The results were cross-validated by out-of-sample testing. Of the 40 sessions, 35 were correctly matched. The shape of power spectra contributed most to recognition. Out of all 2400 pairwise comparisons 99.3% were correct, with sensitivity 87.5% and specificity 99.5%. The intra-individual stability is high compared to the inter-individual variation. Thus, interleaved EEG-fMRI measurements are valid. Furthermore, longitudinal effects on cognitive EEG can be judged against the intra-individual variability in subjects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The template matching index was calculated based on correlation coefficient with the template, which was further classified by linear discriminant analysis classifier to distinguish the imagined movements, The 9-subject left/right motor imagery data from NIPS2001 (Neural Information Processing System) competition were used to test the algorithm offline. The tenfold cross-validation averaged accuracy was 79.3%, better than previously reported accuracy. A pilot experiment was subsequently Performed online on four subjects. Three of the four subjects achieved an accuracy of more than 70% at the end of the 15-minute training session.

In the resting state, cold stimulation mostly induced intensification of the delta activity, while, when coinciding with the performance of voluntary movements, it also resulted in increases in the powers of oscillations of the alpha1 and beta1 ranges. The structure of changes in the coefficients of coherence under the influence of cooling also depended on the conditions of testing (in the resting state or during motor activity). Therefore, the effect of tonic cold stimulation on the interaction between synchronizing and desynchronizing cerebral systems and interrelations between different cortical zones was modified under conditions of realization of a motor function.

We compared the inter-individual variation in spectral observables to the intra-individual stability over more than a year. Methods: We recorded resting EEG in 55 healthy adults with eyes closed. In 20 persons EEG was recorded in a second session with retest intervals 12-40 months. For electrodes AFz, Cz and Pz alpha peak frequency and a peak height were transformed into Z-scores. We compared the curve shape of power spectra by first aligning alpha peaks to 10 Hz and then regressing spectra pairwise onto each other to calculate a t-value. The t-value and differences of Z-scores for all pairs of sessions were entered into a generalized linear model (GLM) where binary output represents the recognition probability. The results were cross-validated by out-of-sample testing. Results: Of the 40 sessions, 35 were correctly matched. The shape of power spectra contributed most to recognition. Out of all 2960 pairwise comparisons 99.5% were correct, with sensitivity 88% and, specificity 99.5%. Conclusions: Our statistical apparatus allows to identify those spectral EEG observables which qualify as statistical signature of a person. Significance: The effect of external factors on EEG observables can be contrasted against their normal variability over time. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Whereas propagated seizures are known to disrupt cerebral activity, little work has been done on remote network effects of seizures that do not propagate. Human focal temporal lobe seizures demonstrate remote changes including slow waves on electroencephalography ( EEG) and decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the neocortex. Ictal neocortical slow waves have been interpreted as seizure propagation; however, we hypothesize that they reflect a depressed cortical state resembling sleep or coma. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed multimodal studies of partial and secondarily generalized limbic seizures in rats. Video/EEG monitoring of spontaneous seizures revealed slow waves in the frontal cortex during behaviorally mild partial seizures, contrasted with fast polyspike activity during convulsive generalized seizures. Seizures induced by hippocampal stimulation produced a similar pattern, and were used to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging weighted for blood oxygenation and blood volume, demonstrating increased signals in hippocampus, thalamus and septum, but decreases in orbito-frontal, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortex during partial seizures, and increases in all of these regions during propagated seizures. Combining these results with neuronal recordings and CBF measurements, we related neocortical slow waves to reduced neuronal activity and cerebral metabolism during partial seizures, but found increased neuronal activity and metabolism during propagated seizures. These findings suggest that ictal neocortical slow waves represent an altered cortical state of depressed function, not propagated seizure activity. This remote effect of partial seizures may cause impaired cerebral functions, including loss of consciousness.

EEG was recorded from 25 (16 male) right-handed healthy young adults. EEG data were segmented into one 1-s baseline epoch before each event and two 1-s epochs after event onset. Power estimates (mu V-2) were derived with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for each artefact free event. Both of the studied events evoked increased occipital theta (4-6 Hz) responses as compared to the pre-event baseline. The wounding event evoked also increased occipital high theta (6-8 Hz) response and the killing event evoked low alpha (8-10 Hz) asymmetry over the central electrodes, both relative to the pre-event baseline. The results are discussed in light of facial electromyographic and electrodermal activity responses evoked by these same events, and it is suggested that the reported EEG responses may be attributable to affective processes related to these violent game events.

Functional correlates of oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency windows are interpreted in several ways. However, only a small number of reports indicate the need for overall interpretations by integrating all type of results. The present essay emphasizes the importance of developing a common overview by considering sensory and cognitive inputs, in studies comparing healthy subjects with subjects with cognitive impairments. By doing this, the present report briefly outlines some general aspects and rules in the study of brain oscillations. The use in clinical studies of drugs mimicking neurotransmitters is also taken into consideration for a more complete analysis. A prominent extension to the study of functional correlates of brain functions is the new emerging results in oscillatory processes in the spinal cord and the autonomous system.

What you see is not (always) what you hear: Induced gamma band responses reflect cross-modal interactions in familiar object recognition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; event-related potentials; EEG; gamma; human; multisensory; object recognition; oscillations; visual	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; HUMANS; CORTEX; BRAIN; TASK; REPETITION; SYNCHRONY; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Gamma-band responses (GBRs) are hypothesized to reflect neuronal synchronous activity related to activation of object representations. However, it is not known whether synchrony in the gamma range is also related to multisensory object processing. We investigated the effect of semantic congruity between auditory and visual information on the human GBR. The paradigm consisted of a simultaneous presentation of pictures and vocalizations of animals, which were either congruent or incongruent. EEG was measured in 17 students while they attended either the auditory or the visual stimulus and performed a recognition task. Behavioral results showed a congruity effect, indicating that information from the unattended modality affected behavior. Irrelevant visual information affected auditory recognition more than irrelevant auditory information affected visual recognition, suggesting a bias toward reliance on visual information in object recognition. Whereas the evoked (phase-locked) GBR was unaffected by congruity, the induced (non-phase-locked) GBR was increased for congruent compared with incongruent stimuli. This effect was independent of the attended modality. The results show that integration of information across modalities, based on semantic congruity, is associated with enhanced synchronized oscillations at the gamma band. This suggests that gamma-band oscillations are related not only to low-level unimodal integration but also to the formation of object representations at conceptual multisensory levels.

Despite major advances in the last few years, an explicit linkage between the two is still missing and the neuroimaging community faces two complementary but unrelated sets of functional descriptions of the human brain. Such an explicit framework, linking the two approaches in potentially complex cognitive tasks and in a variety of brain regions would permit to combine them into fine spatio-temporally-grained human brain mapping procedures. We combined fMRI and intra-cranial EEG recordings of the same epileptic patients during a semantic decision task and found a close spatial correspondence between regions of fMRI activations and recording sites showing EEG energy modulations in the gamma range (>40 Hz). Our findings further support previous findings that gamma band modulations co-localize with BOLD variations and also indicate that fMRI may be used as a constraint to improve source reconstruction of gamma band EEG responses.

In this MEG study, we evaluated the event-related synchronization (ERS)of alpha activity after eye closing in patients with early AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)who presented no slow MEG pattern. Thirteen patients with probable AD and thirteen patients with MCI, who met NINCDS-ADRDA and Petersen's diagnostic criteria, respectively, were enrolled. We also selected fourteen age-matched normal control Subjects. MEG activity was acquired during eye-open and eye-closed states. The ERS after eye closing within 8-15 Hz frequency band was calculated and its cortical source was superimposed on the individual's MRI by using the beamformer implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA). The Source image was converted into a standardized image, and group comparisons across patients with AD, MCI and controls were performed using BrainVoyager QX. The averaged ERS was observed dominantly in posterior regions in all three groups. Significant difference in ERS was observed only for the comparison between AD patients and controls, with AD patients showing increased ERS in frontal regions. Frontal shift of posterior alpha activity was observed clearly in AD patients Using the combination of beamformer and group comparison. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Even small sampling shifts (e.g. a single data-point at 5 kHz) increase the variance of the sampled gradient artifacts because of very steep slopes in the signal time course. Hence, although principally gradient artifacts are invariant signals because of their technical origin, variance attributed to sampling errors attenuates the effect of artifact removal. Recently, it has been shown that synchronizing the EEG-amplifier clock to the MR-scanner control-device clock improves artifact reduction by Subtraction. Methods: In order to investigate the synchronized measurement of combined EEG-fMRI, we used simulated EEG by measuring function generator signals in the MR-scanner. Only the usage of known signals allows an assessment of the improvement in accuracy of artifact recording by synchronized compared to non-synchronized Measurement, since the signal is identical in both conditions. Results: After averaged gradient artifact Subtraction synchronized recorded signals were apparently less distorted than non-synchronized recorded signals. Spectral analyses revealed that especially artifact frequencies above 50 Hz had less power in restored synchronized compared to restored non-synchronized recorded signals. Computed total signal variances were not always less in restored synchronized compared to restored non-synchronized recorded signals. Conclusions: Taken together, synchronizing simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurement is a useful enhancement for averaged gradient artifact Subtraction although post-correction filtering is still necessary. Significance: Our results support the recent finding that synchronization improves the quality of averaged gradient artifact subtraction. However, quantitatively we Could not verify a systematic benefit of recording electrical signals during fMRI synchronously rather than non-synchronously to the MR-scanner control-device clock.

Different patterns of BOLD responses have been observed in children as compared to adults. A high intra- and intersubject variability of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to epileptic discharges has been observed in adults. The actual HRF to epileptic discharges in children and its dependence on age are unknown. We analyzed 64 EEG-fMRI event types in 37 children (3 months to 18 years), 92% showing a significant BOLD response. HRFs were calculated for each BOLD cluster using a Fourier basis set. After excluding HRFs with a low signal-to-noise ratio, 126 positive and 98 negative HRFs were analyzed. We evaluated age-dependent changes as well as the effect of increasing numbers of spikes. Peak time, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of the HRF and the t-statistic score of the cluster were used as dependent variables. We observed significantly longer peak times of the HRF in the youngest children (0 to 2 years), suggesting that the use of multiple HRFs might be important in this group. A different coupling between neuronal activity and metabolism or blood flow in young children may cause this phenomenon. Even if the t-value increased with frequent spikes, the amplitude of the HRF decreased significantly with spike frequency. This reflects a violation of the assumptions of the General Linear Model and therefore the use of alternative analysis techniques may be more appropriate with high spiking rates, a common situation in children.

A new electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system utilizing active segment selection and multiresolution fractal features is designed and tested for single-trial EEG classification. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the proposed system consists of three main procedures including active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. The active segment selection is based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, and is used to obtain the optimal active time segment in the time-frequency domain. We then utilize a modified fractal dimension to extract multiresolution fractal feature vectors from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) data for movement classification. By using a simple linear classifier, we find significant improvements in the rate of correct classification over the conventional approaches in all of our single-trial experiments for real finger movement. These results can be extended to see the good adaptability of the proposed method to imaginary movement data acquired from the public databases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In each of a series of trials, subjects were presented trains of distorted pictures (with decreasing levels of degradation), and were asked to respond as quickly as possible when they recognize the meaning of the picture. The results show that during the time-window of picture recognition, upper alpha power decreased but inter-areal phase synchronization increased as compared to meaningless control pictures. We assume that synchronous alpha oscillations - particularly during a decrease in alpha power - reflect topographically specific neural network activity that is related to the access of semantic information in LTM.

Sleep and EEG was studied at the age of 3 months in two mouse models of the condition, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje, carrying one extra copy of partially overlapping segments of the mmu chromosome 16 (equivalent to the human chromosome 21). We found that the Ts65Dn mice showed increased waking amounts at the expense of non-REM sleep, increased theta power during sleep and a delayed sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. In contrast, Ts1Cje had limited sleep and EEG abnormalities, showing only a delayed sleep rebound after sleep deprivation and no difference in theta power. We previously found that mice over-expressing the human APPwt transgene, a gene triplicated in Ts65Dn but not Ts1Cje, also show increased wake and theta power during sleep. These results demonstrate abnormalities in sleep and EEG in Ts65Dn mice and underscore a possible correlation between App overexpression and hippocampal theta oscillations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

EEG sharp waves and sparse ensemble unit activity in the Macaque hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING-SYSTEMS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; THETA ACTIVITY; BEHAVING RAT; MEMORY; NEURONS; PLACE; REACTIVATION; MONKEY	Neural unit activity and EEGs were recorded from inferior temporal regions of three rhesus macaques chronically implanted with "hyperdrives" holding 12 individually movable tetrodes. Recordings were made from each monkey over a period of similar to 3 mo, while the electrodes were moved by small increments through the hippocampus and neighboring structures. After recording, the monkeys were necropsied, and the brains were sectioned and Nissl-stained, permitting identification of individual electrode tracks. The results establish that hippocampal pyramidal cells are "complex spike cells," firing at overall average rates of similar to 0.3 Hz, with spike trains consisting of long periods of silence interspersed with bursts of activity. The results also establish that the monkey hippocampal EEG shows "sharp wave" events consisting of a high-frequency "ripple" oscillation (similar to 110 Hz) together with a large slow-wave EEG deflection lasting several hundred milliseconds. The evidence suggests that monkey sharp waves are probably generated mainly in the CA1 region and that sharp waves are associated with an inactive/drowsy-or-sleeping behavioral state, which is also associated with increased hippocampal pyramidal cell activity and increased hippocampal EEG amplitude. The results of this initial study of ensembles of primate hippocampal neurons are consistent with previous studies in rodents and consistent with the hypothesis that theories and models of hippocampal memory function developed on the basis of rat data may be applicable to a wide range of mammalian species.

Due to their non-selective profile, however, they potently modulate several sup-type specific GABAA receptors, contributing to their broad-range side effects. Based on observations in genetically altered mice, however, it has been proposed that anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines is predominantly mediated by GABAA alpha 2/3 subunit-containing receptors. In the present study we analyzed the actions of the preferential GABA(A) alpha 1 and alpha 2/3 PAMs, zolpidem and L-838417, respectively on hippocampal EEG and medial septum neuronal activity in anesthetized rats. In parallel, a computational model was constructed to model pharmacological actions of these compounds on the septo-hippocampal circuitry. The present results demonstrated that zolpidem inhibited theta oscillation both in the hippocampus and septum, and profoundly inhibited firing activity of septal neurons. L-838417 also inhibited hippocampal and septal theta oscillation, however, it did not significantly alter firing rate activity of septal neurons. Our computational model showed that cessation of periodic firing of hippocamposeptal neurons, representing absence of hippocampal theta activity, disrupted oscillation of septal units, without altering their overall firing activity, similar to changes observed in our in vivo experiments following administration of L-838417. Understanding the correlation between changes in septo-hippocampal activity and actions of selective modulators of GABAA subtype receptor modulators would further advance design of anxiolytic drugs.

Prior approaches analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) had varying degrees of success, primarily due to smaller study cohorts, and the inherent difficulty of the problem. A new effort using multiresolution analysis of ERPs is described. Distinctions of this study include analyzing a larger cohort, comparing different wavelets and different frequency bands, using ensemble-based decisions and, most importantly, aiming the earliest possible diagnosis of the disease. Surprising yet promising outcomes indicate that ERPs in response to novel sounds of oddball paradigm may be more reliable as a biomarker than the more commonly used responses to target sounds.

Burst suppression during propofol anaesthesia recorded from scalp and subthalamic electrodes: report of three cases	ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						propofol; EEG; burst suppression; sleep spindle	EEG; POTENTIALS	Background: Measurement of slow EEG activity and burst suppression are the main tasks in monitoring the effects of anaesthestics with EEG, which is often done with commercial univariate indexes such as BIS. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of burst suppression EEG during propofol anaesthesia using scalp electrodes and depth electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus. Specifically, we describe the electrical fields of the three EEG patterns we have previously described: the sharp wave, the burst and the spindle. Methods: We recorded the EEG of three Parkinson patients during propofol anaesthesia from the scalp electrodes and the depth electrode implanted in the subthalamic nucleus for treating parkinsonism. Results: (1) The slow waves of bursts recorded from all surface electrodes on scalp or neck with depth electrode reference are positive and have the highest amplitude in frontal electrodes, suggesting synchronous generation in the whole cerebral cortex. (2) The sharp wave and spindles have the highest amplitude at vertex. They are opposite in polarity in vertex and depth electrodes when referred to the neck electrode, suggesting generation in the sensorimotor cortex. Conclusions: Recording simultaneously EEG from the depth and scalp electrodes shows that bursts and their slow wave oscillations are synchronous in the whole cortex while spindles and sharp waves are produced by the sensorimotor cortex. The amplitude of slow waves recorded with surface electrodes is equal to the difference of the wave at two electrodes and therefore only a small part of that generated by the cortex.

We investigated PLMS-related EEG and HR variations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) in order to detect possible abnormalities in cortical and autonomic arousal responses. Methods: Ten patients with MSA were contrasted against ten patients with primary RLS. Cortical (EEG) and autonomic (HR) variations associated with PLMS during NREM sleep were analysed by means of Fast Fourier Transform and HR analysis. In addition, we analysed the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) during sleep, CAP representing a measure of the spontaneous arousal oscillations during NREM sleep. Results: PLMS in RLS were associated with tachycardia and spectral EEG variations, beginning about 2 s before the onset of PLMS, and peaking 1-4 s after. The HR and spectral EEG variations were strikingly reduced or absent in MSA. MSA patients also had significantly lower CAP rate compared to RLS patients. Conclusions: Blunted HR and EEG spectral changes adjacent to PLMS indicated impaired cortical and autonomic arousal responses during sleep in MSA patients. Significance: PLMS, when present, may represent a useful means to study the arousal responses during sleep. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Ripples with similar characteristics are also present in humans, yet their underlying cellular correlates are still unknown. By in vivo recording interneurons and pyramidal cells in the human hippocampal formation, we find that cell type-specific firing patterns and phase-locking on a millisecond timescale can be distinguished during ripples. In particular, pyramidal cells fired preferentially at the highest amplitude of the ripple, but interneurons began to discharge earlier than pyramidal cells. Furthermore, a large fraction of cells were phase-locked to the ripple cycle, but the preferred phase of discharge of interneurons followed the maximum discharge probability of pyramidal neurons. These relationships between human ripples and unit activity are qualitatively similar to that observed in vivo in the rodents, suggesting that their underlying mechanisms are similar.

One important stimulus property is spatial frequency (SF). Therefore, we studied the influence of SF on human alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) responses in a choice reaction task. Since real world images contain multiple SFs, an SF mixture was also examined. Event related potentials were modulated by SF around 80 and 300 ms. Evoked gamma responses were strongest for the low SF and the mixture stimulus; alpha responses were strongest for high SFs. The results link evoked and induced alpha and evoked gamma responses in human EEG to different modes of stimulus processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG infraslow activity in absence and partial seizures	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						baseline shifts; electroencephalography; glia; infraslow topography; seizures	SPIKE; OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY; SHIFTS; WAVE	It is currently assumed that for recording of infraslow activity (ISA) DC-coupled amplifiers are required. This report will demonstrate that this may not be the case and presents some data about its potential clinical usefulness. Archived EEGs of 29 seizures from 6 children with absence attacks, accompanied by 3 Hz classical spike-wave discharges (SW), were compared with 20 partial seizures from 10 adult patients. The data from the children were acquired on a Bio-logic system, those from the adults on a Grass-Telefactor instrument. In the children the original 30-minute routine EEG was used while in the adults stored videomonitored data were excerpted to provide 20-minute segments which included the preictal, ictal and postictal state. All data were analyzed with the BESA software package. The seizures were evaluated separately on conventional filter settings, full band of 0.01-to the upper limit of the instrument, and 0.01-0.1 Hz (infraslow activity, ISA). Filter settings of 0.01-0.1 Hz provided a better assessment of ISA than when the full band was evaluated. Absence seizures showed bilateral essentially synchronous ISA with a negative positive sequence in the frontal areas and opposite polarity in the posterior head regions. In partial seizures when seizure onset was clearly lateralizeable from conventional frequency settings ISA corresponded to that hemisphere, but the electrode position could be displaced to a neighboring one from the one which was maximally involved on conventional settings. Topographic analysis showed two types of ISA: one with focal spread only and the other where there was in addition an element of synchrony especially in the frontal areas. It is concluded that ISA can be recovered from conventional EEG recordings and may be helpful not only in determining the area(s) of seizure onset but can also differentiate truly focal seizures from those where an additional generalized seizure tendency is present. This is likely to be important when epilepsy surgery is performed in absence of a demonstrable structural lesion.

Scalp-recorded ssSEPs were analysed by means of dipole source analysis to achieve optimal separation of left and right hemisphere ssSEPs. The time course of ssSEP modulation at the source level was extracted by means of a wavelet transform. in addition to the extraction of ssSEPs, the analysis included the derivation of lateralized attention and movement-related potentials, i.e. the attention-directing anterior negativity (ADAN) and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). The results revealed a time course of ssSEP modulation remarkably similar to the time course of ADAN and LRP. The time course was characterized by a reduction of ssSEP amplitude at latencies just following the peak latency of the ADAN (similar to 400 ms) and the peak latency of the LRP (similar to 1200 ms). This reduction was greater for contralateral than for ipsilateral movements. The study demonstrates that ssSEP methodology represents a feasible approach to the measurement of movement-related changes in cortical excitability, which may be used to resolve ambiguities in the interpretation of lateralized event-related brain potentials.

The subjects were 19 psychiatric outpatients. Hypnotizability was measured with the Hypnotic Induction Profile ( HIP). Fifty-four sets of EEG data were analyzed by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a well-established fractal analysis technique. The scaling exponents, which are the results of fractal analysis, are reduced toward white noise during the hypnotic condition, which differentiates the hypnotic condition from the waking condition. Further, the decrease in the scaling exponents during hypnosis was solely associated with the eye-roll sign within specific cortical areas (F3, C4, and O1/2) closely related to eye movements and attention. In conclusion, the present study has found that the application of the fractal analysis technique can demonstrate the electrophysiological correlations with hypnotic influence on cerebral activity.

Designing a fuzzy rule based system to estimate depth of anesthesia	2007 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	APR 01-05, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			PREDICT MOVEMENT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SEVOFLURANE; ISOFLURANE; DESFLURANE; COMPLEXITY; PROPOFOL; ENTROPY	Estimating the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is still a challenging area in anesthesia research. The objective of this study was to design a fuzzy rule based system which integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) features to quantitatively estimate the DOA. The proposed method is based on the analysis of single-channel EEG using frequency and time domain features as well as Shannon entropy measure. The fuzzy classifier is trained with features obtained from four subsets of data comprising well-defined anesthesia states: awake, moderate, general anesthesia, and isoelectric. The classifier extracts efficient fuzzy if-then rules and the DOA index is derived between 100 (full awake) to 0 (isoelectric) using fuzzy inference engine. To validate the proposed method, a clinical study has conducted on 22 patients to construct 4 subsets of reference states and also to compare the results with CSM monitor (Danmeter, Denmark), which has revealed satisfactory correlation with clinical assessments.

Here we investigated whether noninvasive field potentials estimated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) using the ELECTRA source localization algorithm could provide real-time decoding of mental states in healthy humans. By means of pattern recognition techniques on 500-ms EEG epochs, we were able to discriminate accurately from single trials which of four categories of visual stimuli the subjects were viewing. Our results show that it is possible to reproduce the decoding accuracy previously obtained in animals with invasive recordings. A comparison between the decoding results and the subjects' behavioral performance indicates that oscillatory activity (OA), elicited in specific brain regions) codes better for the visual stimulus category presented than the subjects' actual response, i.e., is insensitive to voluntary or involuntary errors. The identification of brain regions participating in the decoding process allowed us to construct 3D-functional images of the task-related OA. These images revealed the activation of brain regions known for their involvement in the processing of this type of visual stimuli. Electrical neuroimaging therefore appears to have the potential to establish what the brain is processing while the stimuli are being seen or categorized, i.e., concurrently with sensory-perceptual processes.

The list of characteristics with a minimal error revealed statistically significant differences between spectral power of delta- and theta-ranges in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients. Spectral power of these slow rhythms was always higher in the formers then in the latter. As a whole, in schizophrenic patients the decrease of delta-rhythm spectral power in the lower frontal area of right hemisphere and theta-rhythm - in the lower temporal area of left hemisphere most frequently is observed. These results are in agreement with hypofrontality and hypotemporality characteristic of schizophrenic patients and testify to the lack of "fundamental" brain base of cognitive functions. These facts are evidently connected with the significant neurochemical disturbances taking place in schizophrenia.	[Strelets, V. B.; Novototsky-Vlasov, V. Yu.; Garakh, Zh. V.; Zeligovsky, V.

Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance.

Matches with auditory long-term memory induce gamma activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillations; 40 Hz activity; auditory long-term memory	BAND ACTIVITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; WORKING-MEMORY; LEARNING-TASK; RESPONSES; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; ERP	In recent years the cognitive functions of human gamma-band activity (30-100 Hz) advanced continuously into scientific focus. Not only bottom-up driven influences on 40 Hz activity have been observed, but also top-down processes seem to modulate responses in this frequency band. Among the various functions that have been related to gamma activity a pivotal role has been assigned to memory processes. Visual experiments suggested that gamma activity is involved in matching visual input to memory representations. Based on these findings we hypothesized that such memory related modulations of gamma activity exist in the auditory modality, as well. Thus, we chose environmental sounds for which subjects already had a long-term memory (LTM) representation and compared them to unknown, but physically similar sounds. 21 subjects had to classify sounds as 'recognized' or 'unrecognized', while EEG was recorded. Our data show significantly stronger activity in the induced gamma-band for recognized sounds in the time window between 300 and 500 ins after stimulus onset with a central topography. The results suggest that induced gamma-band activity reflects the matches between sounds and their representations in auditory LTM. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is a lack of information on the modulation of the corticomuscular coherence in conjunction with dynamic force output. We addressed this question comparing the EEG-EMG coherence and the cortical motor spectral power in eight healthy subjects in a visuomotor task, in which the subjects exerted a steady-state or periodically modulated dynamic isometric force output with their right-index finger to keep a visual cursor within a target zone. In the static condition, significant coherence was confined to the beta-range. In the dynamic condition, the most distinct coherence occurred in the gamma-range and the significant beta-range coherence was strikingly reduced. The cortical motor power in the beta-range during dynamic force output was decreased, whereas the power in the gamma-range remained without significant change. We conclude that during dynamic force the corticospinal oscillation mode of the sensorimotor system shifts towards higher (principally gamma) frequencies for the rapid integration of the visual and somatosensory information required to produce the appropriate motor command.

The discovered negative correlations in the low frequency range and positive correlations in the high frequency range between amplitude EEG characteristics and indices of subjective value can be interpreted as connection between the index and brain activation processes. The authors conclude that the motivational factor 'value of profession' is mostly formed under the influence of typological qualities of the individual which may manifest themselves in general ergodicity. At the same time the factor 'accessibility' is adversely affected by a number of characteristics of the nervous system.											29	0	0	0	1	MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA	MOSCOW	39 DIMITROVA UL., 113095 MOSCOW, RUSSIA	0042-8841			VOP PSIKHOL+	Vopr.

We provide evidence from simultaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data that perception of 3-D objects defined by luminance or motion elicits sequential activity in human visual cortices within 500 msec. Following activation of the primary visual cortex around 100 msec, 3-D objects elicited sequential activity with only little overlap (dynamic 3-D shapes: MT-LO-Temp; stationary 3-D shapes: LO-Temp). A delay of 80 msec, both in MEG/EEG responses and in reaction times (RTs), was found when additional motion information was processed. We also found significant positive correlations between RT, and MEG and EEG responses in the right temporal location. After about 400 msec, long-lasting activity was observed in the parietal cortex and concurrently in previously activated regions. Novel time-frequency analyses indicate that the activity in the lateral occipital (LO) complex is associated with an increase of induced power in the gamma band, a hallmark of binding. The close correspondence of an induced gamma response with concurrent sources located in the LO in both experimental conditions at different points in time (similar to 200 msec for luminance and similar to 300 msec for dynamic cues) strongly suggests that the LO is the key region for the assembly of object features. The assembly is fed forward to achieve coherent perception of a 3-D object within 500 msec.

Dextrals and sinistrals (right-handers and left-handers): Specificity of interhemispheric brain asymmetry and EEG coherence parameters	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Review						right-handers; left-handers; interhemispheric asymmetry; EEG coherence	CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; HANDEDNESS; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; LESIONS; GENDER; CORTEX	Data of literature about morphological, functional and biochemical specificity of the brain interhemispheric asymmetry of healthy right-handers and left-handers and about peculiarity of dynamics of cerebral pathology in patients with different individual asymmetry profiles are presented at the present article. Results of our investigation by using coherence parameters of electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy right-handers and left-handers in state of rest, during functional tests and sleeping and in patients with different forms of the brain organic damage were analyzed too. EEG coherence analysis revealed the reciprocal changing of alpha-beta and theta-delta spectral bands in right-handers whilein left-handers synchronous changing of all EEG spectral bands were observed. Data about regional-frequent specificity of EEG coherence, peculiarity of EEG asymmetry in right-handers and left-handers, aslo about specificity of EEG spectral hand genesis and point of view about a role of the brain regulator systems in forming of interhemispheric asymmetry in different functional states allowed to propose the conception about principle of interhermispheric brain asymmetry formation in left-handers and left-handers. Following this conception in dextrals elements of concurrent (surnmary-reciprocal) cooperation are predominant at the character of interhemispheric and cortical-subcortical interaction while in sinistrals a principle of concordance (supplementary) is preferable. These peculiarities the brain organization determine, from the first side, the quicker revovery of functions damaged after cranio-cerebral trauma in left-handers in comparison right-handers and from the other side - they determine the forming of the more expressed pathology in the remote terms after exposure the low dose of radiation.

Decreased efficacy of GABA(A)-receptor modulation by midazolam in the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						GABA(A)-receptor; epilepsy; population pharmacokinetic; pharmacodynamic modelling; post-SE animal model; benzodiazepine	STATUS-EPILEPTICUS; POPULATION ANALYSIS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; EXPRESSION; RAT; PHARMACODYNAMICS; HIPPOCAMPUS; PHARMACORESISTANCE; PHARMACOKINETICS; BENZODIAZEPINES	Purpose: The objective of this investigation was to characterize quantitatively the time-dependent changes in midazolam (MDL) efficacy in the silent period after induction of status epilepticus (SE) in rats. The changes in MDL efficacy were correlated to changes in ex vivo GABA(A)-receptor expression. Methods: MDL efficacy was quantified by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling by using the beta-frequency of the EEG as PD end point. Two PK-PD experiments were performed in each animal: the first experiment before and the second experiment at either day 4 or day 14 after SE. SE was induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections with kainate. GABA(A)-receptor expression was determined by ex vivo autoradiography with [H-3]flumazenil. Results: The concentration versus EEG effect relation of midazolam was successfully described by the sigmoidal E-max model. The maximal effect on the beta-frequency of the EEG (E-max) was reduced to 51.6 +/- 35.6% and 25.8 +/- 33.7% of the original value at 4 and 14 days after induction of SE. The ex vivo study with [H-3]flumazenil showed that the observed reductions in E-max were paralleled by a reduction in GABA(A)-receptor density. Conclusions: The efficacy of MDL is decreased in the silent period after SE, which can be partly accounted for by a reduction in GABA(A)-receptor density.

ERP old/new effects were obtained in two distinct source-memory tasks. Functionally related EEG power and phase locking effects were found in the delta and theta frequency range. A late posterior negativity (LPN) was larger for old than new responses irrespective of source accuracy. It was also larger when participants were required to judge how they had previously interacted with a recognized picture as compared to judging its study location. This result is consistent with the view that the LPN reflects processes in the service of reconstructing previous episodes by integrating recognized items with task-relevant contextual attributes, and that LPN amplitude is related to the amount of contextual features available for forming such an integrated representation. Phase locking of ongoing delta and theta activity (but not EEG power) was functionally equivalent to LPN amplitude modulations, suggesting that stimulus-induced concentration of delta and theta phases without stimulus-induced power changes may be the neural mechanism of LPN generation. In addition, sustained enhancements of phase-locking precision in the theta range were observed for erroneous and delayed source judgments, suggesting that theta-phase locking is related to the coordination of multiple cortical assemblies in highly demanding task situations.

EEG functional connectivity in term age extremely low birth weight infants	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High density electroencephalogram (EEG); Synchrony; Functional connectivity; Coherence; Extremely low birth weight (FLEW); Term; Infant	PRETERM INFANTS; BRAIN MATURATION; GESTATIONAL-AGE; HEALTHY TERM; SLEEP STATES; OUTCOMES; QUANTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; STATISTICS; ULTRASOUND	Objective: The hypothesis is tested that electrocortical functional connectivity (quantified by coherence) of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, measured at term post-menstrual age, has regional differences from that of full term infants. Methods: 128 lead EEG data were collected during sleep from 8 ELBW infants with normal head ultra-sound exams and 8 typically developing full term infants. Regional spectral power and coherence were calculated. Results: No significant regional differences in EEG power were found between infant groups. However, compared to term infants, ELBW infants had significantly reduced interhemispheric coherence (in frontal polar and parietal regions) and intrahemispheric coherence (between frontal polar and parieto-occipital regions) in the 1-12 Hz band but increased interhemispheric coherence between occipital regions in the 24-50 Hz band. Conclusions: ELBW infants at term post-menstrual age manifest regional differences in EEG functional connectivity as compared to term infants. Significance: Distinctive spatial patterns of electrocortical synchrony are found in ELBW infants. These regional patterns may presage regional alterations in the structure of the cortex.

As a first step in this direction, the authors employed high-density EEG to explore whether sleep rhythms differ between schizophrenia subjects, healthy individuals, and a psychiatric control group with a history of depression. Method: Healthy comparison subjects (N= 17), medicated schizophrenia patients (N= 18), and subjects with a history of depression (N= 15) were recruited. Subjects were recorded during the first sleep episode of the night with a 256-electrode high-density EEG. Recordings were analyzed for changes in EEG power spectra, power topography, and sleep-specific cortical oscillations. Results: The authors found that the schizophrenia group had a significant reduction in centroparietal EEG power, from 13.75 to 15.00 Hz, in relation to both the comparison and depression groups. No significant difference in EEG power between the comparison and depression groups was identified. The authors also found a decrease in sleep spindle number, amplitude, duration, and integrated spindle activity in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, integrated spindle activity had an effect size corresponding to 93.0% or 90.2% separation of the schizophrenia from the comparison or depression group. Conclusions: Sleep spindles are generated by the thalamic reticular nucleus in conjunction with specific thalamic nuclei and are modulated by corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections. The deficit in sleep spindles in schizophrenia subjects may reflect dysfunction in thalamic-reticular and thalamocortical mechanisms and could represent a biological marker of illness.

In the a-band (about 8-14 Hz), decreased oscillatory activity is thought to reflect a state of enhanced cortical excitability, and increased activity to reflect a state of cortical idling or inhibition in which excitability is reduced, but the alpha/excitability link has not been probed directly. Here, we studied the relationship between resting oscillatory activity and visual cortex excitability across participants using electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the occipital pole. We found individual posterior a-band power to correlate with the individual threshold for eliciting illusory, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced visual percepts. This provides direct support for an a/excitability link and for baseline states of the visual brain to vary across individuals.

The functional connectivity of the voxel time series between brain regions in the frequency space was investigated by performing spectral analysis of fMRI time series. The regional interactivities between the two portions of the supplementary motor area (pre-SMA and SMA-proper) and the primary motor cortex (M1), defined as a seed region, were evaluated. The spectral parameter of coherence was used to describe a correlation structure in the frequency domain between two voxel-based time series and to infer the strength of the functional interaction within our presumed motor network of connections. The results showed meaningful differences of the functional interactions between the two portions of the SMA and the M1 area depending on the task conditions. This approach demonstrated the existence of a functional dissociation between the pre-SMA and SMA-proper subregions. We therefore conclude that spectral analysis is useful for identifying functional interactions of brain regions and might provide a powerful tool to quantify changes in connectivity profiles associated with various components of an experimental task.

From perception to action: phase-locked gamma oscillations correlate with reaction times in a speeded response task	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED PATTERNS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; BAND RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FREQUENCY; HUMANS; BRAIN; ARCHITECTURE; PARADIGMS	Background: Phase- locked gamma oscillations have so far mainly been described in relation to perceptual processes such as sensation, attention or memory matching. Due to its very short latency (approximate to 90 ms) such oscillations are a plausible candidate for very rapid integration of sensory and motor processes. Results: We measured EEG in 13 healthy participants in a speeded reaction task. Participants had to press a button as fast as possible whenever a visual stimulus was presented. The stimulus was always identical and did not have to be discriminated from other possible stimuli. In trials in which the participants showed a fast response, a slow negative potential over central electrodes starting approximately 800 ms before the response and highly phase-locked gamma oscillations over central and posterior electrodes between 90 and 140 ms after the stimulus were observed. In trials in which the participants showed a slow response, no slow negative potential was observed and phase- locked gamma oscillations were significantly reduced. Furthermore, for slow response trials the phase- locked gamma oscillations were significantly delayed with respect to fast response trials. Conclusion: These results indicate the relevance of phase- locked gamma oscillations for very fast ( not necessarily detailed) integration processes.

Since the synchronized oscillatory activity and the phase dynamics between the brain areas are two important mechanisms in the brain's function and information transfer, we decided to examine whether it is possible to extract the encoded information from the EEG signals using the phase-demodulation approach. The EEG was measured during the performance of different visuomotor tasks and the information we were trying to decode was the gripping force as applied by the subjects. The study revealed that it is possible, by using simple beta-rhythm filtering, phase demodulation, principal component analysis and a fuzzy model, to estimate the gripping-force response by using EEG signals as the inputs for the proposed model. The presented study has shown that even though EEG signals represent a superposition of all the active neurons, it is still possible to decode some information about the current activity of the brain centers. Furthermore, the cross-validation showed that the information about the gripping force is encoded in a very similar way for all the examined subjects. Thus, the phase shifts of the EEG signals seem to have a key role during activity and information transfer in the brain, while the phase-demodulation method proved to be a crucial step in the signal processing.

J	Ehlers, CL; Phillips, E				Ehlers, Cindy L.; Phillips, Evelyn			Association of EEG alpha variants and alpha power with alcohol dependence in Mexican American young adults	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Mexican Americans; alcohol dependence; EEG variants; EEG spectral power	LOW-VOLTAGE-ALPHA; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM EEG; HUMAN-BEHAVIOR GENETICS; DRINKING PATTERNS; FAMILY-HISTORY; PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; HISPANIC-AMERICAN; MISSION INDIANS	Several studies support an association between electroencephalogram (EEG) voltage and alcohol dependence. However, the distribution of EEG variants also appears to differ depending on an individual's ethnic heritage, suggesting significant genetic stratification of this EEG phenotype. The present study's aims were to investigate the incidence of EEG alpha variants and spectral power in the alpha frequency range in Mexican American young adults based on gender, and personal and family history of alcohol dependence. Clinical ratings (high-, medium-, and low alpha voltage variants) and spectral characteristics of the EEG in the alpha frequency range (7.5-12 Hz) were investigated in young adult (age 18-25 years) Mexican American men (n = 98) and women (n = 138) who were recruited from the community. Nineteen percent (n = 45) of the participants had a low-voltage alpha EEG variant, 18% had a high-voltage variant, and 63% had a medium-voltage variant. There were no significant differences in the distribution of the EEG variants based on family history of alcohol dependence. There was a significant relationship between gender and the three alpha variants (chi(2) = 9.7; df = 2; P <.008), and there were no male participants with alcohol dependence with high alpha variants (chi(2) = 5.8; df = 2; P <.056). Alcohol dependence, but not a family history of alcohol dependence, was associated with lower spectral power in the alpha frequency range in the right (F = 4.4; df = 1,96; P <.04) and left (F = 5.3; df = 1.96; P <.02) occipital areas in the men but not in the women. In conclusion, in this select population of Mexican American young adults, male gender and alcohol dependence are associated with an absence of high-voltage alpha variants and lower alpha power in the EEG. These data suggest that EEG low voltage, a highly heritable trait, may represent an important endo-phenotype in male Mexican Americans that may aid in linking brain function with genetic factors underlying alcohol dependence in this ethnic group.

Sleep improving effects of a single dose administration of a valerian/hops fluid extract	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						valerian; hops; EEG; sleep; electrohypnogram	THETA ACTIVITY; INSOMNIA; WAKING	Repetitive administrations of valerian/hops combinations have been widely used for self-administered therapy of sleep disturbances. This investigation focuses on the question if a single administration can be an effective sleep aid. Two parallel groups of n = 20 (verum) and n = 22 (placebo) were tested. Each subject spent two consecutive nights in the lab (reference night and medication night). Medication consisted in giving verum or placebo to poor sleepers identified by a validated sleep questionnaire (Schlaffragebogen SF-B). Two ml of the liquid extract or similar smelling placebo were diluted in 50 ml water (flavoured with honey) and administered 15 minutes before EEG recording during the medication night. The data analysis is based on the electrohypnogram - a method derived from a validated computer assisted automatic analysis for depth of sleep. Differences between the reference nights and medication nights were evaluated and tested for significance. Time spent in sleep (values of the sleep frequency index "SFx" of the electrohypnogram of 74% or lower) was significantly higher for the verum group in comparison to the placebo group (p<0.01). The difference with respect to time spent in deeper sleep (i.e. 68% and lower or 62% and lower) between reference and medication night was also statistically significant at p<0.01. This parameter correlated with the difference in quality of sleep between the two consecutive nights as derived from the sleep inventory SF-A sub-score (subjects evaluation) with r = 0.48 at p<0.0001. The EEG derived parameter "sleep quantity" as calculated from the electrohypnogram proved superiority of the valerian/hops combination over placebo. Thus, the present investigation has shown evidence that a valerian/hops fluid extract can be used successfully using a single administration.

Nonlinear EEG activation evoked by low-strength low-frequency magnetic fields	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						magnetic fields; evoked potential; nonlinear response; recurrence analysis	RECURRENCE PLOTS; SYSTEMS	Recent electrophysiological evidence suggested the existence of a human magnetic sense, but the kind of dynamical law that governed the stimulus-response relationship was not established. We tested the hypothesis that brain potentials evoked by the onset of a weak, low-frequency magnetic field were nonlinearly related to the stimulus. A field of I G, 60 Hz was applied for 2 s, with a 5 s inter-stimulus period, and brain potentials were recorded from occipital electrodes in eight subjects, each of whom were measured twice, with at least I week between measurements. The recorded signals were subjected to nonlinear (recurrence analysis) and linear (time averaging) analyses. Using recurrence analysis, magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) were detected in each subject in both the initial and replicate studies, with one exception. All MEPs exhibited the expected latency but differed in dynamical characteristics, indicating that they were nonlinearly related to the stimulus. MEPs were not detected using time averaging, thereby further confirming their nonlinearity. Evolutionarily conditioned structures that help mediate linear field-transduction in lower life forms may be expressed and functionally utilized in humans, but in a role where they facilitate vulnerability to man-made environmental fields.

These structures are critically involved in declarative memory formation and memory consolidation during sleep. As memory processing is suggested to involve the interplay between fast and slow oscillations, we hypothesized different correlations between frequency bands in surface versus mediotemporal electroencephalogram recordings. Polysomnographic recordings obtained in 10 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were analyzed. In accordance with earlier studies, we observed that power density in surface electroencephalogram is organized reciprocally between 610 and fast frequencies above 16 Hz during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (negative correlations). In contrast, we found that within the hippocampus delta/theta power alternated in parallel with fast oscillations above 16 Hz during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (positive correlations).

While power spectral density shows the increase of power during SCS only at small number of electrodes, coherence extends this area and sharpens its boundary simultaneously. Parameters of the method were experimentally optimized to maximize its reliability. SCS is applied to suppress chronic, intractable pain by patients, whom pharmacotherapy does not relieve. In our study, the pain developed in lower back and lower extremity as the result of unsuccessful vertebral discotomy, which is called failed-back surgery syndrome (FBSS). Our method replicated the results of previous analysis using PSD and extended them with more accurate localization of the area influenced by SCS.

This beta oscillation was used to simulate a wheel chair movement in a virtual environment (VE). The analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data revealed that the induced beta oscillations were accompanied by a characteristic heart rate (HR) change in form of a preparatory HR acceleration followed by a short-lasting deceleration in the order of 10-20 bpm (beats-per-minute). This provides evidence that mental practice of motor performance is accompanied not only by activation of cortical structures but also by central commands into the cardiovascular system with its nuclei in the brain stem.

We analyzed event-related oscillations in young, healthy subjects (N=26) by using three types of stimulation: (1) a simple light signal, (2) the picture of the face of an anonymous elderly lady and (3) the picture of the subjects' own grandmother. We found a number of significant peak to peak amplitude measures in all frequency bands in the time period of 0-500 ms, allowing a differentiation between perception of the subjects' own grandmother, the unknown elderly face and the light stimulation. The results showed increased event-related oscillatory responses elicited by the unknown face compared to the known grandmother a) in the theta responses (4-8 Hz) at T-6 (46%), b) in the gamma (28-48 Hz) responses at C-z (22%) and C-3 (38%) and c) in the beta responses at F-4 (46%), C-z (47%) and P-3 (105%). In contrast, the subjects' own grandmother elicited 20% increased fast theta (6-8 Hz) oscillations at F-4 compared to the unknown face. Delta responses dissociated face from simple light processing, as reflected in the observation of approx. 50% higher amplitudes at the occipital compared to the frontal locations during face perception. We conclude that the described multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ms. Furthermore, the results are in conceptual accordance with the "selectively distributed processing" hypothesis. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

'Motion' and intention that are involved in the individual perception of musical structure combined with mirror neuron (MN) system activation are studied in this article. The mechanism of MN involved in the perception of musical structures is seen as a means for cueing the learner on 'known' factors that can be used for his/her knowledge scaffolding. To explore such relationships, EEG recordings, and especially the Mu-rhythm in the premotor cortex that relates to the activation of MN, were acquired and explored. Three experiments were designed to provide the auditory and visual stimuli to a group of subjects, including both musicians and non-musicians. The acquired signals, after appropriate averaging in the time domain, were analysed in frequency and bifrequency domains, using spectral and bispectral analysis, respectively. Experimental results have shown that an intention-related activity shown in musicians could be associated with Mu-rhythm suppression. Moreover, all underlying ongoing function appearing in the transition from heard sound to imagined sound could be revealed in the bispectrum domain and a Mu-rhythm modulation provoked by the MNs could cause bispectral fluctuations, especially when visual stimulation is combined with an auditory one for the case of musicians. These results pave the way for transferring the research in the area of blind or visually impaired people, where hearing is the main information sensing tool.

During this task, participants respond faster when the relative spatial positions of stimulus and response match (no response conflict exists) than when they do not match (response conflict exists). An increased response conflict (increase in reaction times known as Simon effect) was found in elderly control and Parkinson's patients compared with young participants. Group and condition differences were found in the 6 and 0 frequency range, which may reflect that Parkinson's patients and matched controls use different cognitive strategies for stimulus-response processing than young controls and neurophysiological correlates of such strategy are deficient in patients compared with age-matched controls.

Magnetosensory evoked potentials: Consistent nonlinear phenomena	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						evoked potentials; nonlinear; recurrence analysis; magnetic fields	BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; FIELDS; EEG	Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) having strengths typically found in the general environment can alter brain activity, but the reported effects have been inconsistent. We theorized that the problem arose from the use of linear methods for analyzing what were actually nonlinear phenomena, and therefore studied whether the nonlinear signal-processing technique known as recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could be employed as the basis of a reliable method for demonstrating consistent changes in brain activity. Our primary purpose was to develop such a method for observing the occurrence of evoked potentials in individual subjects exposed to magnetic fields (2 G, 30 and 60 Hz). After all conditions that affected the analysis of the EEG were specified in advance, we detected magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) in all 15 subjects (P < 0.05 in each experiment). The MEPs, which occurred within the predicted latency interval of 109-504 ms, were independent of the frequency and the direction of the field, and were not detected using the traditional linear method of analysis, time averaging. When the results obtained within subjects were averaged across subjects, the evoked potentials could not be detected, indicating how real nonlinear phenomena can be averaged away when the incorrect method of analysis is used. Recurrence quantification analysis, but not linear analysis, permitted consistent demonstration of MEPs. The use of nonlinear analysis might also resolve apparent inconsistencies in other kinds of brain studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

The basic assumptions are that memory related oscillations are probably confined to theta and upper alpha and that other frequencies particularly in the gamma range are important for memory primarily because they become coupled to lower frequencies and/or because they play a specific role for a high precision timing of neural events (including phenomena such as LTP or LTD). In contrast to previous studies, where we related theta and upper alpha to a variety of different memory processes, we suggest here that these oscillations are associated with top-down control processes in two large storage systems, working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). These systems may have their own types of top-down processes that control access to and/or manipulation of stored information. The hypothesis, suggested here is that theta and upper alpha reflect these processes which can be best studied when analyzing phase. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We evaluated occipital perisaccadic gamma activity both in the presence and absence of visual input, when the observer was blindfolded. We quantified gamma power in the time periods before, during, and after horizontal saccades. The corresponding EEG was evaluated for individual saccades and the wavelet transformed EEG averaged for each time window, without averaging the EEG first. We found that, in both dark and light, parietal and occipital gamma power increased during the saccade and peaked prior to reaching new fixation. We show that this is not the result of muscle activity and not the result of visual input during saccades. Saccade direction affects the laterality of gamma power over posterior electrodes. Gamma power recorded over the posterior scalp increases during a saccade. The phasic modulation of gamma by saccades in darkness-when occipital activity is decoupled from visual input-provides electrophysiological evidence that voluntary saccades affect ongoing EEG. We suggest that saccade-phasic gamma modulation may contribute to short-term plasticity required to realign the visual space to the intended fixation point of a saccade and provides a mechanism for neuronal assembly formation prior to achieving the intended saccadic goal. The wavelet-transformed perisaccadic EEG could provide an electrophysiological tool applicable in humans for the purpose of fine analysis and potential separation of stages of 'planning' and 'action'.

Infants viewed video loops of complete and incomplete actions, which they could discriminate according to our pilot study, while we recorded their electrophysiological brain activity. Analysis of bursts of gamma-band oscillations resulting from passive viewing of these stimuli indicated increased gamma-band activity over left frontal regions when viewing incomplete actions as compared with complete actions. These results suggest that by 8 months infants are sensitive to the disruption of perceived goal-directed actions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Amending prior findings the influence of neural correlates related to the emotional state termed "romantic love" was investigated. Specifically, the effect of feelings of love on face perception was of interest. Pictures of a "loved person" were presented to female subjects and the elicited responses were compared with responses to pictures showing faces of a "known and appreciated person" or an "unknown person" during EEG recordings (n=20 females). As a control condition light stimulation was employed. The sequence of faces shown was presented in random and block-design. EEG data was analyzed considering maximum amplitudes and topographical differences within the conventional frequency bands of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Differences between light and face stimuli were found in the delta and theta bands and differences between the face types and the two designs were found in the delta band. The delta response to the picture of the "loved person" showed significantly higher amplitude values, not only in comparison with the "unknown person", but also with the picture of the "appreciated person". Frontal lobes appear to react to different types of facial stimuli with specific increases in delta responses. The difference between the response to the "loved person" and of the "known and appreciated person" reflects the component of the emotion denoted as love. The findings and their interpretations are discussed within the framework of event-related oscillations and complex stimulus processing emphasizing the concept of dynamic localization.

The present study aimed at dissociating both aspects using a preparation in rodents trained to perform in a target-discrimination task while recording the intracerebral electrocorticogram in parallel from left and right auditory cortex. While stimulus-related aspects of gamma-band activity were already evident in the naive subjects, aspects related to successful target-discrimination only emerged with learning. Frequency-modulated tones were employed as stimuli and were varied with respect to two stimulus dimensions, viz. "spectral content" and "modulation direction". A target stimulus had to be discriminated in a GO/(NO-GO) paradigm from three non-target stimuli matching the target in only one or none of these dimensions. Analysis of the event-related potentials indicated that the physical stimulus parameters explained most of the variance in amplitude of most event-related potential components. For the evoked gamma-band activity no learning related modulations were found. The induced gamma-band activity showed a relationship with the similarity of a stimulus with the target that was most prominent in the right hemisphere. The correspondence between task-specific behavior and the amplitude of induced gamma-band activity, both developing with learning, supports a functional relevance of this form of oscillation beyond merely processing physical stimulus attributes.

Recently, the wavelet-based coherence is suggested for this purpose due to that it can capture the time-varying characteristics of signals from which the Fourier transform would suffer. However, the quantitative comparison between Fourier- and wavelet-based coherence is less addressed. In this paper we used simulated signals under various signal-to-noise ratios and real evoked electrophysiological signals to assess the coherence estimation of these two methods. Our results showed that Fourier-based coherence is more affected by the Guassian noise than wavelet-based coherence, in particular at the frequency band of 18-50 Hz.

To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12 month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF=0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON=1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP=3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus.

However, little is known about how such social processes are integrated in the brain. Here, we used a specially designed dual-electroencephalogram system and the conceptual framework of coordination dynamics to identify neural signatures of effective, real-time coordination between people and its breakdown or absence. High-resolution spectral analysis of electrical brain activity before and during visually mediated social coordination revealed a marked depression in occipital alpha and rolandic mu rhythms during social interaction that was independent of whether behavior was coordinated or not. In contrast, a pair of oscillatory components (phi(1) and phi(2)) located above right centro-parietal cortex distinguished effective from ineffective coordination: increase of phi, favored independent behavior and increase of phi(2) favored coordinated behavior. The topography of the phi complex is consistent with neuroanatomical sources within the human mirror neuron system. A plausible mechanism is that the phi complex reflects the influence of the other on a person's ongoing behavior, with phi(1) expressing the inhibition of the human mirror neuron system and phi(2) its enhancement.

Normal neuromuscular motor control has two fundamental components: (1) to control the body, and (2) to predict the consequences of the control command, which is called motor prediction. In this study, after training with a specially designed BCI paradigm based on motor imagery, two subjects learnt to predict the time course of some features of the EEG signals. It is shown that, with this newly-obtained motor prediction skill, subjects can use motor imagery of feet to directly control a mobile robot to avoid obstacles and reach a small target in a time-critical scenario.

A Cartesian time-frequency approach to reveal brain interaction dynamics	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						brain; complex coherence; time-frequency analysis; magnetoencephalography	EEG DATA; COHERENCE; SIGNALS	The study of large-scale interactions from magnetoencephalographic data based on the magnitude of the complex coherence computed at channel level is a widely used method to track the coupling between neural signals. Traditionally, a measure based on the magnitude of the complex coherence estimated by Fourier analysis, has been used under the assumption that the neural signals are stationary. Here, we split the complex coherence in its real and imaginary parts and focus on the latter with the advantage that the imaginary part is insensitive to spurious connectivity resulting from volume conducted "self interaction". Furthermore, interacting sources alone contribute to a non-vanishing imaginary part of the complex coherence whereas the contribute of non-interacting sources is also mapped from the magnitude of the complex coherence. Since it has been extensively shown that non-stationary stochastic processes contribute to the generation of neural signals, it is fundamental to be able to define interaction measures that are able to follow the temporal variations in the coupling between neural signals. To this purpose time-frequency domain techniques to estimate the magnitude of the complex coherence have been developed in the past decades. Similarly, we extend the analysis of the imaginary part of complex coherence to the time-frequency domain, by using the short-time Fourier transform to analyze the complex coherence as a function of time. In this way, it is possible to get an indication about the dynamic of the underlying source interaction pattern by looking at channel level interactions without the bias introduced by artifactual self-interaction by volume conduction or by the contribute of non-interacting sources. Furthermore, the corresponding imaginary part of the cross-spectrogram can be used to estimate interactions on a source level by localizing pools of sources interacting at a given frequency and by characterizing their dynamics. The method has been applied to magnetoencephalographic data from a crossmodal visual auditory stimulation and provided evidence for the involvement of temporal and occipital areas in the integrated information processing for simultaneous audiovisual stimulation. Furthermore, the source interaction pattern shows a variation in time that reflects a dynamical synchronization of the involved brain sources in the frequency bands of interest.

Novelty detection aids the encoding of new information into memory-a process thought to depend on the HE and to be modulated by the theta rhythm of EEG. We examined EEG recorded in the HF of rats foraging for food within a novel environment, as it became familiar over the next five days, and in two more novel environments unexpectedly experienced in trials interspersed with familiar trials over three further days. We found that environmental novelty produces a sharp reduction in the theta frequency of foraging rats, that this reduction is greater for an unexpected environment than for a completely novel one, and that it slowly disappears with increasing familiarity. These results do not reflect changes in running speed and suggest that the septo-hippocampal system signals unexpected environmental change via a reduction in theta frequency. In addition, they provide evidence in support of a cholinergically mediated mechanism for novelty detection, have important implications for our understanding of oscillatory coding within memory and for the interpretation of event-related potentials, and provide indirect support for the oscillatory interference model of grid cell firing in medial entorhinal cortex.

While the theta rhythm was originally assumed to originate in the medial septum, more recent studies suggest autonomous theta generation in the MTL. Although coherence between entorhinal and hippocampal theta activity has been found to influence memory formation, it remains unclear whether these two structures can generate theta independently. In this study we analyzed intracranial electroencephalographic ( EEG) recordings from 22 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis undergoing presurgical evaluation prior to resection of the epileptic focus. Using a wavelet-based, frequency-band-specifi c measure of phase synchronization, we quantified synchrony between 10 different recording sites along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampal formation in the non-epileptic brain hemisphere. We compared EEG synchrony between adjacent recording sites (i) within the entorhinal cortex, (ii) within the hippocampus, and (iii) between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We observed a significant interregional gap in synchrony for the delta and theta band, indicating the existence of independent delta/theta rhythms in different subregions of the human MTL. The interaction of these rhythms could represent the temporal basis for the information processing required for mnemonic encoding and retrieval.

Using a spatial filtering technique, we localized gamma activity to primary visual cortex. We tested the hypothesis that spatial frequency properties of visual stimuli may be related to the temporal frequency characteristics of the associated cortical responses. We devised a method to assess temporal frequency differences between stimulus-related responses that typically exhibit complex spectral shapes. We applied this methodology to either single-trial (induced) or time-averaged (evoked) responses in four frequency ranges (0-40, 20-60, 40-80 and 60-100 Hz) and two time windows (either the entire duration of stimulus presentation or the first second following stimulus onset). Our results suggest that stimuli of varying spatial frequency induce responses that exhibit significantly different temporal frequency characteristics. These effects were particularly accentuated for induced responses in the classical gamma frequency band (20-60 Hz) analyzed over the entire duration of stimulus presentation. Strikingly, examining the first second of the responses following stimulus onset resulted in significant loss in stimulus specificity, suggesting that late signal components contain functionally relevant information. These findings advocate a functional role of gamma activity in sensory representation. We suggest that stimulus specific frequency characteristics of MEG signals can be mapped to processes of neuronal synchronization within the framework of coupled dynamical systems.

The decreased delta power probably corresponds to increased task-evoked arousal, whereas the transient theta power increase corresponds to working memory demand and possibly to the orienting response. The increased alpha1 and alpha2 power may be a manifestation of a top-down mechanism revealing control over the execution of a response. The area-specific, task-related, and frequency-dependent changes of EEG complexity measures indicate frontally increasing complexity during the early part of the CNV in the beta frequency bands, which underscores the importance of this region in the mechanisms of anticipatory behavior.

Simultaneous EEG/Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 4 Tesla: Correlates of Brain Activity to Spontaneous Alpha Rhythm During Relaxation	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG/fMRI; Alpha rhythm; Spontaneous brain activity; Thalamus; Windowed Fourier analysis; High-field MR imaging	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; 1.5 T; FMRI; EEG; SIGNAL; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; CONTRAST	Simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging have been applied to the study of brain states associated with alpha waves using a magnetic field strength of 1.5 Tesla and has been shown in recent years to be feasible up to 3 Tesla for other applications. This study demonstrates this technique's continued viability at a field strength of 4 Tesla, affording a proportionally greater sensitivity to changes in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. In addition, for the study of alpha correlations. the authors used a larger number of subjects and scanning sessions than in the previous work. Random effects group regression analysis of 35 EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions against occipital alpha magnitude in a relaxed state detected bilateral widespread activation of dorsal thalamus and portions of the anterior cingulate and cerebellum. In the same group analysis, deactivations arose predominantly in the fusiform and adjacent visual association areas with a small activation cluster also detected in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This pattern is consistent with a correspondence between alpha magnitude variations and resting state network dynamics ascertained by recent studies of low frequency spontaneous BOLD fluctuations. The central role of the thalamus in resting state networks correlated with alpha activity is highlighted. Demonstrating, the applicability Of simultaneous EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging up to 4 Tesla is particularly important for clinically relevant research involving challenging spontaneous EEG abnormalities, such as those of epilepsy.

EEG was recorded from 16 subjects performing a color and a shape discrimination task manipulated with constant and variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI) conditions. The power of oscillatory activity was investigated by convolving the EEG signals with Morlet wavelets. The constant ISI condition yielded significantly shorter reaction times than the variable ISI condition, indicating more efficient preparation for upcoming stimuli during the constant ISI. We found significantly higher prestimulus alpha activity in the constant ISI condition than in the variable ISI condition, but no significant CNV even in the constant ISI condition. Such a reflection of temporal expectancy in the prestimulus alpha activity corroborates that the prestimulus top-down mental state for preparing upcoming task-performance is considerably reflected in the prestimulus ongoing alpha activity.

Methods: We studied five patients (4.5-14 years) who underwent surgery following intracranial video-EEG (VEEG) monitoring. We analyzed clinical profiles, MRIs, scalp and intracranial. VEEGs, and MEGSSs. We localized ictal. HFOs using a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA). Results: Seizure onset ranged from 0.4 to 8 years. Three patients presented with asymmetrical spasms. Interictal scalp VEEG recorded predominantly unilateral epileptiform discharges in four; generalized and multifocal in one. Ictal. scalp VEEG showed generalized high-amplitude slow waves with superimposed fast waves in four patients; hemispheric electrodecremental episodes in one. MRI findings were normal in three, hemispheric polymicrogyria and periventricular heterotopia in one each. All. patients had unilateral MEGSS clusters. Ictal. HFOs, ranging from 150 to 250 Hz, localized over Rolandic and frontal regions in four, with one also having extensive temporo-occipital HFOs. After cortical resection, three patients were seizure free; one had >90% reduction in seizure frequency. One patient experienced residual seizures after resection of the hemispheric ictal HFO region. Conclusion: Unilateral clusters of MEGSSs overlapped regional IOZs in older patients with epileptic spasms. High spatio-temporal MBFA before and during spasms revealed the regional ictal HFOs. Seizure-free outcomes following resection of zone with MEGSS clusters and ictal HFOs suggested that a subset of epileptic spasms was focal-onset seizures. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some methods have been proposed to estimate the coupling strength among neural networks; however, few estimations of the coupling direction (information flow) among neural networks have been attempted. It is known that Bayesian estimator is based on a priori knowledge and a probability of event occurrence. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate coupling directions among neural networks with conditional mutual information that is estimated by Bayesian estimation. First, this method is applied to analyze the simulated EEG series generated by a nonlinear lumped-parameter model. In comparison with the conditional mutual information with Shannon entropy, it is found that this method is more successful in estimating the coupling direction, and is insensitive to the length of EEG series. Therefore, this method is suitable to analyze a short time series in practice. Second, we demonstrate how this method can be applied to the analysis of human intracranial epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and to indicate the coupling directions among neural networks. Therefore, this method helps to elucidate the epileptic focus localization.

Subjects were divided into a junior and a senior group and engaged in a simple and a complex version of "Go/No go" tasks. Cognitive, subjective and electrophysiological data were combined. Our results indicated that there was an increase in alpha power over time only in the junior group in the simple task and the senior group in the complex one, suggesting that, depending on age, the increase in alpha band vary in a different way according with the degree of task complexity and could reflect some different phenomena. Cognitive performance were independent of age but for the main dimensions of motivation, seniors had higher scores, and they were less sleepy than juniors. Finally, this study showed correlations between cognitive performance, subjective evaluations and electrophysiological measures, and their value for understanding the subject's engagement in a task.

Here, we compared this activity for voluntary and involuntary spatial attention in a spatial-cueing paradigm with faces as targets. The stimuli and trial timing were kept constant across attention conditions with only the predictive value of the cue changing. Gamma-band response was linked to voluntary shifts of attention, but not to the involuntary capture of attention. The presence of increased gamma responses for the voluntary allocation of attention, and its absence in cases of involuntary capture suggests that the neural mechanisms governing these two types of attention are different. Moreover, these data allow a description of the temporal dynamics contributing to the dissociation between voluntary and involuntary attention. The distribution of this correlate of voluntary attention is consistent with a top-down process involving contralateral anterior and posterior regions.

ISWs are a specific type of ictal EEG pattern characterized by a slow wave at the seizure onset followed by low voltage fast activity. Methods: Investigations were carried out on 14 patients from the UCLA hospital (USA) and 10 from the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium) implanted with depth and grid electrodes for localization of the epileptogenic zone. Results: Sixty-one seizures in the UCLA group and 30 seizures in the Ghent group were analyzed. Fourteen UCLA and seven Ghent patients had ISWs at seizure onset. The duration of ISWs varied between 0.3 to 6.0 s and maximum amplitude varied from 0.2 to 1.4 mV. ISWs in three of 14 UCLA patients (30% of seizures) had a consistent positive polarity at the deepest contacts that were located in the amygdala, hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex and reversed polarity outside of these brain areas (ISWs I). ISWs in I I of 14 UCLA patients (70% of seizures) had negative polarity at the deepest electrodes and their amplitude increased toward the recording contacts located in the white matter or neocortex (ISWs2). All ISWs from the seven Ghent patients were negative in the depth contacts (ISWs2) and positive on grid electrodes at the cortical surface. ISWs1 were associated with EEG spikes at the onset and on increase in amplitude of 10-20 Hz sinusoidal activity. In contrast, ISWs2 were associated with suppression of EEG amplitude, an increase in frequency in the range of 20-50 Hz, and did not have EEG spikes at the onset. Multiunit neuronal activity showed strong synchronization of neuronal discharges during interictal spikes, but multiunit synchronization was not obvious during ISWs2. Conclusion: The existence of EEG spikes and phase reversal with ISWs1 indicates this type of seizure may be triggered by hypersynchronous neuronal discharges; however, seizures with ISWs2 at the onset may be triggered by different mechanisms, perhaps nonneuronal.

However, the main output from the basal ganglia is via the thalamus, and corticothalamic feedback constitutes the primary source of synapses in the thalamus. We therefore focus on the thalamocortical interplay. During the surgical intervention in six patients, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from pallidal-recipient thalamic nuclei VA and VLa. Simultaneously, EEG was recorded from several sites on the scalp. The highest thalamocortical coherence was found in the theta frequency band (4 - 9 Hz) with a mean peak frequency of 7.5 Hz. The magnitude of thalamocortical theta coherence was comparable to the magnitude of EEG coherence between scalp electrode pairs. Thalamocortical theta coherence reached 70% and was maximal with frontal scalp sites on both hemispheres. In the 13 - 20 Hz beta frequency band, maximal coherence was comparatively low but localized on the scalp ipsilateral to the site of thalamic LFP recording. The high thalamocortical coherence underlines the importance of thalamic function for the genesis of scalp EEG. We discuss the PD pathophysiology within the framework of dysrhythmic thalamocortical interplay, which has important consequences for the choice of therapeutic strategy in patients with severe forms of PD.

Our results showed two scaling regions in all subjects' channels (for limited time scales from 0.01 to 0.04 s and from 0.08 to 0.43 s, respectively), with a clear bend when their corresponding slopes (alpha(1) and alpha(2)) were different. No significant differences between groups were found with a,. However, a2 values were significantly lower in control subjects at electrodes T5, T6, and O1 (p < 0.01, Student's t-test). These findings suggest that the scaling behavior of the EEG is sensitive to AD. Although a2 values allowed us to separate AD patients and controls, accuracies were lower than with spectral analysis. However, a forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure showed that the combined use of DFA and spectral analysis could improve the diagnostic accuracy of each individual technique. Thus, although spectral analysis outperforms DFA, the combined use of both techniques may increase the insight into brain dysfunction in AD.

What happens to the brain in weightlessness? A first approach by EEG tomography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; tilt; zero gravity; weightlessness; brain hemodynarnics	HEAD-DOWN TILT; SPACEFLIGHT; ASYMMETRY; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; EMOTION; MICROGRAVITY; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; SYNCHRONY	Basic changes in environmental conditions are fundamental to understanding brain cortical mechanisms. Several studies have reported impairment of central nervous Processes during weightlessness. There is ongoing debate as to whether these impairments are attributable to primary physiological effects or secondary psychological effects of the weightlessness environment. This study evaluates the physiological effects of changed gravity conditions on brain cortical activity. In a first experiment, EEG activity of seven participants Was recorded at normal, increased and zero gravity during a parabolic flight. Additionally an EEG under normal gravity conditions preflight was recorded. In a second experiment, 24 participants were exposed to a supine, seated and 9 degrees head-down tilt position while EEG was recorded. Data were analysed using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Beta-2 EEG activity (18-35 Hz) was found to be increased in the right Superior frontal gyrus under normal gravity conditions inflight. By exposure to weightlessness a distinct inhibition of this activity within the same areas Could be noticed. As the tilt experiment showed changes in the left inferior temporal gyrus in supine and tilted positions we conclude that the observed changes under weightlessness are not explainable by hemodynamic changes but Father reflect emotional processes related to the experience of weightlessness. These findings suggest that weightlessness has a major impact on electro cortical activity and may affect central nervous and adaptation processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

High-frequency gamma activity (80-150 Hz) is increased in human cortex during selective attention	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; ECoG; gamma oscillations; high-gamma activity; sensory cortex; intracranial EEG	HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; COHERENCE; POWER	Objective: To study the role of gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) in selective attention using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) in humans. Methods: We recorded ECoG in human subjects implanted with subdural electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Sequences of auditory tones and tactile vibrations of 800 ins duration were presented asynchronously, and subjects were asked to selectively attend to one of the two stimulus modalities in order to detect an amplitude increase at 400 ms in some of the stimuli. Results: Event-related ECoG gamma activity was greater over auditory cortex when subjects attended auditory stimuli and was greater over somatosensory cortex when subjects attended vibrotactile stimuli. Furthermore, gamma activity was also observed over prefrontal cortex when stimuli appeared in either modality, but only when they were attended. Attentional modulation of gamma power began similar to 400 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the temporal demands on attention. The increase in gamma activity was greatest at frequencies between 80 and 150 Hz, in the so-called high-gamma frequency range. Conclusions: There appears to be a strong link between activity in the high-gamma range (80-150 Hz) and selective attention. Significance: Selective attention is correlated with increased activity in a frequency range that is significantly higher than what has been reported previously using EEG recordings.

However, the genetic underpinnings of sleep microarchitecture in humans remain largely unknown. Here we report on the results of a classical twin study in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs examining the genetic effect on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) composition. Methods: Polysomnographic recordings were obtained in 35 pairs of MZ (26.4 +/- 5.4 years, 17-43 years, 17 male pairs, 18 female pairs) and 14 same-gender pairs of DZ twins (22.1 +/- 2.7 years, 18-26 years, 7 male pairs, 7 female pairs). The EEG power spectra were generated on the basis of Fast Fourier transformations combined with conventional sleep parameters, according to standardized criteria. Results: We tested the genetic variance contributing to the observed overall variance of the sleep measures and found that the relative contributions of the delta, theta, alpha, and sigma frequency bands at central derivations were significantly correlated to the genetic background. In these frequency bands, MZ twins also showed within-pair concordance in spectral power that was significantly higher than that of DZ twins. Conclusions: The broad overlap of EEG frequencies during non-REM sleep and wakefulness, which shows a significant genetic variance, supports the hypothesis of common neuronal mechanisms generating EEG oscillations in humans. Our findings strongly support the suitability of the spectral composition of non-REM sleep for defining endophenotypes.

Up to this time all requirements and limitations established by national and international regulations and recommendations for safety of electromagnetic fields (EMF) are based on the quantitative data of EMF thermal effect. Analysis of different approaches for estimation of sensitivity of the brain were applied in this study: theoretical sensitivity of living cell to microwave radiation, hypothesis of the quasithermal effect, experimental data of microwave radiation effects on the brain, special experiments to avoid thermal effect, experiments at radiation power density lower and higher than thermal limit. As a result it was shown that statistically significant changes occurred in the EEG rhythms at microwave radiation power densities about 10 dB less than thermal limit Clear dependence of the results on modulation frequency confirmed that the effect has nonthermal origin. The intensity of the effect is not linearly related to the applied field power density.

It has been suggested that functional connectivity between brain areas may be of major value in explaining excessive craving and compulsive drug seeking by providing essential link between psychological and biological processes. Considering that withdrawal initiates a widespread activation of cortical regions responsible for compulsive drug seeking and desire for the drug, we predict that withdrawal would result in a significant increase in functional cortical connectivity. We applied the novel operational architectonics approach that enables us to estimate both local and remote functional cortical connectivity by means of EEG structural synchrony measure. In 13 withdrawal opioid-dependent patients we found the evidence that local and remote cortical functional connectivity was indeed significantly enhanced (for both alpha and beta frequency oscillations). Additionally, statistical relationship between functional connectivity and the severity of opioid withdrawal has been found. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

EEG evidence of gender differences in a motor related CNV study	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						gender differences; CNV; EEG	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; RESPONSE SELECTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TASK; ANTICIPATION; ASYMMETRY; MOVEMENT; MEMORY	In the present study gender differences related to the contingent negative variation (CNV) were investigated. A series of two acoustic stimuli was presented to participants across a wide age range. The first stimulus was consistent throughout the experiment whereas the second one was either a high frequency or a low frequency tone. One of them had to be answered by a button press (go condition) the other did not require any response (nogo condition). Between the first and the second tone there was a time period of two seconds in which the CNV appeared as a slow negative potential shift. Within this episode data were analysed with respect to gender differences. Statistical analysis revealed topographical differences between men and women in go conditions for both left and right index finger movements. Differences were found over frontal regions where women showed higher brain activity than men and over temporo-parietal regions where men produced higher brain activity than women. In order to explain the fact that only in "go" conditions significant gender differences occurred we introduce the phenomenon of implicit learning. Due to implicit learning assumed predictions related to S2 might have occurred from time to time. This is so, because a 50% chance for one of two different stimuli to occur leads to reasonable assumed predictions after two or more stimuli of a kind occurring in a series. The present data now provide evidence that if such assumed prediction or expectancy is directed towards an upcoming demand to act then brain activity is subject to gender differences. Further studies providing controlled sequences of "go" conditions versus "nogo" conditions have to be done to prove this idea true.

J	Miller, JW; Kim, W; Holmes, MD; Vanhatalo, S				Miller, John W.; Kim, Wonsuk; Holmes, Mark D.; Vanhatalo, Sampsa			Ictal localization by source analysis of infraslow activity in DC-coupled scalp EEG recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE SEIZURES; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; SHIFTS; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY	New bedside long-term DC-coupled EEG techniques have demonstrated that infraslow (< 0.5 Hz) activity lateralizes temporal lobe seizures (Vanhatalo, S., Holmes, M.D., Tallgren, P., Voipio, J., Kaila, K., Miller, J.W., 2003a. Very slow EEG responses indicate the laterality of temporal lobe seizures: a DC-EEG study. Neurology 60, 1098-1104). However, even high amplitude infraslow activity is difficult to localize by simple visual inspection if there is overlying faster EEG activity or slow artifact. In this study, we address this with improved DC-coupled EEG recording and analysis techniques and also extend observation to both temporal and extratemporal seizures. Recordings were performed during presurgical evaluation of medically intractable epilepsy, with 20 seizures in 11 patients analyzed. A commercial DC-coupled recording device was used, with sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes in a standard 10-10 system array, with additional anterior temporal and subtemporal electrodes. Seizures were localized with a software package by means of source montage analysis. Infraslow signals occurred with all seizures, often with amplitude orders of magnitude higher than conventional frequencies (0.5 to 70 Hz). The most reliable method to localize these signals and distinguish them from artifacts used a source montage after low-pass filtering below 0.5 Hz. Five of the eight patients who received epilepsy surgery had follow-up documenting significant seizure reduction, and infraslow signal analysis correctly localized the region of seizure onset in all five, while conventional noninvasive EEG recording and analysis localized only three of the five. Several seizures were also analyzed using principle component analysis source localization methods, with the results less consistently localizing than source montage analysis. DC-coupled EEG recordings give clinically useful information to noninvasively localize the seizure focus. The value of this method is increased by source analysis tools that reveal localized changes more clearly than direct visual inspection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Self-organized 40 Hz synchronization in a physiological theory of EEG	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting	JUL, 2006	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			electroencephalogram; self-organization; gamma band; 40 Hz; synchronization	TASK	We present evidence that large-scale spatial coherence of 40 Hz oscillations can emerge dynamically in a cortical mean field theory. The simulated synchronization time scale is about 150 ms, which compares well with experimental data on large-scale integration during cognitive tasks. The same model has previously provided consistent descriptions of the human EEG at rest, with tranquilizers, under anesthesia, and during anesthetic-induced epileptic seizures. The emergence of coherent gamma band activity is brought about by changing just one physiological parameter until cortex becomes marginally unstable for a small range of wavelengths. This suggests for future study a model of dynamic computation at the edge of cortical stability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A previous study of P50 sensory gating did not reveal abnormalities in high-functioning school age children [C. Kemner, B. Oranje, M.N. Verbaten, H. van Engeland, Normal P50 gating in children with autism, J. Clin. Psychiatry 63 (2002) 214-217]. Sensory gating deficit may, however, characterize younger children with autism or be a feature of retarded children with autism, reflecting imbalance of neuronal excitation/inhibition in these cohorts. We applied a paired clicks paradigm to study P50 sensory gating, and its relation to IQ and EEG gamma spectral power (as a putative marker of cortical excitability), in young (3-8 years) children with autism (N = 21) and age-matched typically developing children (N = 21). P50 suppression in response to the second click was normal in high-functioning children with autism, but significantly (p < 0.03) reduced in those with mental retardation. P50 gating improved with age in both typically developing children and those with autism. Higher ongoing EEG gamma power corresponded to lower P50 suppression in autism (p < 0.02), but not in control group. The data suggest that ineffective inhibitory control of sensory processing is characteristic for retarded children with autism and may reflect excitation/inhibition imbalance in this clinical group.

The right-handed university Students (27 males and 26 females) participated in the experiments. The instruction "to create the most original solution" (INS2) as compared to (he instruction "to create any solution" (INS I) produced an increase in baseline coherence and task-related desynchronization in the alphal,2 bands. This effect was more pronounced in the anterior cortex. Changes in the beta2 rhythm were found mostly in the posterior cortex and were presented by a decreased task-induced beta2 synchronization after INS2 vs. INS1. Instruction-related coherence changes in the alpha 1 band did not depend on factors of gender and task type, whereas the effects of these factors on the alpha2 and beta2 bands were significant. Gender differences in instruction-related coherence changes were found in the alpha2 band during verbal creativity testing, whereas figural creativity was associated with gender-dependent instruction-related changes in the beta2 band. These differences were more pronounced in the INS1 condition. The results demonstrate that extrinsic motivation of creative thinking promotes the frequency-specific reorganization of hemispheric interactions. High-frequency widespread cortical oscillations are of greater significance in men, whereas low-frequency rhythms and, mainly, functioning of the frontal cortex greatly contribute to creative activity in women.

In rodents they occur in association with sharp waves and are grouped by the cortical slow oscillation such that, in parallel with sleep spindles, ripple activity is suppressed during the hyperpolarized down-state and enhanced during the depolarized up-state. The temporal coupling between slow oscillations, spindles and ripples has been suggested to serve a hippocampo-neocortical dialogue underlying memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined whether a similar coupling exists between these oscillatory phenomena in humans. In sleep recordings from seven epileptic patients, scalp-recorded slow oscillations and spindles as well as parahippocampal ripples recorded from foramen ovale electrodes were identified by automatic algorithms. Additionally, ripple and spindle root mean square activity was determined for relevant frequency bands. Ripple density was higher during Non-REM than REMsleep (P <0.001). Ripple activity distinctly decreased time-locked to slow oscillation negative half-waves in the three patients without temporal structural alterations (P <0.001), whereas in the four patients with severe mesiotemporal structural alterations this coupling was obscure. Generally, in the patients ripple activity was increased before spindle peaks and distinctly decreased after the peak ( P <0.001). Ripples were consistently associated with interictal spikes suggesting that spike-ripple complexes represent an epileptic transformation of sharp wave-ripple complexes in the epileptic hippocampus. Our findings are consistent with the notion of a hippocampo-to-neocortical information transfer during sleep that is linked to coordinate ripple and spindle activity, and that in the intact temporal lobe is synchronized to cortical slow oscillations.

Multisensory processing and oscillatory activity: analyzing non-linear electrophysiological measures in humans and simians	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cross-modal; bimodal; EEG; ERP; binding; oscillation; beta gamma	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; AUDITORY ASSOCIATION CORTEX; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HUMAN BRAIN; HUMAN EEG; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CROSSMODAL BINDING	Stimulus-related oscillations are known to be closely linked to integrative processing in the brain. One research domain within which there has been tremendous interest in oscillatory mechanisms is in the integration of inputs across the widely separated sensory systems. Under the standard approach of assessing multisensory interactions in electrophysiological datasets, the event-related response to a multisensory stimulus is directly compared with the sum of the responses to its unisensory constituents when presented alone. When using methods like wavelet transformation or fast Fourier transformation to derive induced oscillatory signals, however, such linear operations are not appropriate. Here we introduce a simple bootstrapping procedure wherein the linear summation of single unisensory trials forms a distribution against which multisensory trials may be statistically compared, an approach that circumvents the issue of non-linearity when combining unisensory oscillatory responses. To test this approach we applied it to datasets from intracranial recordings in non-human primates and human scalp-recorded EEG, both derived from a simple audio-visual integration paradigm. Significant multisensory interactions were revealed in oscillatory activity centered at 15 and 20 Hz (the so-called beta band). Simulations of different levels of background noise further validated the results obtained by this method. By demonstrating super- and sub-additive effects, our analyses showed that this approach is a valuable metric for studying multisensory interactions reflected in induced oscillatory responses.

Adult rats were chronically instrumented with sleep-wake recording electrodes. Following post-surgical recovery, rats were habituated extensively for freely moving polygraphic recording conditions. On the first experimental recording day (baseline day, BLD), polygraphic signs of undisturbed sleep-wake activities were recorded for 4 h (between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM). During the second experimental recording day (REM sleep deprivation day, RDD), rats were selectively deprived of REM sleep for the first 2 h and then allowed to have normal sleep-wake for the following 2 h. The results demonstrated that during the first 2 h, compared to BLD, RDD recordings exhibited 87.80% less time in REM sleep and 16% more time in non-REM (NREM) sleep. The total percentages of wakefulness remained comparable between the BLD and RDD. During the RDD, the mean number of REM sleep episodes was much higher than in the BLD, indicating increased REM sleep drive. Electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectral analysis revealed that selective REM sleep deprivation increased delta power but decreased theta power during the residual REM sleep. During the last 2 h, after REM sleep deprivation, rats spent 51% more time in REM sleep compared to the BLD. Also during this period, the number of REM sleep episodes with the shortest (5-30 s) and longest (> 120 s) duration increased during the RDD. These findings suggest that the REM sleep homeostatic process involves increased delta- and decreased theta-frequency wave activities in the cortical EEG. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Method Neural oscillations refer to periodic variations in the recording of neural activity The temporal synchronization of oscillations represents a mechanism of neural communication implicated in normal brain functioning as well as psychopathology. We reviewed physiological, imaging, and neuropsychological evidence that tics and symptoms of ADHD may result from abnormal oscillatory activity in the brain. Results Structural and functional abnormalities in the cortical- striatal-thalamo cortical circuits may result in the disruption of oscillatory activity within the basal ganglia of individuals with TS and lead to transient hyperpolarization of selected thalamocortical regions. Extended to TS plus ADHD this or similar mechanisms, in turn, would lead to the dysrhythmia of particular vulnerable cortical regions and give rise to various deficits in motor control (TS + ADHD) as well as impulsivity and attention (ADHD). Compensatory systems within the prefrontal cortex could be activated and trained to modulate the misguided striatal and thalamocortical oscillations. Conclusions Although it is highly likely that abnormal neural oscillations have a prominent role in co-occurrence of TS + ADHD, its final relevance in this case deserves further differentiated research (i.e. oscillatory networks disentangled from other neuropsychiatric disorders).

In this paper, we discuss a nonparametric method for detecting the directionality of coupling based on the estimation of information theoretic functionals. We consider several different methods for estimating conditional mutual information. The behavior of each estimator with respect to its free parameter is shown using a linear model where an analytical estimate of conditional mutual information is available. Numerical experiments in detecting coupling directionality are performed using chaotic oscillators, where the influence of the phase extraction method and relative frequency ratio is investigated.

The cortical contribution to rhythmic motor patterns of the feet, however, has never been evaluated in humans. In this study we investigated EEG activity related to rhythmic stepping and tapping movements in 10 healthy subjects. Subjects performed self-paced fast bilateral anti-phase, in-phase and unilateral rhythmic foot movements as well as an isometric cocontraction of the calf muscles, while being seated as relaxed as possible. Surface EMG from the anterior tibial muscles was recorded in parallel with a 64 channel EEG. Power spectra, corticomuscular coherence and corticomuscular delay were calculated. All subjects showed corticomuscular coherence at the stepping frequencies in the central midline region that extended further to the frontal mesial area. The magnitude and the topography of this coherence were equal for the right and left anterior tibial muscle and all movement conditions. During cocontraction there was coherence in the 15-30 Hz range which was refined to the central midline area. EEG-EMG delays were significant in 9 subjects with values between 14 and 26 ms, EMG-EEG feedback was only found in 6 subjects with delays between 25 and 40 ms. We conclude that rhythmic motor patterns of the feet are represented in the cortex, transmitted to the muscles with delays compatible with fast corticospinal transmission and fed back to the cortex. A similar cortical contribution may be important also for gait control in humans. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Raethjen, Jan; Govindan, R.

The investigation of sleep and associated disorders requires the overnight acquisition of a huge amount of biosignal data derived from various sensors (polysomnographic recording) as well as consecutive time-consuming manual analysis (polysomnographic analysis). Therefore, the development of automatic analysis systems has become a major focus in sleep research in the recent years, resulting in the development of algorithms for the analysis of different biosignals (EEG, ECG, EMG, breathing signals). In this study, an open source algorithm published by Hamilton et al. was used for ECG analysis, whereas the analysis of breathing signals was done using an algorithm published by Clark et al. using also variations of the intra-thoracic pressure for the detection of breathing disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) analysis was done with a self-made algorithm, whereas EEG analyses are currently under development, using both frequency analysis modules and pattern recognition procedures. Although all these algorithms have proved to be quite useful, their validity and reliability still needs to be verified in future studies. Taking into account that during a standard polysomnographic recording data from approximately 8 hours of sleep are collected, it is imaginable that processing this amount of data by the described algorithms very often exceeds the calculating capacity of current standard computers. Using Grid technology, this limitation can be transcended by splitting biosignal data and distributing it to several analysis computers. Therefore, Grid based automatic analysis systems may improve the effectiveness of polysomnographic investigations and thereby diminish the costs for health care providers.

Spontaneous neural activity is closely linked to development and perception, and is correlated with behavior. Some of this activity is probably related to internal processing of task- and goal-relevant information, but some is simply noise. Two previous studies have reported correlations between performance on behavioral tasks and measures of neural noise and have characterized these relationships as intrinsic stochastic resonance (SR). We argue that neither of these studies demonstrated intrinsic SR, and discuss several alternative ways of measuring ENN in humans from EEG or MEG records. Using one of these, random-phase power in the 30-50 Hz range 1 sec before the onset of the signal, we demonstrate a kind of intrinsic SR that optimizes detection of weak visual signals. Minimum response time was obtained when this EEG measure of ENN was in a middle decile. No other measure of ENN was related either to response time or to an unbiased measure of detection accuracy (e.g., d'). A discussion of the implications of these findings for the study of intrinsic SR concludes the paper.

The effect of higher doses of isoflurane, widely used in clinical settings, on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is meanwhile ignored. In this study we investigated the integrity of the BBB during various levels of isoflurane anaesthesia (1% and 3%) in cats by monitoring the extravasation of Evans blue. Simultaneously we measured the electroencephalogram (EEG), with particular emphasis on its direct current (DC) component. High doses of anaesthetic (3%) broke down the BBB in the cortex and thalamus, while milder doses (1%) only opened the BBB in the thalamus. The fluorescent signal of Evans blue was visible over an extravascular length of 23 mu m in the cortex and 25 mu m in the thalamus, similar to the diffusion of the same dye when the BBB was disrupted with mannitol. The opening of the BBB was associated with (i) a positive DC shift in the EEG measured on the scalp and (ii) an evaluated increase in cerebral volume of 2-2.8%. The opening of the BBB by high doses of isoflurane brings into discussion hitherto unexplored effects of anaesthesia on the brain. The electrophysiological correlate provided by the DC component of the EEG constitutes a promising option for the assessment of the BBB integrity during human anaesthesia.

It is associated with a number of conditions including deafness but may arise spontaneously. Brain imaging studies indicate increased neuronal excitability and decreased density of benzodiazepine receptors in temporal (auditory) cortex but the source and mechanism of such changes are unknown. Various electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities involving temporal lobe and other brain areas have been described but recordings have been limited to standard EEG wave bands up to frequencies of 22 Hz. This clinical study of otherwise healthy patients with intractable unilateral tinnitus, using quantitative EEG power spectral mapping (QEEG), identified discrete localised unilateral foci of high frequency activity in the gamma range (>40-80 Hz) over the auditory cortex in eight patients experiencing tinnitus during recording. These high frequency "hot spots" were not present in 25 subjects without tinnitus. The results suggest that further EEG investigations should include recordings in the gamma frequency range since such high frequency oscillations are believed to be necessary for perception. Identification of "hot spots" in tinnitus patients would provide a means for monitoring the effects of new treatments. These findings may also provide a model for exploration of more complex phenomena such as verbal and musical hallucinations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we attempt to address these issues. We recorded 64 channel surface EEGs and EMGs from forearm muscles in 15 patients with definite ET. EEG and EMG power spectra, relative power of the rhythmic EMG activity, relative EEG power at the tremor frequency, and EEG-EMG and EEG-EEG coherence were calculated and their dynamics over time explored. Corticomuscular delay was studied using a new method for narrow-band coherent signals. Corticomuscular coherence in the contralateral central region at the tremor frequency was present in all patients in recordings with a relative tremor EMG power exceeding a certain level. However, the coherence was lost intermittently even with tremors far above this level. Physiological 15- to 30-Hz coherence was found consistently in 11 patients with significantly weaker EMG activity in this frequency range. A more frontal (mesial) hot spot was also intermittently coupled with the tremor and the central hot spot in five patients. Corticomuscular delays were compatible with transmission in fast corticospinal pathways and feedback of the tremor signal. Thus the tremor rhythm is intermittently relayed only in different cortical motor areas. We hypothesize that tremor oscillations build up in different subcortical and subcortico-cortical circuits only temporarily entraining each other.

Intelligence and EEG phase reset: A two compartmental model of phase shift and lock	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG phase reset; phase shift duration; phase lock duration; intelligence	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; NONLINEAR INTERDEPENDENCE; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STATE TRANSITIONS; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; RESOLUTION	Objectives: The purpose Of this Study was to explore the relationship between EEG phase reset and performance on the Wechsler Intelligence test. Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 378 subjects ranging in age from 5 years to 17.6 years. The Wechsler Intelligence test (WISC-R) was administered to the same subjects on the same day but not while the EEG was recorded. Complex demodulation was used to compute instantaneous EEG phase differences between pairs of electrodes and the 1st and 2nd derivatives were used to measure phase reset by phase shift duration and phase lock duration. The dependent variable was full scale I.Q. and the independent variables were phase shift duration (SID) and phase lock duration (LID) with age as a covariate. Results: Phase shift duration (40-90 ms) was positively related to intelligence (P<.00001) and the phase lock duration (100-800 ms) was negatively related to intelligence (P<.00001). Phase reset in short interelectrode distances (6 cm) was more highly correlated to I.Q. (P<.0001) than in long distances (> 12 cm). Conclusions: The duration Of unstable phase dynamics and phase locking represent a bounded optimization process, for example, too long a duration of phase locking then less flexibility and too short of a phase shift then reduced neural resources. A two compartmental model of local field Coupling and neuron synchrony to a preferred phase was developed to explain the findings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Thatcher, R.

Methods: We evaluated spatial patterns of EEG slow-wave synchronization between all possible pairs of electrodes (19) placed over the scalp of 10 sleeping healthy young normal subjects using two graph theoretical measures: the clustering coefficient (Cp) and the characteristic path length (Lp). The measures were obtained during the different sleep stages and CAP conditions from the real EEG connectivity networks and randomized control (surrogate) networks (Cp-s and Lp-s). Results: Cp and Cp/Cp-s increased significantly from wakefulness to sleep while Lp and Lp/Lp-s did not show changes. Cp/Cp-s was higher for A1 phases, compared to B phases of CAP. Conclusions: The network organization of the EEG slow-wave synchronization during sleep shows features characteristic of small-world networks (high Cp combined with low Lp); this type of organization is slightly but significantly more evident during the CAP Al subtypes. Significance: Our results show feasibility of using graph theoretical measures to characterize the complexity of brain networks during sleep and might indicate sleep, and the A1 phases of CAP in particular, as a period during which slow-wave synchronization shows optimal network organization for information processing.

Experts (n = 8) and novices (n = 10) had to shoot repeatedly while EEG was recorded, and the time course of Fm theta during the aiming period was significantly different between the two groups, showing a steady increase of power for the last 3 s before the shot only for experts, but not for novices. Source analysis (LORETA) indicated a significantly stronger theta activity for experts strictly located at the anterior cingulate area and medial frontal cortex, locations well known for focused attention. The results suggest that experts and novices use different strategies during the aiming period. While novices keep a relatively constant amount of attention to the target, experts are able to increase attention exactly to the time point of the trigger pull. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that reactivating cholinergic input, a key component in normal cognition and memory operations, in slices of the cat primary visual and somatosensory thalamus, produces robust alpha rhythms. These rhythms rely on activation of muscarinic receptors and are primarily coordinated by activity in the recently discovered, gap junction-coupled subnetwork of high-threshold (HT) bursting thalamocortical neurons. By performing extracellular field recordings in combination with intracellular recordings of these cells, we show that (1) the coupling of HT bursting cells is sparse, with individual neurons typically receiving discernable network input from one or very few additional cells, (2) the phase of oscillatory activity at which these cells prefer to fire is readily modifiable and determined by a combination of network input, intrinsic properties and membrane polarization, and (3) single HT bursting neurons can potently influence the local network state. These results substantially extend the known effects of cholinergic activation on the thalamus and, in combination with previous studies, show that sensory thalamic nuclei possess powerful and dynamically reconfigurable mechanisms for generating synchronized alpha activity that can be engaged by both descending and ascending arousal systems.

Information theoretic equivalent bandwidths of random processes and their applications	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation (BSI 2005)	SEP 06-08, 2005	Tokyo, JAPAN			instantaneous equivalent bandwidths; Renyi divergence; Burg entropy; positive time-frequency distribution; Copula theory	LINEAR PREDICTION	Objectives: Since most of the biomedical signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG) and phonocardiogram (PCG), are nonstationary random processes, the time-frequency analysis has recently been extensively applied to those signals in order to achieve precise characterization and classification. In this paper, we hove first defined a new class of information theoretic equivalent bandwidths (EBWs) of stationary random processes, then instantaneous EBWs (IEBWs) using nonnegative time-frequency distributions have been defined in order to track the change of the EBW of a nonstationary random process. Methods: The new class of EBWs which includes spectral flatness measure (SFM) for stationary random processes is defined by using generalized Burg entropy. Generalized Burg entropy is derived from the relation between Renyi entropy and Renyi information divergence of order a. In order to track the change of EBWs of a nonstationary random process, the IEBWs are defined on the nonnegative time-frequency distributions, which are constructed by the Copula theory. Results: We evaluate the IEBWs for a first order stationary auto-regressive (AR) process and three types of time-varying AR processes. The results show that the IEBWs proposed here properly represent a signal bandwidth. In practical application to PCGs, the proposed method was successful in extracting the information that the bandwidth of the innocent systolic murmur was much smaller than that of the abnormal systolic murmur. Conclusions: We have defined new information theoretic EBWs and have proposed a novel method to track the change of the IEBWs. Some computer simulation showed effectiveness of the methods. Applying the IEBWs to PCGs, we could extract some features of a systolic murmur.

Here, we present the first report of a state window within anesthesia- induced coma, usually associated with an EEG pattern of burst suppression, during which brain excitability is dramatically increased so that even subliminal stimuli elicit bursts of whole- brain activity. We investigated this phenomenon in vivo using intracellular recordings of both neurons and glia, as well as extracellular calcium and EEG recordings. The results indicate that the bursting activity elicited with mechanical microstimulations, but also with auditory and visual stimuli, is dependent on complex mechanisms, including modulation of excitatory ( NMDA) components, gap junction transmission, as well as the extracellular calcium concentration. The occurrence of bursting events is associated with a postburst refractory period that underlies the genesis of the alternating burst- suppression pattern. These findings raise the issue of what burst spontaneity during anesthesia- induced coma means and opens new venues for the handling of comatose patients.

J	Townsend, G; Feng, Y				Townsend, George; Feng, Yi			Using phase information to reveal the nature of event-related desynchronization	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Delta-phase; Multi-class BCI; Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related synchronization (ERS)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; COMPUTER; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; BAND; BCI	It is common knowledge among brain researchers that certain events, such as motor imagery, can elicit event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERD/ERS) of neurons in the brain, and that these phenomena manifest themselves in terms of band power changes in brain signals. There are, however, also important phase related changes in the brain signals associated with ERD/ERS which we investigate here. We quantify for the first time the "delta-phase" component of the Complex Band Power (CBP) features introduced in [G. Townsend, B. Graimann, G. Pfurtscheller, A comparison of common spatial patterns with complex band power features in a four-class BCI Experiment, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 53 (2006) 642-651] and [G. Townsend, Brain Computer Interfaces: Phase Features and Post Processing Issues, Ph.D. Thesis, 2006, p. 97]. Although this component, which makes explicit use of phase, is known from these earlier studies to provide improved classification results in a brain-computer interface (BCI), this phenomenon has never been investigated purely in the context of a physiological phenomenon. The importance of this study is to fill this gap in our knowledge by providing an analysis and quantification of this new feature so that an improved understanding of its nature will allow further exploitation of this feature to further improve BCI systems. Given that the primary use of BCIs is as an assistive technology for the disabled, the importance of this work to society cannot be overstated. Changes in band power in the context of ERD/ERS have been investigated in the past using a visualization tool called an ERD/ERS map [B. Graimann, Movement-Related Patterns in ECoG and EEG: Visualization and Detection, Ph.D. Thesis, 2003, p. 107]. We present and discuss here for the first time, an equivalent tool called the delta-phase map used to visualize the occurrence of delta-phase in different frequency bands and over the time courses of motor imagery trials. In this study, the delta-phase feature is shown to be proportional to frequency and is quantified and presented in that context for clarity. It was found that the most prominent ERD activity occurring in the frequency bands studied here are correlated to the activity captured in the delta-phase maps. The underlying nature of ERD/ERS is explored based on evidence provided by the delta-phase feature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automated seizure onset detection for accurate onset time determination in intracranial EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure onset detection; Machine learning; EEG	SPONTANEOUS EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; APPLIED CURRENTS; CORTICAL STIMULATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; PULSE STIMULATION; PATTERNS; EPILEPSY; AFTERDISCHARGES; TRANSITION	Objective: A novel algorithm for automated seizure onset detection is presented. The method allows for precise identification of electrographic seizure onset times within large databases of electrographic data. Methods: The patient-specific algorithm extracts salient spectral and temporal features in five frequency bands within a sliding window of an electrographic recording. Feature windows are classified as containing or not containing a seizure onset via Support vector machines. A clustering and regression analysis is utilized to accurately localize seizure onsets in time. User-adjustable parameters allow for tuning of detection sensitivity, false positive rate, and latency. The method was tested on intracranial electrographic data recorded from six patients with a total of 1792 recorded seizure onsets from 8246 total electrographic recordings. Results: Testing of algorithm performance via cross-validation resulted in sensitivities between 80% and 98%, false positive rates from 0.002 to 0.046 per minute (0.12-2.8 per hour), and median detection time within 100 ms of the electrographic onset for all patients. In five of the six patients, more than 90% of all detected onsets were less than 3 s from the electrographic onset. Conclusions: The detection system was able to detect seizure onset times in a temporally unbiased fashion with low latency while maintaining reasonable sensitivities and false positive rates. The regression algorithm for temporal localization of onsets confers a considerable benefit in terms of detection latency. Significance: With the use Of Our algorithm, large databases of electrographic data can be rapidly processed and seizure onset times accurately marked, facilitating research and analyses of peri-onset events that require precise seizure onset alignment.

The present study sought to characterize the effects of circadian fluctuations of tonic alertness on HFOs in awake humans. Median nerve SEPs were recorded at four times during a 24-hour waking period. In parallel to the SEP recordings, a reaction-time (RT) task was performed to assess tonic alertness. Additionally, the spontaneous EEG was monitored. The low-frequency SEP component N20 and the early and late HFO parts did not change across the measurement sessions. In contrast, RTs were clearly prolonged at night and on the second morning. EEG also showed increased delta power at night. HFOs are sensitive to pronounced vigilance changes, such as sleep, but are refractory to fluctuations of tonic alertness. Tonic alertness is regarded to be the top-down cognitive control mechanism of wakefulness, whereas sleep is mediated by overwhelming bottom-up regulation, which seems apparently more relevant for, at least in part, subcortically triggered high-frequency burst generation in the ascending somatosensory system.

Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: Visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillation; 40 Hz; contrast; visual	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; REACTION-TIME; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VEP LATENCY; BOTTOM-UP; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERN	We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Because cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor activation on sensory gating and neuronal oscillations in rats. Methods: Auditory sensory gating has been recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in anesthetized rats. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded from the hippocampus, medial septum, EC and medial prefrontal cortex in anesthetized and freely moving rats. Effects of systemic administration of CB1 receptor agonist CP-55940 were evaluated on these parameters. Results: CP-55940 significantly disrupted auditory gating both in the hippocampus and EC in anesthetized rats. Theta field potential oscillations were disrupted in the hippocampus and EC, with simultaneous interruption of theta-band oscillations of septal neurons. Administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM-251 reversed both the agonist-induced gating deficit and the diminished oscillations. In freely moving rats, CP-55940 significantly reduced theta and gamma power in the hippocampus, whereas in the EC, only gamma power was attenuated. However, novelty-induced theta and gamma activities were significantly diminished by CP-55940 in both the hippocampus and EC. Conclusions: Our data indicate that activation of CB1 receptors interferes with neuronal network oscillations and impairs sensory gating function in the limbic circuitry, further supporting the connection between cannabis abuse and increased susceptibility of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

As a consequence, such high-density ERP mapping yields fairly dense ERP data sets that are often hard to analyze comprehensively or to relate straightforwardly to specific cognitive or emotional processes, because of the richness of the recorded signal in both the temporal (millisecond time-resolution) and spatial (multidimensional topographic information) domains. Principal component analyses (PCA) and topographic analyses (combined with distributed source localization algorithms) have been developed and successfully used to deal with this complexity, now offering powerful alternative strategies for data-driven analyses in complement to more traditional ERP analyses based on waveforms and peak measures. In this paper, we first briefly review the basic principles of these approaches, and then describe recent ERP studies that illustrate how they can inform about the precise spatio-temporal dynamic of emotion processing. These studies show that the perception of emotional visual stimuli may produce both quantitative and qualitative changes in the electric field configuration recorded at the scalp level, which are not apparent when using conventional ERP analyses. Additional information gained from these approaches include the identification of a sequence of successive processing stages that may not fully be reflected in ERP waveforms only, and the segregation of multiple or partly overlapping neural events that may be blended within a single ERP waveform. These findings highlight the added value of such alternative analyses when exploring the electrophysiological manifestations of complex and distributed mental functions, as for instance during emotion processing.

Aborted and refractory status epilepticus in children: A comparative analysis	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						status epilepticus; refractory status epilepticus; children; epilepsy	CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; RISK-FACTORS; MIDAZOLAM INFUSION; TERM MORTALITY; INTENSIVE-CARE; FIRST EPISODE; 1ST EPISODE; MANAGEMENT; CHILDHOOD	Purpose: The aims of this retrospective study were: (1) to compare the demographics, clinical characteristics, etiology, and EEG findings of status epilepticus aborted with medication (ASE) and refractory status epilepticus (RSE), (2) to describe the treatment response of status epilepticus (SE), and (3) to determine predictors of long-term outcome in children with SE. Methods: Medical records and EEG lab logs with ICD-9 diagnostic codes related to SE were reviewed. Patients younger than 18 years of age, hospitalized in 1994-2004 at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, were included. Results: One hundred fifty-four children had SE; 94 (61%) had ASE, and 60 (39.0%) had RSE. Family history of seizures, higher seizure frequency score, higher number of maintenance antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), nonconvulsive SE, and focal or electrographic seizures on initial EEG were associated with RSE by univariate analysis. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in RSE (13.3%) than in ASE (2.1%). In the long term, survivors with RSE developed more new neurological deficits (p < 0.001) and more epilepsy (p < 0.004) than children with ASE. Children treated in a more aggressive fashion appeared to have better treatment responses (p < 0.001) and outcomes (p = 0.03). Predictors of poor outcome were long seizure duration (p < 0.001), acute symptomatic etiology (p = 0.04), nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) (p = 0.01), and age at admission < 5 years (p = 0.05). Discussion: Several patient and clinical characteristics are associated with development of RSE and poor outcome. Prospective, randomized trials that assess different treatment protocols in children with SE are needed to determine the optimal sequence and timing of medications.

Induced electroencephalogram oscillations during source memory: Familiarity is reflected in the gamma band, recollection in the theta band	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN RECOGNITION MEMORY; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; RETRIEVAL DYNAMICS	Modulations of oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in the induced gamma and theta frequency ranges (induced gamma and theta band responses; iGBRs: > 30 Hz; iTBRs: similar to 6 Hz) have been associated with retrieval of information from long-term memory. However, the specific functional role of these two forms of oscillatory activity remains unclear. The present study examines theta- and gamma-oscillations within a dual-process framework, which defines "familiarity" and "recollection" as the two component processes of recognition memory. During encoding, participants were instructed to make "bigger/smaller than a shoebox" or "living/nonliving" decisions for different object pictures. During retrieval "old/new" recognition was followed (for items judged old) by a source discrimination task regarding the decision made for each item at encoding. iGBRs (35-80 Hz; 210-330 msec) were higher for correctly identified "old" relative to "new" objects. Importantly, they did not distinguish between successful and unsuccessful source judgments. In contrast, iTBRs (4-7.5 Hz; 600-1200 msec) were sensitive to source discrimination. We propose that iGBRs mirror early associative processes linked to Familiarity-related retrieval processes, whereas iTBRs reflect later onsetting, episodic, recollection-related mechanisms.

Time Pressure Modulates Electrophysiological Correlates of Early Visual Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVOKED GAMMA; RESPONSES; STATISTICS; VISION; TASK; EEG	Background: Reactions to sensory events sometimes require quick responses whereas at other times they require a high degree of accuracy-usually resulting in slower responses. It is important to understand whether visual processing under different response speed requirements employs different neural mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We asked participants to classify visual patterns with different levels of detail as real-world or non-sense objects. In one condition, participants were to respond immediately, whereas in the other they responded after a delay of 1 second. As expected, participants performed more accurately in delayed response trials. This effect was pronounced for stimuli with a high level of detail. These behavioral effects were accompanied by modulations of stimulus related EEG gamma oscillations which are an electrophysiological correlate of early visual processing. In trials requiring speeded responses, early stimulus-locked oscillations discriminated real-world and non-sense objects irrespective of the level of detail. For stimuli with a higher level of detail, oscillatory power in a later time window discriminated real-world and non-sense objects irrespective of response speed requirements. Conclusions/Significance: Thus, it seems plausible to assume that different response speed requirements trigger different dynamics of processing.

Led by this finding, we have developed a way to normalize such pathological activity by neurofeedback techniques (Weisz et al. (2005). PLoS Med., 2: e153). This is achieved mainly through enhancement of tau activity, i.e., oscillatory activity produced in perisylvian regions within the alpha frequency range (8-12 Hz) and concomitant reduction in delta power range (0.5-4 Hz). This activity is recorded from electrodes placed on the frontal scalp. We have found that modification of the tau-to-delta ratio significantly reduces tinnitus intensity. Participants who successfully modified their oscillatory pattern profited from the treatment to the extent that the tinnitus sensation became completely abolished. Overall, this neurofeedback training was significantly superiorin reducing tinnitus-related distress than frequency discrimination training.

Out-of-synch and out-of-sorts: Dysfunction of motor-sensory communication in schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						corollary discharge; EEG; motor; neural oscillations; schizophrenia	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; ACTIVE MOVEMENT; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SPECIFICITY; INTEGRATION; PREDICTION	Background: Phase synchronization of neural activity preceding a motor act may reflect an efference copy of the motor plan and its expected sensory consequences (corollary discharge), which is sent to sensory cortex to herald the arrival of self-generated sensations and dampen the resulting sensory experience. We performed time-frequency decomposition of response-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine phase synchronization of oscillations across trials (phase-locking factor [PLF]) to self-paced button presses. If prepress PILF reflects the activity in motor cortex, it should be contra lateralized. If it reflects the action of the efference copy, it should be related to subsequent sensory suppression. If efference copy/corollary discharge mechanisms are abnormal in schizophrenia, it should be reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Electroencephalogram was collected while 23 patients (20 schizophrenia; 3 schizoaffective) and 25 age-matched control subjects pressed a button, at will, every 1 to 2 sec. Phase-locking factor preceding and following button presses was calculated from single-trial EEG; averaging single trials yielded response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) to the tactile response associated with button pressing. Results: Consistent with its hypothesized reflection of efference copy/corollary discharge signals, prepress gamma band neural synchrony was 1) maximal over the contralateral sensory-motor cortex in healthy subjects, 2) correlated with the ipsilateralized somatosensory ERP amplitude evoked by the press, and 3) reduced in patients. Prepress neural synchrony in the beta band was also reduced in patients, especially those with avolition/apathy. Conclusions: These data are consistent with dysfunction of forward model circuitry in schizophrenia and suggest that the specific motor-sensory system affected is selectively linked to symptoms involving that system.

High-speed scanning in human memory. Science 153, 652-654.) word recognition task. In a sample of fourteen young (mean age 21.9 years, range = 18-27) and fourteen older (mean age 68.4 years, range = 60-80) participants, theta power was foundto be significantly lower in older adults during both the retention and recognition intervals. This theta power difference was greatest at the fronto-central midline electrode and occurred in parallel with a small, non-significant decrease in recognition accuracy in the older sample. A significant decrease in older adults' mean theta power was also observed in resting EEG, however, it was of substantially smaller magnitude than the task-related theta difference. It is proposed that a neurophysiological measure(s), such as task-specific frontal midline theta (W) power, may be a more sensitive marker of cognitive aging than task performance measures. Furthermore, as recent research indicates that W is generated primarily in the anterior cingulate cortex, the current findings support evidence that the function of brain networks incorporating this structure may be affected in cognitive aging.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models for inhaled anaesthetics	ANAESTHESIST			German	Review						volatile anaesthetics; N2O; opioids; distribution coefficient; k(e0) value; EEG index	MINIMUM ALVEOLAR CONCENTRATION; END-TIDAL SEVOFLURANE; CIRCUIT INHALATION ANESTHESIA; QUANTITATIVE EEG-ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; NITROUS-OXIDE; BISPECTRAL INDEX; VOLATILE ANESTHETICS; TRACHEAL EXTUBATION; CONCENTRATION MAC	Pharmacokinetic models can be differentiated into two groups: physiological-based models and empirical models. Traditionally the pharmacokinetics of volatile anaesthetics are described using physiological-based models together with the respective tissue-blood distribution coefficients. The compartments of the empirical model have no anatomical equivalents and are merely the product of the mathematical procedure for parameter estimation. The end expiratory concentration of volatile anaesthetics is approximately equal to the arterial concentration and, therefore, the description of the transition between plasma and effect site for volatile anaesthetics plays a central role. The most important parameter here is the k(e0) value which is a time constant and describes the time delay for the transition from the central compartment to the calculated effect compartment. The k(e0) values for sevoflurane and isoflurane are the same but the concentration balance between the end-tidal concentration and the effect compartment occurs twice as quickly with desflurane. In clinical practice volatile anaesthetics are normally combined with N2O and/or opioids. This results in an additive interaction between volatile anaesthetics and N2O but a synergistic interaction of volatile anaesthetics with opioids. However, there are relatively few investigations on the interactions between the clinically widely used combination of volatile anaesthetics, N2O and opioids.

J	Lotte, F; Lecuyer, A; Arnaldi, B				Lotte, Fabien; Lecuyer, Anatole; Arnaldi, Bruno			FuRIA: a new feature extraction algorithm for brain-computer interfaces using fuzzy and inverse models	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); feature extraction; inverse model; source localization; classification; interpretability; fuzzy set; electroencephalography (EEG)	CLASSIFICATION; BCI; COMMUNICATION; WORKSHOP	When using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), the identification of mental tasks relies on two main points: feature extraction and classification [MAM(+)06, BFWB07, LCL(+)07]. Feature extraction aims at describing EEG signals by a few relevant values called "features", whereas classification aims at automatically assigning a class to these features. In this paper we focus on feature extraction, as the BCI community has stressed the need to explore new feature extraction algorithms [MAM+06]. Recently, inverse models have been revealed as promising feature extraction algorithms for BCI [QDHO4, GGP(+)05, WGWB05, CLL06]. Such models aims at computing the activity in the whole brain volume, by using only scalp EEG signals and a head model representing the brain as a set of voxels (volume elements). The activity computed in a few brain regions has been used as features for BCI systems. Despite good results, some limitations remain. Indeed, it seems that current methods cannot conciliate genericity, i.e., the capability to deal with any kind of mental task, and the fact of generating few features. On one hand, methods that are generic and automatic tend to generate a large number of features, as they extract several features for each voxel [GGP(+)05], The activity in neighboring voxels can be correlated and, as such, it would be more appropriate to gather these voxels in brain regions. On the other hand, methods that generate few features have been proposed, but they are not generic anymore as they need a priori knowledge on the mental tasks used, and are currently limited to motor imagery-based BCI [QDH04, WGWB05]. Recently, we have proposed a method which is generic and which generates few features, as voxels whose activity is correlated are gathered into Regions Of Interest (ROI) [CLL06]. However, this method is not completely automatic and is limited to the use of two ROI whose spatial extension is hard to define [CLL06]. In this paper, we propose a generic feature extraction algorithm which can automatically identify any number of relevant ROI and can properly define their spatial extension thanks to the new concept of fuzzy ROI. This algorithm is known as FuRIA, which stands for "Fuzzy Region of Interest Activity". The FuRIA algorithm FuRIA is a trainable feature extraction algorithm. Indeed, it can automatically identify what are the relevant ROI to discriminate mental tasks, and what are the frequency bands in which these ROI react. The FuRIA training is performed in 5 steps: Statistical analysis: This step consists in comparing, using a statistical test, the activity in each voxel, possibly averaged over a given time window, between the different classes. This analysis is performed for each of the N-f frequencies considered, Once the analysis is achieved, we obtain N-f statistical maps, each one revealing which voxels are significant for discrimination. Clustering: For each statistical map computed at the previous step, a clustering algorithm is used in order to gather significant voxels into ROI. To perform this clustering, a 4-dimensional vector [x, y, z, s] is associated to each significant voxel. The x, y, z coordinates are the 3D coordinates of the voxel in the head model used and s is the voxel statistic obtained at the previous step. Once the clustering is achieved, all voxels whose associated vector belongs to the same cluster are gathered into the same ROI. Fusion: Once the relevant ROI are identified for each frequency, we have to identify which ROI are relevant in which frequency band. To do so, ROI obtained at similar positions (i.e., with an overlap of more than 50%), for consecutive frequencies, are merged, simply using the union set operator, and identified as reactive in the frequency band resulting from the concatenation of these frequencies. Adaptation: Because of the use of the union as the fusion operator, a ROI Q identified as reactive in the frequency band [f(a); f(b)] can contain voxels which were significant for a single frequency belonging to [f(a); f(b)] but which are not significant anymore for the whole [f(a); f(b)] frequency band. Consequently, we perform another statistical analysis for each ROI, in order to remove voxels that are not significant anymore. Fuzzification: In the ROI defined so far, it can be noticed that all voxels do not have, statistically, the same discriminative power. However, all these voxels contain a given amount of information. Moreover, the brain regions of a given subject are not well defined but are rather naturally fuzzy. Hence, identifying which voxels should be kept in a ROI, and which ones should be removed is a difficult problem. We believe that all voxels that contain information should be in the ROI, but that those which contain less information should be less in the ROI. Thus, we propose the concept of fuzzy ROI, which relies on the fuzzy set theory of Zadeh [Zad96]. A standard (crisp) ROI Omega(c) is defined by the set of voxels it contains. The activity gamma(Omega c) in this ROI Omega(c) is classically computed from the activity gamma(v) of the voxels v of this ROI (see Equation 1). A fuzzy ROI Omega(f) is not defined by a set of voxels anymore, but by a fuzzy membership function mu(Omega f). This function provides the membership degree (in [0; 1]) of any voxel into the ROI Omega(f). The activity in a fuzzy ROI is computed as described in Equation 2, where N-v is the number of voxels in the head model used. This formalism enables use to weigh each voxel according to the importance of its contribution within the ROI, and, as such, to use efficiently the available information. To complete the training of FuRIA, all ROI Omega are turned into fuzzy ROI by associating to each of them a fuzzy membership function mu(Omega) which uses the statistics obtained at the previous step. Once the training of FuRIA is completed, a set of discriminant fuzzy ROI should have been identified together with the corresponding reactive frequency bands. The activity in these ROI and in these frequency bands, possibly averaged over time, can be used as features for any classifier. Evaluation In order to evaluate FuRIA, we used sLORETA (standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography) as the inverse model [PM02], a multiple comparison randomization t-test as the statistical analysis [HBWF96] and the "Mean Shift" algorithm as the clustering algorithm [CM02]. Concerning the fuzzy membership functions, it appears that, due to the low resolution of sLORETA, significant voxels with a relatively high probability of type I error are much more numerous that significant voxels with a relatively low probability of type I error. Consequently, for each ROI Omega, we used a membership function mu(Omega) which assigns a membership degree which decreases exponentially with the voxel statistics, as described in Equation 10. In this equation, N-Omega s is the number of voxels in the ROI Omega; p(min) and p(max) are respectively the minimum and maximum probability, among the ROI voxels, of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis H-0; and p(v) is the probability of correctly rejecting H-0 for voxel v. In order to evaluate FuRIA, we have used the data set IV of the "BCI competition 2003" [WZL(+)04]. These data contain EEG signals recorded 500 ms before a subject hits a keyboard key with a finger from his left or right hand, The goal of the competition participants was to identify, for each trial, the hand that was used. We trained the FuRIA algorithm on the training set provided, by considering the frequencies between 3 Hz and 45 Hz, with a step of 1 Hz, and by considering the time window comprising the last 250 ms of each trial. FuRIA has found 5 discriminant fuzzy ROI (see Figure 1), hence generating 5-dimensional feature vectors. These features has been classified using a linear support vector machine. The recognition rates obtained after 100 training/testing repetitions are displayed in Table 2 and compared with two other methods: the method of the competition winner [WZL+04] and a method using inverse models that we proposed previously [CLL06]. The results obtained withouth the fuzzification step (step 5 of the training, see previous section) are also displayed as a comparison. We can noticed that the method that use FuRIA with fuzzification reached the best results with a recognition score ranging from 85% to 86%, These results suggest that the features extracted with FuRIA are very discriminant, as they are not numerous (there are only 5 features) and still enable us to reach good classification results. It is also interesting to notice that when using FuRIA without fuzzification, the results are significantly lower. This stress the advantage of using efficiently the information contained in any significant voxel, thanks to the concept of fuzzy ROI. In addition to this evaluation, we also proposed a first step towards the design of an interpretable BCI system. To this end, we proposed to classify FuRIA features, which are interpretable features, with a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), which is an interpretable classifier. Indeed, FIS are a set of fuzzy "if-then" rules that can be learnt from data. By combining FuRIA features with FIS, we can obtain a set of rules describing which activity in which brain regions and frequency bands is related to which mental task. An evaluation of this method on the EEG data mentioned above suggested that the obtained rules were consistent with the literature (see Figure 3).

Homeostatic regulation of sleep in the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii)	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BASE-LINE CONDITIONS; EEG POWER SPECTRA; CORTICAL TEMPERATURE; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; VIGILANCE STATES; GUINEA-PIG; DEPRIVATION; RAT; STIMULATION; WAKEFULNESS	Background: Sleep is regulated by both a circadian and a homeostatic process. The homeostatic process reflects the duration of prior wakefulness: the longer one stays awake, the longer and/or more intense is subsequent sleep. In mammals, the best marker of the homeostatic sleep drive is slow wave activity (SWA), the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum in the 0.5-4 Hz frequency range during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In mammals, NREM sleep SWA is high at sleep onset, when sleep pressure is high, and decreases progressively to reach low levels in late sleep. Moreover, SWA increases further with sleep deprivation, when sleep also becomes less fragmented (the duration of sleep episodes increases, and the number of brief awakenings decreases). Although avian and mammalian sleep share several features, the evidence of a clear homeostatic response to sleep loss has been conflicting in the few avian species studied so far. The aim of the current study was therefore to ascertain whether established markers of sleep homeostasis in mammals are also present in the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), a migratory songbird of the order Passeriformes. To accomplish this goal, we investigated amount of sleep, sleep time course, and measures of sleep intensity in 6 birds during baseline sleep and during recovery sleep following 6 hours of sleep deprivation. Results: Continuous (24 hours) EEG and video recordings were used to measure baseline sleep and recovery sleep following short-term sleep deprivation. Sleep stages were scored visually based on 4-sec epochs. EEG power spectra (0.5-25 Hz) were calculated on consecutive 4-sec epochs. Four vigilance states were reliably distinguished based on behavior, visual inspection of the EEG, and spectral EEG analysis: Wakefulness (W), Drowsiness (D), slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. During baseline, SWA during D, SWS, and NREM sleep (defined as D and SWS combined) was highest at the beginning of the major sleep period and declined thereafter. Moreover, peak SWA in both SWS and NREM sleep increased significantly immediately following sleep deprivation relative to baseline. Conclusion: As in mammals, sleep deprivation in the white-crowned sparrow increases the intensity of sleep as measured by SWA.

Analysis of depth of anesthesia with Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Depth of anesthesia; Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy; Spectral entropy; Empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert transform; Entropy; Pharmacokineticipharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling; Prediction probability	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BISPECTRAL INDEX; EEG; SEVOFLURANE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ARTIFACTS	Objective: Monitoring the effect of anesthetic drug on the neural system is an ongoing challenge for anesthetists. Several methods based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been proposed to estimate the depth of anesthesia (DoA); for instance, the Fourier-based time-frequency balanced spectral entropy as implemented in the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy Module. In this paper, a novel method based on Hilbert-Huang transform is proposed to calculate a spectral entropy value, called Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and is applied to EEG recordings during sevoflurane anesthesia. The dose-response relation of Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy during sevoflurane anesthesia is presented. Methods: We analyzed a previously collected set of EEG data, obtained from 14 patients' during the induction of general anesthesia with sevoflurane. The Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy were applied to the EEG recording. State entropy and response entropy based on the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy were calculated, respectively. The performance of both methods was assessed by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and prediction probability. To obtain reliable Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy values, a combined preprocessor was applied in advance. Results: In the awake state, the baseline variability (as estimated by the coefficient of variation) of the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy was less than half the variability of the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy (p < 0.001). All entropy values decreased similarly with increasing sevoflurane concentration, as shown by the high correlation between the respective methods (p < 0.001). However, Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy exhibited greater resistance to noise in the EEG signal: and decreased in a more linear fashion with increasing sevoflurane effect-site concentration, particularly around the point of loss of consciousness. The goodness-of-fit of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model and the prediction probability using the state entropy of Hilbert-Huang spectrum (R(2) = 0.86, P(k) = 0.84) was significantly better than that using the one of M-Entropy (R(2) = 0.80, P(k) = 0.81, p < 0.05); however, the difference between response entropy values was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The results from this small dataset suggest that the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy has a slightly stronger ability to track changes in sevoflurane effect-site concentration than M-Entropy with a stronger noise-resistance. Significance: Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy could be incorporated in the design of a new method to estimate the effect of anesthetic drugs on the EEG.

Delay estimation in multimodal coherent signals: Application to the cortical correlate of Parkinsonian tremor	ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL SIGNALS AND IMAGES	Biosignal-Brno		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International EURASIP Conference (BIOSIGNAL)	JUN, 2008	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Biomed Engn, European Assoc Speech, Signal & Image Proc (EURASIP), Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMB)				The basic and first "harmonic" frequencies of Parkinsonian tremor are independent oscillations the biological basis of which remains unclear. The estimation of delay between these coherent signals explains two important aspects of these oscillations. The intuitive indication of the unidirectional delay is that the same signal travels from the cortex to the periphery, and the bidirectional delay indicates that there is also a feedback from the periphery to the cortex. In this study, the coherence was estimated using the Welch periodogram method for EEG and EMG data from 21 Parkinsonian patients with a classical rest tremor. Using the method of "maximizing coherence", the delays were estimated. The analyses were validated by applying them also to two model signals. The results indicate that both these frequencies have bidirectional delays. However, the first "harmonic" frequency has significantly longer delays compared to the basic frequency, which supports the hypothesis that they are independent oscillations, and either they originate from different regions in the brain or have a different trajectory from the cortex to the periphery.

Linear electrode depth estimation in rat motor cortex by laminar analysis of Ketamine-Xylazine-Induced oscillations	2007 3RD INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	MAY 02-05, 2007	Kohala Coast, HI	IEEE, EMBS			BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; ORIGIN; INTERFACE; MARKING; SIGNALS	While the development of silicon-substrate microelectrode arrays has enabled chronic recording of single unit activity from multiple neurons simultaneously, accurate interpretation of the signals depend on the anatomical placement of the electrodes. Toward this end, this paper develops an in vivo method for identifying the placement of electrodes based on laminar analysis of ketamine-Xylazien-Induced field potential oscillations in rat motor cortex. The proposed method is based on finding the polarity reversal in laminar oscillations which is reported to appear in upper part of layer V in laminar High Voltage Spindles (HVSs) of rat cortical column. Analysis of histological images showed a 21 mu m error in the estimate of the polarity reversal depth compared to the expected range (850-1050 mu m). One out of the four rats did not undergo a phase reversal. Histology verified that the electrode was placed deeper than 1050 mu m. We propose that this method can be used to determine an estimate of laminar electrodes implanted in rat motor cortex.

Subjects learned to turn a steering wheel according to a given trajectory in order to minimise the discrepancy between a changing foreground stimulus (controllable by the subjects) and a constant background stimulus. The results of the present study show that increasing practice of continuous tracking movements that are continuously performed in the presence of auditory feedback is not accompanied by decrease in phase locking between areas involved. Moreover, the study confirms that internally produced movements show enhanced coherent activities compared to externally guided movements and therefore suggests that the motor-parietal network is more engaged during internally produced than externally produced movements.

Some are rapidly forgotten, but others we recognize later. We accurately predicted recognition success with natural scene photographs using single trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures of brain activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEG responses in the initial 600 ms following the onset of scene photographs allow for prediction accuracy rates up to 84.1% using linear Support-Vector-Machine classification (ISVM). A permutation test confirmed that all ISVM based prediction rates were significantly better than "guessing". More generally, we present four approaches to analyzing brain function using ISVMs. (1) We show that ISVMs can be used to extract spatio-temporal patterns of brain activation from MEG-data. (2) We show ISVM classification can demonstrate significant correlations between comparatively early and late processes predictive of scene recognition, indicating dependencies between these processes over time. (3) We use ISVM classification to compare the information content of oscillatory and event-related MEG-activations and show they contain a similar amount of and largely overlapping information. (4) A more detailed analysis of single-trial predictiveness of different frequency bands revealed that theta band activity around 5 Hz allowed for highest prediction rates, and these rates are indistinguishable from those obtained with a full dataset. In sum our results clearly demonstrate that ISVMs can reliably predict natural scene recognition from single trial MEG-activation measures and can be a useful tool for analyzing predictive brain function.

For BCIs to assist hemiparetic patients, the implant must use unaffected cortex ipsilateral to the affected limb. This requires the identification of distinct electrophysiological features from the motor cortex associated with ipsilateral hand movements. Methods-In this study we studied 6 patients undergoing temporary placement of intracranial electrode arrays. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded while the subjects engaged in specific ipsilateral or contralateral hand motor tasks. Spectral changes were identified with regards to frequency, location, and timing. Results-Ipsilateral hand movements were associated with electrophysiological changes that occur in lower frequency spectra, at distinct anatomic locations, and earlier than changes associated with contralateral hand movements. In a subset of 3 patients, features specific to ipsilateral and contralateral hand movements were used to control a cursor on a screen in real time. In ipsilateral derived control this was optimal with lower frequency spectra. Conclusions-There are distinctive cortical electrophysiological features associated with ipsilateral movements which can be used for device control. These findings have implications for patients with hemispheric stroke because they offer a potential methodology for which a single hemisphere can be used to enhance the function of a stroke induced hemiparesis.

These activities are often partially overlapped in time and frequency, so that they are even more difficult to be separated in single-trial. Therefore, online applications based on induced brain activity require specific online processing methods to separate both activities efficiently. Here we propose a module-based methodology for the online extraction and quantification of induced brain activity during cognitive-related tasks. Further, the role of electrode montages and the minimization of the evoked activity are examined in both simulated and real data as part of the optimization process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Affect, while the infant looked at and away from the adult's face during both conditions, was analyzed. Infants displayed neutral and some positive affect while looking at both SF and BE RSA was quantified continuously during both conditions. RSA increased during BF relative to SF. EEG was quantified only while the infants were looking at the adult's face during both conditions. An increase in theta over multiple scalp areas (AF3,4; F7,8; FC3; T6) was observed during BF relative to SF. The data suggest that infant attention to BF and SF reflect different psychophysiological processes that can be indexed by RSA and scalp-recorded theta. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The circadian variation of heart-rate variability (HRV) might be of relevance to this risk. We examined night versus daytime HRV in patients with newly diagnosed and refractory localization-related epilepsy, assessing the effects of drug treatment and epilepsy surgery on the night/daytime HRV ratio. Methods: We used spectral analysis to assess HRV and calculated the night-time (00.00-05.00)/daytime (07.30-21.30) ratio of HRV in 14 patients with newly diagnosed localization-related epilepsy before and during carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment and in 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy before and after epilepsy surgery. Both groups were compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Results: No significant differences were found from controls in the night/daytime ratios of HRV whether compared before or after initiation of treatment with CBZ in newly diagnosed epilepsy patients. When patients were used as their own controls, night/daytime ratios of standard deviation of RR intervals (p = 0.04) and total power (p = 0.04) were significantly lower during treatment than before. Compared with those of controls, the night/daytime ratios were lower in epilepsy surgery patients before surgery [low-frequency power (p = 0.04); high-frequency power (p = 0.04)]. Night/daytime ratios did not change significantly after surgery. Conclusions: The HRV of the patients was more affected during night-time when the risk of SUDEP seems to be highest in such patients.

In this paper, we describe an experiment we conducted to explore some of the issues around using an electroencephalograph (EEG) for classifying working memory load. Within this experiment, we present our classification methodology, including a novel feature selection scheme that seems to alleviate the need for complex drift modeling and artifact rejection. We demonstrate classification accuracies of up to 99% for 2 memory load levels and up to 88% for 4 levels. We also present results suggesting that we can do this with shorter windows, much less training data, and a smaller number of EEG channels, than reported previously. Finally, we show results suggesting that the models we construct transfer across variants of the task, implying some level of generality. We believe these findings extend prior work and bring us a step closer to the use of such technologies in HCI research.	[Grimes, David; Shenoy, Pradeep; Rao, Rajesh P.

These algorithms are developed primarily for applications with fast sampling rate which demands significant reduction in computation load per iteration. The new algorithms are evaluated on a chaotic nonlinear biological based time series signals such as electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG). The EEG and ECG signals not only shows non-stationary behaviour but also large oscillation or changes. When the sample time is in milliseconds, both neural network adaptation and weight update must take place within the short time frame thus any learning rule must be computationally simple. The second order techniques, such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), need large amount of memory O(N-2) and computationally intensive. The main goal of this paper is to develop a simple back-propagation based (SBP) resource allocation network (RAN), or also known as sequential learning technique using Radial Basis Function by incorporating Gaussian kernel, in order to identify (model) EEG and ECG signals. Simulation results show the modeled data show good representation of the original signals with less prediction error.

The power and coherence was estimated using the multitaper method for EEG and EMG data from 6 Parkinsonian patients with a classical rest tremor. The Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) was used to find the coherent sources in the brain. Before hand this method was validated for the application to the EEG by showing in 3 normal subjects that rhythmic stimuli (1-5Hz) to the median nerve leads to almost identical coherent sources for the basic and first harmonic frequency in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex which is the biologically plausible result. In all the Parkinson patients the corticomuscular coherence was also present in the basic and the first harmonic frequency of the tremor. However, the source for the basic frequency was close to the frontal midline and the first harmonic frequency was in the region of premotor and sensory motor cortex on the contralateral side for all the patients. Thus the generation of these two oscillations involves different cortical areas and possibly follows different pathways to the periphery.

While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in MEG activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30-70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the ongoing MEG signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase ( e. g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability.

Eysenck meets Martindale: The relationship between extraversion and originality from the neuroscientific perspective	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						EEG; alpha; arousal; creativity; originality; extraversion	EEG-ALPHA; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; CREATIVITY; INTROVERSION; OSCILLATIONS; PERSONALITY; THINKING	Based on Martindale's low arousal theory of creativity the production of creative or original ideas more likely occurs in states of lower cortical arousal. According to Eysenck's arousal theory, extraverted individuals are assumed to display a lower cortical arousal than their introverted counterparts. In combining predictions derived from both theories, we might then expect that brain activity in response to the production of novel, original ideas is moderated by individual differences in originality and in the personality dimension extraversion-introversion. In analyzing EEG alpha power during creative idea generation (n = 34) we found evidence in support with this assumption. Those extraverted individuals who produced highly original ideas during task performance exhibited the largest amount of alpha power, while in introverted individuals who produced less original ideas the lowest level of alpha power was observed. These results are consistent with the view of personality (i.e., extraversion) and performance (i.e., originality or in a broader sense, creativity) as inter-related rather than independent domains.

Presurgical seizure frequency and tumoral etiology predict the outcome after extratemporal epilepsy surgery	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; tumors; seizure frequency; demographic data; predictors for prognosis	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CORTICAL RESECTION; LOBECTOMY; EEG	To examine the predictive value of demographic data for the seizure outcome after extratemporal epilepsy surgery. Eightyone patients who underwent resective extratemporal epilepsy surgery were retrospectively studied concerning (a) age at surgery, (b) onset of epilepsy, (c) duration of epilepsy, (d) number of seizures at the time of presurgical evaluation, (d) number of presurgically tested antiepileptic substances and (f) number of seizure types. The data were correlated to the postoperative seizure outcome after two years. 33 patients (40.7%) were seizure free two years after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that both tumor etiology and low presurgical seizure frequency were independently associated with seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery. The recurrence rate in patients with one or more seizures per day was more than two-fold if compared with patients with fewer seizures. The remaining demographic factors did not show a significant association with seizure outcome in our 81 patients. Fewer than daily seizures prior to surgery and a tumoral etiology independently increase the likelihood of remaining seizure free two years after extratemporal epilepsy surgery.

Gamma band activity (30-100 Hz) has been hypothesized to reflect either the maintenance of neuronal representations or changing demands in attention. Regarding posterior alpha activity (8-13 Hz), it is under debate whether it reflects functional inhibition or neuronal processing required for the task. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the role of oscillatory brain activity in humans using a working memory task engaging either the dorsal or ventral visual stream. We recorded brain activity using magnetoencephalography from subjects performing a delayed-match-to-sample task. Subjects were instructed to remember either the identity or the spatial orientation of shortly presented faces. The analysis revealed stronger alpha power around the parieto-occipital sulcus during retention of face identities (ventral stream) compared with the retention of face orientations (dorsal stream). In contrast, successful retention of face orientations was associated with an increase in gamma power in the occipital lobe relative to the face identity condition. We propose that gamma activity reflects the actual neuronal maintenance of visual representations, whereas the alpha increase is a result of functional inhibition.

The effects of low-frequency environmental-strength electromagnetic fields on brain electrical activity: A critical review of the literature	ELECTROMAGNETIC BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Review						electromagnetic field; brain electrical activity; nonlinear analysis; electroencephalogram; evoked potentials; recurrence analysis	ELF MAGNETIC-FIELD; 50 HZ; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; HUMAN EXPOSURE; RABBIT BRAIN; RESTING EEG; HUMANS; STIMULATION	Reports dealing with the stimulus-response relationship between low-level, low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and changes in brain electrical activity permit assessment of the hypothesis that EMFs are detected by the body via the process of sensory transduction. These reports, as well as those involving effects on brain activity observed after a fixed time of exposure, are critically reviewed here. A consistent stimulus-response relationship between EMFs and changes in brain activity has been demonstrated in animal and human subjects. The effects, which consisted of onset and offset evoked potentials, were observed under conditions permitting the inference that the fields were transduced like ordinary stimuli such as light and sound. However, unlike the changes in brain activity induced by these stimuli, the changes induced by EMFs were governed by nonlinear laws. The studies involving attempts to determine whether a period of EMF exposure caused a metabolic effect reflected in pre-exposure/post-exposure differences in brain activity were generally inconclusive.

Effects of olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol on sleep after a single oral morning dose in healthy volunteers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						antipsychotics; polysomnography; spectral analysis; subjective evaluations; healthy volunteers; single morning oral intake	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; 5-HT2C RECEPTORS; DELTA-SLEEP; EEG; ANTAGONIST; SPECTRA	Objectives To compare the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep activity and subjective sleep quality. Design Randomised, Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period cross-over, clinical trial was used to evaluate the effects of active treatments on objective and subjective sleep variables. Setting Sleep laboratory evaluation. Participants Twenty healthy young volunteers, both sexes. Interventions Single oral morning administrations of olanzapine 5 mg, risperidone 1 mg, haloperidol 3 mg and placebo. Measurements and results Five polysomnographic nights were evaluated: one control night and one after each intervention. Significant increase in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with decreases in wake time were observed after olanzapine. Decreases in wake time, REM sleep and stage shifts together with increases in stage 2 were obtained after risperidone. Haloperidol showed only a tendency to increase sleep efficiency and stage 2 and to decrease wake time. Olanzapine showed decreases in power density in frequencies higher than 10 Hz during all sleep stages and in frequencies lower than 5 Hz range in SWS; decreases in the dynamics of spindle frequency activity (SFA) in the second and fourth non-rapid eye movement (NREM) episodes were also obtained. Risperidone presented increases in the 3.6-10.8 Hz frequency range in NREM sleep stages and in stage 2. Haloperidol also showed increases in NREM sleep stages and in stage 2, but these were in frequencies higher than 10 Hz, with increases in the dynamics of SFA in the first NREM episode. Only a significant improvement in subjective sleep quality was observed after olanzapine. Conclusions Antipsychotics showed different sleep changes as their neurochemical profiles were distinct. These changes were observed even when the drug was administered 15 h before going to bed.

Phase I trial: safety and feasibility of intracranial electroencephalography using hybrid subdural electrodes containing macro-and microelectrode arrays	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						complication; electroencephalography; epilepsy surgery; high-frequency oscillation; microelectrode; subdural hybrid electrode	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; EPILEPSY SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS; RECORDINGS; MORBIDITY; BRAIN	Object. Cerebral cortex electrophysiology is poorly sampled using standard, low spatial resolution clinical intracranial electrodes. Adding microelectrode arrays to the standard clinical macroelectrode arrays increases the spatial resolution and may ultimately improve the clinical utility of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). However, the safety of hybrid electrode systems containing standard clinical macroelectrode and microelectrode arrays is not yet known. The authors report on their preliminary experience in 24 patients who underwent implantation of hybrid electrodes. Methods. In this study, 24 consecutive patients underwent long-term iEEG monitoring with implanted hybrid depth and subdural grid and strip electrodes; both clinical macroelectrodes and research microelectrodes were used. The patients included 18 women and 6 men with an average age of 35 +/- 12 years (range 21-65). The mean hospital stay was 11 +/- 4 days (range 5-20), with mean duration of implantation 7.0 +/- 3.2 days (range 3-15). Data from the 198 consecutive craniotomies for standard clinical subdural grid insertion (prior to surgery in the 24 patients described here) were used for comparison to investigate the relative risk of complications. Results. Focal seizure identification and subsequent resection was performed in 20 patients. One patient underwent a subsequent operation after neurological deterioration secondary to cerebral swelling and a 5-mm subdural hematoma. There were no infections. The overall complication rate was 4.2% (only 1 patient had a complication), which did not significantly differ from the complication rate previously reported by the authors of 6.6% when standard subdural and depth intracranial electrodes were used. There were no deaths or permanent neurological deficits related to electrode implantation. Conclusions. The authors demonstrate the use of hybrid subdural strip and grid electrodes containing high-density microwire arrays and standard clinical macroelectrodes. Hybrid electrodes provide high spatial resolution electrophysiology of the neocortex that is impossible with standard clinical iEEG. In this initial study in 24 patients, the complication rate is acceptable, and there does not appear to be increased risk associated with the use of hybrid electrodes compared with standard subdural and depth iEEG electrodes. More research is required to show whether hybrid electrode recordings will improve localization of epileptic foci and tracking the generation of neocortical seizures.

Thirteen subjects with stable CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction, 26 +/- 7%) and CSR (apnea-hypopnea index 52 +/- 15 h(-1)) underwent overnight polysomnography with beat-to-beat measurement of systemic arterial blood pressure (BP). CSR events were divided into those with or without an EEG arousal defined according to the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Association. The pressor response was quantified in terms of the delta BP change (difference between the minimum BP during apnea and maximum BP during hyperpnea). Changes in the morphology of the pressor response were assessed by subdividing individual respiratory events into six periods (three during apnea: A1, A2, A3; and three during hyperpnea: H1, H2, H3). Considerable fluctuations in BP and heart rate (HR) were observed across the CSR cycle (delta mean BP 20.2 +/- 6.5 mmHg). The presence of an EEG arousal did not alter the amplitude of fluctuations in BP. Mean blood pressure (MBP) increased 21.0 +/- 7.5 mmHg with arousal versus 19.3 +/- 5.8 mmHg without arousal (NS). A repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant interaction between the presence of arousal and the proportional change in mean BP across the six periods, indicating that an EEG arousal had no effect on the morphology of MBP change during CSR [F(5,60) = 1.44, P = 0.22]. This study showed that EEG-defined arousal does not amplify the pressor response to CSR in CHF.

To study the underlying neuronal processes, participants were presented different types of dot patterns (Glass patterns) either forming a global structure or forming no global structure while EEG was recorded. Participants were naive about the pattern types and performed a demanding colour discrimination task. Following the experiment, the degree to which participants acquired awareness of the global visual structure was assessed. Early gamma-frequency band responses (gamma, 25-100 Hz) over occipital, parietal, and central areas were enhanced to circular Glass patterns as compared to random dot patterns at 90 ms post-stimulus. This effect was observed exclusively in participants who were subjectively aware of the global pattern structure. In this group of observers, the pattern effect built up gradually during the course of the experiment. The significance of enhanced early gamma responses to global patterns for the production of awareness of the pattern might lie in the increased impact of information conveyed by well synchronised neuronal assemblies to upstream cortical areas.

The best of both worlds: Phase-reset of human EEG alpha activity and additive power contribute to ERP generation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						additive power; alpha activity; EEG; EPP; phase-resetting	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; EVOKED-RESPONSE; BRAIN DYNAMICS; BAND POWER; PERFORMANCE; AMPLITUDE	Some authors have proposed that, event-related potentials (ERPs) are generated by a neuronal response which is additive to and independent of ongoing activity, others demonstrated that they are generated by partial phase-resetting of ongoing activity. We investigated the relationship between event-related oscillatory activity in the alpha band and prestimulus levels of ongoing alpha activity on ERPs. EEG was recorded from 23 participants performing a visual discrimination task. Individuals were assigned to one of three groups according to the amount of prestimulus total alpha activity, and distinct differences of the event-related EEG dynamics between groups were observed. While all groups exhibited an eventre-lated increase in phase-locked (evoked) alpha activity, only individuals with sustained prestimulus alpha activity showed alpha-blocking, that is, a considerable decrease of poststimulus non-phase-locked alpha activity. In contrast, individuals without observable prestimulus total alpha activity showed a concurrent increase of phase-locked and non-phase-locked alpha activity after stimulation. Data from this group seems to be in favor of an additive event-related neuronal response without alpha-blocking. However, the dissociable EEG dynamics of total and evoked alpha activities together with a complementary simulation analysis indicated a partial event-related reorganization of ongoing brain activity. We conclude that both partial phase-resetting and partial additive power contribute dynamically to the generation of ERPs. The prestimulus brain state exerts a prominent influence on event-related brain responses. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten subjects had to perform a reaction time task at different altitudes. The EEG and ECG were recorded simultaneously. Additionally, the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured at different altitudes and the subjects filled out a Lake Louise questionnaire that describes the degree of altitude mountain sickness (AMS). After elevation from 134 m to 4000 m in the hypobaric chamber heart-rate increased from 68.9 bpm to 81.6 bpm, RMSSD (root mean square of squared differences of adjacent heart beat intervals) decreased from 54.3 ms to 33.3 ms, the LF/HF ratio increased from 2.5 to 3.9 and oxygen saturation decreased to 82.7% after 11 h at 4000 m altitude. The Lake Louise Score (LSS) reached 3.4 after one night at 4000 m. EEG beta activity between 14 Hz and 18 Hz was attenuated at 4000 m and also after return to 134 m. The results indicate that the subjects were not able to adapt to 4000 m within 12 h in the hypobaric chamber. Even after 1 h after the return to 134 m all parameters are still affected from the night at 4000 m altitude. ECG and EEG changes are in line with results obtained at 2700 m height at Dachstein.

Such increases and decreases of slow wave activity are limited to the cortical regions involved in specific task performance during wakefulness. Here, we test the hypothesis that reorganization of motor cortex produced by long-term potentiation (LTP) affects EEG activity of this brain area during subsequent sleep. Methodology/Principal Findings: By pairing median nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex, one can potentiate the motor output, which is presumed to reflect plasticity of the neural circuitry. This paired associative stimulation increases M1 cortical excitability at interstimulus intervals of 25 ms. We compared the scalp distribution of sleep EEG power following paired associative stimulation at 25 ms to that following a control paradigm with 50 ms intervals. It is shown that the experimental manipulation by paired associative stimulation at 25 ms induces a 48% increase in amplitude of motor evoked potentials. This LTP-like potentiation, induced during waking, affects delta and theta EEG power in both REM and non-REM sleep, measured during the following night. Slow-wave activity increases in some frontal and prefrontal derivations and decreases at sites neighboring and contralateral to the stimulated motor cortex. The magnitude of increased amplitudes of motor evoked potentials by the paired associative stimulation at 25 ms predicts enhancements of slow-wave activity in prefrontal regions. Conclusions/Significance: An LTP-like paradigm, presumably inducing increased synaptic strength, leads to changes in local sleep regulation, as indexed by EEG slow-wave activity. Enhancement and depression of slow-wave activity are interpreted in terms of a simultaneous activation of both excitatory and inhibitory circuits consequent to the paired associative stimulation at 25 ms.

In the case of electroencephalograms, the FFT algorithm was the only quantifying method used until the 1970s, but this analysis is not conclusive in most pathologies. Fractal techniques provide new tools for the processing of signals whose traces have a sophisticated geometric complexity. The fractal dimension is computed easily in our work by means of explicit formulae involving the time samples. In this paper we obtain, under some hypotheses, an exact relation between the Fourier Transform of a signal and its Fractal Dimension. In the last part of the paper, an electroencephalographic application involving fractal and spectral parameters is described.	[Sebastian, M. V.; Navascues, M.

It is a nonparametric method to quantify the predictability of time series. Five minutes of recording were acquired with a 148-channel whole-head magnetometer in 15 patients with probable AD and 15 elderly control subjects. Stationary epochs of 5 seconds (848 points, sample frequency of 169.55 Hz) were selected. Our results showed that AD patients' MEGs were more predictable than controls' recordings. Additionally, an accuracy of 76.7% (80.0% sensitivity; 73.3% specificity) was reached using a receiver operating characteristic curve. These preliminary results suggest the usefulness of nonlinear forecasting to gain a better understanding of dynamical processes underlying the MEG recording.

These results have prompted us to apply the quantitative nonlinear methods to a limbic epilepsy rat (CLE), as this model has several important features of human MTLE. The present study tests the hypothesis that preictal dynamical changes similar to those seen in human MTLE exist in the CLE model. Forty-two, 2-hr epoch data sets from 4 CLE rats (mean seizure duration 74 +/- 20 sec) are analyzed, each containing a focal onset seizure and intracranial data beginning 1 hr before the seizure onset. Three nonlinear measures, correlation integral, short-term largest Lyapunov exponent and average angular frequency are used in the current study. Data analyses show multiple transient drops in STLmax values during the preictal period followed by a significant drop during the ictal period. Average angular frequency values demonstrate transient peaks during the preictal period followed by a significant peak during the ictal period. Convergence among electrode sites is also observed in both STLmax and (Omega) over bar values before seizure onset. Results suggest that dynamical changes precede and accompany seizures in rat CLE. Thus, it may be possible to use the rat CLE model as a tool to refine and test real-time seizure prediction, and closed-loop intervention techniques.	[Nair, S.

We used magnetoencephalography to assess a activity during an auditory spatial delayed matching-to-sample task compared with a nonmemory control condition. In the memory task, participants had to memorize the lateralization angle of a noise stimulus SI and compare it with another lateralized sound S2 presented after an 800-ms delay phase. Whereas a desynchronization following SI was observed over superior temporal areas under both conditions, only the memory task was accompanied by posterior parietal a synchronization during the subsequent delay period. The findings are consistent with the notion of a activity reflecting active inhibition of interfering processes during memory maintenance of spatial sounds.

While much research focuses on developing methods for automatic removal of artefact sources, comparatively little effort has been spent on trying to identify neurophysiological sources of interest, which is especially challenging in the absence of prior knowledge about their spatial or time-freqency characteristics. This work presents a method for identifying source signals exhibiting systematic and reliable time-frequency differences over clearly defined epochs associated with different "system-states". The proposed method uses annotated data and a classification approach to identify those sources which individually reflect significant differences between epochs (classes). Applied to segments of 275-channel MEG data from a visuo-motor task in which left, right or no finger movements occurred, the method selects only a small number of sources whose scalp topographies are consistent with primary sensorimotor cortical areas.

(2007) Hippocampus 17:801-812) explains the generation of spatially stable, regular firing patterns by medial entorhinal cortical (mEC) grid cells in terms of the interference between velocity-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with different preferred directions. This model predicts specific relationships between the intrinsic firing frequency and spatial scale of grid cell firing, the EEG theta frequency, and running speed (Burgess, 2008). Here, we use spectral analyses of EEG and of spike autocorrelograms to estimate the intrinsic firing frequency of grid cells, and the concurrent theta frequency, in mEC Layer 11 in freely moving rats. The intrinsic firing frequency of grid cells increased with running speed and decreased with grid scale, according to the quantitative prediction of the model. Similarly, theta frequency increased with running speed, which was also predicted by the model. An alternative Moire interference model (Blair et al., 2007) predicts a direction-dependent variation in intrinsic firing frequency, which was not found. Our results Suggest that interference between VCOs generates the spatial firing patterns of entorhinal grid cells according to the oscillatory interference model. They also provide specific constraints on this model of grid cell firing and have more general implications for viewing neuronal processing in terms of interfering oscillatory processes.

J	Basile, LFH				Basile, Luis F. H.			Complex, multifocal, individual-specific attention-related cortical functional circuits	BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						attention; cortical electrical activity; high-resolution electroencephalography; slow potentials; source localization; functional mapping	VISUAL-ATTENTION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; PARIETAL LOBE; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; RECONSTRUCTIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; POTENTIALS; ANATOMY	Recent studies focusing on the analysis of individual patterns of non-sensory-motor CNS activity may significantly alter our view of CNS functional mapping. We have recently provided evidence for highly variable attention-related Slow Potential (SP) generating cortical areas across individuals (Basile et al., 2003, 2006). In this work, we present new evidence, searching for other physiological indexes of attention by a new use of a well established method, for individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during expecting attention. We applied latency corrected peak averaging to oscillatory bursts, from 124-channel EEG recordings, and modeled their generators by current density reconstruction. We first computed event-related total power, and averaging was based on individual patterns of narrow task-induced band-power. This method is sensitive to activity out of synchrony with stimuli, and may detect task-related changes missed by regular Event-Related Potential (ERP) averaging. We additionally analyzed overall inter-electrode phase-coherence. The main results were (1) the detection of two bands of attention-induced beta range oscillations (around 25 and 21 Hz), whose scalp topography and current density cortical distribution were complex multi-focal, and highly variable across subjects, including prefrontal and posterior cortical areas. Most important, however, was the observation that (2) the generators of task-induced oscillations are largely the same individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during the resting, baseline state. We concluded that attention-related electrical cortical activity is highly individual-specific (significantly different from sensory-related visual evoked potentials or delta and theta induced band-power), and to a great extent already established during mere wakefulness. We discuss the critical implications of those results, in combination with other studies presenting individual data, to functional mapping: the need to abandon group averaging of task-related cortical activity and to revise studies on group averaged data, since the assumption of universal function to each cortical area appears deeply challenged. Clinical implications regard the interpretation of focal lesion consequences, functional reorganization, and neurosurgical planning.	[Basile, Luis F.

STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN PYRAMIDAL CELL ACTIVITY AND NETWORK OSCILLATIONS IN THE OLFACTORY CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						rat; piriform cortex; olfactory coding; local field potential; gamma oscillations	RAT PIRIFORM CORTEX; ODOR DISCRIMINATION; NEURAL ASSEMBLIES; RESPIRATORY CYCLE; BULB; EEG; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; REPRESENTATIONS; HETEROGENEITY	Oscillatory activity is a prominent characteristic of electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory system and has been proposed to play a key role in encoding olfactory representations. Studies in several systems have shown that some aspects of information coding involve characteristics that intertwine spikes and fast oscillations (in the beta and gamma range) of local field potentials (LFP). In the insect olfactory system, it has been proposed that oscillatory activity could provide a temporal link between cells. Following previous data, we have proposed that gamma band oscillations in mammals could subserve a gating function for the transfer of information between the olfactory bulb (013) and the anterior piriform cortex (aPC), which are functionally coupled. In this study, we used an electrophysiological approach to investigate the temporal relationship between UP gamma oscillations and single-unit activity by simultaneously recording UP and single unit discharges in the rat aPC during odor evoked activity. Our data showed that mean spike discharges and gamma oscillatory bursts were synchronized with the same respiratory cycle epoch (around the inspiration/expiration transition). Temporal correlations between spikes and UP revealed that cortical cell spikes were tightly phase-coupled with the peak of gamma oscillations and that this phase-coupling was not odor-dependent. Our results suggest that gamma oscillation may act as a temporal filter. Oscillatory phase-coupled spikes in the OB could act in increasing the probability of spike emission in the aPC cell during a narrow time-window, explaining the tight phase-coupling observed in the aPC. The role of spike-LFP phase-coupling as a binding function between odor features is discussed. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The heads of pigs were irradiated with a half wave dipole using three different exposure routines; short bursts of 1-3 s at two different exposure levels and a continuous 10-min exposure. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was registered continuously during the exposures to search for RF-EMF originated changes. The dosimetry was based on simulations with the anatomical heterogeneous numerical model of the pig head. The simulation results were validated by experimental measurements with the exposure dipole and a homogeneous liquid phantom resembling the pig head. The specific absorption rate (SAR), defined as a maximum average over 10 g tissue mass (SAR(10g)), was 7.3 W/kg for the first set of short bursts and 31 W/kg for the second set of short bursts. The SAR(10g) in the continuous 10-min exposure was 31 W/kg. The estimated uncertainty for the dosimetry was 25% (K=2).

The thalamus is a key participant in many of these oscillations, yet the cellular mechanisms by which this participation occurs are poorly understood. Here we describe how, under appropriate conditions, thalamocortical (TC) neurons from different nuclei can exhibit a wide array of largely unrecognised intrinsic oscillatory activities at a range of cognitively-relevant frequencies. For example, both metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and muscarinic Ach receptor (mAchR) activation can cause rhythmic bursting at alpha/theta frequencies. Interestingly, key differences exist between mGluR- and mAchR-induced bursting, with the former involving extensive dendritic Ca(2+) electrogenesis and being mimicked by a non-specific block of K(+) channels with Ba(2+), whereas the latter appears to be more reliant on proximal Na(+) channels and a prominent spike after-depolarization (ADP). This likely relates to the differential somatodendritic distribution of mGluRs and mAChRs and may have important functional consequences. We also show here that in similarity to some neocortical neurons, inhibiting large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in TC neurons can lead to fast rhythmic bursting (FRB) at similar to 40 Hz. This activity also appears to rely on a Na(+) channel-dependent spike ADP and may occur in vivo during natural wakefulness. Taken together, these results show that TC neurons are considerably more flexible than generally thought and strongly endorse a role for the thalamus in promoting a range of cognitively-relevant brain rhythms.

J	Zion-Golumbic, E; Bentin, S				Zion-Golumbic, Elana; Bentin, Shlomo			Dissociated neural mechanisms for face detection and configural encoding: Evidence from N170 and induced gamma-band oscillation effects	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						configural processing; EEG; faces; gamma oscillations; N170	PERCEPTION; MEMORY; SYNCHRONY; INVERSION; RECOGNITION; SPECIFICITY; EXPERTISE; RESPONSES; FEATURES; HUMANS	Despite ample research, the structure and the functional characteristics of neural systems involved in human face processing are still a matter of active debate. Here we dissociated between a neural mechanism manifested by the face-sensitive N170 event-related potential effect and a mechanism manifested by induced electro-encephalographic oscillations in the gamma band, which have been previously associated with the integration of individually coded features and activation of corresponding neural representations. The amplitude of the N170 was larger in the absence of the face contour but not affected by the configuration of inner components (ICs). Its latency was delayed by scrambling the configuration of the components as well as by the absence of the face contour. Unlike the N170, the amplitude of the induced gamma activity was sensitive to the configuration of ICs but insensitive to their presence within or outside a face contour. This pattern suggests a dual mechanism for early face processing, each utilizing different visual cues, which might indicate their respective roles in face processing. The N170 seems to be associated primarily with the detection and categorization of faces, whereas the gamma oscillations may be involved in the activation of their mental representation.

Antidepressant drugs, including norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors are proven to diminish REM sleep, and REM sleep-related hippocampal theta oscillation. Since reboxetine, a highly selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor has been shown to block REM sleep, but induce or facilitate hippocampal theta activity in anesthetized rats, the current study investigated the effects of reboxetine on stageand behavior dependent theta activity. Polysomnographic recordings, which included hippocampal field potentials at the hippocampal fissure, were carried out in rats for 8 h during the light phase of the circadian cycle. Theta rhythm was analyzed during three different behavioral conditions: REM sleep, during motor activity in a familiar environment, and during exploration in a novel environment. We found that, compared with REM sleep, theta power was relatively low during periods of active wakefulness when the animal was in the familiar home cage, but considerably increased during exploration in a novel environment. Reboxetine suppressed sleep and thus abolished REM sleep-related hippocampal theta rhythm, attenuated theta in the familiar environment, and significantly enhanced theta oscillations associated with exploratory behavior. Our findings demonstrate a state- and behavior-dependent modulation of hippocampal theta activity by reboxetine, providing further evidence for a prominent role of norepinephrine in arousal and focused or selective attention (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Modulation of hippocampal theta oscillation by histamine H3 receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							HISTAMINE H-3 RECEPTOR; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; BRAIN HISTAMINE; HIGH-FREQUENCY; ANTAGONISTS; RHYTHM; BEHAVIOR; EEG; NOREPINEPHRINE	Preclinical findings demonstrate procognitive actions of histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists. Since a prominent role of neuronal network oscillations of the hippocampus, such as theta band oscillation, has been recognized in numerous cognitive functions, in the present study, the potential involvement of H3 receptors in modulation of hippocampal theta activity has been investigated using various recording paradigms. Systemic administration of the selective H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists, thioperamide and ciproxifan (0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg i.v.), dose dependently increased hippocampal theta power, similarly to methylphenidate (0.1-1 mg/kg i.v.), in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. When hippocampal theta oscillation was elicited by electrical brainstem (nucleus pontis oralis) stimulation, ciproxifan (1 mg/kg i.v.) augmented the power of stimulation-induced theta. In contrast, systemic administration of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not modify elicited theta. To analyze the role of H3 receptors on stage- and behavior-dependent hippocampal theta activity, polysomnographic recordings were carried out together with field potential recordings at the hippocampal fissure in freely moving rats for 8 h during the light phase of the circadian cycle. Systemic administration of ciproxifan (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) promoted wakefulness with a concomitant reduction in cortical delta power and augmented novelty-induced hippocampal theta activity. These findings provide evidence that H3 receptors play an important role in regulation of hippocampal theta oscillation, representing one of the probable mechanisms involved in histamine-induced modulation of higher brain functions, such as attention and learning.

Increased frontal phase-locking of event-related theta oscillations in Alzheimer patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer; dementia; oscillations; ERP; theta; P300; phase-locking; cholinergic	BRAIN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; VISUAL-CORTEX; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; ALPHA-OSCILLATION; SHORT-TERM; DISEASE; ACETYLCHOLINE; EEG	This is a pilot study describing event-related oscillations in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (AD). Theta responses of 22 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (11 non-treated, 11 treated by cholinesterase inhibitors), and 20 healthy elderly controls were analyzed by using the conventional visual oddball paradigm. We aimed to compare theta responses of the three groups in a range between 4-7 Hz at the frontal electrodes. At F-3 location, theta responses of healthy subjects were phase locked to stimulation and theta oscillatory responses of non-treated Alzheimer patients showed weaker phase-locking, i.e. average of Z-transformed means of correlation coefficients between single trials was closer to zero. In treated AD patients, phase-locking following target stimulation was two times higher in comparison to the responses of non-treated patients. The results indicate that the phase-locking of theta oscillations at F-3 in the treated patients is as strong as the control subjects. The F-4 theta responses were not statistically significant between the groups. Our findings imply that the theta responses at F3 location are highly unstable in comparison to F4 in non-treated mild AD patients and cholinergic agents may modulate event-related theta oscillatory activities in the frontal regions.

J	Guntekin, B; Basar, E				Guentekin, Bahar; Basar, Erol			Brain oscillations are highly influenced by gender differences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						gender differences; brain oscillations; occipital cortex; EEG; visual evoked potentials	THETA; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; TASK	There are few studies describing gender differences in event related oscillations (EROS). In the present report we demonstrate that gender differences are apparent in EROS even during simple visual stimulation, possibly activating very basic sensory networks. The data of 32 (16 males) healthy subjects were recorded from thirteen different scalp locations (F-3, F-4, C-z, C-3, C-4, T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, P-3, P-4, O-1, O-2). Analysis was performed in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (5-8.5 Hz), alpha (9-13 Hz), beta (15-24 Hz), and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency ranges. The results showed that the maximum peak-to-peak delta response amplitudes for women were significantly higher than for men over occipital, parietal, central and temporal electrode locations. There were also differentiations in the beta and gamma oscillatory responses. These gender differences were most pronounced over the electrode Site O-2, that is, over primary visual areas. It is suggested that this study might serve as a standard to investigate gender differences in electrophysiology. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

In the experiment 110 individuals participated (55 males and 55 females). They were clustered into 5 personality types according to the dimensions of general and emotional intelligence, and the five-factor personality model (FFM) - extraversion (E), neuroticism (N), openness (O), conscientiousness (C) and agreeableness (A). The resting EEG of individuals was analyzed using three methods: a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); Approximated entropy (ApEn), and a low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The results show that most robust differences between personality types were observed in the gamma band, between types with extreme constellations of dimensions (neurotic type low emotional intelligence and A; high N), or between types with specific combinations of dimensions (introverts with high IQ, versus extraverts with low to average IQ). These differences were also gender specific. In the gamma band females with different personality structures differed much more than did males, whereas in the lower-1 alpha band a reverse pattern was observed. It was further shown that the differences were much more pronounced in the parieto-occipital brain areas than in the frontal areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such synchronous activity is reflected in the ongoing oscillatory activation pattern that can be recorded non-invasively using MEG and EEG techniques.

Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: Sound intensity modulates auditory evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillations; 40 Hz; phase-locking; sound intensity	CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MIDDLE-LATENCY RESPONSE; OSCILLATING-POTENTIALS; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; VISUAL-STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; CORTEX; DEPENDENCE; PERCEPTION	We studied the effect of different sound intensities on the auditory evoked gamma-band response (GBR). Previous studies observed oscillatory gamma activity in the auditory cortex of animals and humans. For the visual modality, it has been demonstrated that the GBR can be modulated by top-down (attention, memory) as well as bottom-up factors (stimulus properties). Therefore, we expected to find a sound intensity modulation for the auditory GBR. 21 healthy participants without hearing deficits were investigated in a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal tones were presented at three systematically varied sound intensities (30, 45, 60 dB hearing level). The results of the auditory evoked potentials were predominantly consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, we observed an augmentation of the evoked GBR with increasing sound intensity. The analysis indicated that this intensity difference in the GBR amplitude most likely arises from increased phase-locking. The results demonstrate a distinct dependency between sound intensity and gamma-band oscillations. Future experiments that investigate the relationship between auditory evoked GBRs and higher cognitive processes should therefore select stimuli with an adequate sound intensity and control this variable to avoid confounding effects. In addition, it seems that gamma-band activity is more sensitive to exogenous stimulus parameters than evoked potentials. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Then, we evaluated the differences in the cortical network associated with later remembered and not-remembered commercials by calculating the global- E-g and local-efficiency E-l indexes. During the visualization of the video-clips that will be forgotten (FRG), the cortical network exhibited high values of global- and local-efficiency, reflecting a small-world configuration. During the visualization of the video-clips that will be remembered (RMB), the same indexes appeared significantly lower. Such a difference seems not depending on the spectral content of the cortical activity. This result shows how the network communication efficiency would be affected by the presence of attentional and semantic processes that are behind a successful memory encoding in a lifelike situation.

Syllabic rate corresponds to natural jaw-associated oscillatory rhythms, and phonemic length could reflect endogenous oscillatory auditory cortical properties. Hemispheric lateralization for speech could result from an asymmetry of cortical tuning, with left and right auditory areas differentially sensitive to spectro-temporal features of speech. Using simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from humans, we show that spontaneous EEG power variations within the gamma range (phonemic rate) correlate best with left auditory cortical synaptic activity, while fluctuations within the theta range correlate best with that in the right. Power fluctuations in both ranges correlate with activity in the mouth premotor region, indicating coupling between temporal properties of speech perception and production. These data show that endogenous cortical rhythms provide temporal and spatial constraints on the neuronal mechanisms underlying speech perception and production.

The righthanded university students (27 males and 26 females) participated in the experiments. An instruction "to create the most original solution" as compared to condition with an instruction "to create any solution" induced all increase in the baseline power of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 rhythms most pronounced in the posterior cortex. Task-related desynchronization of the alpha rhythms was higher but the beta-2 synchronization was lower after the former than after the latter instruction. Differences in the asymmetry of the alpha I and alpha 2 rhythms in the parietal and temporal regions of hemispheres suggested the right hemisphere dominance in intrinsic alertness and evoked activation related to divergent thinking. The findings were common and gender-independent in both figurative and verbal tasks suggesting a generalized influence of extrinsic motivation oil creative activity.

In this article we provide a brief overview of contemporary methodologies used for the operationalization of creative thinking in a neuroscientific context. Empirical studies are reported which measured brain activity (by means of EEG, fMRI, NIRS or PET) during the performance of different experimental tasks. These tasks, along with creative idea generation tasks used in our laboratory, constitute useful tools in uncovering possible brain correlates of creative thinking. Nevertheless, much more work is needed in order to establish reliable and valid measures of creative thinking, in particular measures of novelty or originality of creative insights.

We have investigated the effect of acute immobilization stress in amygdalohippocampal circuits by measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) in male Wistar rats during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus) and the amygdala (lateral nucleus). Prior to the stress, two baseline recordings were taken. Twenty-four hours later rats were exposed once to acute immobilization stress (AIS) session for 2 h. After the release and on subsequent days, electrophysiological changes that occurred due to stress during REM sleep were analyzed by comparing them with baseline measurements. Our results suggest that acute immobilization stress induced significant increase in REM sleep in the first 24 h after the exposure. In addition to changes in the sleep patterns, we have observed increased theta oscillations in CA1 area of the hippocampus with decreased coherence at theta range (4-8 Hz) between hippocampus and amygdala. These results suggest that single exposure to aversive experience such as immobilization stress can lead to dynamic changes in neuronal activities with altered sleep morphology. The results obtained in the present study are comparable to those seen in human patients suffering from panic, and anxiety due to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (C) 2008 IBRO.

The set was formed to pictures of faces with a negative emotional expression (an angry face). Different patterns of the EEG spatial synchronization were revealed for the theta and alpha bands, especially, in subjects who formed the rigid set (erroneous perception of the facial expression in the form of contrast and assimilative illusions). An increase in coherence in the theta band was observed in subjects of this group (n = 23) between the dorsolateral frontal and temporal regions of the right hemisphere. A neural mechanism underlying the visual illusions was suggested. Analysis of the EEG coherence in the theta and alpha bands makes it possible to obtain the "windows" for the insight into operation of the cortico-hippocampal and fronto-thalamic functional systems of the integrative brain activity and involvement of these systems in perception of facial expression. The fronto-thalamic system is involved in a more generalized activation of the brain cortex, especially of its frontal regions.

Tiny signals from the human brain: Acquisition and processing of biomagnetic fields in magnetoencephalography	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							EEG; LOCALIZATION; MEG	Low-temperature superconductivity plays an important role in some specific biomedical applications, and, in particular, in non-invasive imaging methods of human brain activity. Superconducting magnets are indispensable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which allows functional imaging of the brain with high spatial but poor temporal resolution. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are the most sensitive magnetic field detectors. Up to a few hundreds of SQUIDs are nowdays used in modern whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems. They allow tracking brain activation with a superior temporal resolution of milliseconds, which is a quintessential condition for the monitoring of brain dynamics and the understanding of information processing in the human brain. We introduce the prerequisites of MEG data acquisition and briefly review two established methods of biomagnetic signal processing: The concept of signal averaging, and the subsequent source identification as a solution of the biomagnetic inverse problem. Beside these standard techniques, we discuss advanced methods for signal processing in MEG, which take into account the frequency content of the recorded signal. We briefly refer to the prospects of Fourier analysis and wavelet transform in MEG data analysis, and suggest matching pursuit as a promising tool for signal decomposition and reconstruction with high resolution in time-frequency plane.

The available treatments for sleep disturbance have their limitations, so we have adopted a different approach to the improvement of sleep. Since in animal and human studies skin warming has been found to increase neuronal activity in brain areas that are critically involved in sleep regulation, we investigated whether subtle skin temperature manipulations could improve human sleep. By employing a thermosuit to control skin temperature during nocturnal sleep, we demonstrate that induction of a mere 0.4 degrees C increase in skin temperature, whilst not altering core temperature, suppresses nocturnal wakefulness ( P<0.001) and shifts sleep to deeper stages ( P<0.001) in young and, especially, in elderly healthy and insomniac participants. Elderly subjects showed such a pronounced sensitivity, that the induced 0.4 degrees C increase in skin temperature was sufficient to almost double the proportion of nocturnal slow wave sleep and to decrease the probability of early morning awakening from 0.58 to 0.04. Therefore, skin warming strongly improved the two most typical age-related sleep problems; a decreased slow wave sleep and an increased risk of early morning awakening. EEG frequency spectra showed enhancement of low-frequency cortical oscillations. The results indicate that subtle feedback control of in-bed temperature through very mild manipulations could have strong clinical relevance in the management of disturbed sleep especially in the elderly, who have an attenuated behavioural response to suboptimal environmental temperature, which may hamper them from taking appropriate action to optimize their bed temperature.

They are intended as overt movements, but the absence of the measurable motor responses and the subjective experience make quasi-movements similar to motor imagery. We used the amplitude dynamics of electroencephalographic alpha oscillations as a marker of the regional involvement of cortical areas in three experimental tasks: movement execution, kinesthetic motor imagery, and quasi-movements. All three conditions were associated with a significant suppression of alpha oscillations over the sensorimotor hand area of the contralateral hemisphere. This suppression was strongest for executed movements, and stronger for quasi-movements than for motor imagery. The topography of alpha suppression was similar in all three conditions. Proprioceptive sensations related to quasi-movements contribute to the assumption that the "sense of movement" can originate from central efferent processes. Quasi-movements are also congruent with the postulated continuity between motor imagery and movement preparation/execution. We also show that in healthy subjects quasi-movements can be effectively used in brain-computer interface research leading to a significantly smaller classification error (similar to 47% of relative decrease) in comparison to the errors obtained with conventionally used motor imagery strategies.

Typically, physiological studies on real-time detection of drowsiness usually use the same model for all subjects. However, the relatively large individual variability in EEG dynamics relating to loss of alertness implies that for many subjects, group statistics may not be useful to accurately predict changes in cognitive states. Researchers have attempted to build subject-dependent models based on his/her pilot data to account for individual variability. Such approaches cannot account for the cross-session variability in EEG dynamics, which may cause problems due to various reasons including electrode displacements, environmental noises, and skin-electrode impedance. Hence, we propose an unsupervised subject- and session-independent approach for detection departure from alertness in this study. Experimental results showed that the EEG power in the alpha-band (as well as in the theta-band) is highly correlated with changes in the subject's cognitive state with respect to drowsiness as reflected through his driving performance. This approach being an unsupervised and session-independent one could be used to develop a useful system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings.

Methods: Interictal electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were analyzed for eight pediatric epilepsy patients to find the cortical activation maps, which were compared with the patients' seizure-onset zones identified from ictal ECoG recordings. Various relations between the local activation time and cortical potential were assumed. The most effective relation was determined by accessing their capability to predict the seizure-onset zone. Computer simulations using a moving dipole source model were also conducted to test the present approach in imaging the propagated cortical activity. Results: In both clinical data analysis and computer simulations, the maximal amplitude proved to be the most effective criterion with which to determine the local cortical activation time. The present method successfully predicted the seizure-onset zone in seven of eight patients by the CAM analysis of ECoG-recorded interictal spikes (IISs). For patients with multiple seizure foci, each focus can be revealed by analyzing IISs with different spatial patterns. Conclusions: The time difference between spike peaks of the interictal events in the leading channel and other channels can be effectively defined as the local cortical activation time. The cortical activation mapping method based on this time latency can be used to predict the seizure-onset zones, suggesting that the present CAM method is useful to assist the presurgical evaluation for the epilepsy patients.

Even though perceptual areas are engaged in memory recall, little is known about how memory stabilization is reflected in those areas. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we investigated changes in visual areas with memory stabilization. Subjects were trained on associating a face to one of eight locations. The first set of associations(`stabilized') was learned in three sessions distributed over a week. The second set(`labile') was learned in one session just prior to the MEG measurement. In the recall session only the face was presented and subjects had to indicate the correct location using a joystick. The MEG data revealed robust gamma activity during recall, which started in early visual cortex and propagated to higher visual and parietal brain areas. The occipital gamma power was higher for the labile than the stabilized condition (time= 0.65-0.9 s). Also the event-related field strength was higher during recall of labile than stabilized associations ( time= 0.59-1.5 s). We propose that recall of the spatial associations prior to memory stabilization involves a top-down process relying on reconstructing learned representations in visual areas. This process is reflected in gamma band activity consistent with the notion that neuronal synchronization in the gamma band is required for visual representations. More direct synaptic connections are formed with memory stabilization, thus decreasing the dependence on visual areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Nieuwenhuis, Ingrid L.

Self-paced movements induce high-frequency gamma oscillations in primary motor cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BAND ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; HUMANS; AREAS; MEG	There has been increasing interest in the functional role of high-frequency (>30 Hz) cortical oscillations accompanying various sensorimotor and cognitive tasks in humans. Similar "high gamma" activity has been observed in the motor cortex, although the role of this activity in motor control is unknown. Using whole-head MEG recordings combined with advanced source localization methods, we identified high-frequency (65 to 80 Hz) gamma oscillations in the primary motor cortex during self-paced movements of the upper and lower limbs. Brief bursts of gamma activity were localized to the contralateral precentral gyrus (MI) during self-paced index finger abductions, elbow flexions and foot dorsiflexions. In comparison to lower frequency (10-30 Hz) sensorimotor rhythms that are bilaterally suppressed prior to and during movement (Jurkiewicz et al., 2006), high gamma activity increased only during movement, reaching maximal increase 100 to 250 ms following EMG onset, and was lateralized to contralateral MI, similar to findings from intracranial EEG studies. Peak frequency of gamma activity was significantly lower during foot dorsiflexion (67.4 +/- 5.2 Hz) than during finger abduction (75.3 +/- 4.4 Hz) and elbow flexion (73.9 +/- 3.7 Hz) although markedly similar for left and right movements of the same body part within subjects, suggesting activation of a common underlying network for gamma oscillations in the left and right motor cortex. These findings demonstrate that voluntary movements elicit high-frequency gamma oscillations in the primary motor cortex that are effector specific, and possibly reflect the activation of cortico-subcortical networks involved in the feedback control of discrete movements.

Glutamatergic stimulation of the basal forebrain elevates extracellular adenosine and increases the subsequent sleep	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep homeostasis; sleep deprivation; EEG; in vivo microdialysis; rat	FREELY MOVING RATS; EEG POWER SPECTRA; C-FOS PROTEIN; NUCLEUS BASALIS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ENERGY DEPLETION; RELEASE; NEURONS; DEPRIVATION; BRAIN	A prolonged period of waking accumulates sleep pressure, increasing both the duration and the intensity of the subsequent sleep period. Delta power, which is calculated from the slow range electroencephalograph ic (EEG) oscillations (0.1-4 Hz), is regarded as the marker of sleep intensity. Recent findings indicate that not only the duration but also the quality of waking, determines the level of increase in the delta activity during the subsequent sleep period. Elevated levels of extracellular adenosine in the basal forebrain (BF) during prolonged waking have been proposed to act as the molecular signal of increased sleep pressure, but the role of BF neuronal activity in elevating adenosine has not been previously explored. We hypothesized that an increase in neuronal discharge in the BF would lead to increase in the extracellular adenosine and contribute to the increase in the subsequent sleep. To experimentally increase neuronal activity in the rat BF, we used 3 h in vivo microdialysis application of glutamate or its receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or AMPA. Samples for adenosine measurement were collected during the drug application and the EEG was recorded during and after the treatment, altogether for 24 h. All treatments increased the duration of the subsequent sleep following the application. In contrast, delta power was elevated only if both the waking EEG theta (59 Hz) power (which can be regarded as a marker of active waking) and the extracellular adenosine in the BF were increased during the application. These results indicate that increased neuronal activity in the BF, and particularly the type of neuronal activity coinciding with active waking, is one of the factors contributing to the buildup of the sleep pressure.

In this study, we examined the spatial characteristics of spectral distribution in EEG field powers, i.e., sitting quietly with an EC and EO resting state of 3 min each, measured with high-density 128-ch EEG recording and FFT signal analyses in 15 right-handed healthy college females. Region of interest was set at a threshold at 90% of the spectral effective value to delimit the dominant spatial field power of effective energy in brain activity. Low-frequency delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) EEG field power was distributed at the prefrontal area with great expansion of spatial field and enhancement of field power (t = -2.72, p < 0.02) from the EC to the EO state. Theta (4-7 Hz) EEG field power was distributed over the fronto-central area and leaned forward from EC to the EO state but with drastic reduction in field power (t = 4.04, p < 0.01). The middle-frequency alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz) and alpha-2 (10-12 Hz) EEG powers exhibited bilateral distribution over the posterior areas with an anterior field in lower alpha-1. Both showed significantly reduction of field powers (respectively, W = 120, p < 0.001 for alpha-1; t = 4.12, p < 0.001 for alpha-2) from EC to the EO state. Beta-1 (13-23 Hz) exhibited a similar spatial region over the posterior area as in alpha-2 and showed reduction of field power (t = 4.42, p < 0.001) from EC to the EO state. In contrast, high-frequency beta-2 and gamma band exhibited similar, mainly prefrontal distribution in field power, and exhibited no change from EC to the EO state. Corresponding correlation analyses indicated significant group association between EC and EO only in the field powers of delta (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) and theta (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) band. In addition, the great inter-individual variability (90 folds in alpha-1, 62 folds in alpha-2) in regional field power was largely observed in the EC state (10 folds) than the EO state in subjects. To summarize, our study depicts a network of spectral EEG activities simultaneously operative at well defined regional fields in the EC state, varying specifically between EC and EO states. In contrast to transient EEG spectral rhythmic dynamics, current study of long-lasting (e. g. 3 min) spectral field powers can characterize state features in EEG. The EEG default mode network (EEG-DMN) of spectral field powers at rest in the respective EC or EO state is valued to serve as the basal electrophysiological condition in human brain. In health, this EEG-DMN is deemed essential for evaluation of brain functions without task demands for gender difference, developmental change in age span, and brain response to task activation. It is expected to define brain dysfunction in disease at resting state and with consequences for sensory, affective and cognitive alteration in the human brain. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Single-trial ECoG neural interfaces require appropriate feature extraction and signal processing methods to identify and model in real-time signatures of motor events in spontaneous brain activity. Here, we develop the clinical experimental paradigm and analysis tools to record broadband (1 Hz to 6 kHz) ECoG from patients participating in a reaching and pointing task. Motivated by the significant role of amplitude modulated rate coding in extracellular spike based brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), we develop methods to quantify spatio-temporal intermittent increased ECoG voltages to determine if they provide viable control inputs for ECoG neural interfaces. This study seeks to explore preprocessing modalities that emphasize amplitude modulation across frequencies and channels in the ECoG above the level of noisy background fluctuations in order to derive the commands for complex, continuous control tasks. Preliminary experiments show that it is possible to derive online predictive models and spatially localize the generation of commands in the cortex for motor tasks using amplitude modulated ECoG.

Hence, the relative spectral power (RSP) in classical frequency bands was calculated from the averaged power spectral density. Given the fact that the RSP can be viewed as a probability distribution function, the Shannon spectral entropy, Tsallis spectral entropy, generalized escort-Tsallis spectral entropy and Renyi spectral entropy were calculated from the RSP. Significant differences for each parameter were assessed with Mann-Whitney U test, whereas classification performance was studied using binary logistic regression. Results revealed an increase in the RSP of control subjects at beta and gamma bands, while AD patients showed an increase in the RSP values at delta and theta bands. Entropies obtained statistically significant lower values for AD patients than for controls. This issue suggests a significant decrease in irregularity of AD patients' MEG activity.

In this study we show that when a visual target is attended enhanced synchrony between gamma phase (30 to 50 Hz) and theta phase (4 to 7 Hz), representing bottom-up and top-down activity, respectively, can be observed. This is interpreted as memory matching between incoming visual information and stored (top-down) information. The results highlight the function of oscillatory brain activity in the integration of memory and attention processes. This seems to be true in particular for theta oscillations showing increased interregional phase-coupling. We conclude that memory information is stored within a distributed theta network and it is matched with an incoming sensory trace at posterior brain areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thirty healthy volunteers were exposed and sham exposed to electromagnetic field (EMF) (450 MHz, 0.16mW/cm2) modulated at 21Hz modulation frequency during visual oddball tasks. During the task the participants had to distinguish infrequent target stimuli from frequent standard stimuli. The task consisted of visually presented random ball shape stimuli, of which the 25% were target and 75% were standard stimuli. There were two tasks for a subject - EMF exposed task and sham exposed task. One task lasted 10 minutes, during the exposed task the EMF was switched on and off in one-minute intervals, so that the participants performed half of the task in exposed condition (EMF ON) and half of the task without the exposure (EMF OFF). The sham exposed task was identical to exposed task, except the EMF generator was switched off all the time. For analysis of the EEG event-related responses the channel Pz was used. The EEG responses of a task were grouped into four different categories taking into account the EMF exposure condition (ON, OFF) during the response and the response type (standard, target). The responses were averaged by categories. The EMF ON and OFF potentials were compared pair-wise. There were no statistically significant differences in responses in sham exposed tasks, neither in standard nor in target response components. In the exposed task the group mean N100 amplitude (measured from standard response) was -3,41+/-4,54 mu V in EMF ON category and -2,50+/-4,71 mu V in EMF OFF category, this difference was statistically highly significant (p< 0,00009). Differences in another components' amplitudes, latencies and in RT between EMF ON and OFF conditions were not significant during exposed tasks. It was concluded that modulated microwave effect has stronger impact on sensory components of EEG visual event-related potentials compared to later stages of visual information processing.

Since a complex interaction is present between sleep disorders and occurrence of arousals, we hypothesized that %VLFI and other indexes of heart-rate variability (HRV) measures reflect the degree of sleep fragmentation. Methods: The high-and low-frequency peaks from spectral analysis (FFT) of R-R intervals, the HRV changes using wavelet transform (WT), the geometric and time domain HRV, and the %VLFl were measured in 336 sleep studies performed in patients with insomnia, SRBD and restless legs syndrome/ periodic limb movement disorder (RLS/PLMD). The ability of HRV measures to assess sleep fragmentation was examined by correlation analysis and from the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF ratio) at the FFT and WT and the %VLFI were higher in patients with SRBD and RLS/PLMD, compared with patients with insomnia. These measures were related to the arousal (MA) index as well as to the apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturations, and periodic leg movement index (p < .001). The presence of a sleep fragmentation defined as an MA index > 20 was well detected by the %VLFl (ROC area: 0.66 +/- 0.03) and the LF/HF ratio at WT (ROC area: 0.66 +/- 0.03). Conclusion: The %VLFI and LF/HF ratio provide indirect measures of sleep fragmentation, suggesting that HRV measures during sleep assess more the associated sleep fragmentation than the presence of a specific sleep disorder.

Ten healthy volunteers, under conditions of increasing sleep deprivation (up to 34 hours), were asked to alternately undergo a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or a Driving Simulation test every 2 hours while ECG, EEG, EMG, eye movement and video were recorded. Results from 59 falling asleep (FA) events tracked from the first 5 volunteers during MWT provide promising trends: Heart Rate Variability in the VLF range decreases consistently and significantly minutes before FA events. The sympatho-vagal balance is very low compared to baseline wake values for about 5 minutes before the events. The mean HR and overall RR variability decrease during FA events by 2.2 SD and 2.9 SD below regional means. These changes found during MWT suggest that ECG derived parameters in the time and time-frequency domains may provide a useful tool for monitoring drivers' drowsiness and preventing traffic accidents.

The pathophysiology of this aberrant rhythmic activity is poorly understood. We used a computational model of a neocortical network with a dynamic homeostatic scaling rule to show that loss of input (partial deafferentation) can trigger network reorganization that results in pathological periodic discharges. The decrease in average firing rate in the network by deafferentation was compensated by homeostatic synaptic scaling of recurrent excitation among pyramidal cells. Synaptic scaling succeeded in recovering the network target firing rate for all degrees of deafferentation (fraction of deafferented cells), but there was a critical degree of deafferentation for pathological network reorganization. For deafferentation degrees below this value, homeostatic upregulation of recurrent excitation had minimal effect on the macroscopic network dynamics. For deafferentation above this threshold, however, a slow periodic oscillation appeared, patterns of activity were less sparse, and bursting occurred in individual neurons. Also, comparison of spike-triggered afferent and recurrent excitatory conductances revealed that information transmission was strongly impaired. These results suggest that homeostatic plasticity can lead to secondary functional impairment in case of cortical disorders associated with cell loss.

A well established marker of the functional dynamics within such cell assemblies is the suppression of iGBR amplitudes after the repetition of familiar, stimuli. This effect is commonly interpreted as a signature of 'sharpening' processes within conceptual networks, which are behaviourally mirrored in repetition priming effects. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli leads to iGBR increases indicating the 'formation' of a new cell assembly. A limitation of previous experiments was that only small numbers of repetitions were used. Thus, in the present EEG study we presented familiar and unfamiliar stimuli 10 times. We were able to replicate sharpening effects within conceptual networks representing familiar stimuli. Furthermore, we observed a gradual increase of iGBRs elicited by repeated unfamiliar stimuli. Interestingly, this formation effect did not turn into a sharpening effect after many repetitions (i.e. after an unfamiliar stimulus became familiar). Thus, we conclude that sharpening and formation effects rely on qualitatively different networks representing familiar and unfamiliar material. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this purpose, a semi-automated, frequency-based methodology was developed, and testing was carried out in 5 patients with PB. We found that apneas and hypopneas very often (86% on average) begin in synchrony with transitions from wakefulness to theta activity, and end in synchrony with the opposite transition. These results suggest that in these patients chemical instability secondary to the impaired hemodynamics coexists and interacts with state instability.

They have targeted a variety of events and injuries e.g. epilepsy or stroke. The current density distribution and the voltage lead field associated with an impedance measurement setup is of critical importance for the proper analysis of any dynamics in the impedance measurement or for an accurate reconstruction of an EIT image, specially a dynamic type. In this work for the first time, the current density distribution is calculated in a human head with anatomical accuracy and resolution down to 1 torn, containing up to 24 tissues and considering the frequency dependency of the conductivity of each tissue. The obtained current densities and the subsequent sensitivity maps are analyzed with a special focus on the dependency of the electrode arrangement and also the measurement frequency. The obtained results provide us with interesting and relevant information to consider in the design of any tool for Electrical Bioimpedance Cerebral Monitoring.

Detecting changes in RTC versus CC communication from the EEG alone remains an unsolved problem. RTC communication shows complex (linear and nonlinear) properties in EEG. Aiming to detect changes in complexity of RTC communication from EEG, we applied a novel concept to analyze the complexity of information flow in RTC communication on different time scales of neuronal oscillations with Mutual information function (MIF). Methods: We studied information flow in RTC and CC communication in a previously established model of moderate and deep propofol/fentanyl anesthesia in six juvenile pigs. We recorded the electrothalamograrn (EThG) of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and the electrocorticogram (ECoG) of five ipsilateral regions and characterized their linear (spectral power, coherence) and complexity (MIF) properties. Results: During deep anesthesia, ECoG complexity over the temporoparietal region decreased on the time scale of beta frequency band. The spectral power in the beta frequency band decreased over others, but not over the temporoparietal region. Coherence decreased predominantly in the alpha band in both CC and RTC communication while information flow complexity decreased specifically in RTC, but not in CC, communication, suggesting higher information flow in RTC communication during deep anesthesia. Conclusions: Information flow complexity changes in ECoG specifically reflect changes in RTC communication. Significance: RTC communication can be quantified from cerebrocortical activity alone by assessing information flow complexity of CC communication.

Empirical Mode Decomposition on Mismatch Negativity	14TH NORDIC-BALTIC CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND MEDICAL PHYSICS	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	14th Nordic-Baltic Conference an Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics	JUN 16-20, 2008	Riga, LATVIA	Siemens, Grindex, Arbor Med Corp, Philips, AB Technol Corp, IFMBE, Latvian Council Sci		EMD; IMF; MMN; time-frequency; SAR	DYNAMICS; SOUND; EEG	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been applied in the various disciplines to extract the desired signal. The basic principle is to decompose a time series into intrinsic mode functions (IFMs) and each IFM corresponds to an oscillation phenomenon. A statistical description of the oscillatory activities of the EEG has been well known. It is desired to extract single oscillatory process from the EEG by EMD. Mismatch negativity (MMN) can be automatically elicited by the deviant stimulus in an oddball paradigm, in which physically the deviant stimulus occurs among repetitive and homogeneous stimuli. MMN thus reflects the ability of the brain to detect changes in auditory stimuli. So, the MMN trace indeed is the superposition of different event related potentials (ERPs). In theory, different ERPs correspond to different oscillatory phenomena. We assume each oscillatory activity corresponds to an IMF. Hence, EMD can decompose the MMN trace into different IMFs. Based on the timing, spectral and time-frequency infomax of MMN, a MMN detector is also designed to choose the MMN-like IMF. In contrast to the classic methods-averaging and optimal digital filtering (ODF), the EMD can cancel the ERPs overlapped with MMN both in the time and frequency domain. In the computation on the MMN experiment dataset, EMD outperforms averaging and ODF with about 3dB higher support to absence ratio.

We recorded EEG while 18 subjects retained sets of consonants in memory for 3 s; setsize ( ss4, ss6, ss8) determines memory workload. Theta power (4-8 Hz) increased with workload in all subjects in middle frontal electrodes. Using ICA, the increase in theta could be attributed to one component whose generators were localized by sLORETA in the medial frontal gyrus. Alpha power in parietal electrode Pz showed a mean increase during retention as compared to prestimulus fixation (event-related synchronization, ERS). On an individual basis, alpha power increased with workload in 9 subjects (WL+ group) and decreased in 9 subjects (WL-group). The alpha increased in upper alpha for the WL+ group ( mean: 10.4 Hz) and decreased in lower alpha for the WL- group ( mean: 8.9 Hz). Time-frequency representations show high alpha power early during retention for the WL+ group and high alpha power late during retention for the WL- group. sLORETA revealed maximal contrast for the WL+ group in the cuneus and for the WL- group in the precuneus. In subjects with WL+, alpha increase in the cuneus may reflect WM maintenance or active inhibition of task-irrelevant areas. In subjects with WL-, alpha decrease in the precuneus may reflect release of inhibition associated with attentional demands. Thus, alpha EEG characterizes two aspects of processing in the same WM task. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Characterization of the sleep EEG in acutely depressed men using detrended fluctuation analysis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sleep; EEG; energy fluctuations; scaling properties; scaling exponents; depression	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY; SEQUENCES; DIAGNOSIS; ILLNESS; SCALE; AGE	Objective: The aim of the present paper is to study the fluctuations of the sleep EEG over various time scales during a specific pathological condition: major depressive episode. Focus is made on scaling behaviour, which is the signature of the absence of characteristic time scale, and the presence of long-range correlations associated to physiological constancy preservation, variability reduction and mostly adaptability. Methods: Whole night sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in 24 men: 10 untreated patients with a major depressive episode (41.70 +/- 8.11 years) and 14 healthy subjects (42.43 +/- 5.67 years). Scaling in these time series was investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis (time range: 0.16-2.00 s). Scaling exponents (a) were determined in stage 2, slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) and during REM sleep. Forty-five epochs of 20 s were chosen randomly in each of these stages. Results: The median values of alpha were lower in patients during stage 2 and SWS. Conclusions: Major depressive episodes are characterized by a modification in the correlation structure of the sleep EEG time series. The finding which shows decreasing rate of the temporal correlations being different within the two groups in stage 2 and SWS provides an electrophysiologic argument that the underlying neuronal dynamics are modified during acute depression. Significance: The observed modifications in scaling behaviour in acutely depressed patients could be an explanation of the sleep fragmentation and instability found during major depressive episode.

The alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) has been known as the hallmark of the brain's idle-state. However, it is still debated if the alpha rhythm reflects synchronization in a distributed network or focal generator and whether it occurs spontaneously or is driven by a stimulus. This EEG/fMRI study aimed to explore the source of alpha modulations and their distribution in the resting brain. By serendipity, while computing the individually defined power modulations of the alpha-band, two simultaneously occurring components of these modulations were found. An 'induced alpha' that was correlated with the paradigm (eyes open/eyes closed), and a 'spontaneous alpha' that was ongoing and unrelated to the paradigm. These alpha components when used as regressors for BOLD activation revealed two segregated activation maps: the 'induced map' included left lateral temporal cortical regions and the hippocampus; the 'spontaneous map' included prefrontal cortical regions and the thalamus. Our combined fMRI/EEG approach allowed to computationally untangle two parallel patterns of alpha modulations and underpin their anatomical basis in the human brain. These findings suggest that the human alpha rhythm represents at least two simultaneously occurring processes which characterize the 'resting brain'; one is related to expected change in sensory information, while the other is endogenous and independent of stimulus change.

Sleep-stage scoring in the rat using a support vector machine	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						sleep staging; automated scoring; support vector machine	EEG; VALIDATION; DESIGN	Analysis and classification of sleep stages is a fundamental part of basic sleep research. Rat sleep stages are scored based on electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from electrodes implanted epidurally and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the temporalis or nuchal muscle. An automated sleep scoring system was developed using a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate among waking, nonrapid eye movement sleep, and paradoxical sleep. Two experts scored retrospective data obtained from six Sprague-Dawley rodents to provide the training sets and subsequent comparison data used to assess the effectiveness of the SVM. Numerous time-domain and frequency-domain features were extracted for each epoch and selectively reduced using statistical analyses. The SVM kernel function was chosen to be a Gaussian radial basis function and kernel parameters were varied to examine the effectiveness of optimization methods. Tests indicated that a common set of features could be chosen resulted in an overall agreement between the automated scores and the expert consensus of greater than 96%. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, methodological and inferential constraints have so far been unable to resolve the question of whether this interaction takes the form of direct top-down influences on perceptual processing, or feedforward convergence during a decision process. We examined top-down lexical influences on the categorization of segments in a/s/-/integral/ continuum presented in different lexical contexts to produce a robust Ganong effect. Using integrated MEG/EEG and MRI data we found that, within a network identified by 40 Hz gamma phase locking, activation in the supramarginal gyrus associated with wordform representation influences phonetic processing in the posterior superior temporal gyrus during a period of time associated with lexical processing. This result provides direct evidence that lexical processes influence lower level phonetic perception, and demonstrates the potential value of combining Granger causality analyses and high spatiotemporal resolution multimodal imaging data to explore the functional architecture of cognition.

The most robust gender related difference in brain activity was observed in the lower-2 alpha band. Mates and females displayed an inverse IQ-activation relationship in just that domain in which they usually perform better: females in the emotional intelligence domain, and males in the visuospatial ability domain. A similar pattern of brain activity could also be observed for the male/female respondents with different levels of performance and emotional IQ. It was suggested that high ability representatives of both genders to some extent compensate for their inferior problem solving skills (males in emotional tasks and females in spatial rotation tasks) by increasing their level of attention.

After the hypnotic induction, but without further suggestions as compared to the baseline condition, all studied parameters of local and remote functional connectivity were significantly changed. The significant differences between hypnosis and the baseline condition were observable (to different extent) in five studied independent frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The results were consistent and stable after I year. Based on these findings we conclude that alteration in functional connectivity of the brain may be regarded as a neuronal correlate of hypnosis (at least in very highly hypnotizable subjects) in which separate cognitive modules and subsystems may be temporarily incapable of communicating with each other normally.

Methods Upper alpha frequency band EEG event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) were calculated as percent changes in power relative to an inter-trial baseline across 4 memory loads in a spatial delayed-response task. Results: During the delay, the diagnostic groups showed equivalent ERD/ERS activity over posterior scalp regions at the lowest memory load; however, as memory load increased, patients, and to an intermediate degree, their non-schizophrenic co-twins (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs collapsed together), showed significantly greater increases in ERD/ERS amplitude as compared with controls. Conclusions: These findings dernonstrate abnormally increased ERWERS amplitudes with increasing memory load in patients with schizophrenia and their co-twins, consistent with inefficiency of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting active maintenance of information across a delay.

J	Basar, E; Guntekin, B				Basar, Erol; Guntekin, Bahar			A breakthrough in neuroscience needs a "Nebulous Cartesian System" Oscillations, quantum dynamics and chaos in the brain and vegetative system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain-body-mind; quantum brain model; chaos; brain oscillations; alpha; string theory; Feynman Diagrams; Heisenberg S-Matrix; Darwin; evolution	VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; POTENTIALS; ASSOCIATIONS; ALCOHOLISM; FREQUENCY; MEMORY; CAT	The Cartesian System is a fundamental conceptual and analytical framework related and interwoven with the concept and applications of Newtonian Dynamics. In order to analyze quantum processes physicist moved to a Probabilistic Cartesian System in which the causality principle became a probabilistic one. This means the trajectories of particles (obeying quantum rules) can be described only with the concept of cloudy wave packets. The approach to the brain-body-mind problem requires more than the prerequisite of modem physics and quantum dynamics. In the analysis of the brain-body-mind construct we have to include uncertain causalities and consequently multiple uncertain causalities. These multiple causalities originate from (1) nonlinear properties of the vegetative system (e.g. irregularities in biochemical transmitters, cardiac output, turbulences in the vascular system, respiratory apnea, nonlinear oscillatory interactions in peristalsis); (2) nonlinear behavior of the neuronal electricity (e.g. chaotic behavior measured by EEG), (3) genetic modulations, and (4) additional to these physiological entities nonlinear properties of physical processes in the body. The brain shows deterministic chaos with a correlation dimension of approx. D-2=6, the smooth muscles approx. D-2=3. According to these facts we propose a hyper-probabilistic approach or a hyper-probabilistic Cartesian System to describe and analyze the processes in the brain-body-mind system. If we add aspects as our sentiments, emotions and creativity to this construct, better said to this already hyper-probabilistic construct, this "New Cartesian System" is more than hyper-probabilistic, it is a nebulous system, we can predict the future only in a nebulous way; however, despite this chain of reasoning we can still provide predictions on brain-body-mind incorporations. We tentatively assume that the processes or mechanisms of the brain-body-mind system can be analyzed and predicted similar to the metaphor of '' finding the walking path in a cloudy or foggy day". This is meant by stating "The Nebulous Cartesian System" (NCS). Descartes, at his time undertaking his genius step, did not possess the knowledge of today's physiology and modem physics; we think that the time has come to consider such a New Cartesian System. To deal with this, we propose the utilization of the Heisenberg S-Matrix and a modified version of the Feynman Diagrams which we call "Brain Feynman Diagrams". Another metaphor to consider within the oscillatory approach of the NCS is the "string theory". We also emphasize that fundamental steps should be undertaken in order to create the own dynamical framework of the brain-body-mind incorporation; suggestions or metaphors from physics and mathematics are useful; however, the grammar of the brains intrinsic language must be understood with the help of a new biologically founded, adaptive-probabilistic Cartesian system. This new Cartesian System will undergo mutations and transcend to the philosophy of Henri Bergson in parallel to the Evolution theory of Charles Darwin to open gateways for approaching the brain-body-mind problem.

Effect of eye-blinks on a self-paced brain interface design	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain-computer interface; brain interface; self-paced BCI; asynchronous BCI; BCI; BI; EEG; EOG; ocular artefact	TECHNOLOGY; POTENTIALS	Objective: To test the performance of an EEG-based self-paced brain interface when data contaminated with eye-blink artefacts are included in the evaluation. Methods: Two different designs of a self-paced brain interface (the low frequency-asynchronous switch design, LF-ASD) are evaluated and compared using offline data from eight subjects. The true positive rates of the two designs are compared for three cases: (a) data containing eye-blink artefacts are excluded from the input; (b) all data, including eye-blinks, are included as input but the output decisions are inactivated during eye-blink artefacts; (c) all the data, including eye-blinks, are included as input and the output decisions are reported in all times including during eye-blink artefacts. Results: The true positive rates of one design of the LF-ASD (LF-ASD-V5) for case (c) and of another design (LF-ASD-V4) for case (b) are 40.5% and 42.4%, respectively, for false positive rates of 1%. Conclusions: The true positive rates of LF-ASD-V5 when eye-blinks are included in the analysis deteriorate slightly compared to when the output during eye-blink artefacts is inactivated in LF-ASD-V4. Significance: LF-ASD-V5 allows the device-to be functional at all times and can handle artefacts better than LF-ASD-V4. If a slight decrease in true positive rates is acceptable, no further devices are needed to record the electro-oculogram (EOG) for detecting eye-blinks.

If the ability to do so were a form of sensory transduction, one would expect that fields could trigger evoked potentials, as do other sensory stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by examining electroencephalograms from 17 subjects for the presence of evoked potentials caused by the onset and by the offset of 2 G, 60 Hz (a field strength comparable to that in the general environment). Both linear (time averaging) and nonlinear (recurrence analysis) methods of data analysis were employed to permit an assessment of the dynamical nature of the stimulus/response relationship. Using the method of recurrence analysis, magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) in the signals from occipital derivations were found in 16 of the subjects (P < 0.05 for each subject). The potentials occurred 109-454 ms after stimulus application, depending on the subject, and were triggered by onset of the field, offset of the field, or both. Using the method of time averaging, no MEPs were detected. MEPs in the signals from the central and parietal electrodes were found in most subjects using recurrence analysis, but no MEPs were detected using time averaging. The occurrence of MEPs in response to a weak magnetic field suggested the existence of a human magnetic sense. In distinction to the evoked potentials ordinarily studied, MEPs were nonlinearly related to the stimulus as evidenced by the need to employ a nonlinear method to detect the responses. (c) 2006 IBRO.

Quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane mask induction	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							BISPECTRAL INDEX; SPECTRAL ENTROPY; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; ANESTHESIA; SEIZURES; EEG; PROPOFOL; PATIENT; ABNORMALITIES; FREQUENCY	Background: Sevoflurane may induce epileptiform electroencephalographic activity leading to unstable Bispectral Index numbers, underestimating the hypnotic depth of anesthesia. The authors developed a method for the quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia. Methods: Electroencephalographic data from 60 patients under sevoflurane mask induction were used in the analysis. Electroencephalographic data were visually classified. A novel electroencephalogram-derived quantity, wavelet subband entropy (WSE), was developed. WSE variables were calculated from different frequency bands. Performance of the WSE in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity and the ability of the WSE to recognize misleading Bispectral Index readings caused by epileptiform activity were evaluated. Results: Two WSE variables were found to be sufficient for the quantification of epileptiform activity: WSE from the frequency bands 4-16 and 16-32 Hz. The lower frequency band was used for monophasic pattern monitoring, and the higher frequency band was used for spike activity monitoring. WSE values of the lower and higher bands followed the time evolution of epileptiform activity with prediction probabilities of 0.809 (SE, 0.007) and 0.804 (SE, 0.007), respectively. In deep anesthesia with epileptiform activity, WSE detected electroencephalographic patterns causing Bispectral index readings greater than 60, with event sensitivity of 97.1%. Conclusions: The developed method proved useful in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the future, it may improve the understanding of electroencephalogram-derived information by assisting in recognizing misleading readings of depth-of-anesthesia monitors. The method also may assist in minimizing the occurrence of epileptiform activity and seizures during sevoflurane anesthesia.

Subjects learned to turn a steering-wheel according to a given trajectory in order to minimise the discrepancy between a changing foreground stimulus (controllable by the subjects) and a constant background stimulus (uncontrollable) for both the auditory and the visual modality. In the auditory condition, we uncovered a learning-related increase in inter-hemispheric phase locking between inferior parietal regions, suggesting that coupling between areas involved in audiomotor integration is augmented during early learning stages. Intra-hemispheric phase locking between motor and superior parietal areas increased in the left hemisphere as learning progressed, indicative of integrative processes of spatial information and movement execution. Further tests show a significant correlation of intra-hemispheric phase locking between the motor and the parietal area bilaterally and movement performance in the visual condition. These results suggest that the motor-parietal network is operative in the auditory and in the visual condition. This study confirms that a complex fronto-parietal network subserves learning of a new movement that requires sensorimotor transformation and demonstrates the importance of interregional coupling as a neural correlate for successful acquisition and implementation of externally guided behaviour.

Functional specificity of human hippocampal theta, however, is unclear. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded with a whole-head 275-channel magnetoencephalographic (MEG) system as healthy participants navigated to a hidden platform in a virtual reality Morris water maze. MEG data were analyzed for underlying oscillatory sources in the 4-8 Hz band using a spatial filtering technique (i.e., synthetic aperture magnetometry). Source analyses revealed greater theta activity in the left anterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices during goal-directed navigation relative to aimless movements in a sensorimotor control condition. Additional analyses showed that left anterior hippocampal activity was predominantly observed during the first one-half of training, pointing to a role for this region in early learning. Moreover, posterior hippocampal theta was highly correlated with navigation performance, with the former accounting for 76% of the variance of the latter. Our findings suggest human spatial learning is dependent on hippocampal and parahippocampal theta oscillations, extending to humans a significant body of research demonstrating such a pivotal role for hippocampal theta in animal navigation.

The precise nature of this interaction, however, is poorly understood. A positive correlation between BOLD-response and cortically generated local field potentials, which reflect the weighted average of synchronized dentrosomatic components of pyramidal synaptic signals, has been demonstrated. Likewise, positive BOLD-responses have been reported in conjunction with scalp-recorded synchronized electromagnetic activity by a number of groups. However, it is not yet clear how the opposite electromagnetic pattern, i.e. cortical clesynchronization, is related to the BOLD signal. To address this question, we conducted a combined event-related fMRl and 275 sensor whole-head MEG study during identical visual two-choice reaction time task conditions in 10 human subjects. We found complex sequences of MEG-synchronization and desynchronization across a wide frequency range in the visual and motor area in close correspondence with "locales" of positive BOLD-responses. These results indicate that a correspondence of positive BOLD-responses is not exclusively found for cortical synchronization but also for desynchronization, suggesting that the relationship between BOLD signals and electromagnetic activity might be more complex than previously thought.

Methods: We estimated the functional networks in the frequency domain from a set of high-resolution EEG data in a group of healthy subjects during the showing of commercial spots within a neutral documentary. We evaluated the differences in the cortical network associated with later remembered and not-remembered commercials by calculating the global-E-g and local-efficiency E-l indexes. Results: Successful encoding of TV spots significantly affects the functional communication among cortical areas irrespectively of the frequency band. During the visualization of the video-clips that will be forgotten (FRG), the cortical network exhibited high values of global- and local-efficiency, reflecting a small-world configuration. During the visualization of the video-clips that will be remembered (RMB), the same indexes appeared significantly lower. This difference was especially evident for E-l in the alpha band and for E-g in the beta and gamma bands. Conclusions: The presence of attentional and semantic processes during the RMB condition leads to a significant reduction of the network communication efficiency. Significance: Such a reduction could represent a predictive measure of accurate recalls of TV spots. (c) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It has been suggested that this coherence in activity is a signature of functional integration of multimodal neuronal networks. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-established technique for non-invasive cortical stimulation. Its modulating effects outlast the train of stimulation and affect behavior. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cortico-cortical coherence between distant brain areas can be selectively enhanced by synchronous bifocal rTMS. Cortico-cortical coherence was assessed in 16 healthy human subjects before and after three trains of synchronous high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS to the left primary motor cortex and the visual cortex at the occipital pole simultaneously. Stimulation of the left M1 alone served as the control condition. Coherence and spectral power were measured between these areas on the stimulated and the homologue contralateral side. Synchronous bifocal rTMS induced an increase of interregional coupling in the alpha and lower beta band on the stimulated side without effects on spectral power. These data indicate that synchronous bifocal rTMS is a feasible technique for selective modulation of interregional EEG coherence. Furthermore, they raise the hypothesis that interventional enhancement of long-range coherence may effectively modulate interregional integration with behavioral consequences.

The present study offers a new method to compute traveling alpha waves using the center of mass algorithm. Electroencephalographic alpha waves are oscillations with a characteristic frequency range and reactivity to closed eyes. Several lines of evidence derived from qualitative observations suggest that the alpha waves represent a spreading wave process with specific trajectories in the human brain. We found that during a certain alpha wave peak recorded with 30 electrodes the trajectory starts and ends in distinct regions of the brain, mostly frontal-occipital, frontal-frontal, or occipital-frontal, but the position of the trajectory at the time in which the maximal positivity of the alpha wave occurs has a definite position near the central regions. Thus we observed that the trajectory always crossed around the central zones, traveling from one region to another region of the brain. A similar trajectory pattern was observed for different alpha wave peaks in one alpha burst, and in different subjects, with a mean velocity of 2.1 +/- 0.29 m/s. We found that all our results were clear and reproducible in all of the subjects. To our knowledge, the present method documents the first explicit description of a spreading wave process with a singular pattern in the human brain in terms of the center of mass algorithm.

Alterations in information processing in PFC may partly underlie schizophrenia symptoms. Methods: The 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI and antipsychotic drugs were administered to anesthetized rats. Single unit and local field potential (LFP) extracellular recordings were made in medial PFC (mPFC). Electrolytic lesions were performed in the thalamic nuclei. Results: DOI markedly disrupts cellular and network activity in rat PFC. DOI altered pyramidal discharge in mPFC (39% excited, 27% inhibited, 34% unaffected; n = 51). In all instances,DOI concurrently reduced low-frequency oscillations (.3-4 Hz; power spectrum: .25 +/- .02 and .14 +/- 01 mu V-2 in basal conditions and after 50-300 mu g/kg intravenous (IV) DOI, respectively; n = 51). Moreover, DOI disrupted the temporal association between the active phase of LFP and pyramidal discharge. Both effects were reversed by M100907 (5-HT2A receptor antagonist) and were not attenuated by thalamic lesions, supporting an intracortical origin of the effects of DOI. The reduction in low-frequency oscillations induced by DOI was significantly reversed by the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol (.1-.2 mg/kg IV) and clozapine (I mg/kg IV). Conclusions: DOI disorganizes network activity in PFC, reducing low-frequency oscillations and desynchronizing pyramidal discharge from active phases of LFP. These effects may underlie DOI's psychotomimetic action. The reversal by clozapine and haloperidol indicates that antipsychotic drugs may reduce psychotic symptoms by normalizing an altered PFC function.	[Celada, Pau; Puig, M.

To contribute to a better understanding of the neurophysiological underpinnings of habituation in auditory processing and its disturbance in schizophrenia we used three different approaches to analyze auditory evoked responses, namely phase-locking (PL) analyses, single trial amplitudes, and averaged event-related potentials (P50 and N100). Given that brain oscillations reflect the neuronal correlates of information processing we hypothesized that PL and amplitudes reflect even more essential parts of auditory processing than the averaged ERP responses. In 32 schizophrenia patients and 32 matched controls EEG was continuously recorded using an auditory paired click paradigm. PL of the lower frequency bands (alpha and theta) was significantly reduced in patients whereas no significant differences were present in higher frequencies (gamma and beta). Alpha and theta PL and amplitudes showed a marked increase after the first click and to a minor degree after the second one. This habituation was more prominent in controls whereas in schizophrenia patients the response to both clicks differed only slightly. N100 suppression was significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients whereas no group differences were present with respect to the P50. This corresponded to the finding that Gamma mostly contributed to the prediction of the P50 response and theta mostly to the N100 response. Our data showed that analyzing phase and amplitude in single trials provides more information on auditory information processing and reflects differences between schizophrenia patients and controls better than analyzing the averaged ERP responses.

We now investigate the effect of intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid, as another model of temporal lobe epilepsy, focusing on epileptogenesis, spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), and the transition from basal to SWD states in GAERS. The EEG was recorded from the hippocampus and cortex of adult GAERS and Wistar rats before kainic acid injections into the basolateral amygdala and for 3 months thereafter. EEG and video recordings monitored SWDs and convulsive seizures. We analyzed spectral changes of the EEG during kainic acid-induced status epilepticus, SWDs, for 10s before (silent period) and for 2s before (transition period) SWDs. After the injection of kainic acid, all animals experienced convulsive seizures for at least 3 h. The first convulsive seizure was significantly delayed in GAERS compared with Wistar rats. SWDs and increases in power of the delta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges during the transition period disappeared after the kainic acid injection for 1-3 d and gradually reappeared. Power increases in the delta and alpha ranges were significantly correlated with the number of SWDs, in the beta and alpha ranges with their mean duration. Neo-Timm's staining at the end of experiments demonstrated that mossy fiber sprouting in GAERSis less pronounced than in Wistar rats. Our findings show that mechanisms underlying absence epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy interact with each other, although a site of this interaction remains to be defined.

Here we examined the response of two electrophysiological signals, the N170 ERP and induced gamma-band activity (>20 Hz), to face orientation and familiarity across two blocks, one in which the face identity was task-relevant and one in which it was not. N170 amplitude to inverted faces was higher than to upright faces and was not influenced by face familiarity or its task relevancy. In contrast, induced gamma activity was higher for upright than for inverted faces and for familiar than unfamiliar faces. The effect of face inversion was found in lower gamma frequency band (25-50 Hz), whereas familiarity affected amplitudes in higher gamma frequency band (50-70 Hz). For gamma, the relevance of face identity to the task modulated both inversion and familiarity effects. These findings pinpoint three functionally dissociated neural mechanisms involved in face processing, namely, detection, configural analysis, and recognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: (a) Surface EEG-video monitoring in freely moving pups; (b) intracortical multiple unit activity (MUA) and local field potential recordings in 5- to 7-day-old rats after pharmacological inhibition of the glutamate transporters by DL-TBOA. Results: Glutamate transporters inhibition alters the background cortical electrical activity inducing a dominant and persistent pattern of bilateral recurrent paroxysmal bursts alternating with periods of hypoactivity and also partial seizures. Intracortical local field recordings show that paroxysmal bursts are associated with multiunits and gamma oscillations separated by periods of silence. This cortical activity involves the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and was not observed after kainate and pilocarpine administration. Conclusions: We show that a dysfunction of glutamate transporters in immature rats leads to a singular cortical activity that is reminiscent of a "suppression-burst" pattern. We propose that an early deficiency of glutamate transport may underlie some early onset epilepsies.

Region-specific changes in gamma and beta2 rhythms in NMDA receptor dysfunction models of schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; EEG; gamma; beta; inhibition; NMDA	NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; BAND ACTIVITY; INTERNEURONS; EXPRESSION; KETAMINE; NEURONS; SUBUNIT; CORTEX	Cognitive disruption in schizophrenia is associated with altered patterns of spatiotemporal interaction associated with multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands in cortex. In particular, changes in the generation of gamma (30-80 Hz) and beta2 (20-29 Hz) rhythms correlate with observed deficits in communication between different cortical areas. Aspects of these changes can be reproduced in animal models, most notably those involving acute or chronic reduction in glutamatergic synaptic communication mediated by N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In vitro electrophysiological and immunocytochemical approaches afforded by such animal models continue to reveal a great deal about the mechanisms underlying EEG rhythm generation and are beginning to uncover which basic molecular, cellular, and network phenomena may underlie their disruption in schizophrenia. Here we briefly review the evidence for changes in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and glutamatergic function and address the problem of region specificity of changes with quantitative comparisons of effects of ketamine on gamma and beta2 rhythms in vitro. We conclude, from available evidence, that many observed changes in markers for GABAergic function in schizophrenia may be secondary to deficits in NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity. Furthermore, the broad range of changes in cortical dynamics seen in schizophrenia-with contrasting effects seen in different brain regions and for different frequency bands-may be more directly attributable to underlying deficits in glutamatergic neuronal communication rather than GABAergic inhibition alone.

They believed the epileptogenic zone to be the "region of the beginning and the primary organization" of ictal discharges. The opinion of North American authors is different: the epileptogenic zone is the "what to remove area" to produce freedom from seizures. This surgical definition assumes postsurgical validation. The aim of this paper is to show how to define the epileptogenic zone from all the stereoelectroencephalographic recording data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.

Following an ERD that occurs shortly before and during the movement, bursts of beta oscillations (beta ERS) appear within a 1-s interval after movement offset. Such a post-movement beta ERS has been reported after voluntary hand movements, passive movements, movement imagination, and also after movements induced by functional electrical stimulation. The present study compares ERD/ERS patterns in paraplegic patients (suffering from a complete spinal cord injury) and healthy subjects during attempted (active) and passive foot movements. The aim of this work is to address the question, whether patients do have the same focal beta ERD/ERS pattern during attempted foot movement as healthy subjects do. The results showed midcentral-focused beta ERD/ERS patterns during passive, active, and imagined foot movements in healthy subjects. This is in contrast to a diffuse and broad distributed ERD/ERS pattern during attempted foot movements in patients. Only one patient showed a similar ERD/ERS pattern. Furthermore, no significant ERD/ERS patterns during passive foot movement in the group of the paraplegics could be found. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The replay is associated with a fast oscillation known as a dendritic sharp wave, which occurs as a ripple in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Here we propose a very simple dynamical firing rate neural model of this phenomenon based on balance of multiplicative feedback inhibition between the pyramidal cells and basket cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. This model accounts for the reverseness of the replayed re-activations as well as for some characteristics of the ripple oscillation. Furthermore we suggest the function of the replay itself is to perform a spatial remapping and therefore to form a cognitive map of the experienced environment. We illustrate this idea with the creation of a map where the place cell firing rate depends on distance to the replay location and which can therefore be used in spatial navigation to follow the shortest experienced path to a goal. As a second illustration we show how the model naturally accounts for splitter cells, which are cells whose response varies on the central arm of successive trials of an alternation task despite the fact that the environmental input is the same.

Recognition of point-light biological motion: Mu rhythms and mirror neuron activity	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; mirror neurons; mu rhythm	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; PERCEPTION; PREMOTOR; AREAS; EEG; IMITATION; MOVEMENT; PARIETAL	Changes in power in the mu frequency band (8-13 Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is thought to indirectly reflect the activity of mirror neurons in premotor cortex. Activation of these neurons by self-performed, observed or imagined motor actions is assumed to produce asynchronous firing and a reduction in mu rhythm oscillation (referred to as mu suppression) in sensorimotor cortex. A recent fMRI study by Saygin et al. [Saygin AP, Wilson SM, Hagler Jr DJ, Bates E, Sereno MI. Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex. J Neurosci 2004;24:6181-8] revealed that the premotor brain regions containing mirror-neurons are also activated in response to point-light human motion. The perceived movement of these light cues are integrated into one percept of a complete human action (e.g. jumping jacks), rather than seen as individual moving lights. The present study examined whether recruitment of the mirror neuron system, as reflected in mu rhythm suppression, mediates recognition of point-light biological motion. Changes in mu power were recorded while subjects viewed point-light biological motion videos, matched scrambled versions of these animations, and visual white-noise (baseline). The results revealed that point-light biological animations produced mu suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not. This supports the hypothesis that the mirror neuron system is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This motion aftereffect (MAE) is usually ascribed to short-term functional changes in cortical areas involved in visual motion analysis akin to adaptation. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we show increased global field activity due to the MAE which could mostly be explained by a dipole located near the putative location of human area MT+. We further demonstrate that the induced MAE is accompanied by a significant increase in gamma-band activity (GBA) recorded from parietooccipital cortex contralateral to the visual motion stimulus. This gamma oscillation most likely reflects an increase in neuronal response coherence due to decreased inhibition of a group of neurons with similar preferred direction, namely the direction opposite to the adapted one. A second focal GBA response was picked up by the most posterior sensors ipsilateral to the side of the stimulus, reflecting the size of the MAE, whose source could not be reliably located.

Observations on the cortical silent period in Parkinson's disease	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION-SUPPLEMENT			English	Article						TMS; oscillations; EMG; beta frequency; motor cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; EEG; MODULATION	Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool in the neurosciences to study motor functions and nervous disorders, amongst others. Single pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex lead to a so-called cortical silent period in the recording from the corresponding muscle, i.e. a period of similar to 100 ms with no muscle activity. We here show that in Parkinson's disease (PD), this cortical silent period in some cases is interrupted by short bursts of EMG activity. We describe in detail these interruptions in two patients with PD. These interruptions may number up to 3 per cortical silent period and show a consistent frequency across trials and hemispheres within a given patient; the two patients described here do differ, however, in the time-delay of the interruptions and hence the induced frequency. For one patient, the frequency of the interruptions proved to be around 13 Hz, the other patient showed a frequency of around 17 Hz. The results corroborate earlier findings of cortical oscillations elicited by pulses of TMS and may be related to abnormal oscillatory activity found in the cortical-subcortical motor system in PD.

Mapped clock oscillators as ring devices and their application to neuronal electrical rhythms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						complexity; coupled oscillators; electroencephalogram (EEG); neuronal assemblies; neuronal rhythms; nonlinear dynamics	POPULATION OSCILLATIONS; INTRINSIC OSCILLATIONS; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; DIMENSIONAL CHAOS; ROBUST CHAOS; FIRE MODEL; CA3; HIPPOCAMPUS; EXCITATION; DYNAMICS	The mapped clock oscillator (MCO) is a second-order, Winfree-type oscillator generating two instantaneous clock variables (amplitude and phase) that are mapped to an observable output variable (voltage) via a static nonlinearity. Two fundamental classes of ring devices are presented. Their respective dynamics give rise to two oscillator forms-the labile clock and the clock-which can be coupled together in various configurations to create higher-order systems with sufficient complexity to capture the dynamics of neuronal assemblies. To demonstrate the applicability of MCOs in modelling neuronal rhythms, a hippocampal network model of four coupled oscillators was constructed and shown to exhibit rhythmic activity of varying complexity, depending on model parameters. The dynamics of the network were quantified through estimation of the maximum lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension. Synthesis of complex neuronal rhythms may have therapeutic implications. The modular and efficient design of the MCO should facilitate the process of implementing coupled MCO networks in electronic hardware as potential neural prostheses for treating dynamic diseases such as epilepsy.

The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations.

Medial septal region as a target for modulation of seizure discharges in the hippocampus in a model of acute temporal lobe epilepsy	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						hippocampus; medial septum; elecrtoencephalogram; model of acute epilepsy; seizure discharges; delivery of GABA(A) and muscarinic receptor antagonists and agonists into the septum; septo-hippocampal interrelations	THETA-RHYTHM; SEPTOHIPPOCAMPAL GABA; CARBACHOL; NEURONS; ATROPINE; PATHWAY	Investigation of changes in the hippocampal EEG produced by GABAergic and cholinergic substances delivered into the medial septum region was performed in awake rabbits. Changes in the threshold of seizure discharges in the hippocampus evoked by perforant path stimulation (model of acute epilepsy) were also examined. Injections of GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist of cholinergic receptors carbacholine in low doses induced an increase in the power of delta- and theta modulation and appearance of 7-12-Hz oscillations. The threshold of hippocampal seizure afterdischarges decreased. In higher doses, these substances evoked 7-15-Hz oscillations followed by seizures. GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol and muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine decreased the power of the theta rhythm and increased the seizure threshold. Picrotoxin or carbacholine injected after muscimol or scopolamine, respectively, did not evoke seizures. Thus, we have shown the possibility to control hippocampal activity by local changes in the GABAergic and cholinergic systems of the medial septum region.

Effects of adolescent ethanol exposure on sleep in adult rats	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Adolescent; Cortex; EEG; Ethanol; Sleep; Slow-wave sleep	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; ADMISSION PREDICTS RELAPSE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PEAK ALPHA-FREQUENCY; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; C-FOS EXPRESSION; PRIMARY ALCOHOLICS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; SECONDARY DEPRESSION	Although adolescent ethanol (EtOH) exposure has been associated with long-lasting changes in brain function, little is known as to whether EtOH exposure during adolescence alters sleep and cortical arousal. This study examined protracted alterations in sleep in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence. Adolescent male Wistar rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 12 h/day for 5 weeks. Cortical electroencephalograms were obtained during 4-h recording sessions after 5 weeks of withdrawal from EtOH. Adolescent EtOH exposure significantly reduced the mean duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) episodes and the total amount of time spent in SWS in EtOH-exposed rats, compared to controls. Spectral analysis revealed that adolescent EtOH exposure significantly increased cortical peak frequencies during SWS in the 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 Hz bands. Taken together, our findings suggest that chronic EtOH exposure in adolescent rats reduces measures of SWS, ail effect also seen as part of normal aging. Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the consequences of EtOH exposure on the aging process are not known, the similarities between adolescent EtOH exposure and aging merits further investigation.

Contribution of the spectral analysis to the brain connectivity study by fMRI - Functional dissociation of supplementary motor area	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			French	Article						fMRI; spectral analysis; supplementary motor; area; motor; functional; connectivity	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BOLD HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TIME-RESOLVED FMRI; MACAQUE MONKEY; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; FINGER MOVEMENT; CORTICAL AREAS; ARM MOVEMENTS; IN-VIVO; PRE-SMA	Aim.- To validate, through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from spectral analysis of time series during a visuomotor task, a model of functional connectivity mainly constituted by the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the supplementary motor area proper (SMA-proper) and the primary motor cortex (M1). Materials and methods.- The paradigm that was tried out in young subjects (n = 5) consisted of a preparation task of motor movement. We firstly proceeded with an estimate in the frequency domain of coherency coefficients and values of phase shift between these three areas. Secondly, the estimated coherency coefficients were integrated to a model of functional connectivity. Two interaction coefficients were calculated, one for the related M1 and pre-SMA regions, the other one for the related M1 and SMA-proper regions. Results and conclusion.- Our results demonstrate hemodynamic activity that definitely occurred earlier in the pre-SMA area during the preparatory period of the task. In the same way, a more important interaction was found between M1 and pre-SMA areas, which corroborates the assumption of the prevalent role played by these two areas in the case of a preparation task of a motor movement. Thus, this study has allowed highlighting a functional dissociation between the two portions of the SMA. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, it has not been demonstrated that the power-law component can play an important role in human perceptual functions. Here, we demonstrate that the power spectrum of magnetoencephalograph recordings of brain activity varies in coordination with perception of subthreshold visual stimuli. We observed that perceptual performance could be better explained by modulation of the power-law component than by modulation of the peak power in particular narrow frequency ranges. The results suggest that the brain operates in a state of self-organized criticality, modulating the power spectral exponent of its activity to optimize its internal state for response to external stimuli.

J	Miller, R				Miller, Robert			Theory of the normal waking EEG: From single neurones to waveforms in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency ranges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma; beta; alpha; paired pulse; up-state; down-state	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; APICAL DENDRITES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; POTENTIALS; NEOCORTEX; PATTERNS; CURRENTS; CELLS	The classic alpha rhythm, recorded intracortically, consists of alternating surface-negative troughs and briefer surface-positive peaks. The troughs are associated with neuronal hyperpolarization, the peaks with brief depolarization and burst firing. Each hyperpolarization is mainly a potassium potential, lasting similar to 100 ms. Depolarization and burst firing arise when this inactivates. In the desynchronized state, membrane potential is poised just below threshold. Firing in vivo is somewhat irregular and non-bursting. It is suggested that EEG bistability (classic alpha vs desynchronization) corresponds to bistability of single pyramidal cells. In vitro, paired pulses lead to depression of synaptic transmission in synapses linking two pyramidal cells, but to facilitation in synapses linking pyramidal cells to inhibitory neurones. These effects should be recruited by burst firing in vivo. Thus, enhancement of inhibitory and excitatory transmission occur respectively during the classic alpha rhythm, and the desynchronized state. As a result both states tend to be self-sustaining. In the desynchronized state high frequency (gamma or beta) activity predominates. In simulations, gamma activity has been modeled as the behaviour of cortical networks where populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurones interact. These simulations assume conduction times between neurones to be negligible. However, this is not true for long-distance interactions. Introduction into the models of plausible conduction delays should slow the oscillation frequency. The activated cortex can then produce not only gamma activity but also beta, and sometimes alpha activity. Thus, alpha frequencies can arise both in the "idling" cortex (classic alpha), and in the activated cortex, although the respective mechanisms are quite different. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Brain activity modeling in general anesthesia: Enhancing local mean-field models using a slow adaptive firing rate	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							VOLATILE ANESTHETICS; SYNAPTIC CONDUCTANCES; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; PURKINJE-CELLS; IN-VITRO; NEURONS; SLEEP; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION	In this paper, an enhanced local mean-field model that is suitable for simulating the electroencephalogram (EEG) in different depths of anesthesia is presented. The main building elements of the model (e.g., excitatory and inhibitory populations) are taken from Steyn-Ross [M. L. Steyn-Ross , Phys. Rev. E 64, 011917 (2001), D. A. Steyn-Ross , Phys. Rev. E 64, 011918 (2001)] and Bojak and Liley [I. Bojak and D. T. Liley, Phys. Rev. E 71, 041902 (2005)] mean-field models and a new slow ionic mechanism is included in the main model. Generally, in mean-field models, some sigmoid-shape functions determine firing rates of neural populations according to their mean membrane potentials. In the enhanced model, the sigmoid function corresponding to excitatory population is redefined to be also a function of the slow ionic mechanism. This modification adapts the firing rate of neural populations to slow ionic activities of the brain. When an anesthetic drug is administered, the slow mechanism may induce neural cells to alternate between two levels of activity referred to as up and down states. Basically, the frequency of up-down switching is in the delta band (0-4 Hz) and this is the main reason behind high amplitude, low frequency fluctuations of EEG signals in anesthesia. Our analyses show that the enhanced model may have different working states driven by anesthetic drug concentration. The model is settled in the up state in the waking period, it may switch to up and down states in moderate anesthesia while in deep anesthesia it remains in the down state.

Methods: A proportional feedback stimulation system was designed. Penicillin-induced episodic seizures were created in rat primary motor cortex. Both intracranial (proximal to seizure focus) and extracranial EEGs were monitored. Current stimulation was applied at the seizure focus by using the intracranial EEG as the current-stimulus template. Different gains (H) for determining feedback stimulus amplitudes were tested. Results: The effect of feedback stimulation on seizures was initially assessed by measuring change in variance of the amplitude histogram of the intracranial EEG before and during stimulation. Mean reduction in amplitude variance during seizure activity was significant, with variance during stimulation progressively reduced as feedback gain was increased, indicating that overall suppression of seizure amplitude depended on H. Further increases in feedback gain typically produced saturating oscillations, indicating that this level of H resulted in instability. Frequency analysis of seizure and stimulation periods for each of the effective levels of H demonstrated close correlation across a large frequency domain, suggesting that the reduction in EEG seizure amplitude during feedback stimulation was possibly because of shunting of neuronal currents near electrodes as opposed to an alteration of neuronal dynamics. Although the frequency and energy responses during seizures before or during feedback stimulation remained well correlated in the delta band, this correlation progressively decreased across the theta, alpha, and beta bands. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that proportional feedback stimulation holds the promise of suppressing seizure activity. More-complicated control algorithms for generating feedback stimulation may provide further improvements in seizure suppression.

Electrical activity at very low and very high frequencies, beyond the practical range of scalp EEG, can be recorded subdurally and may contain considerable information not available non-invasively. The recording and stimulating procedures for using chronically implanted subdural electrodes to localize the epileptogenic zone and map eloquent functions of the human cortex are well established, and complication rates are low. Complications include infections, CSF leak, and focal neurologic deficits, all of which tend to be increased with a higher number of electrodes and longer duration of recordings. Careful consideration of the risks and benefits should be coupled with a firm hypothesis about the epileptogenic zone derived from the non-invasive components of the epilepsy workup to guide the decision about whether and where to implant subdural electrodes. When they are employed to answer a specific question in an individual patient, subdural electrodes can optimize the clinical outcome of a candidate for epilepsy surgery.

TRANSITION TO ICTAL ACTIVITY IN TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY: INSIGHTS FROM MACROSCOPIC MODELS	COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE IN EPILEPSY			English	Article; Book Chapter							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; KAINIC ACID MODEL; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; BRAIN-STIMULATION; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; BASIC MECHANISMS; IN-VIVO; NETWORKS	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of partial epilepsy. It is characterized by recurrent seizures originating from one or several areas of the temporal cortex and propagating through interconnected neuronal networks within and outside the temporal lobe. Although there is current evidence that seizures are related to abnormal excessive firing and synchronization of neurons, little is known about the precise basic mechanisms underlying human epileptic seizures and mechanisms of transitions from normal to paroxysmal activity. This chapter presents some insights into transition mechanisms to ictal activity in human TLE that can be drawn from a macroscopic modeling approach that developed over the three past decades. The term 'macroscopic' relates to the modeling level. Indeed, relevant variables in considered models describe the average activity of interconnected subpopulations of principal neurons and interneurons without explicit representation of mechanisms lying at the level of single cells, conversely to biologically-inspired detailed models. Although macroscopic, these models rely on neurophysiological data and have two essential features. First, their parameters relate to excitatory and inhibitory processes taking place in the considered neuronal tissue. Second, the temporal dynamics of their output is analogous to a field activity, allowing for direct comparison with real electroencephalographic signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes (depth-EEG, stereotaxic method) during presurgical evaluation of patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. The chapter provides a historical perspective about macroscopic models and describes their theoretical bases. A model-based interpretation of depth-EEG signals recorded during the transition to ictal activity is illustrated and discussed.

Ketamine increases the frequency of electroencephalographic bicoherence peak on the alpha spindle area induced with propofol	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthetics i.v., ketamine; monitoring, depth of anaesthesia; monitoring, electroencephalogrophy; neurophysiology; sleep	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; THALAMIC RELAY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MODEL; MECHANISMS; ANESTHESIA; ISOFLURANE; FEEDBACK; SLOW	Background. The reticular and thalamocortical system is known to play a prominent role in spindle wave activity, and the spindle wave is related to the sedative effects of anaesthetics. Recently, bispectral analysis of the EEG has been developed as a better method to indicate nonlinear regulation including the thalamocortical system linking to the cortical area. In the present study, in order to explore the interference of ketamine with the nonlinear regulation of the sub-cortical system, we examined the effect of ketamine on spindle at waves through the bispectral analysis. Methods. The study included 21 patients. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using a propofol-TCI system (target-controlled infusion, with target concentration 3.5 mu g ml(-1)). An A-2000 BIS monitor was used and the raw EEG signals were collected via an RS232 interface on a personal computer. Bicoherence, the normalized bispectrum, and power spectrum were analysed before and after i.v. administration of I mg kg(-1) racemic ketamine. Results. Propofol caused a peaks in both power and bicoherence spectra, with average frequencies of 10.6 (SD 0.9) Hz and 10.7 (1.0) Hz, respectively. The addition of ketamine significantly shifted each peak to frequencies of 14.4 (1.4) Hz and 13.6 (1.5) Hz, respectively [P < 0.05, mean (SD)]. Conclusions. Ketamine shifted the a peaks of bicoherence induced by propofol to higher frequencies. This suggests that ketamine changes the a spindle rhythms through the modulation of the nonlinear sub-cortical reverberating network.

Related emotional reactions to the music were studied using Principal Component Analysis of validated reports, fMRI, and EEG coherent activity. A piano selection by Bach and a symphonic passage from Mahler widely differing in musical features were used as pleasing pieces. A segment by Prodromides was used as an unpleasing stimulus. Ten consecutive 30 s segments of each piece alternating with random static noise were played to 19 non-musician volunteers for a total of 30 min of auditory stimulation. Both brain approaches identified a left cortical network involved with pleasant feelings (Bach and Mahler vs. Prodromides) including the left primary auditory area, posterior temporal, inferior parietal and prefrontal regions. While the primary auditory zone may provide an early affective quality, left cognitive areas may contribute to pleasant feelings when melodic sequences follow expected rules. In contrast, unpleasant emotions (Prodromides vs. Bach and Mahler) involved the activation of the right frontopolar and paralimbic areas. Left activation with pleasant and right with unpleasant musical feelings is consistent with right supremacy in novel situations and left in predictable processes. When all musical excerpts were jointly compared to noise, in addition to bilateral auditory activation, the left temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, and frontopolar area were activated suggesting that cognitive and language processes were recruited in general responses to music. Sensory and cognitive integration seems required for musical emotion. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown that procedures presumably leading to local plastic changes in the cerebral cortex can lead to local changes in SWA during subsequent sleep. To further investigate the connection between cortical plasticity and sleep SWA, in this study we used a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which median nerve stimuli were followed at different intervals (25 or 10 ms) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to the contralateral cortical hand area. As expected, such a protocol led to a sustained increase (long-term potentiation-like) or decrease (long-term depression-like) of cortical excitability as measured by motor evoked potentials. By using a TMS-compatible high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) system, we also found that, in individual subjects, TMS-evoked cortical responses over sensorimotor cortex changed with different interstimulus intervals. Moreover, during subsequent sleep, SWA increased locally in subjects whose TMS-evoked cortical responses had increased after PAS, and decreased in subjects whose cortical responses had decreased. Changes in TMS- evoked cortical EEG response and change in sleep SWA were localized to similar cortical regions and were positively correlated. Together, these results suggest that changes in cortical excitability in opposite directions lead to corresponding changes in local sleep regulation, as reflected by SWA, providing evidence for a tight relationship between cortical plasticity and sleep intensity.

Investigations are based oil concept of academic M.N. Livanov about special role of spatial-temporal relations of brain potentials oscillations of various brain areas in providing of functional connection between them. It is shown, that in rest condition the structure of interregional relations of cortex biopotentials in all healthy people is characterized by high spatial orderliness that obviously assists to optimal realization of informational processes during various functional conditions from rest to complex cognitive functions. Special attention is given for the problem of functional signigicance of phase shifts of EEG waves. Data, that allows concluding that brainstem and thalamocartical integrative systems are characterized with relatively small inherited and phenotypic variability whereas fiber systems of both hemispheres that provide processes of intercortical integration are characterized by more expressed inter-individual variability, is presented. Intensive development of long associative and commissural tracks of telencephalon that joined even the most distanced cortical regions of hemispheres in united formation apparently results in formation of morpho-functional "skeleton" of neocortex, that occurred to be the basis for origin of qualitatively new (in comparison to animals) principals of formation of system organization of integral activity of the brain. Existence of long mono- and oligo-synaptic connections provides conditions for correlative development in ontogenesis of new function that is not conditioned by phylogenetic development.

Event-related cortical dynamics of soldiers during shooting as a function of varied task demand	AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; event-related spectral perturbation; theta; alpha; shooting performance; cognitive workload	MENTAL WORKLOAD; EEG; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PATTERNS; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; MARKSMEN; ARCHERS; FLIGHT	Introduction: Cortical dynamics of soldiers were examined during a reactive shooting task under varied task demands to investigate the effects of cognitive load on functional states of soldiers in real-time. Methods: Task demand factors consisted of task load (single, dual), decision load (no-decision, choice-decision), and target-exposure time (short, long). The Dismounted Infantryman Survivability and Lethality Testbed (DISALT) shooting simulator was programmed to generate the eight shooting scenarios and record weapon aim-point data while EEG was acquired continuously during each scenario. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was derived from single-trial data time-locked to the onsets of targets and peak amplitude and latency measures were analyzed in theta (4-7 Hz) and upper alpha (11-13 Hz) frequency bands. Results:The results are as follows: 1) a stimulus-evoked ERSP theta peak exhibited higher amplitude in the parietal region for choice- vs. no-decision scenarios and longer latency in the right central and temporal regions for dual- vs. single-task scenarios; and 2) ERSP alpha exhibited a progressive increase following the onset of targets with less of an increase in the left central region for dual- vs. single-task scenarios. Discussion: ERSP theta synchronization reflects stimulus encoding and exhibits increased peak power with more complex decision demands and longer latency with secondary task demands, whereas ERSP alpha synchronization reflects motor preparation and exhibits less of an increase with secondary task demands during reactive target shooting tasks. This research contributes the first study of cortical dynamics of soldiers performing a reactive shooting task and has implications for theories of attention and cognitive workload, human factors engineering, and soldier performance.

PPARs play a critical role in lipid and glucose metabolism. We examined whether chronic treatment with bezafibrate, a PPAR agonist, would alter sleep and body temperature (BT). Mice fed with a control diet were monitored for BT, electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram for 48 h under light-dark conditions. After obtaining the baseline recording, the mice were provided with bezafibrate-supplemented food for 2 wk, after which the same recordings were performed. Two-week feeding of bezafibrate decreased BT, especially during the latter half of the dark period. BT rhythm and sleep/wake rhythm were phase advanced about 2-3 h by bezafibrate treatment. Bezafibrate treatment also increased the EEG delta-power in nonrapid eye movement sleep compared with the control diet attenuating its daily amplitude. Furthermore, bezafibrate-treated mice showed no rebound of EEG delta-power in nonrapid eye movement sleep after 6 h sleep deprivation, whereas values in control mice largely increased relative to baseline. DNA microarray, and real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that bezafibrate treatment increased levels of Neuropeptide Y mRNA in the hypothalamus at both Zeitgeber time (ZT) 10 and ZT22, and decreased proopiomelanocortin-alpha mRNA in the hypothalamus at ZT10. These findings demonstrate that PPARs participate in the control of both BT and sleep regulation, which accompanied changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus. Activation of PPARs may enhance deep sleep and improve resistance to sleep loss.

Usually, to find out whether a patient is sensitive, he/she is stimulated visually with, e.g. a stroboscopic light stimulus at variable frequency and intensity until a photo paroxysmal response (PPR) occurs. The research described in this work aims to find whether photosensitivity can be detected without provoking a PPR. Methods: Twenty-two subjects, 15 with known photosensitivity, were stimulated with visual stimuli that did not provoke a PPR. Using an "evoked response representation", 18 features were analytically derived from EEG signals. Single- and multi-feature classification paradigms were applied to extract those features that separate best subjects with PSE from controls. Results: Two variables in the "evoked response representation", a frequency term and a goodness of fit term to a particular template, appeared to be best suited to make a prediction about the photosensitivity of a subject. Conclusions: Evoked responses appear to carry information about potential PSE. Significance: This result can be useful for screening patients for photosensitivity and it may also help to assess in a quantitative way the effectiveness of medical therapy.

Ablation of Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 potassium channels disrupts thalamocortical oscillations in vitro and in vivo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						parvalbumin; fast-spiking interneurons; thalamic reticular nucleus; spindle waves; rhythmic rebound bursts; cortical activation	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; MICE LACKING; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; MOUSE-BRAIN; DELTA-OSCILLATIONS; FAST-SPIKING; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC ACTIVATION; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; NEOCORTICAL INTERNEURONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS	The genes Kcnc1 and Kcnc3 encode the subunits for the fast-activating/fast-deactivating, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv3.1 and Kv3.3, which are expressed in several brain regions known to be involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. When these genes are genetically eliminated, Kv3.1/Kv3.3-deficient mice display severe sleep loss as a result of unstable slow-wave sleep. Within the thalamocortical circuitry, Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits are highly expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which is thought to act as a pacemaker at sleep onset and to be involved in slow oscillatory activity ( spindle waves) during slow-wave sleep. We showed that in cortical electroencephalographic recordings of freely moving Kv3.1/Kv3.3-deficient mice, spectral power is reduced up to 70% at frequencies < 15 Hz. In addition, the number of sleep spindles in vivo as well as rhythmic rebound firing of TRN neurons in vitro is diminished in mutant mice. Kv3.1/Kv3.3-deficient TRN neurons studied in vitro show similar to 60% increase in action potential duration and a reduction in high-frequency firing after depolarizing current injections and during rebound burst firing. The results support the hypothesis that altered electrophysiological properties of TRN neurons contribute to the reduced EEG power at slow frequencies in the thalamocortical network of Kv3-deficient mice.

Parametric spectral analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of excitatory synaptic currents	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR DESENSITIZATION; POSTSYNAPTIC CURRENTS; CHANNEL PROPERTIES; TIME-SERIES; CLEFT; EEG; ACETYLCHOLINE; TRANSMISSION; KINETICS	We assessed on Monte-Carlo simulated excitatory post-synaptic currents the ability of autoregressive (AR)-model fitting to evaluate their fluctuations. AR-model fitting consists of a linear filter describing the process that generates the fluctuations when driven with a white noise. Its fluctuations provide a filtered version of the signal and have a spectral density depending on the properties of the linear filter. When the spectra of the non-stationary fluctuations of excitatory post-synaptic currents were estimated by fitting AR-models to the segments of current fluctuations, assumed to be stationary and independent, the parameter and spectral estimates were scattered. The scatter was much reduced if the time-variant AR-models were fitted using stochastic adaptive estimators (Kalman, recursive least squares and least mean squares). The ability of time-variant AR-models to accurately fit the current fluctuations was monitored by comparing the fluctuations with predicted fluctuations, and by evaluating the model-learning rate. The median frequency of current fluctuations, which could be rapidly tracked and estimated from the individual quantal events (either Monte-Carlo simulated or recorded from pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus), rose during the rise phase, before declining to a lower steady-state level during the decay phase of quantal event, whereas the variance showed a broad peak. The closing rate of AMPA channels directly affects the steady-state median frequency, whereas the transient peak can be modulated by a variety of factors-number of molecules released, ability of glutamate molecules to re-enter the synaptic cleft, diffusion constant of glutamate in the cleft and opening rate of AMPA channels. In each case, the effect on the amplitude and decay time of mEPSCs and on the current fluctuations differs. Each factor thus leaves its own kinetic fingerprint arguing that the contribution of such factors can be inferred from the combined kinetic properties of individual mEPSCs.	[Glavinovic, M.

Prestimulus EEG alpha activity reflects prestimulus top-down processing	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						inhibition; P3 latency; prestimulus alpha activity; reaction time; top-down processing	TERM-MEMORY TASK; REACTION-TIME; DETECTION PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; STIMULUS ONSET; P3 LATENCY; PHASE; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION	In order to test the hypothesis that prestimulus alpha activity reflects top-down inhibitory processing, EEG was recorded from 16 subjects performing a color and a shape discrimination task. Both tasks required the inhibition of the task-irrelevant feature. Longer reaction times and P3 latencies showed that the shape task was more difficult than the color task. We suppose that these different task-difficulties are due to a higher salience of the color feature as compared to the shape feature. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher prestimulus total alpha activity in the shape task than the color task. We concluded that the inhibition of the more salient color feature in the shape task resulted in enhanced prestimulus alpha activity. Such a relationship between prestimulus alpha and poststimulus performance implies that prestimulus alpha reflects prestimulus top-down processing for preparing subsequent task-performance. Since we observed the 'task' effect of prestimulus alpha activity also in reaction times and in P3 latencies, prestimulus alpha seems to predict such poststimulus responses. Consequently, prestimulus ongoing alpha activity probably reflects top-down information and modulates subsequent poststimulus responses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to investigate the change of neural dynamics in bipolar disorder, we used a new nonlinear measurement "similarity index" to analyze the magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and test the hypothesis that there are synchronization changes within different frequency bands in the frontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder. Ten patients with bipolar I disorder during euthymic phase and ten normal controls underwent 2 min eye-closed resting recording with a whole-head 306-channel MEG system. Eleven channels of MEG data from frontal area were selected for analysis. Synchronization level in the delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-24 Hz) bands was calculated for each subject and compared across group. The results showed that significant dynamic changes in bipolar patients can be characterized by increased synchronization of slow frequency oscillations (delta) and decreased synchronization of fast frequency oscillations (beta). Furthermore, the positive correlation between beta synchronization level and preservative errors in Wisconcin Card sorting task was found which would implicate the deficit of executive function in bipolar patients. Out findings indicate that analysis of spontaneous MEG recordings at resting state using nonlinear dynamic approaches may disclose the Subtle regional changes of neural dynamics in BD.

Dynamics of clinical, neurophysiological and radiological indices as a criterion for evaluation of treatment quality of symptomatic epilepsy with keppra and topamax	ZHURNAL NEVROLOGII I PSIKHIATRII IMENI S S KORSAKOVA			Russian	Article						keppra; topamax; symptomatic epilepsy; 'urgent care mode'	MONOTHERAPY; LEVETIRACETAM; FORMS; CARBAMAZEPINE; TOPIRAMATE	A comparative analysis of treatment with keppra and topamax of various types of epilepsy has been carried out in 37 patients aged from 1 to 35 years. Symptomatic temporal-frontal-lobe epilepsy was diagnosed in 22 patients, symptomatic temporal lobe epilepsy in 15 including "urgent aid" cases with previous antiepileptic therapy being ineffective. Effect of the drugs on the cerebral blood flow was studied with the single proton emission CT. Keppra treatment was assigned to 20 patients in dosages varying from 500 to 2,500 mg (30-50 mg/kg/daily) for single intake. Then the patients received the drug two times daily under the clinical and EEG control. The drug was tested for using in the "urgent care mode". The clinical effect by 43% decreasing (p < 0,001) of seizures was observed in the first 12 h. The "stability state" was 80% after 8 months of the treatment. Topamax was administered to 17 patients in two dosages depending on patient's age and weight starting with 25-50 mg (from 3 to 12,5 mg/kg/daily) with the dose adjustment during 2 days. The latter was depended on the dynamics of clinical data and EEG. For the first 2 days, patients revealed changes in seizures quality: the seizure structure became less complex, without generalized seizures, and period of a seizure was shorter. Reduction of seizures frequency was observed on the 7-10(th) day and made up on average 73,9% (p < 0,01). Comparing to keppra, topamax did not cause signs of autonomic and psychological discomfort. Generalized seizures became less frequent by the V day.

Theta phase locking across the neocortex reflects cortico-hippocampal recursive communication during goal conflict resolution. Int. J. Psychophysiol. 60, 260-2731 in the context of theory linked with animal hippocampal theta [GrayJA., McNaughton, N., 2000. The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal system, 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford]. Here, the hypothesis that human EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) may also be a natural analogue to animal hippocampal theta is tested. Participants engaged in a monitoring task where the object was to press a response key immediately after presentation of 4 individual, non-repeating, single integer odd digits. These were presented amongst a continuous stream of single integer digits and Xs. EEG recorded in the earlier study were reanalysed; this time extracting alpha power and coherence from the same 34 participants. Alpha had a different profile to theta and was not primarily related to goal conflict. Low alpha (8-10 Hz) coherence consistently increased at electrodes close to primary sensorimotor cortex; particularly during response execution and response inhibition. The coherence analysis revealed that high alpha (10-12 Hz) related to response execution. Supplementary analyses demonstrated widespread high alpha coherence increase during response execution, inhibition and preparation. These data were discussed within the context of motor driven 'classic alpha' and Rolandic mu. A coherence profile which differentiated response execution and response inhibition was proposed to reflect a working memory network which was activated during response execution. Also, alpha power (8-12 Hz) reduced at several central electrodes during response execution. This reflected classic Rolandic mu response. Participants displaying a predicted low alpha power trend had the fastest response times; this was linked with traditional views of low alpha's functional significance. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A significant increase in breathing amplitude precedes sleep bruxism	CHEST			English	Article						arousals; nasal cannula; respiration; rhythmic masticatory muscle activity; sleep bruxism; tooth grinding	RISK	Background: Sleep bruxism (SB) is a stereotyped movement disorder that is characterized by rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) and tooth grinding. Evidence has suggested that SB is associated with sleep arousals and that most RMMA episodes are preceded by physiologic changes occurring in sequence, namely, a rise in autonomic sympathetic-cardiac activity followed by a rise in the frequency of EEG and suprahyoid muscle activity. In the present study, we hypothesize that an increase in respiration also characterizes the onset of SB within the arousal sequence. Methods: Polygraphic sleep recordings of 20 SB subjects without any sleep-related breathing disorders were analyzed for changes in respiration (ie, root mean square, area under the curve, peak, peak-to-peak, and length) extracted from a nasal cannula signal. Variables were analyzed and compared using analysis of variance and correlation tests. Results: Measurements of respiration showed significant changes over time. Four seconds before RMMA muscle activity, the amplitude of respiration is already increased (8 to 23%); the rise is higher at the onset of the suprahyoid activity (60 to 82% 1 s before RMMA); the rise is maximal during RMMA (108 to 206%) followed by a rapid return to levels preceding RMMA. A positive and significant correlation was found between the frequencies of RMMA episodes and the amplitude of breath (R-2 = 0.26; p = 0.02). The amplitude of respiratory changes was 11 times higher when arousal was associated with RMMA in comparison to arousal alone. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that RMMA-SB muscle activity is associated with a rise in respiration within arousal.

Sharp-wave ripple (SPW-R) complexes are network activity thought to represent the neuronal substrate for information transfer from the hippocampal to neocortical circuits, contributing to the explicit memory consolidation. In this study we examined and compared the actions of two barbiturates with distinct amnesic actions, the general anesthetic thiopental and the anticonvulsant phenobarbital, on in vitro SPW-R activity. Results: Using an in vitro model of SPW-R activity we found that thiopental ( 50 - 200 mu M) significantly and concentration-dependently reduced the incidence of SPW-R events ( it increased the inter-event period by 70 - 430 %). At the concentration of 25 mu M, which clinically produces mild sedation and explicit memory impairment, thiopental significantly reduced the quantity of ripple oscillation ( it reduced the number of ripples and the duration of ripple episodes by 20 +/- 5%, n = 12, P < 0.01), and suppressed the rhythmicity of SPWs by 43 +/- 15% ( n = 6, P < 0.05). The drug disrupted the synchrony of SPWs within the CAl region at 50 mu M ( by 19 +/- 12%; n = 5, P < 0.05). Similar effects of thiopental were observed at higher concentrations. Thiopental did not affect the frequency of ripple oscillation at any of the concentrations tested ( 10 - 200 mu M). Furthermore, the drug significantly prolonged single SPWs at concentrations = 50 mu M ( it increased the half-width and the duration of SPWs by 35 - 90 %). Thiopental did not affect evoked excitatory synaptic potentials and its results on SPW-R complexes were also observed under blockade of NMDA receptors. Phenobarbital significantly accelerated SPWs at 50 and 100 mu M whereas it reduced their rate at 200 and 400 mu M. Furthermore, it significantly prolonged SPWs, reduced their synchrony and reduced the quantity of ripples only at the clinically very high concentration of 400 mu M, reported to affect memory. Conclusion: We hypothesize that thiopental, by interfering with SPW-R activity, through enhancement of the GABA(A) receptor-mediated transmission, affects memory processes which involve hippocampal circuit activation.

J	Guntekin, B; Basar, E				Guntekin, Bahar; Basar, Erol			Emotional face expressions are differentiated with brain oscillations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						face expression; brain oscillations; emotion; alpha; beta; theta	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; ASYMMETRY; ATTENTION; VALENCE; AROUSAL; HUMANS	The differentiation of "facial expressions" is a process of higher mental activity, which has considerable applications in "psychology of moods and emotions". We applied the approach of event-related oscillations (EROs) to investigate the modulation of electrical manifestations related to emotional expression in EEG recordings of 20 healthy subjects. EROs of "neutral, angry and happy" faces in 13 electrical recordings sites (F-3, F-4, C-z, C-3, C-4, T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, P-3, P-4, O-1, O-2) were analyzed. Following the recording session, the subjects were asked to express the degree of their emotional involvement (valence and arousal) using the Self-Assessment Manikin ratings. Amplitude frequency characteristics (AFCs) were used to determine the frequencies of interest and the ranges for digital pass-band filtering applied accordingly. Consecutively, peak to peak amplitude measures of oscillatory responses were computed for the selected frequency bands and for the differentiation of the different stimuli. A differentiation between angry and happy facial expressions was observed especially in the alpha (9-13 Hz) and beta (15-24 Hz) frequencies, however, only when selecting stimuli with high mood involvement. Therefore, these frequency bands are the main focus of this report. The amplitudes of the alpha responses upon angry face stimulation were significantly higher than upon presentation of the happy faces at posterior locations. At F3, C, and C3, beta responses upon angry face stimulation were significantly higher in amplitude compared with the happy face stimulation. It is discussed that the frontal theta response is highly increased in comparison to all theta responses also encountered in studies of face recognition: During observation of facial expression, the occipital theta is much higher. We conclude and emphasize that the analysis of brain oscillatory responses distributed over the scalp in combination with subjective ratings of emotional impact of stimuli provide a good basis for analysing the influence of emotional information processing in the brain. In congruence with others, the results support the phylogenetical viewpoint suggesting that angry face stimulations are faster and more ample in responding. Furthermore, frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes seem to be involved in processing of facial expressions, as reflected in an ensemble of different frequency brain oscillatory responses distributed over the scalp.

This research is based on the study of intracerebral stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) recordings in an attempt to identify the neural networks involved in generating paroxystic activities so as to understand their dynamics in space and time, and to propose targeted therapies that could "control" these networks. Today, the classical notion of epileptic focus should be replaced by a more complex model that takes into account the potential interactions within the neuronal networks involved in seizures. During partial epileptic seizures, the cerebral structures involved are the seat of characteristic oscillations that may be synchronized or, on the contrary, that can desynchronize in a transitory manner. These epileptic rhythms disturb the physiological rhythms that underlie the cognitive and emotional processes, which can thus be altered in partial epilepsy, even if located far from the original discharge site. We suggest that seizures originate in a group of structures that are highly epileptogenic (epileptogenic zone network, [EZN]) whose activity is synchronized before the appearance of fast oscillations that are transitorily desynchronized. Later, other cortical and subcortical structures are the seat of slower, synchronized rhythmic modifications (propagation network, [PN]). The emergence of clinical signs in the seizure depend on these phenomena, which in some cases can mimic a normal cognitive process or, on the contrary, lead to a deep rupture in normal cerebral functioning.

Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.

Here we used multi-input nonlinear analysis methods and EEG source imaging to assess the role of several different boundary cues in visual scene segmentation. Synthetic figure/ground displays portraying a circular figure region were defined solely by differences in the temporal frequency of the figure and background regions in the limiting case and by the addition of orientation or relative alignment cues in other cases. The use of distinct temporal frequencies made it possible to separately record responses arising from each region and to characterize the nature of nonlinear interactions between the two regions as measured in a set of retinotopically and functionally defined cortical areas. Figure/background interactions were prominent in retinotopic areas, and in an extra-striate region lying dorsal and anterior to area MT+. Figure/background interaction was greatly diminished by the elimination of orientation cues, the introduction of small gaps between the two regions, or by the presence of a constant second-order border between regions. Nonlinear figure/background interactions therefore carry spatially precise, time-locked information about the continuity/discontinuity of oriented texture fields. This information is widely distributed throughout occipital areas, including areas that do not display strong retinotopy.

Increased cortico-cortical functional connectivity in early-stage Parkinson's disease: An MEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN BRAIN; BASE-LINE; DEMENTIA	We set out to determine whether changes in resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity are a feature of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), explore how functional coupling might evolve over the course of the disease and establish its relationship with clinical deficits. Whole-head magnetoencephalography was performed in an eyes-closed resting-state condition in 70 PD patients with varying disease duration (including 18 recently diagnosed, drug-naive patients) in an "OFF" medication state and 21 controls. Neuropsychological testing was performed in all subjects. Data analysis involved calculation of three synchronization likelihood (SL, a general measure of linear and non-linear temporal correlations between time series) measures which reflect functional connectivity within (local) and between (intrahemispheric and interhemispheric) ten major cortical regions in five frequency bands. Recently diagnosed, drug-naive patients showed an overall increase in alpha1 SL relative to controls. Cross-sectional analysis in all patients revealed that disease duration was positively associated with alpha2 and beta SL measures, while severity of parkinsonism was positively associated with theta and beta SL measures. Moderately advanced patients had increases in theta, alpha1, alpha2 and beta SL, particularly with regard to local SL. In recently diagnosed patients, cognitive perseveration was associated with increased interhemispheric alpha1 SL. Increased resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the 8-10 Hz alpha range is a feature of PD from the earliest clinical stages onward. With disease progression, neighboring frequency bands become increasingly involved. These findings suggest that changes in functional coupling over the course of PD may be linked to the topographical progression of pathology over the brain. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus originates from the medial septum (MS) and cholinergic receptors are expressed in both the MS and hippocampus. In this study, we compared the effects of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine in the MS and the hippocampus on theta generation. Hippocampal theta rhythm was elicited by electrical stimulation of the pontine reticular formation using series of stimuli with varying intensities. Atropine was administered either systemically (50 mg/kg i.p.) or locally in the MS (microdialysis; 25 and 75 mM for 30 or 90 min) or in the hippocampus on one side (microinjection; 20 or 40 ug). The relative power at the peak theta frequency was calculated and averaged over episodes of low-intensity and high-intensity stimulations. We found that atropine drastically reduced theta rhythmic synchronization when injected in either location. After MS administration of atropine, however, high-frequency theta elicited by high-intensity stimuli was more resistant (58% and 67% decrease after 25 mM and 75 mM atropine, respectively) than slow theta elicited by low-intensity stimuli (86% and 91% decrease). There was no significant difference between the powers of the two oscillations after hippocampal injections (70-75% decrease). We conclude that the theta suppressing effect of atropine involves both hippocampal and septal mechanisms and that low-frequency theta as compared with fast theta rhythm is more sensitive to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism in the MS but not in the hippocampus.

The original one-dimensional interference model is generalized to an appropriate two-dimensional mechanism. Specifically, dendritic subunits of layer 11 medial entorhinal stellate cells provide multiple linear interference patterns along different directions, with their product determining the firing of the cell. Connection of appropriate speed- and direction- dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to. increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the "preferred" direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta-frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid-like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of EEG power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment.

J	Shusterman, V; Troy, WC				Shusterman, Vladimir; Troy, William C.			From baseline to epileptiform activity: A path to synchronized rhythmicity in large-scale neural networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							NEURONAL NETWORKS; TRAVELING-WAVES; VISUAL-CORTEX; MODEL NEURONS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; BRAIN; RAT; POPULATIONS; INITIATION	In large-scale neural networks in the brain the emergence of global behavioral patterns, manifested by electroencephalographic activity, is driven by the self-organization of local neuronal groups into synchronously functioning ensembles. However, the laws governing such macrobehavior and its disturbances, in particular epileptic seizures, are poorly understood. Here we use a mean-field population network model to describe a state of baseline physiological activity and the transition from the baseline state to rhythmic epileptiform activity. We describe principles which explain how this rhythmic activity arises in the form of spatially uniform self-sustained synchronous oscillations. In addition, we show how the rate of migration of the leading edge of the synchronous oscillations can be theoretically predicted, and compare the accuracy of this prediction with that measured experimentally using multichannel electrocorticographic recordings obtained from a human subject experiencing epileptic seizures. The comparison shows that the experimentally measured rate of migration of the leading edge of synchronous oscillations is within the theoretically predicted range of values. Computer simulations have been performed to investigate the interactions between different regions of the brain and to show how organization in one spatial region can promote or inhibit organization in another. Our theoretical predictions are also consistent with the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in particular with observations that lower-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms entrain larger areas of the brain than higher-frequency rhythms. These findings advance the understanding of functional behavior of interconnected populations and might have implications for the analysis of diverse classes of networks.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide affects homeostatic sleep regulation in healthy young men	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM			English	Article						cortisol; growth hormone; prolactin	VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; ENERGY-METABOLISM; NMDA RECEPTORS; CA1 REGION; RAT; PACAP; DEPRIVATION; BRAIN	Pituitary adenylate cyclase- activating peptide ( PACAP) is involved in autonomous regulation, including timekeeping, by its action on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and on neuroendocrine secretion, energy metabolism, and transmitter release. In particular, the interactions between PACAP and the glutamatergic system are well recognized. We compared the effect of intravenously administered PACAP to that of placebo in eight healthy male subjects. PACAP in a concentration of 4 x 12.5 mu g was administered in a pulsatile fashion hourly between 2200 and 0100. Sleep EEG was recorded from 2300 to 1000, which was also the time when subjects were allowed to sleep. Blood samples were taken every 20 min between 2200 and 0700 for the determination of cortisol, GH, and prolactin. PACAP administration led to no changes in the macrosleep structure as assessed according to standard criteria. Spectral analysis revealed a significant reduction in the theta- frequency range in the first 4- h interval and of the spindle frequency range in the second 4- h interval of the registration period. This was accompanied by an increase in the time constant tau of the physiological delta- power decline in the course of the night, i. e., a less pronounced dynamic of the reduction of delta- power with time. This was accompanied by a trend ( P < 0.1) toward decreased prolactin secretion in the first 4- h period of the night. No other changes in endocrine secretion were observed. We concluded that PACAP leads to a reduction of the dynamics of homeostatic sleep regulation and prolactin secretion. Both effects are the opposite of those seen after sleep deprivation but similar to the changes after napping, i. e., a reduced sleep propensity. This implies that PACAP might be involved in homeostatic sleep regulation.

The total duration and number and mean duration of the spontaneous bursts of slow spike-and-wave discharges (SSWD) that characterize the AY model were measured using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in freely moving animals. In a randomized counterbalanced dose response design, rats were treated with either the 5-HT2A agonist 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg), the 5-HT2C preferring agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg), the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), or vehicle. DOI significantly reduced the total duration and number of SSWD. In contrast, mCPP had no effect on total duration or number of SSWD. Ketanserin exacerbated the number of SSWD at 2.5 mg/kg but produced mixed results at 5.0 mg/kg. However, none of the treatments affected the mean SSWD duration. These data support the hypothesis that 5HT(2A) receptors are involved in the pathology of experimental atypical absence seizures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ictal intracranial infraslow EEG activity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Intracranial; Infraslow; Seizures; DC baseline shifts; Epilepsy; Glia	TEMPORAL-LOBE SEIZURES; DC CHANGES; SHIFTS; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES; POTENTIALS; EPILEPSY; SPIKE; WAVE	Objective: To investigate seizure onset baseline shifts and their relationship to background infraslow activity (ISA: 0.01-0.1 Hz). Methods: Archived intracranial EEG recordings of 61 seizures from 12 patients were evaluated. All had extensive coverage of several lobes with implanted grid, strip and/or depth electrodes prior to potential epilepsy Surgery. The data had been obtained on a Nihon-Kohden system (acquisition range 0.01-1000 Hz). Data analysis was carried out with the BESA (R) software. Results: When the high pass filter was set at 0.01 Hz ictal baseline shifts, comparable to those reported in the literature when DC equipment was used, were consistently observed. Their amplitude and distribution among the sampled electrodes differed to some extent in different seizures from the same patient. They were not necessarily limited to the "epileptogenic zone" as expected from conventional frequencies (CF) and formed part of a marked amplitude increase in background ISA. This could precede and/or outlast the seizure as seen on CF. Conclusions: Ictal baseline shifts are part of a marked increase in ISA which is regional and/or multiregional even in patients where a purely focal process is suspected. Significance: ISA provides an additional parameter for the delineation of the epileptogenic zone. (c) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Optimal sustained attention is linked to the spectral content of background EEG activity: greater ongoing tonic alpha (similar to 10 Hz) power supports successful phasic goal activation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; INCREASES; REFLECT	Efficient executive control frequently requires the timely activation or re-activation of a task-goal to enable purposeful behaviour. Additionally, more generalized factors such as alertness or neurological health will influence the efficiency with which control can be implemented. Goal-directed processes have been investigated by examining event-related potentials (ERPs), but much less is known about the involvement of background or 'tonic' processes reflected in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), and how these affect the phasic processes expressed in the broad-band ERP. Here, we investigate the relationship between a key attention-sensitive tonic process - the alpha rhythm - and relevant phasic processes observed during a sustained attention paradigm in neurologically healthy subjects. We report that subjects with relatively higher tonic alpha power (similar to 10 Hz) show a larger-amplitude late positive ERP component that is thought to index goal activation and has been found to predict good sustained attention performance as defined by correct response patterns. Source localization results suggest that the neural generators responsible for oscillatory alpha activity, which are found primarily in the parietal and occipital lobes, are distinct from those giving rise to the late positive component. The results are discussed in terms of increased alpha synchrony facilitating goal-directed behaviour.

Memory consolidation has been suggested to occur predominantly during sleep. Very recent findings, however, suggest that important steps in memory consolidation occur also during waking state but may become saturated after some time awake. Sleep, in this model, specifically favors restoration of synaptic plasticity and accelerated memory consolidation while asleep and briefly afterwards. To distinguish between these different views, we recorded intracranial electroencephalograms from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex of human subjects while they retrieved information acquired either before or after a "nap" in the afternoon or on a control day without nap. Reaction times, hippocampal event-related potentials, and oscillatory gamma activity indicated a temporal gradient of hippocampal involvement in information retrieval on the control day, suggesting hippocampal-neocortical information transfer during waking state. On the day with nap, retrieval of recent items that were encoded briefly after the nap did not involve the hippocampus to a higher degree than retrieval of items encoded before the nap. These results suggest that sleep facilitates rapid processing through the hippocampus but is not necessary for information transfer into the neocortex per se.

J	Nunez, PL; Srinivasan, R				Nunez, Paul L.; Srinivasan, Ramesh			Hearts don't love and brains don't pump - Neocortical dynamic correlates of conscious experience	JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES			English	Article							SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORS	Human brains exhibit complex dynamic behaviour measured by external recordings of electric (EEG) and magnetic fields (MEG). These data reveal synaptic field oscillations in neocortex at millisecond temporal and centimetre spatial scales. We suggest that the neural networks underlying behaviour and cognition may be viewed as embedded in these synaptic action fields, analogous to social networks embedded in a culture. These synaptic fields may facilitate the binding of disparate networks to produce a behaviour and consciousness that appears unified to external observers. EEG, MEG anatomy, physiology, and complex physical systems are considered here to suggest fundamental physical and biological properties of human brains that may be required for human consciousness to occur. We do not claim that these tissue properties are necessarily causal; however, they appear to be strongly correlated with human consciousness. Emphasis is placed on the hierarchical structure of brains, non-local connections between distant cortical regions, and resonant interactions between networks. While several of these ideas are supported by both experimental data and mathematical theory, the mathematics is replaced by metaphor for this paper. One conjecture is that the schizophrenias and other diseases occur when neural networks fail to conform to global synaptic fields. Perhaps consciousness is a resonance phenomenon and only properly tuned brains can orchestrate the beautiful music of sentience.

However, frequency characteristics of the underlying processes have been less studied. Besides, most of the studies did not take into account personality-related individual differences. In this study, effects of explicit and implicit anxiety on the oscillatory dynamics of cortical responses elicited by presentation of angry, neutral, and happy faces were investigated using time-frequency decomposition by means of wavelet transform. Both explicit and implicit anxiety were associated with higher alpha band desynchronization, which was most pronounced during presentation of angry faces. Within theta and delta bands, effects appeared to be opposite for explicit and implicit anxiety measures. In implicitly anxious subjects, frontal delta and theta synchronization upon the presentation of angry and happy (but not neutral) faces was found to be higher than in low anxiety ones, whereas explicit anxiety was associated with a lower theta band synchronization. The results are discussed in terms of conscious and controlled vs. unconscious and intuitive information processing associated with explicit and implicit personality measures.

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia. Method: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. Results: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index. The MK-0777 agent was well-tolerated. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that enhanced GABA activity at alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors improves behavioral and electrophysiological measures of prefrontal function in individuals with schizophrenia.

Cortical aperiodic shutter enabling phase transitions at theta rates	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	AUG 12-17, 2007	Orlando, FL	IEEE			BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; ORIGIN; DYNAMICS	Brains are open thermodynamic systems, continually dissipating metabolic energy as heat in constructing spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. Here patterns of cortical oscillations are described as Prigogine's 'dissipative structures' formed at a conditionally stable operating point far from equilibrium. Around that point exists a small-signal, near-linear range in which pairs of impulse responses superpose. Piece-wise linearization extends analysis into nonlinear ranges. Resulting root loci are interpreted as projections from a phase plane, in which the three phase boundaries are graphed in the coordinates of rate of change in a dynamic order parameter (negentropy) on the ordinate analogous to static pressure vs. energy dissipation (power) analogous to static temperature on the abscissa. The graph reveals the neural mechanisms that implement phase transitions, which enable the limbic system to repeat the action-perception cycle at 3-7 Hz. Salient among these are null spikes ('vortices') found in background ECoG.

They occur in different brain areas and have been associated to relevant physiological and pathological processes such as sensory processing, memory, epilepsy and consciousness. Neuronal oscillations are mediated and shaped by i) the intrinsic properties of the cell membrane, ii) the architecture of synaptic connections between the neurons confined in a network, and iii) the dynamics of the synaptic currents. The firing properties of the neurons depend on the ionic channels that they possess but nonlinear interactions between different families of ionic currents, may produce small subthreshold membrane oscillations (SMOs). Because the probability to generate an action potential rises during the depolarizing phase of the SMOs, this activity can regulate the neuron's firing frequency. Consequently, SMOs influence the responsiveness of the neuron to synaptic inputs that occur at particular frequencies and which, finally, produce a broad range of brain rhythms. In addition to the intrinsic properties of the neuronal membrane, the firing frequency of single neurons depends on the synaptic inputs from other neurons within the network. Indeed, neurons can produce responses in their neighbors by means of electrical and chemical synapses. In this sense, two or more neurons are in synchrony if each fires action potentials, within a small time window before or after the other. This could be explained if both neurons share the same synaptic input or if they interact with each other. Hence, network synchrony is reflected by the current flow between the extracellular and intracellular compartments which can be recorded as a field potential in the extracellular space. Thus, this field potential reflects both synchronic subthreshold events and action potentials generated by the cells contained in the recorded field. Therefore, the electric potential produced by the synchronized activity of cortical neurons can be recorded over the scalp (the electroencephalogram or EEG). This activity is characterized by its morphology, its frequency and the experimental context in which it is recorded. The cortical brain rhythms are classified in frequency bands, and they are associated with different brain states. They compete and interact with each other and can coexist in the same or in different structures. Because field oscillations can be spontaneously generated in vitro, their generating and sustaining mechanisms can be thoroughly studied. For instance, blockade of presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors is a common tool used to isolate the specific contributions of different synaptic components that generate the field oscillations. We also discuss the role of short and long-term GABAergic plasticity and its involvement in neuronal oscillations and in the generation of hyper-synchronic rhythms that underlie epileptic discharges. Indeed, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions regulate and sustain the firing synchrony in neural networks. For instance, diverse sets of GABAergic interneurons contribute with different firing frequencies that finally inhibit their postsynaptic targets: excitatory principal cells and other interneurons. In other words, inhibitory synapses, as a whole, generate different synchronic neuronal events and restrain the network excitability. Hence, it is relevant to study which parameters do modify the GABAergic transmission. For instance, a feature of GABAergic synapses is that prolonged GABA(A)-R activation may lead to a switch from a hyperpolarizing to a depolarizing postsynaptic response. This is partly due to a positive shift on the GABAA-R reversal potential (E-GABA) because of a GABA-induced-chloride (Cl-) accumulation in the postsynaptic neurons. Recent studies suggest that the activity-dependent EGABA shift may have important implications in the mechanisms involved in the generation of gamma (similar to 40 Hz) oscillations and seizure-like discharges. The study of how intracellular Cl- dynamics shape network oscillations may bring insights into the mechanisms of physiological and pathological brain rhythms. Moreover, Cl- dynamics have also prominent functional implications during development. Another relevant example of GABAergic plasticity is observed in the glutamatergic hippocampal granule cells (GCs). In response to an increment in network excitability, GCs are able to synthesize and release GABA for fast neurotransmission. Several experimental results have compellingly shown that GABAergic signaling from these cells activates presynaptic and postsynaptic GABAergic receptors. Therefore, it is plausible that after seizures, the GCs could spontaneously release GABA that would, in turn, change the spontaneous field activity that naturally emerges from the postsynaptic targets that comprise the CA3 intrinsic network oscillator. And this is indeed the case. GABA released from CGs inhibits beta/gamma oscillations (similar to 20 Hz) in the CA3 area, where principal cells and interneurons are impinged by CGs. Thus, this mechanism could be used to limit network excitability after seizures. The emergence of the GABAergic phenotype in CGs could also be involved in the deleterious effects on learning and memory consolidation that have been observed after seizures. Finally, we briefly discuss the computational role that network oscillations may have to represent sensory information.

Synchronization measurement of multiple neuronal populations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LOW-CALCIUM MODEL; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CROSS-CORRELATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; STATE-SPACE; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; EPILEPSY; EEG	Synchronization measurement of multiple neuronal populations. J Neurophysiol 98: 3341-3348, 2007. First published October 3, 2007; doi:10.1152/jn.00977.2007. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a method, based on equal-time correlation, correlation matrix analysis and surrogate resampling, that is able to quantify and describe properties of synchronization of population neuronal activity recorded simultaneously from multiple sites. Initially, Lorenz-type oscillators were used to model multiple time series with different patterns of synchronization. Eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition was then applied to identify "clusters" of locally synchronized activity and to calculate a "global synchronization index." This method was then applied to multichannel data recorded from an in vitro model of epileptic seizures. The results demonstrate that this novel method can be successfully used to analyze synchronization between multiple neuronal population series.

Enhanced gamma-band activity in ADHD patients lacks correlation with memory performance found in healthy children	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						40 Hz; Dopamine; Encoding; Gamma activity; Polymorphism; Oscillations	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER GENE; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; VISUAL-DISCRIMINATION TASK; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; D-4 RECEPTOR GENE; HUMAN SCALP EEG	Previous electrophysiological as well as imaging research has contributed to the understanding of impairments in attention, executive functions, and memory in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, there is a lack of studies investigating ADHD related differences in the gamma range of human electroencephalogram (EEG), although gamma activity is strongly associated with cognitive processes impaired in ADHD patients and is also modulated by dopamine polymorphisms linked with ADHD. To close this gap, the present study compared gamma activity in ADHD children with that of healthy controls and correlated it with memory performance. EEG was recorded from 13 ADHD patients as well as 13 healthy control subjects during the encoding phase of a visual memory paradigm. In a subsequent recognition test, participants had to judge pictures as being old or new. Analysis of evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs) during stimulus encoding revealed a strong task-related enhancement for ADHD patients in parieto-occipital areas. Interestingly, this augmentation was not associated with recognition performance, whereas healthy subjects exhibited a strong positive correlation between evoked gamma activity during stimulus encoding and subsequent recognition performance. We interpret this finding as evidence of enhanced excitation levels and unspecific activation of processing resources in ADHD patients. Furthermore, enhanced GBRs in ADHD could also indicate a decrease of neuronal signal-to-noise ratio, partially caused by the genetic variations within the dopaminergic pathway of ADHD patients. The involved genetic polymorphisms have been shown to modulate evoked GBRs, which therefore could be a possible marker of impaired neurotransmission in ADHD. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Data will be reviewed here from cross-sectional EEG and MEG studies to suggest that Parkinson's disease is characterized by changing patterns of disturbed neural synchrony that appear to be dependent on the stage of disease. Some of these alterations in neural synchrony may directly account for a number of disease-related impairments in motor and cognitive functions. Future longitudinal studies are required to fully understand the disturbances of functional brain networks in Parkinson's disease and how they evolve throughout the course of the disease.

Applications of different wavelets for the estimation of potential elicited by the sensorial stimulation of the tibial nerve	IV LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2007, BIOENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR LATIN AMERICA HEALTH, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		Portuguese	Proceedings Paper	4th Latin American Congress on Biomedical Engineering 2007 - Bioengineering Solutions for Latin America Health	SEP 24-28, 2007	Margarita Isl, VENEZUELA	CORAL, IFMBE, EMB, IEEE, SOVEB, Univ Simon Bolivar		Wavelets; Denoising; Evoked Potentials		The evoked potential (EP) elicited by sensorial stimulation is overlapped on spontaneous oscillations of the electroencephalogram (EEC). The standard method to estimate the EP is the coherent average of EEG epochs, but in many cases, there are not sufficient epochs to improve satisfactorily the signal-to-noise relation (SNR). Then, a method to improve the SNR of the EP based on a wavelet denoising tool associated with a cyclic shift of the epochs, collected during 5 Hz pulse stimulus on the tibial nerve, is presented. In this context, the choice of the wavelet can determine the improvement in SNR. To help in the choice, measures of the latency and amplitude of the EP components using different wavelets was compared with the EP model. The Reverse Biorthogonals wavelets presented better results, and demonstrate to be good choices for the analysis.	[Santos Filho, S. A.; Braga, E. Q.; da Silva, E. J.; Tierra-Criollo, C.

The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a general signal processing method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary time series. The main idea of EMD is to decompose a time series into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). EMD is an adaptive decomposition since the extracted information is obtained directly from the original signal. By utilizing this method to obtain the features of normal and epileptic seizure signals, we compare them with traditional features such as wavelet coefficients through two classifiers. Our results confirmed that our proposed features could potentially be used to distinguish normal from seizure data with success rate up to 95.42%.

The rise in life expectancy will likely increase its prevalence, since ageing is the greatest known risk factor. Although an early and accurate identification is critical, low diagnostic accuracy is currently reached. Hence, the aim of the present study was to analyse the spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity from 148 channels in 20 AD patients and 21 healthy controls to extract discriminating spectral features. Relative power (RP) was calculated in conventional frequency bands and several ratios were defined to emphasise the differences in its distribution. Both RP values and spectral ratios were transformed with a principal component analysis to summarise information with minimal loss of variability. AD patients showed a significant increase of RP(delta) and RP(theta), along with a decrease of RP(beta) and RP(gamma). The most significant differences were reached by spectral ratios using the p band. Specifically, we obtained 75.0% sensitivity, 90.5% specificity and 82.9% accuracy (linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure), together with a p-value lower than 0.001 (one-way analysis of variance with age as a covariate) using the [RP(alpha) + RP(beta(1)) + RP(beta(2)) + RP(gamma)]/[RP(delta) + RP(theta)] ratio. The spectral ratios also showed a higher correlation with the severity of dementia than individual relative power measures. Our results suggest that the spectral ratios could be useful descriptors to help in the AD diagnosis, since they effectively summarise the slowing of the AD patients' MEG rhythms in individual indexes and correlate significantly with the severity of dementia.

In sleeping zebra finches, we observed slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an intermediate sleep (IS) stage commonly occurring in, but not limited to, transitions between other stages, and high amplitude transients reminiscent of K-complexes. SWS density decreased whereas REM density increased throughout the night, with late-night characterized by substantially more REM than SWS, and relatively long bouts of REM. Birds share many features of sleep in common with mammals, but this collective suite of characteristics had not been known in any one species outside of mammals. We hypothesize that shared, ancestral characteristics of sleep in amniotes evolved under selective pressures common to songbirds and mammals, resulting in convergent characteristics of sleep.

In this model the motivation to approach is lateralized to the left, whereas the motivation to avoidance is lateralized to the right hemisphere. The aim of the present experiment was to seek evidence for this model by relating electrophysiological and phenomenological indices of frontal asymmetry to a direct measure of cortical excitability. Frontal asymmetrical resting states of the electroencephalogram and motivational tendencies indexed by the Carver and White questionnaire were compared with neural excitability of the left and right primary motor cortex as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation in 24 young healthy right-handed volunteers. In agreement with the model of frontal asymmetry, predominant left over right frontal cortical excitability was associated with enhanced emotional approach relative to emotional avoidance. Moreover, the asymmetries of brain excitability and approach-avoidance motivational predispositions were both reflected by frontal beta (13-30 Hz) electroencephalogram asymmetries. In conclusion, the currently demonstrated interconnections between cortical excitability, electrophysiological activity, and self-reported emotional tendencies for approach or avoidance support the frontal asymmetry of emotion model and provide novel insights into its biological underpinnings.

Period concatenation underlies interactions between gamma and beta rhythms in neocortex	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; neocortex; gamma rhythm; beta rhythm; inhibition	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; CORTEX; CELL; SPEED	The neocortex generates rhythmic electrical activity over a frequency range covering many decades. Specific cognitive and motor states are associated with oscillations in discrete frequency bands within this range, but it is not known whether interactions and transitions between distinct frequencies are of functional importance. When coexpressed rhythms have frequencies that differ by a factor of two or more interactions can be seen in terms of phase synchronization. Larger frequency differences can result in interactions in the form of nesting of faster frequencies within slower ones by a process of amplitude modulation. It is not known how coexpressed rhythms, whose frequencies differ by less than a factor of two may interact. Here we show that two frequencies (gamma - 40 Hz and beta2 - 25 Hz), coexpressed in superficial and deep cortical laminae with low temporal interaction, can combine to generate a third frequency (beta1 - 15 Hz) showing strong temporal interaction. The process occurs via period concatenation, with basic rhythm-generating microcircuits underlying gamma and beta2 rhythms forming the building blocks of the beta1 rhythm by a process of addition. The mean ratio of adjacent frequency components was a constant - approximately the golden mean - which served to both minimize temporal interactions, and permit multiple transitions, between frequencies. The resulting temporal landscape may provide a framework for multiplexing - parallel information processing on multiple temporal scales.

That such memory updating is part of our memory system is suggested by numerous behavioral studies. The physiological correlates of this process, however, still remain elusive. In this study we explore oscillatory correlates of memory updating as they occur in list-method directed forgetting. In this task, subjects are cued to forget a previously learned word list and to learn a new list of words instead. Such cuing typically leads to forgetting of the first list (List 1) and to memory enhancement of the second (List 2). Measuring EEGs during List-2 encoding, we identified two effects of the forget cue on oscillatory function: an increase in upper alpha power and a reduction in upper alpha phase coupling (11 to 13 Hz). Median-split analyses revealed that the two oscillatory effects were selectively related to the two behavioral effects. Whereas the increase in power was related to List-2 enhancement, the reduced phase coupling was related to List-1 forgetting. Our results point to separate neural origins of forgetting and enhancement and show that alpha oscillations play a critical role in intentional updating of episodic memory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The surgical treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy is preceded by a pre-surgical evaluation period during which intracranial EEG recordings are performed to identify the epileptogenic network and provide a functional map of eloquent cerebral areas that need to be spared to minimize the risk of post-operative deficits. A growing body of research based on such invasive recordings indicates that cortical oscillations at various frequencies, especially in the gamma range (40 to 150 Hz), can provide efficient markers of task-related neural network activity. Principal Findings. Here we introduce a novel real-time investigation framework for mapping human brain functions based on online visualization of the spectral power of the ongoing intracranial activity. The results obtained with the first two implanted epilepsy patients who used the proposed online system illustrate its feasibility and utility both for clinical applications, as a complementary tool to electrical stimulation for presurgical mapping purposes, and for basic research, as an exploratory tool used to detect correlations between behavior and oscillatory power modulations. Furthermore, our findings suggest a putative role for high gamma oscillations in higher-order auditory processing involved in speech and music perception. Conclusion/Significance. The proposed real-time setup is a promising tool for presurgical mapping, the investigation of functional brain dynamics, and possibly for neurofeedback training and brain computer interfaces.

J	Rovati, L; Salvatori, G; Bulf, L; Fonda, S				Rovati, Luigi; Salvatori, Giorgia; Bulf, Luca; Fonda, Sergio			Optical and electrical recording of neural activity evoked by graded contrast visual stimulus	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; HUMAN-BRAIN; ADULT; SPECTROSCOPY; POTENTIALS	Background: Brain activity has been investigated by several methods with different principles, notably optical ones. Each method may offer information on distinct physiological or pathological aspects of brain function. The ideal instrument to measure brain activity should include complementary techniques and integrate the resultant information. As a "low cost"approach towards this objective, we combined the well-grounded electroencephalography technique with the newer near infrared spectroscopy methods to investigate human visual function. Methods: The article describes an embedded instrumentation combining a continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy system and an electroencephalography system to simultaneously monitor functional hemodynamics and electrical activity. Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) signal depends on the light absorption spectra of haemoglobin and measures the blood volume and blood oxygenation regulation supporting the neural activity. The NIRS and visual evoked potential ( VEP) are concurrently acquired during steady state visual stimulation, at 8 Hz, with a b/ w "windmill"pattern, in nine human subjects. The pattern contrast is varied ( 1%, 10%, 100%) according to a stimulation protocol. Results: In this study, we present the measuring system; the results consist in concurrent recordings of hemodynamic changes and evoked potential responses emerging from different contrast levels of a patterned stimulus. The concentration of [ HbO2] increases and [ HHb] decreases after the onset of the stimulus. Their variation shows a clear relationship with the contrast value: large contrast produce huge difference in concentration, while low contrast provokes small concentration difference. This behaviour is similar to the already known relationship between VEP response amplitude and contrast. Conclusion: The simultaneous recording and analysis of NIRS and VEP signals in humans during visual stimulation with a b/ w pattern at variable contrast, demonstrates a strong linear correlation between hemodynamic changes and evoked potential amplitude. Furthermore both responses present a logarithmic profile with stimulus contrast.

Interactions between cardiac, respiratory and EEG-delta oscillations in rats during anaesthesia	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW-WAVE MAGNITUDE; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; IN-VIVO; SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONS; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; FLOW	We hypothesized that, associated with the state of anaesthesia, characteristic changes exist in both cardio-respiratory and cerebral oscillator parameters and couplings, perhaps varying with depth of anaesthesia. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), respiration and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from two groups of 10 rats during the entire course of anaesthesia following the administration of a single bolus of ketamine-xylazine (KX group) or pentobarbital (PB group). The phase dynamics approach was then used to extract the instantaneous frequencies of heart beat, respiration and slow delta-waves (within 0.5-3.5 Hz). The amplitudes of delta- and theta-waves were analysed by use of a time-frequency representation of the EEG signal within 0.5-7.5 Hz obtained by wavelet transformation, using the Morlet mother wavelet. For the KX group, where slow delta-waves constituted the dominant spectral component, the Hilbert transform was applied to obtain the instantaneous delta-frequency. The theta-activity was spread over too wide a spectral range for its phase to be meaningfully defined. For both agents, we observed two distinct phases of anaesthesia, with a marked increase in theta-wave activity occurring on passage from a deeper phase of anaesthesia to a shallower one. In other respects, the effects of the two anaesthetics were very different. For KX anaesthesia, the two phases were separated by a marked change in all three instantaneous frequencies: stable, deep, anaesthesia with small frequency variability was followed by a sharp transition to shallow anaesthesia with large frequency variability, lasting until the animal awoke. The transition occurred 16-76 min after injection of the anaesthetic, with simultaneous reduction in the delta-wave amplitude. For PB anaesthesia, the two epochs were separated by the return of a positive response to the pinch test at 53-94 min, following which it took a further period of 45-70 min for the animal to awaken. delta-Waves were not apparent at any stage of PB anaesthesia. We applied non-linear dynamics and information theory to seek evidence of causal relationships between the cardiac, respiratory and slow delta-oscillations. We demonstrate that, for both groups, respiration drives the cardiac oscillator during deep anaesthesia. During shallow KX anaesthesia the direction either reverses, or the cardio-respiratory interaction becomes insignificant; in the deep phase, there is a unidirectional deterministic interaction of respiration with slow delta-oscillations. For PB anaesthesia, the cardio-respiratory interaction weakens during the second phase but, otherwise, there is no observable change in the interactions. We conclude that non-linear dynamics and information theory can be used to identify different stages of anaesthesia and the effects of different anaesthetics.

Synch before you speak: Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							COROLLARY DISCHARGE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; ABNORMALITIES; DYNAMICS; SPEECH	Objective: Synchronization of neural activity preceding self-generated actions may reflect the operation of the forward model, which acts to dampen sensations resulting from those actions. If this is true, pre-action synchrony should be related to subsequent sensory suppression. Deficits in this mechanism may be characteristic of schizophrenia and related to positive symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations. If so, schizophrenia patients should have reduced neural synchrony preceding movements, especially patients with severe hallucinations. Method: In 24 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 25 healthy comparison subjects, the authors related prespeech neural synchrony to subsequent auditory cortical responsiveness to the spoken sound, compared prespeech neural synchrony in schizophrenia patients and healthy comparison subjects, and related prespeech neural synchrony to auditory hallucination severity in patients. To assess neural synchrony, phase coherence of single-trial EEG preceding talking was calculated at a single site across repeated trials. To assess auditory cortical suppression, the N1 event-related brain potentials to speech sound onset during talking and listening were compared. Results: In healthy comparison subjects, prespeech neural synchrony was related to subsequent suppression of responsiveness to the spoken sound, as reflected in reduction of N1 during talking relative to listening. There was greater prespeech synchrony in comparison subjects than in patients, especially those with severe auditory hallucinations. Conclusions: These data suggest that EEG synchrony preceding speech reflects the action of a forward model system, which dampens auditory responsiveness to self-generated speech and is deficient in patients who hallucinate.

Conditions required for appearance of a double response to a single-shock stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in hippocampal field CA1 in freely moving rats	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						rats; hippocampus; CA1; Schaffer collaterals; tetanization; wakefulness and sleep; reverberation of excitation	CURRENT-SOURCE-DENSITY; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; REVERBERATION; NEURONS; MEMORY; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS; PROJECTIONS	Schaffer collateral stimulation with a single current impulse can evoke a double response in hippocampal field CA1 of freely moving rats. The late response appears as a population excitatory postsynaptic potential with a preceding short-term potential (frequently biphasic) only after the early population spike and is time-locked to it. The wave shape and polarity of the late response, its latency with respect to the peak of the early population spike suggest that the excitation wave produced in the CA1 field by the stimulation of Schaffer collaterals passes across the entorhinal cortex and returns to the CA1 directly via the perforant path fibers. In waking rat, the medium-intensity stimulation of Schaffer collaterals (able to evoke in the CA1 an early population spike of sufficiently high amplitude) usually does not result in the appearance of the late response. However, similar stimulation becomes efficient after the tetanization of Schaffer collaterals, under conditions of the long-term potentiation of the early population spike. Moreover, the late response occurrence is facilitated in a rat falling asleep after the development in the CA1 of high-amplitude low-frequency EEG oscillations typical for the slow-wave sleep and in a sleeping rat independently of the EEG pattern.

J	Cagy, M; Infantosi, AFC				Cagy, Mauricio; Catelli Infantosi, Antonio Fernando			Objective response detection technique in frequency-domain for reflecting changes in MLAEP	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						auditory evoked potential; objective response detection; anaesthesia	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MIDDLE LATENCY RESPONSES; ANESTHESIA; PHARMACOKINETICS; STIMULATION; PERCEPTION; COHERENCE; PROPOFOL	The mid-latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) occurs within the interval 10-100 ms post-stimulus and exhibits morphological changes due to coma, general anaesthesia and neurological and psychiatric diseases. This work evaluates an objective response detection technique in the frequency domain, the magnitude squared coherence (k(2)(f)), in reflecting MLAEPs changes in amplitude and latencies. Both simulation and EEG data were used in this investigation. The EEG during auditory stimulation in 10 volunteers under propofol-induced anaesthesia was acquired. Based on the null hypothesis of non-existing response, critical values have been derived in order to detect the auditory response. The alternative hypothesis was used to infer about maximal-response frequencies as well as to derive confidence intervals for the estimated values of k(2) (f) during anaesthesia. Changes in both simulated and real MLAEPs could be tracked by k(2) (f), even for low SNR. High degree of cortical activation occurred predominantly between 30 and 90 Hz. This finding could be related to the sensory-originated phase-locked oscillation in the gamma band (30-70 Hz). Hence, for applications where changes on MLAEPs should be assessed, the use of k(2()f) as an objective statistical response detection technique is worth to be applied. (c) 2006 IPEM.

Daytime Ayahuasca administration modulates REM and slow-wave sleep in healthy volunteers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Annual Reunion of the Asociacion-Iberica-de-Patologia-del-Sueno	MAY 26-28, 2005	Almeria, SPAIN	Asoc Iberica Patol Sueno		Ayahuasca; d-amphetamine; polysomnograpy; spectral analysis; subjective evaluations; healthy volunteers	DORSAL RAPHE NEURONS; EEG POWER SPECTRA; BETA-CARBOLINES; RECEPTORS; NIGHT; 5-HT1A; INHIBITION; PAROXETINE; SEROTONIN; AGONIST	Objectives Ayahuasca is a traditional South American psychoactive beverage and the central sacrament of Brazilian-based religious groups, with followers in Europe and the United States. The tea contains the psychedelic indole N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties that render DMT orally active. DMT interacts with serotonergic neurotransmission acting as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptor sites. Given the role played by serotonin in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, we investigated the effects of daytime ayahuasca consumption in sleep parameters. Measurements and results Subjective sleep quality, polysomnography (PSG), and spectral analysis were assessed in a group of 22 healthy male volunteers after the administration of a placebo, an ayahuasca dose equivalent to 1 mg DMT kg(-1) body weight, and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a proaminergic drug, as a positive control. Results show that ayahuasca did not induce any subjectively perceived deterioration of sleep quality or PSG-measured disruptions of sleep initiation or maintenance, in contrast with d-amphetamine, which delayed sleep initiation, disrupted sleep maintenance, induced a predominance of 'light' vs 'deep' sleep and significantly impaired subjective sleep quality. PSG analysis also showed that similarly to d-amphetamine, ayahuasca inhibits rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, decreasing its duration, both in absolute values and as a percentage of total sleep time, and shows a trend increase in its onset latency. Spectral analysis showed that d-amphetamine and ayahuasca increased power in the high frequency range, mainly during stage 2. Remarkably, whereas slow-wave sleep (SWS) power in the first night cycle, an indicator of sleep pressure, was decreased by d-amphetamine, ayahuasca enhanced power in this frequency band. Conclusions Results show that daytime serotonergic psychedelic drug administration leads to measurable changes in PSG and sleep power spectrum and suggest an interaction between these drugs and brain circuits modulating REM and SWS.

Magnetic sources of the M50 response are localized to frontal cortex	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory evoked responses; magnetoencephalography; P50 potential	AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSES; POTENTIALS; P50; EEG	Objective: To determine the source localization(s) of the midlatency auditory magnetic response M50, the equivalent of the P50 potential, a sleep state-dependent waveform known to habituate to repetitive stimulation. Methods: We used a paired stimulus paradigm at interstimulus intervals of 250, 500 and 1000 ms, and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings were subjected to computational methods for current density reconstruction, blind source separation, time-frequency analysis, and data visualization to characterize evoked dynamics. Results: Each subject showed localization of a source for primary auditory evoked responses in the region of the auditory cortex, usually at a 20-30 ms latency. However, responses at 40-70 ms latency that also decreased following the second stimulus of a pair were not localizable to the auditory cortex, rather showing multiple sources usually including the frontal lobes. Conclusions: The M50 response, which shows habituation to repetitive stimulation, was not localized to the auditory cortex, but showed multiple sources including frontal lobes. Significance: These MEG results suggest that sources for the M50 response may represent non-auditory, perhaps arousal-related, diffuse projections to the cortex.

J	van Luijtelaar, G; Bikbaev, A				van Luijtelaar, Gilles; Bikbaev, Arthur			Midfrequency cortico-thalamic oscillations and the sleep cycle: Genetic, time of day and age effects	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						WAG/Rij rats; absence seizures; sleep spindles; sleep cycle; circadian; aging	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; WAKE STATES; RAT MODEL; SPINDLES; STRAIN; MECHANISMS; SEIZURES; DEPRIVATION; PAROXYSMS	WAG/Rij rats have various types of mid frequency cortico-thatamic oscillations, such as anterior and posterior sleep spindles and two types of spike-wave discharges (SWD). The generalized SWD (type 1) preferentially occur at transitions from wake to sleep, type 11 can be found at the occipital cortex during quite wakefulness. In the present experiment sleep spindles, SWD and steep cycle characteristics of 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats were studied and compared with those of younger WAG/Rij rats with much less SWD and age-matched control (ACI) rats. EEG recordings were made during the beginning (morning) and end (afternoon) of the light period in these four groups of rats. Quantitative characteristics of SWD, steep spindles and the steep cycle were determined. There were strain-retated and age-dependent effects in the various cortico-thalamic oscillations, older WAG/Rij had more SWDs than younger WAG/Rij rats (both types I and II) and there were more type I SWDs at the end of the tight period compared to the beginning. Large strain, age and time of day effects on the steep cycle were found. The duration of non-REM steep and the steep cycle was shorter in WAC/Rij rats but only at the end of the tight period and only in older WAG/Rij rats. It can be concluded that the various phasic events and the length of the steep cycle are under genetic control, and that the steep cycle length is also controlled by time of day, age and genetic factors. Non-REM steep and the steep cycle are disrupted by absence seizures but only in fragile periods when drowsiness and tight slow wave steep dominate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study examined the neural correlates of such context effects by analyzing oscillatory brain activity during the encoding of words, both before and after a context change. Participants studied two lists of items and, after the presentation of List 1, were either cued to change their internal context through a simple imagination task, or not. Replicating the behavioral work, the change in context led to forgetting of the first list (List 1) and to memory enhancement of the second (List 2). Measuring EEGs during encoding of the two lists, the context change was found to affect oscillatory brain activity. Whereas an increase of theta and alpha power from List-1 to List-2 encoding was found when the context was left unchanged, a slight theta and alpha power decrease was found when the context was changed. In addition, median split analysis revealed that alpha power during List-2 encoding was related to the enhancement effect of the context change. The results suggest that a change in internal context can lead to a reset of encoding processes, thus pointing to a crucial role of encoding processes in context-dependent memory.

The study aims at testing the hypothesis that the duration of CAP sequences is determined primarily by the number and not by the length of CAP cycles. Methods: The polysomnographic recordings of 24 normal subjects, 12 males and 12 females, ranging in age from 20 to 35 years (mean 27.8 +/- 7.2), were examined. Results: A total of 1053 CAP sequences were counted with an average of 43.9 sequences per night. The mean duration of CAP sequences was 2 min and 33 s. Each CAP sequence was composed of an average of 5.6 CAP cycles. All subjects presented CAP sequences lasting at least 5 min and 30 s. The mean duration of CAP cycles was 26.9 +/- 4.1 s. CAP cycles including subtypes A1 presented the highest correlation with the CAP sequence length (r = 0.92; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The progressive increase of CAP sequences length is linked to the progressive accumulation of CAP cycles. Significance: CAP sequences can be considered as strings of time-constant modules, i.e., CAP cycles, which are involved in the dynamic tailoring of sleep structure.

The pictures varied on valence (negative, neutral, positive) ratings but had the same medium arousal level ratings. The images were presented as targets with a standard stimulus composed of red/white triangles designed to mimic the spatial frequency of the pictures. P300 amplitude from negative relative to neutral stimuli was smaller over frontal areas, whereas amplitude from positive relative to neutral stimuli did not differ. P300 amplitude differences among valence categories were consistent across the midline electrodes, and did not change over the parietal area where arousal effects are typically observed. The findings suggest that valence affects P300 frontal amplitude, and arousal level should be controlled when using emotional stimuli to elicit ERPs. Theoretical implications are discussed.

This frequency-specific change at distinct locations is thought to indicate the dynamic formation of local neuronal assemblies during the activation of cortical object representations. As analytically power increase is just a property of a single location, phase-synchrony was introduced to investigate the formation of large-scale networks between spatially distant brain sites. However, classical phase-synchrony reveals symmetric, pair-wise correlations and is not suited to uncover the directionality of interactions. Here, we investigated the neural mechanism of visual object processing by means of directional coupling analysis going beyond recording sites, but rather assessing the directionality of oscillatory interactions between brain areas directly. This study is the first to identify the directionality of oscillatory brain interactions in source space during human object recognition and suggests that familiar, but not unfamiliar, objects engage widespread reciprocal information flow. Directionality of cortical information-flow was calculated based upon an established Granger-Causality coupling-measure (partial-directed coherence; PDC) using autoregressive modeling. To enable comparison with previous coupling studies lacking directional information, phase-locking analysis was applied, using wavelet-based signal decompositions. Both, autoregressive modeling and wavelet analysis, revealed an augmentation of iGBRs during the presentation of familiar objects relative to unfamiliar controls, which was localized to inferior-temporal, superior-parietal and frontal brain areas by means of distributed source reconstruction. The multivariate analysis of PDC evaluated each possible direction of brain interaction and revealed widespread reciprocal information-transfer during familiar object processing. In contrast, unfamiliar objects entailed a sparse number of only unidirectional connections converging to parietal areas. Considering the directionality of brain interactions, the current results might indicate that successful activation of object representations is realized through reciprocal (feed-forward and feed-backward) information-transfer of oscillatory connections between distant, functionally specific brain areas.

Non-invasive electrophysiological approaches such as electro- and magnetoencephalography have proven to be helpful tools for the real-time investigation of neuronal signals and synchronous communication between cortical areas. In particular, time-frequency decomposition of signals recorded with these techniques seems to be a promising approach because different pain-related oscillatory changes can be observed within different frequency bands, which are likely to be linked to specific sensory and motor functions. In this review we discuss the latest evidence on pain-induced time-frequency signals and propose that changes in oscillatory activity reflect an essential communication mechanism in the brain that is modulated during pain processing. The importance of synchronization processes for normal and pathological pain processing, such as chronic pain states, is discussed.

In children, theta (similar to 4-6 Hz) electroencephalographic responses during recognition were of greater magnitude than those during encoding and a (similar to 8-12 Hz) event-related synchronization responses during encoding increased with increasing memory load. During recognition, greater magnitude alpha and beta (> 12 Hz) event-related desynchronization responses were observed during the presentation of the positive probe as compared with the negative. Complex patterns of theta, alpha and beta frequency brain oscillatory responses during auditory information processing are present already in children of age similar to 13 years.

Electroencephalograms were recorded from 14 low (89 < IQ < I 10) and 14 high (121 < IQ < 142) IQ individuals as they performed the SVT with either a spatial or verbal strategy. Event-related desynchronization in upper alpha (9.5-12.5 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) bands showed that different strategies evoked different activation patterns, but these patterns did not differ between groups. However, an IQ-related correlate was found in the preparation interval. Thus, although processing patterns during task performance seem to depend on the strategy used for task execution, preparation for task processing may depend on IQ.

J	Nokia, MS; Penttonen, M; Korhonen, T; Wikgren, J				Nokia, Miriam S.; Penttonen, Markku; Korhonen, Tapani; Wikgren, Jan			Hippocampal theta (3-8 Hz) activity during classical eyeblink conditioning in rabbits	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						hippocampus; EEG; classical conditioning; delay conditioning	NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; LATENT INHIBITION; LEARNING RATE; TRACE; MEMORY; ACQUISITION; RHYTHM; INACTIVATION; OSCILLATIONS	In 1978, Berry and Thompson showed that the amount of theta (3-8 Hz) activity in the spontaneous hippocampal EEG predicted learning rate in subsequent eyeblink conditioning in rabbits. More recently, the absence of theta activity during the training trial has been shown to have a detrimental effect on learning rate. Here, we aimed to further explore the relationship between theta activity and classical eyeblink conditioning by determining how the relative power of hippocampal theta activity [theta/(theta + delta) ratio] changes during both unpaired control and paired training phases. We found that animals with a higher hippocampal theta ratio immediately before conditioning learned faster and also that in these animals the theta ratio was higher throughout both experimental phases. In fact, while the hippocampal theta ratio remained stable in the fast learners as a function of training, it decreased in the slow learners already during unpaired training. In addition, the presence of hippocampal theta activity enhanced the hippocampal model of the conditioned response (CR) and seemed to be beneficial for CR performance in terms of peak latency during conditioning, but did not have any effect when the animals showed asymptotic learning. Together with earlier findings, these results imply that the behavioral state in which hippocampal theta activity is absent is detrimental for learning, and that the behavioral state in which hippocampal theta activity dominates is beneficial for learning, at least before a well-learned state is achieved.

The place of 'codes' in nonlinear neurodynamics	COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE: THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO BRAIN FUNCTION	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review; Book Chapter						action-perception cycle; electroencephalogram; intentional arc; mesoscopic brain dynamics; neural code; phenomenology; reflex arc; scale-free cortical dynamics; wave packet	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; MULTICORTICAL PATTERNS; NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; SCALP EEG; ORIGIN; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSITIONS; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; DYNAMICS	A key problem in cognitive science is to explain the neural mechanisms of the rapid transposition between stimulus energy and abstract concept - between the specific and the generic - in both material and conceptual aspects, not between neural and psychic aspects. Three approaches by researchers to a solution in terms of neural codes are considered. Materialists seek rate and frequency codes in the interspike intervals of trains of action potentials induced by stimuli and carried by topologically organized axonal lines. Cognitivists refer to the symbol grounding problem and search for symbolic codes in firings of hierarchically organized feature-detector neurons of phonemes, lines, odorants, pressures, etc., that object-detector neurons bind into representations of probabilities of stimulus occurrence. Dynamicists seek neural correlates of stimuli and associated behaviors in spatial patterns of oscillatory fields of dendritic activity that self-organize and evolve as trajectories through high-dimensional brain state space; the codes are landscapes of chaotic attractors. Unlike codes in DNA and the periodic table, these codes have neither alphabet nor syntax. They are epistemological metaphors required by experimentalists to measure neural activity and by engineers to model brain functions. Here I review the central neural mechanisms of olfaction as a paradigm for use of codes to explain how brains create cortical activities that mediate sensation, perception, comprehension, prediction, decision, and action or inaction.

We observed in several patients rhythms of same localization and frequency as sleep spindles, immediately preceding and sometimes continuing at seizure onsets. We aimed to study the link between sleep spindles and seizure onsets. Methods: We used intracerebral stereo-EEG ictal recordings of two MRI-negative patients with clinically defined NFLE. For each of the six studied seizures, sustained activity in the frontal sleep spindle frequency (12 Hz) was observed around seizure onset. The duration of this pre-seizure sleep spindle was compared to that of the 10 preceding sleep spindles. Results: The pre-seizure sleep spindles were clearly of longer duration than the "interictal" sleep spindles for all seizures. This sustained pre-seizure 12 Hz activity could be differentiated from normal awakenings, and showed no spatial relation to the ictal onset. Conclusions: We demonstrated a functional alteration of the sleep spindle-generating thalamocortical loop concomitant with the seizure onsets. This defect may also be involved in seizure generation. Significance: A thalamic participation in NFLE pathogenesis is likely in our two patients. The study of additional patients will allow to evaluate the role of the thalamocortical circuits in NFLE.

According to a recent hypothesis, the homeostatic decrease of sleep SWA is due to a progressive decrease in the strength of corticocortical connections. This hypothesis was evaluated in a large-scale thalamocortical model, which showed that a decrease in synaptic strength, implemented through a reduction of postsynaptic currents, resulted in lower sleep SWA in simulated local field potentials (LFP). The decrease in SWA was associated with a decreased proportion of high-amplitude slow waves, a decreased slope of the slow waves, and an increase in the number of multipeak waves. Here we tested the model predictions by obtaining LFP recordings from the rat cerebral cortex and comparing conditions of high homeostatic sleep pressure (early sleep) and low homeostatic sleep pressure (late sleep). Design: Intracortical LFP recordings during baseline sleep and after 6 hours of sleep deprivation. Setting: Basic sleep research laboratory. Patients or Participants: WKY adult male rats. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Early sleep (sleep at the beginning of the major sleep phase, sleep immediately after sleep deprivation) was associated with (1) high SWA, (2) many large slow waves, (3) steep slope of slow waves, and (4) rare occurrence of multipeak waves. By contrast, late sleep (sleep at the end of the major sleep phase, sleep several hours after the end of sleep deprivation) was associated with (1) low SWA, (2) few high-amplitude slow waves, (3) reduced slope of slow waves, and (4) more frequent multipeak waves. Conclusion: In rats, changes in sleep SWA are associated with changes in the amplitude and slope of slow waves, and in the number of multipeak waves. Such changes in slow-wave parameters are compatible with the hypothesis that average synaptic strength decreases in the course of sleep.

Whole head MEG recordings were made from 13 participants who were asked to passively observe finger movement sequences, observe these sequences with the knowledge they would later have to perform the sequence presented, and finally, to perform a nonmotor mathematics task based on the finger-movement sequences. Beta-band (15-35 Hz) sensorimotor desynchronization was found in overlapping areas during passive observation and in a separate motor execution condition, indicating the activity of the human mirror neuron system. The beta desynchronization in these areas was enhanced relative to passive viewing when participants had to watch the stimuli to later imitate and when they performed the mathematics task, indicating that mirror neuron system activity can be modulated by attention.

The main focus so far has been on corticomuscular coherence (CMC) during static force condition, for which coherence in beta-range has been described. In contrast, we showed in a recent study [1] that dynamic force condition is accompanied by gamma-range CMC. The modulation of the CMC by various dynamic force amplitudes, however, remained uninvestigated. The present study addresses this question. We examined eight healthy human subjects. EEG and surface EMG were recorded simultaneously. The visuomotor task consisted in isometric compensation for 3 forces (static, small and large dynamic) generated by a manipulandum. The CMC, the cortical EEG spectral power (SP), the EMG SP and the errors in motor performance (as the difference between target and exerted force) were analyzed. Results: For the static force condition we found the well-documented, significant beta-range CMC (15-30 Hz) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Gamma-band CMC (30-45 Hz) occurred in both small and large dynamic force conditions without any significant difference between both conditions. Although in some subjects beta-range CMC was observed during both dynamic force conditions no significant difference between conditions could be detected. With respect to the motor performance, the lowest errors were obtained in the static force condition and the highest ones in the dynamic condition with large amplitude. However, when we normalized the magnitude of the errors to the amplitude of the applied force (relative errors) no significant difference between both dynamic conditions was observed. Conclusion: These findings confirm that during dynamic force output the corticomuscular network oscillates at gamma frequencies. Moreover, we show that amplitude modulation of dynamic force has no effect on the gamma CMC in the low force range investigated. We suggest that gamma CMC is rather associated with the internal state of the sensorimotor system as supported by the unchanged relative error between both dynamic conditions.

The deployment of intersensory selective attention: A high-density electrical mapping study of the effects of theanine	CLINICAL NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						theanine; attention; attentional deployment; alpha oscillations; multisensory; EEG	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ANTICIPATORY ATTENTION; HUMAN EEG; ALPHA; METHYLPHENIDATE; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; DISORDER; DEFICITS	Objective: ingestion of the nonproteinic amino acid theanine (5-N-ethylglutamine) has been shown to increase oscillatory brain activity in the so-called alpha band (8-14 Hz) during resting electroencephalographic recordings in humans. Independently, alpha band activity has been shown to be a key component in selective attentional processes. Here, we set out to assess whether theanine would cause modulation of anticipatory alpha activity during selective attentional deployments to stimuli in different sensory modalities, a paradigm in which robust alpha attention effects have previously been established. Methods: Electrophysiological data from 168 scalp electrode channels were recorded while participants performed a standard intersensory attentional cuing task. Results: As in previous studies, significantly greater alpha band activity was measured over parieto-occipital scalp for attentional deployments to the auditory modality than to the visual modality. Theanine ingestion resulted in a substantial overall decrease in background alpha levels relative to placebo while subjects were actively performing this demanding attention task. Despite this decrease in background alpha activity, attention-related alpha effects were significantly greater for the theanine condition. Conclusion: This increase of attention-related anticipatory alpha over the right parieto-occipital scalp suggests that theanine may have a specific effect on the brain's attention circuitry. We conclude that theanine has clear psychoactive properties, and that it represents a potentially interesting, naturally occurring compound for further study, as it relates to the brain's attentional system.

J	Jancke, L; Brunner, B; Esslen, M				Jaencke, Lutz; Brunner, Beatrice; Esslen, Michaela			Brain activation during fast driving in a driving simulator: the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; driving; executive functions; lateral prefrontal cortex; low resolution electrical tomography	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; DECISION-MAKING; VIRTUAL-REALITY; FMRI; EEG; LOCALIZATION; INTEGRATION; TOMOGRAPHY; BEHAVIOR; RISK	Little is currently known about the neural underpinnings of the cognitive control of driving behavior in realistic situations and of the driver's speeding behavior in particular. In this study, participants drove in realistic scenarios presented in a high-end driving simulator. Scalp-recorded EEG oscillations in the a-band (8-13 Hz) with a 30-electrode montage were recorded while the participants drove under different conditions: (i) excessively fast (Fast), (ii) in a controlled manner at a safe speed (Correct), and (iii) impatiently in the context of testing traffic conditions (Impatient). Intracerebral sources of a-band activation were estimated using low resolution electrical tomography. Given that previous studies have shown a strong negative correlation between the Bold response in the frontal cortex and the a-band power, we used or-band-related activity as an estimation of frontal activation. Statistical analysis revealed more a-band-related activity (i.e. less neuronal activation) in the right lateral prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, during fast driving. Those participants who speeded most and exhibited greater risk-taking behavior demonstrated stronger a-related activity (i.e. less neuronal activation) in the left anterior lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are discussed in the context of current theories about the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex in controlling risk-taking behavior, task switching, and multitasking.

The microstructure of active and quiet sleep as cortical delta activity emerges in infant rats	SLEEP			English	Article						development; EEG; behavior; cortex; slow activity transient; early network oscillation; GABA	CALCIUM WAVES; ONTOGENY; PATTERNS; ATONIA; STATE; EEG; REM	Study objectives: Previous investigators have suggested that quiet sleep (QS) in rats develops rapidly upon the emergence of cortical delta activity around postnatal day (P) 11 and that the presence of "half-activated" active sleep (AS) suggests that infant sleep is initially disorganized. To address these issues, we examined the temporal organization of sleep states during the second postnatal week in rats as delta activity emerges. Design: Subjects were P9, P11, and P13 Sprague-Dawley rats. Electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram electrodes were implanted, and data were recorded at thermoneutrality for 2 hours. Results: At all ages, using electromyogram and behavioral criteria, QS (defined as nuchal atonia and behavioral quiescence) dominated the first third of each sleep period, whereas AS (defined as nuchal atonia accompanied by myoclonic twitching) dominated the last third. When delta activity, which was first detected at P11, could be added to the definition of QS, gross assessments of sleep-state organization were not altered, although it was now possible to identify brief periods of QS interposed between periods of AS. No evidence of "half-activated" AS was found. Finally, "slow activity transients" were detected and were primarily associated with QS; their rate of occurrence declined as delta activity emerged. Conclusions: When delta activity emerges at P11, it integrates smoothly with periods of QS, as defined using electromyogram and behavioral criteria alone. Delta activity helps to refine estimates of QS duration but does not reflect a significant alteration of sleep-state organization. Rather, this organization is expressed much earlier in ontogeny as fluctuations in muscle tone and associated phasic motor activity.	[Seelke, Adele M.

The MEGs of 20 AD patients and 21 elderly controls were recorded with eyes closed at rest during 5 min from 148 channels. Five spectral parameters were estimated from PSD: mean frequency (MF), individual alpha frequency (IAF), transition frequency (TF), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) and spectral entropy (SE). To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, we applied a principal component analysis. According to our results, MF was the best discriminating index between both groups (85.00% sensitivity, 85.71% specificity) indicating a shift to the left of the power spectrum in AD. A significant MEG slowing was also observed using both IAF (p < 0.001) and TF (p < 0.01). The lowest classification statistics (65% sensitivity, 66.67% specificity) were obtained with SEF95. However, these results were also significant (p < 0.05). This fact points out that there is a variation in the spectral content at high frequencies of AD patients and controls. Finally, a significant decrease of irregularity in the AD group was observed with SE, with results close to those obtained with MF (90.00% sensitivity, 76.19% specificity). In conclusion, a complete description of PSD can help to increase our insight into brain dysfunction in AD and to extract spectral patterns specific to the disease. (C) 2006 IPEM.

Neurometabolism in human epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Annual Merritt Putnam Symposium held at the Annual Meeting of the American-Epilepsy-Society	DEC, 2006	San Diego, CA			glutamate; neurometabolism; microdialysis; mr spectroscopy; energetics	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; MITOCHONDRIAL UNCOUPLING PROTEINS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PREVENTS NEURONAL DEATH; N-ACETYL-ASPARTATE; EXPERIMENTAL-MODEL; ENERGY-METABOLISM; GABA RELEASE; GLUTAMATE; SEIZURE	Purpose: Because of the large and continuous energetic requirements of brain function, neurometabolic dysfunction is a key pathophysiologic aspect of the epileptic brain. Additionally, neurometabolic dysfunction has many self-propagating features that are typical of epileptogenic processes, that is, where each occurrence makes the likelihood of further mitochondrial and energetic injury more probable. Thus abnormal neurometabolism may be not only a chronic accompaniment of the epileptic brain, but also a direct contributor to epileptogenesis. Methods: We examine the evidence for neurometabolic dysfunction in epilepsy, integrating human studies of metabolic imaging, electrophysiology, microdialysis, as well as intracranial EEG and neuropathology. Results: As an approach of noninvasive functional imaging, quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) measured abnormalities of mitochondrial and energetic dysfunction (via 1H or 31P spectroscopy) are related to several pathophysiologic indices of epileptic dysfunction. With patients undergoing hippocampal resection, intraoperative 13C-glucose turnover studies show a profound decrease in neurotransmitter (glutamate-glutamine) cycling relative to oxidation in the sclerotic hippocampus. Increased extracellular glutamate (which has long been associated with increased seizure likelihood) is significantly linked with declining energetics as measured by 31P MR, as well as with increased EEG measures of Teager energy, further arguing for a direct role of glutamate with hyperexcitability. Discussion: Given the important contribution that metabolic performance makes toward excitability in brain, it is not surprising that numerous aspects of mitochondrial and energetic state link significantly with electrophysiologic and microdialysis measures in human epilepsy. This may be of particular relevance with the self-propagating nature of mitochondrial injury, but may also help define the conditions for which interventions may be developed.

While the "evoked theory" sees no interaction between VEP generation and the alpha rhythm, the "oscillatory theory" (also known as "phase-reset theory") postulates VEP generation to be based on alpha rhythm phase resetting. Previous experimental results are contradictory, rendering a straightforward interpretation difficult. Our approach was to theoretically model the implications of the evoked and oscillatory theory also incorporating stimulus-induced alpha-rhythm desynchronization. As a result, the model based on the oscillatory theory predicts alpha-band dependent VEP amplitudes but constant phase locking. The model based on the evoked theory predicts unaffected VEP amplitudes but alpha-band dependent phase locking. Subsequently, we analyzed experimental data in which VEPs were assessed in an "eyes open" and "eyes closed" condition in 17 subjects. For early components of the VEP, findings are in agreement with the evoked theory, i.e. VEP amplitudes remain unaffected and phase locking decreases during periods of high alpha activity. Late VEP component amplitudes (>175 ms), however, are dependent on pre-stimulus alpha amplitudes. This interaction is contradictory to the oscillatory theory since this VEP amplitude difference is not paralleled by a corresponding difference in alpha-band amplitude in the affected time window. In summary, by using a model-based approach we identified early VEPs to be compatible with the evoked theory, while results of late VEPs support a modulatory but not causative role - the latter implied by the oscillatory theory - of alpha activity for EP generation.

J	Tolmacheva, EA; van Luijtelaar, G				Tolmacheva, Elena A.; van Luijtelaar, Gilles			Absence seizures are reduced by the enhancement of GABA-ergic inhibition in the hippocampus in WAG/Rij rats	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						absence seizures; hippocampus; progesterone; tiagabine; GABA; WAG/Rij rats	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; GENETIC MODEL; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; STRASBOURG; TIAGABINE; BEHAVIOR; STRAIN	Classical theories on absence epilepsy suggest that spike-wave discharge (SWDs) represent thalamo-cortical oscillations, where an abnormally excitable cortex interacts with thalamus and brain stem reticular formation. The limbic system is generally not included in any theory about the pathogenesis of absence seizures. However, some data demonstrated that the alterations in the limbic system attribute to the expression of absence epileptic phenotype in genetic models of absence epilepsy. The present study investigated whether local intrahippocampal administration of progesterone (a GABA(A)-mimetic) and tiagabine (an inhibitor of GABA (re)uptake) might affect the occurrence of SWDs. Mate WAG/Rij rats were implanted with permanent electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes and bilateral cannulas in the CA1-CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Control rats had bilateral cannulas in the cortical area above the hippocampus. Rats received intracerebral injections of progesterone (5 mg/ml), 45% beta-cyclodextrin (CD), saline, or tiagabine (2 mg/ml). EEG recordings were made before and after injection. Progesterone, CD, and tiagabine administration to the hippocampus reduced SWDs for 60 min following administration without behavioral or electroencephalographic side-effects. Both progesterone administration into the cortex and saline injection into the hippocampus yielded no changes in the occurrence of SWDs. These data suggest that activation of GABA-ergic transmission in the hippocampus has an inhibitory effect on cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits underlying the generation of SWDs and might be critically involved in the regulation of absence seizures.

Striatal LFPs were recorded with a device that allowed us to simultaneously record field potentials and apply drugs by reverse microdialysis at the same site. Administration of the GABA(A)-receptor antagonist gabazine ( SR95531, 10 and 500 mu M) induced large- amplitude LFP fluctuations at the infusion site, occurring every 2-5 s for about 2 h after the start of the 20-min drug administration. These events were prevented by cotreatment with a GABA(A)-receptor agonist ( muscimol, 100 mu M) or a combination of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists ( CNQX and MK-801, each given at 100 mu M). Gabazine ( 10 mu M) also increased the firing of single neurons recorded close to the injection site, but in most cases there was no correlation between single-neuron activity and the concomitantly recorded LFP signals from the same striatal region. In contrast, intrastriatal application of gabazine increased the correlation between striatal LFPs and EEG, and resulted in the appearance of recurrent EEG events that were temporally related to the striatal LFP events. These data provide evidence that a GABAergic "tone" in the monkey striatum controls the spontaneous activity of striatal neurons, as well as the level of striatal and cortical synchrony.

The support through top-down knowledge is inevitable but can we identify brain. measures of this matching process between degraded auditory input and possible meaning? To answer these questions, the present study investigated the modulation of the induced gamma-band activity (GBA) in the auditory domain in response to degraded speech. During an EEG experiment subjects first listened to digitally degraded unintelligible speech signals (derived from German nouns). In an exposure sequence, half of the nouns were presented in a non-degraded intelligible format and memorized, while in the crucial test sequence subjects listened to all degraded speech signals again and were asked to identify the words. The induced GBA (40-Hz range) showed an increase at left temporal electrode sites around 350 ms only for words correctly identified in the test sequence. No differences in induced GBA were evident in the baseline sequence; neither did the evoked brain potentials yield any comparable effect. We conclude that the observed enhancement in induced gamma-band activity reflects a matching process of top-down lexical memory traces with degraded sensory input to form a comprehendible speech percept. The findings are highly corroborant to analogous studies in the visual system. They lend further plausibility to a left-lateralized fronto-temporal network enabling lexically guided speech perception, and they demonstrate the complementary role of time-sensitive brain analyses in discerning the functional neuroanatomy of speech.

Towards an EMG-controlled prosthetic hand using a 3-D electromagnetic positioning system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						electroencephalographic (EEG); electromagnetic sensor; electromyographic (EMG); 3-D electromagnetic positioning system		This paper proposes a novel method of using electromyographic (EMG) potentials generated by the forearm muscles during hand and finger movements to control an artificial prosthetic hand worn by an amputee. Surface EMG sensors were used to record a sequence of forearm EMG potential signals via a PC sound card and a novel 3-D electromagnetic positioning system together with a data-glove mounted with 11 miniature electromagnetic sensors used to acquire corresponding human hand pose in real time. The synchronized measurements of hand posture and associated EMG signals stored as prototypes embody a numerical expression of the current hand shape in the form of a series of data frames, each comprising a set of postures and associated EMG data. This allows a computer generated graphical 3-D model, combined with synthesized EMG signals, to be used to evaluate the approach. This graphical user interface could, also enable handicapped users to practice controlling a robotic prosthetic hand using EMG signals derived from their forearm muscles. We believe this task might be made easier using a dictionary of stored task-specific prototype data frames acquired from able-bodied users. By comparing the resulting EMG data frames with stored prototypes, the most likely data frame sequence can be identified and used to control a robotic hand so that it carries out the user's desire. We explore the feasibility of this approach by applying frequency analysis on the signal derived from a multichannel EMG measurement device and identify pattern recognition techniques in the time and frequency domains to determine plausible hand shapes. This approach offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it simplifies the classification procedure, saving computational time and the requirement for the optimization process, and second, it increases the number of recognizable hand shapes, which in turn improves the dexterity of the prosthetic hand and the quality of life for amputees. The database of EMG prototypes could be employed to optimize the accuracy of the system within a machine learning paradigm. By making a range of EMG prototype databases available, prosthetic hand users could train themselves to use their prosthesis using the visual reference afforded by the virtual hand model to provide feedback.

Study design Patterns of sleep spindles during NREM sleep stages 2 and 3-4 (slow-wave-sleep, SWS) were compared in 26 otherwise healthy 6-month-old Chilean infants with iron-deficiency anemia and 18 non-anemic control infants. From polygraphic recordings, EEG activity was analyzed for sleep spindles to assess their number (density), duration, frequency, and inter-spindle interval. Results Iron-deficient anemic infants differed from the control group by having sleep spindles with reduced density, lower frequency, and longer inter-spindle intervals in NREM sleep stage 2 and SWS. Conclusions These results provide evidence of delayed sleep spindle patterns in iron-deficient anemic infants, suggesting that iron is an essential micronutrient for the normal progression of NREM sleep pattern development in the human.

Commonly, information transfer between brain areas is analyzed with the help of correlation measures for electrophysiological data. However, such approaches cannot distinguish between mutual coupling and other mechanisms of creating correlations between responses, such as common input from other sources. Functional coupling is mandatory for information transfer. Here we propose to analyze coupling between active brain areas with the help of models described by a system of differential-algebraic equations. Comparing models with various degrees of coupling, we show that mutual information transfer can be distinguished from one-way information transfer for activated cortical areas estimated by source localization techniques. We exemplify the technique with fast oscillatory activity found in both cortical areas 3b and 1 after peripheral nerve stimulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Functional connectivity was assessed with electroencepha log ra phic coherence between pairs of electrodes in a high-density electrode array in narrow frequency bands among 18 adults with ASD and 18 control adults in an eyes closed resting state. Results: In the theta (3-6 Hz) frequency range, locally elevated coherence was evident for the ASD group, especially within left hemisphere frontal and temporal regions. In the lower alpha range (8-10 Hz), globally reduced coherence was evident for the ASD group within frontal regions and between frontal and all other scalp regions. The ASD group exhibited significantly greater relative power between 3 and 6 Hz and 13-17 Hz and significantly less relative power between 9 and 10 Hz. Conclusions: Robust patterns of over- and under-connectivity are apparent at distinct spatial and temporal scales in ASD subjects in the eyes closed resting state.

The present study analyzed 63 babies' and children's (27 days to 5.5 years) cerebral responses to a pattern-reversal visual stimulation using high-density (128 electrodes) electrophysiological recordings. Developmental data were further compared with those of young adults (n = 16). Tremendous changes in pattern visual evoked potentials (pVEPs) morphology were observed between 7 and 24 months characterized by the emergence of negative components labeled "N70" and "N145" and the reduction of the P100 amplitude. The adult pattern of response appears from 24 months onward. Spectral density values show an increase of higher frequencies with age. Coherence values show a reduction between 3 and 23 months of age as well as a further increase toward adulthood between areas implicated in visual processing. These results are discussed in light of developmental features such as synaptogenesis, myelination, and neuronal networks refinement.

The case of a patient with refractory bitemporal epilepsy is presented. Extraoperative monitoring with depth and subdural electrodes revealed an ictal pattern with a build-up of high-frequency (> 80 Hz) activity originating in the cortex, with spread to both hippocampi. This observation was only revealed with the use of high-pass filtering, and represented crucial information that significantly influenced the decision about the side, localization and extent of resection. Removal of the cortex generating high-frequency activity, led to cessation of seizures in this patient. Current knowledge about the role of high-frequency activity and the case presented here A support the importance of recording with equipment capable of detecting fast A activity during the presurgical invasive monitoring. An active search for a high-frequency seizure onset zone in patients with structurally-unaffected hippocampi may improve the outcome beyond that possible with conventional bandwidth, invasive EEG recordings.

Emergent network topology at seizure onset in humans	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						seizures; electrocorticogram; oscillations; correlation structure; network analysis; multivariate time series analysis	SMALL-WORLD; EEG ACTIVITY; EPILEPSY; PROPAGATION	Epilepsy-the world's most common serious brain disorder-is defined by recurrent unprovoked seizures that result from complex interactions between distributed neural populations. We explore some macroscopic characteristics of emergent ictal networks by considering intracranial recordings from human subjects with intractable epilepsy. For each seizure, we compute a simple measure of Linear coupling between all electrode pairs (more than 2400) to define networks of interdependent electrodes during preictal and ictal time intervals. We analyze these networks by applying traditional measures from network analysis and identify statistically significant global and Local changes in network topology. We find at seizure onset a diffuse breakdown in global coupling, and local changes indicative of increased throughput of specific cortical and subcortical regions. We conclude that network analysis yields measures to summarize the complicated coupling topology emergent at seizure onset. Using these measures, we can identify spatially localized brain regions that may facilitate seizures and may be potential targets for focal therapies. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The article dedicated to the centenary of academician Mikhail Nikolaevich Livanov briefly outlines the history of development of his original concept of the functional significance of the brain potential's spatial synchronization phenomenon as a possible way of studying systemic organization of the brain electrical activity. The new parameter of "space" introduced into neurophysiology by M.N. Livanov made it possible to research the earlier unknown aspect of the brain activity. Livanov's ideas have been developed in many studies of the late decades of the XX century. In the review, much attention is given to specific functional significance of this phenomenon in a broad frequency band 1-250 Hz, especially, during instrumental learning. Energy (power spectra) and coherent-phase characteristics of cortical potentials in traditional (1-30 Hz), gamma-(30-80 Hz) and high-frequency (80-250 Hz) bands are compared. The problem of linear and nonlinear processes in the organization of the brain potentials is mentioned.

Recently, it has been suggested that functional segregation may also be achieved in the frequency domain, by selective coupling of related activities at different frequencies. So far, however, any coupling across frequency in the human has only been modeled in terms of unidirectional influences, a misplaced assumption given the looped architecture of the basal ganglia, and has been considered in static terms. Here, we investigate the pattern of bidirectional coupling between mesial and lateral cortical areas and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at rest and during movement, with and without pharmacological dopaminergic input, in patients with Parkinson's disease. We simultaneously recorded scalp electroencephalographic activity and local field potentials from depth electrodes and deduced patterns of directed coherence between cortical and STN levels across three frequency bands [sub-beta (3-13 Hz), beta(14-35 Hz), gamma(65-90 Hz)] in the different states. Our results show (1) asymmetric bidirectional coupling between STN and both mesial and lateral cortical areas with greater drives from cortex to STN at frequencies <35 Hz, (2) a drop of beta band coupling driven from mesial cortex to STN during movement, and (3) an increase in symmetrical bidirectional drives between STN and mesial cortex and in lateral cortical drive to STN in the gamma band after dopaminergic therapy. The results confirm a bidirectional pattern of cortico-basal ganglia communication that is differentially patterned across frequency bands and changes with movement and dopaminergic input.

Altered phase precession and compression of temporal sequences by place cells in epileptic rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hippocampus; place cells; temporal lobe epilepsy; phase precession; temporal coding; oscillations	MEDIAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEONATAL SEIZURES; SPATIAL MEMORY; UNIT-ACTIVITY; BRAIN-DAMAGE; KAINIC ACID; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; MODEL; INHIBITION	In the hippocampus, pyramidal cells encode information in two major ways: rate coding and temporal coding. Rate coding, in which information is coded through firing frequency, is exemplarily illustrated by place cells, characterized by their location-specific firing. In addition, the precise temporal organization of firing of multiple place cells provides information, in a compressed time window, about the temporal sequence of the locations visited by the animal. This encoding is accomplished through phase precession, a phenomenon whereby unit firing is linked to theta rhythm, one of the major hippocampal EEG oscillations. Although it is likely that this type of processing is critical for normal brain function, its involvement in pathologies associated with cognitive disorders is unknown. In this experiment, we determined whether the temporal organization of place cell firing is affected in an animal model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), a disease accompanied with cognitive impairment. We investigated hippocampal coding and its relationship to theta rhythm in rats after status epilepticus (SE), a condition that leads to MTLE. We found a great proportion of SE place cells had aberrant phase/precession pattern and temporal organization of firing among pairs of neurons, which constitutes the compression of temporal sequences, was altered in SE rats. The same animals were also markedly impaired in the water maze task, a measure of spatial memory. We propose that the synaptic and cellular alterations observed in MTLE induce aberrant temporal coding in the hippocampus, contributing in turn to cognitive dysfunction.

The aim of this study was to further characterize the dynamic nature of the brain at rest by investigating the presence and distribution of coherent, transient BOLD activity in resting fMRI data using a novel method of MRI data analysis - 2dTCA. Material/Methods: High-field fMRI data were acquired in 27 subjects. The temporal clustering analysis, 2dTCA, was implemented to determine the timing of significant, spatially coherent, transient BOLD signal changes. Group maps of positive and negative coherent BOLD changes from each timing profile were created. Results: Spontaneous increases in BOLD activity at both 3T and 4T and decreases at 4T were found in regions of the alpha rhythm circuit including the thalamus, precuneus and the occipital cortex. Additional positive and negative oscillations at 4T and a small region of positive activity at 3T were identified in the area of the brain stem reticular formation, the control center for maintaining arousal and motivation. Conclusions: These results provide additional evidence for the presence of dynamic functional networks in the resting brain that are active while the subjects appear to be at rest and that are spatially distributed in areas responsible for maintaining consciousness and vigilance including brain stem. These findings should be considered in interpreting fMRI results which use resting baseline for comparisons.

Currently, dental acrylic and anchoring screws are used to cement implanted electrodes. This technique works well for adult animals but often encounters difficulty when employed in young mice because their skulls are not strong enough to bear the anchoring screws. Here we describe a novel method favorable for implantation of intra-cranial electrodes in mice as young as postnatal 18 days and suitable for long-term intra-cranial electroencephalographic recordings. Our approach is to construct a multi-electrode assembly according to the desired stereotaxic coordinates of intra-cranial recordings and to secure the implanted electrode assembly to the skull via glue rather than dental acrylic/anchoring screws. The surgical operation for such electrode implantation is relatively quick and rarely associated with complications such as infection, bleeding, neurological deficits, spontaneous seizures or behavioral disturbances. The implanted electrodes are stable, allowing repeated monitoring for several months. Data obtained by simultaneous intra-hippocampal and intra-cortical recordings indicate that our method is suitable for the examination of behaviorally related electroencephalographic activities and experimentally induced seizures. Technical aspects of our methods are discussed, and the procedures for constructing the electrode assembly are presented in detail. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A human intracranial study of long-range oscillatory coherence across a frontal-occipital-hippocampal brain network during visual object processing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						vision; EEG; beta oscillations; hippocampus; perceptual closure	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL NETWORKS; CLOSURE PROCESSES; PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; RECOGNITION; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION	Visual object-recognition is thought to involve activation of a distributed network of cortical regions, nodes of which include the lateral prefrontal cortex, the so-called lateral occipital complex (LOC), and the hippocampal formation. It has been proposed that long-range oscillatory synchronization is a major mode of coordinating such a distributed network. Here, intracranial recordings were made from three humans as they performed a challenging visual object-recognition task that required them to identify barely recognizable fragmented line-drawings of common objects. Subdural electrodes were placed over the prefrontal cortex and LOC, and depth electrodes were placed within the hippocampal formation. Robust beta-band coherence was evident in all subjects during processing of recognizable fragmented images. Significantly lower coherence was evident during processing of unrecognizable scrambled versions of the same. The results indicate that transient beta-band oscillatory coupling between these three distributed cortical regions may reflect a mechanism for effective communication during visual object processing.

Synchronized delta oscillations correlate with the resting-state functional MRI signal	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						electroencephalogram; spontaneous fluctuations; functional connectivity	ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; HUMAN BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA; COHERENCE; RESONANCE; FMRI; EEG; VISUALIZATION	Synchronized low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations of the functional MRI (fMRI) signal have recently been applied to investigate large-scale neuronal networks of the brain in the absence of specific task instructions. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of these fluctuations remain largely unknown. To this end, electrophysiological recordings and resting-state fMRI measurements were conducted in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Using a seed-voxel analysis strategy, region-specific, anesthetic dose-dependent fMRI resting-state functional connectivity was detected in bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL) of the resting brain. Cortical electroencephalographic signals were also recorded from bilateral S1FL; a visual cortex locus served as a control site. Results demonstrate that, unlike the evoked fMRI response that correlates with power changes in the gamma bands, the resting-state fMRI signal correlates with the power coherence in low-frequency bands, particularly the delta band. These data indicate that hemodynamic fMRI signal differentially registers specific electrical oscillatory frequency band activity, suggesting that fMRI may be able to distinguish the ongoing from the evoked activity of the brain.

DYNAMICS OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES DURING EVOLUTION AND PROPAGATION	COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE IN EPILEPSY			English	Article; Book Chapter							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG; PATTERNS; COMPLEXITY; GENERATION; ALGORITHM	Epileptic seizures are rapidly evolving dynamic events which typically last less than two minutes. The need to understand better the dynamics of these transient events is important in part because of increased interest in responsive neurostimulation as potential therapy for epileptic seizures. The matching pursuit (MP) decomposition and Gabor atom density (GAD) are modern techniques which allow detailed time-frequency decomposition (MP) and quantification of complexity changes (GAD). This allows investigations of seizure onset, evolution and propagation of rapidly changing epileptic phenomena with a new perspective and a new level of precision. Using these methods has revealed increased complexity at the onset of many seizures and remarkable similarity of ictal onset patterns from multiple seizures from a single focus in a given patient. These methods can potentially provide insights into network mechanisms contributing to seizure generation and propagation. In this chapter, we illustrate the application of these techniques to partial seizures recorded from intracranial arrays in humans undergoing presurgical evaluations and demonstrate the possibility to identify specific ictal phases. Understanding these specific ictal dynamics can provide information that may assist seizure detection and understanding of the dynamics that contribute to propagation and seizure termination.

It has also been observed that the relative timing of place cell firing recedes as its place field is traversed - a phenomena known as phase precession. This has led to the development of a theory of theta phase coding, whereby spatial sequences being encountered on a behavioural timescale are compressed into a firing sequence of place cells which is repeated in each theta cycle and stored in an auto-associative network using spike-timing dependent plasticity. This paper provides an abstract, descriptive model of theta phase coding in a spiking neural network, and aims to investigate how learning and recall functions may be separated by the neuromodulatory action of Acetylcholine (ACh). It is demonstrated that ACh is not essential for concurrent learning and recall without interference in this case, thanks to the robust nature of the theta phase coding implementation. However, the neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity offers other advantages, and may be essential to avoid continually consolidating false predictions when learning new routes.

A computer model of connections in a mammalian hippocampal slice preparation was constructed including two recently-reported distinct inhibitory feedback circuits. When inhibition by interneurons that synapse on pyramidal dendrites,was decreased, highly localized seizure-like bursting was observed in the CA3 region similar to that which occurs experimentally under GABAergic blockade. In contrast, when inhibition by interneurons that synapse in the axosomatic region was similarly decreased, no such bursting was observed. However, when this transient inhibition was increased, normal coordinated spread of excitation was interrupted by high-frequency localized seizure-like bursting. The increase of this inhibitory input resulted in decreased cell coupling of pyramidal neurons. A decrease in phase coherence was initially observed until seizure-like activity initiated causing a net increase in coherence as has been observed in epileptic patients. These results provide a possible pathway in which a decrease in synchronization could provide the trigger for inducing epileptiform activity.

Increased absolute magnitude of gamma synchrony in first-episode psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						First-episode psychosis; Schizophrenia; Gamma synchrony; EEG; Connectivity; Neural assembly; Oddball task	TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; BAND ACTIVITY; CHRONIC-SCHIZOPHRENIA; P300 AMPLITUDE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HIGH-RISK; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION	Objectives: Recent studies have explored a model of the disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia through the demonstration of abnormal stimulus induced gamma phase synchrony (GPS). These studies have principally examined synchrony in the 40 Hz hand elicited in post-stimulus time periods, relative to a pre-stimulus baseline. In this study we examined the absolute magnitude of GPS elicited by a selective attention task, in first-episode psychosis (FEP). We hypothesized that FEP Would be associated with abnormalities in absolute GPS, particularly when required to selectively attend to task-relevant stimuli. Methods: Fifty-five first-episode psychosis (FEP) Subjects and one hundred and ten matched healthy control subjects underwent an auditory oddball selective attention task during EEG recording. The absolute magnitude of GPS was extracted for the range 35-45 Hz, and time-locked to stimulus onset. GPS averaged were computed for oddball 'target' (task-relevant) and 'non-target' (task-irrelevant) stimuli, for each subject. Results: FEP subjects showed a significant elevation in absolute GPS relative to controls, apparent across the 35-45 Hz range. This elevation was most marked in the left centro-temporal region, across the 800 ins post-stimulus period. In FEP subjects, the elevation in GPS was also greater for target compared to non-target stimuli, while healthy controls did not show a stimulus effect. Conclusion: These findings complement previous evidence for reductions in peak gamma synchrony, calculated relative to a pre-stimulus baseline, in schizophrenia. The results an excess of absolute GPS in schizophrenia may contribute to an inability to effectively integrate task-relevant information, which underlie psychotic symptoms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We have now recorded the EEG simultaneously with local field potentials and unit activity in DRN from WAG/Rij rats, one of the best established models of absence epilepsy during spontaneous SWDs. We have also compared this activity to that in the thalamocortical networks, where SWDs are generated, and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), as this brain area is reciprocally connected to the DRN. We have found that SWDs propagate to the DRN with a short delay, and that the firing rate of its neurons changes during this type of paroxysm. These results provide the first direct evidence for clear alterations in the firing properties of mPFC and DRN neurons during spontaneous SWDs. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Short-term learning of a visually guided power-grip task is associated with dynamic changes in EEG oscillatory activity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERD; desynchronisation; ERS; synchronisation; motor system; power; beta-rebound; visual force-feedback; coherence	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; CORTICAL AREAS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUOMOTOR INTEGRATION; COHERENT OSCILLATIONS; CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; BILATERAL COHERENCE	Objective: Performing a motor task after a period of training has been associated with reduced cortical activity and changes in oscillatory brain activity. Little is known about whether learning also affects the neural network associated with motor preparation and post movement processes. Here we investigate how short-term motor learning affects oscillatory brain activity during the preparation, execution, and post-movement stage of a force-feedback task. Methods: Participants performed a visually guided power-grip tracking task. EEG was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Power and coherence data for the early and late stages of the task were compared. Results: Performance improved with practice. During the preparation for the task alpha power was reduced for late experimental blocks. A movement execution-related decrease in beta power was attenuated with increasing task practice. A post-movement increase in alpha and lower beta activity was observed that decreased with learning. Coherence analysis revealed changes in cortico-cortical coupling with regard to the stage of the visuomotor task and with regard to learning. Learning was variably associated with increased coherence between contralateral and/or ipsilateral frontal and parietal, fronto-central, and occipital brain regions. Conclusions: Practice of a visuomotor power-grip task is associated with various changes in the activity of a widespread cortical network. These changes might promote visuomotor learning. Significance: This study provides important new evidence for and sheds new light on the complex nature of the brain processes underlying visuomotor integration and short-term learning.

Good times for multisensory integration: Effects of the precision of temporal synchrony as revealed by gamma-band oscillations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						bimodal; cross-modal; auditory; visual; audiovisual; asynchrony; attention; gamma; EEG; oscillatory	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; CROSS-MODAL LINKS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; RESPONSES; HUMANS; TASK	The synchronous occurrence of the unisensory components of a multisensory stimulus contributes to their successful merging into a coherent perceptual representation. Oscillatory gamma-band responses (GBRs, 30-80 Hz) have been linked to feature integration mechanisms and to multisensory processing, suggesting they may also be sensitive to the temporal alignment of multisensory stimulus components. Here we examined the effects on early oscillatory GBR brain activity of varying the precision of the temporal synchrony of the unisensory components of an audiovisual stimulus. Audio-visual stimuli were presented with stimulus onset asynchronies ranging from -125 to +125 ms. Randomized streams of auditory (A), visual (V), and audio-visual (AV) stimuli were presented centrally while subjects attended to either the auditory or visual modality to detect occasional targets. GBRs to auditory and visual components of multisensory AV stimuli were extracted for five subranges of asynchrony (e.g., A preceded by V by 100 +/- 25 ms, by 50 +/- 25 ms, etc.) and compared with GBRs to unisensory control stimuli. Robust multisensory interactions were observed in the early GBRs when the auditory and visual stimuli were presented with the closest synchrony. These effects were found over medial-frontal brain areas after 30-80 ms and over occipital brain areas after 60-120 ms. A second integration effect, possibly reflecting the perceptual separation of the two sensory inputs, was found over occipital areas when auditory inputs preceded visual by 100 25 ms. No significant interactions were observed for the other subranges of asynchrony. These results show that the precision of temporal synchrony can have an impact on early cross-modal interactions in human cortex. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electrophysiological correlates of word repetition spacing: ERP and induced band power old/new effects with massed and spaced repetitions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; induced band power; upper alpha; theta; word recognition; continuous recognition task; recall	RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; BRAIN	The EEG was recorded in 21 participants who were required to make 'old' vs. 'new' decisions during a continuous recognition memory task with massed word repetitions (i.e., immediate repetitions) and spaced word repetitions (i.e., with six intervening words). After completion of the recognition task, they were given an unexpected free recall task. Behavioral measures revealed better recognition but worse free recall with massed repetitions, and worse recognition but better free recall with spaced repetitions. The ER-P data revealed that for the 350- to 450-ms time window (representing the N400) the repetition effect was widely distributed across central and parietal scalp sites and was larger with massed than with spaced word repetitions. Peak latencies of the late positive complex (LPC) at Pz were shorter for massed than for spaced repetitions. Mean area around peak measures at Pz indicated that the LPC repetition effect was also larger with massed than with spaced repetitions. In the frequency domain, we found a theta (4-6 Hz) induced band power (IBP) repetition effect for massed repetitions, with theta power in the 250- to 625-ms time window being larger to repeated words than to new words. For spaced repetitions, we found an upper alpha (10-12 Hz) IBP repetition effect with the upper alpha power in the 625- to 1000-ms time window being smaller to repeated words than to new words. With spaced repetitions, we further found that larger LPC and theta IBP repetition effects were associated with smaller recall performance enhancements. The results mainly support a deficient processing account of the spacing effect. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Van Strien, Jan W.; Verkoeijen, Peter P. J.

With the synchronisation status of networks to represent epilepsy, then, adding pulse to stimulations to 10% of neurons to simulate the VNS, we obtain the desynchronisation status of networks (representing antiepileptic effects). The simulations show that synchronisation evolves into desynchronisation in the HH neural networks when a part (10%) of neurons are stimulated with a pulse current signal. The network desynchronisation appears to be sensitive to the stimulation parameters. For the case of the same stimulation intensity, weakly coupled networks reach desynchronisation more easily than strongly coupled networks. The network desynchronisation reduced by short-stimulation interval is more distinct than that of induced by long stimulation interval. We find that there exist the optimal stimulation interval and optimal stimulation intensity when the other stimulation parameters remain certain.

In the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) sample, we have previously reported linkage and association to the cholinergic muscarinic 2 receptor gene (CHRM2) on chromosome 7 with evoked EEG oscillations (Jones et al. 2004), providing evidence that this gene may be involved in human brain dynamics and cognition. In addition, a small number of genetic markers were genotyped in CHRM2 in the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (Comings et al. 2003) and a Dutch family study (Gosso et al. 2006, in press) and both research groups found evidence that this gene may be involved in intelligence. In the COGA sample, we have extensively genotyped SNPs within and flanking the CHRM2 gene. We find evidence of association with multiple SNPs across CHRM2 and Performance IQ, as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). These results remain significant after taking into account alcohol dependence and depression diagnoses in the sample.

Dissociation of sustained attention from central executive functions: local activity and interregional connectivity in the theta range	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cingulate gyrus; electroencephalogram; finger movements; LORETA; task-related coherence; task-related power	MEMORY LOAD; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; EEG-THETA; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; INTEGRATION; DIFFICULTY; RELEVANCE	Human brain oscillatory activity was analysed in the electroencephalographic theta frequency range (4-7 Hz) while subjects executed complex sequential finger movements with varying task difficulty and memory load. Local frontal-midline theta activity was associated with the general level of cognitive demand, with the highest amplitudes in the most demanding condition. Using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA), this theta activity was localized in the anterior cingulate gyrus including the cingulate motor area. These results suggest that local theta activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus represents correlates of an attentional system that allocate cognitive resources. In addition, interregional connectivity in the theta frequency range was modulated by memory-related executive functions independently of task difficulty. Connectivity analyses revealed a more distributed long-range network including frontal and parietal cortices during execution of novel compared with well-trained finger movement sequences. Thus, these results are compatible with a model in which theta long-range coupling indicates integration of sensory information into executive control components of complex motor behaviour.

J	Sandkuhler, S; Bhattacharya, J				Sandkuehler, Simone; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Deconstructing Insight: EEG Correlates of Insightful Problem Solving	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; UPPER ALPHA; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EFFECTS MODELS; MEMORY; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	Background. Cognitive insight phenomenon lies at the core of numerous discoveries. Behavioral research indicates four salient features of insightful problem solving: (i) mental impasse, followed by (ii) restructuring of the problem representation, which leads to (iii) a deeper understanding of the problem, and finally culminates in (iv) an "Aha!'' feeling of suddenness and obviousness of the solution. However, until now no efforts have been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of these constituent features of insight in a unified framework. Methodology/Principal Findings. In an electroencephalographic study using verbal remote associate problems, we identified neural correlates of these four features of insightful problem solving. Hints were provided for unsolved problems or after mental impasse. Subjective ratings of the restructuring process and the feeling of suddenness were obtained on trial-by-trial basis. A negative correlation was found between these two ratings indicating that sudden insightful solutions, where restructuring is a key feature, involve automatic, subconscious recombination of information. Electroencephalogram signals were analyzed in the space x time x frequency domain with a nonparametric cluster randomization test. First, we found strong gamma band responses at parieto-occipital regions which we interpreted as (i) an adjustment of selective attention (leading to a mental impasse or to a correct solution depending on the gamma band power level) and (ii) encoding and retrieval processes for the emergence of spontaneous new solutions. Secondly, we observed an increased upper alpha band response in right temporal regions (suggesting active suppression of weakly activated solution relevant information) for initially unsuccessful trials that after hint presentation led to a correct solution. Finally, for trials with high restructuring, decreased alpha power (suggesting greater cortical excitation) was observed in right prefrontal area. Conclusions/Significance. Our results provide a first account of cognitive insight by dissociating its constituent components and potential neural correlates.

The measurements were performed with eighteen subjects (21.39 +/- 2.75 ages; 12 male). Single type of tactile stimuli was applied to two fingers on the right hand: frequent (non-target) tactile stimuli and targets. The target (25%) stimuli were presented on index finger and nontarget stimuli (75%) were presented on middle finger randomly. Subjects counted the target stimuli mentally. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64 channels, 14 of which (F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-Z, C-3, C-4, T-7, T-8, P-3, P-4, P-7, P-8, O-1, O-2) were primarily analyzed. Peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes and prolongations of delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) were measured in 1000 ms following stimuli. The repeated measures ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. Delta responses to target stimuli were higher than nontarget stimuli at F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-Z, C-3, T-7, P-3, P-4, P-7, P-8 and O-2 recording sites. Delta responses to target stimuli were more prolonged than nontarget stimuli at F-3, F-4, F-Z, C-3, C-4, T-7, P-3, P-4, and O-1. Theta responses to target stimuli were more prolonged than non-targets at F-3, F-4, C-z, C-4, P-3, O-1 and O-2. In tactile oddball paradigm, delta and theta responses to the both stimuli were highly distributed on the scalp. Furthermore, delta and theta oscillations have been differentiated for the target and nontarget stimuli, possibly serving as a reference for future physiological and clinical applications.

Heart rate variability does not discriminate between different levels of haemodynamic responsiveness during surgical anaesthesia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint 12th Annual Meeting of the European-Society-of-Anaesthesiologists (ESA) and European-Academy-of-Anaesthesiology (EAA) (EUROANAESTHESIA)	JUN 05-08, 2004	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	European Soc Anaesthesiol, European Acad Anaesthesiol		anaesthetics i.v., propofol; analgesics opioid, remifentanil; heart, heart rate variability; monitoring, bispectral index; Poincare analysis	SKIN VASOMOTOR REFLEX; MIDAZOLAM SEDATION; PROPOFOL; RESPONSES; DEPTH; REMIFENTANIL; SEVOFLURANE; INDUCTION	Background. Hypnotic depth but not haemodynamic responsiveness is measured with EEG-based monitors. In this study we compared heart rate variability (HRV) in unstimulated patients and stimulation-induced HRV at different levels of anaesthesia. Methods. A total of 95 ASA I or II patients were randomly assigned to five groups (Group I: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 1 ng ml(-1); Group 2: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 3: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 4 ng ml-1; Group 4: BIS 30(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml-1; Group 5: BIS 60(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml-1). A time- and frequency-domain analysis of the RR interval (RRI) from the electrocardiogram was performed. HRV before induction, before and after a 5 s tetanic stimulus of the ulnar nerve, and before and after tracheal intubation was compared between groups, between stimuli, and between responders to intubation [systolic arterial pressure (SAP) increase > 20 mm Hg, a maximal heart rate (HR) after intubation > 90 min(-1) or both] and non-responders (ANOVA). Results. Induction of anaesthesia significantly lowered HR and HRV Mean RRI before stimulation was higher in G3 than in G1, G2, and G4 (P < 0.001), whereas the other HRV parameters were similar. Intubation induced a greater HRV response than tetanic stimulation. The mean RRI after intubation was lower in G3 compared with the other groups and the so of the RRI after tetanic stimulation was lower in G3 compared with G5. Otherwise, unstimulated HRV and stimulation-induced HRV were similar in responders and non-responders. Conclusion. HRV parameters discriminate between awake and general anaesthesia, are different after tracheal intubation and a 5 s ulnar nerve stimulation, but do not discriminate between different levels of haemodynamic responsiveness during surgical anaesthesia.

Evident seizures during sleep are common in clinical practice but are uncommonly considered in animal models of epilepsy. A previous observation of spontaneous spike-and-wave activity during sleep in several A/J mice (A/J JAX) from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) prompted this description of the inheritance of epileptic activity. Methods: Mice from A/J, C57BI/6J (136), and chromosomal substitutions strains were instrumented to record EEG and EMG activity over time without and with anti-epileptic drugs. Intercrosses were performed using linkage analysis to localize sub-chromosomal regions. Results: Spike-discharge patterns (n = 12 mice) were of average duration of 1.9 seconds at a rate per hour of 17, with an intrinsic frequency of 6.41 Hz and an amplitude of 634.8 pV. Clonic movements were observed in < 10% of the episodes. Episodes were expressed (> 75%) either in slowwave sleep or in transitions to and from slow-wave sleep. Events were rare in paradoxical sleep. Compared with vehicle, intraperitoneal administration of ethosuximide (150 mg/kg) or diazepam (5 mg/kg) inhibited or eliminated seizure activity, respectively. In contrast, spontaneous spikeand-wave activity was not observed in A/J mice from Harlan National Laboratories (Indianapolis, Ind) or in B6 mice from Jackson Laboratory. In an intercross between A/J JAX and B6 mice, the trait was not present in the first generation. The trait was observed in 2 chromosome-substitution strains, B6.A4 and B6.A7. In the intercross second generation of these chromosome-substitution strains (n = 113), significant linkage was observed to loci on chromosome 4. Conclusions: This is a sleep-related epilepsy phenotype that exhibits an oligogenic pattern of allelic inheritance.

We found that neither the amplitude enhancement after stimulus onset nor the intertrial phase coherence was generally reduced in patients, but that the topography of the neural response was altered. While healthy controls elicited their maximum early alpha as well as late theta response over posterior electrode sites, the maximum response in patients was shifted to anterior electrode positions. This result was not found for the late theta response for targets as target processing was accompanied with frontal theta amplitude enhancement in healthy controls as well. The change of the topographical response pattern was mirrored by the inter-trial phase coherence in both frequency bands. The findings imply that schizophrenia is related to multiple alterations in oscillatory networks. Even during simple tasks without high cognitive demands dysfunctional mechanisms of temporal and regional coordination appear to be of importance in schizophrenia. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Induced Gamma activity in primary visual cortex is related to luminance and not color contrast: An MEG study	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						functional imaging; visual cortex; color vision; magnetoencephalography; beamformer; gamma activity	OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RESPONSES; SIGNAL; REPRESENTATION; STIMULI; STRIATE; HUMANS; MONKEY; CAT	Gamma activity in the visual cortex has been reported in numerous EEG studies of coherent and illusory figures. A dominant theme of many such findings has been that temporal synchronization in the gamma band in response to these identifiable percepts is related to perceptual binding of the common features of the stimulus. In two recent studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and the beamformer analysis technique, we have shown that the magnitude of induced gamma activity in visual cortex is dependent upon independent stimulus features such as spatial frequency and contrast. In particular, we showed that induced gamma activity is maximal in response to gratings of 3 cycles per degree (3 cpd) of high luminance contrast. In this work, we set out to examine stimulus contrast further by using isoluminant red/green gratings that possess color but not luminance contrast using the same cohort of subjects. We found no induced gamma activity in V1 or visual cortex in response to the isoluminant gratings in these subjects who had previously shown strong induced gamma activity in V1 for luminance contrast gratings.

Three patients with intractable epilepsy who underwent invasive EEG monitoring with subdural electrodes as presurgical evaluation were studied. Electric pulse stimuli were delivered in a bipolar fashion to two adjacent electrodes on and around MC. Cortico-cortical evoked potentials were recorded by averaging electrocorticograms from the contralateral hemisphere. An initial positive triphasic or an initial negative biphasic wave was recorded when the contralateral MCs were stimulated. When the non-MC electrodes were stimulated, no response was recorded. The latencies ranged from 9.2 to 23.8 ms for the initial positive peak. and 25.4 to 39.4 ms for the initial or the second negative peak. The cortico-cortical evoked potentials responses were maximal around the homonymous electrodes with the stimulated electrodes.

Frontal-midline theta from the perspective of hippocampal "theta"	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Theta; Frontal cortex; Hippocampus; Frontal-midline theta; Rhythmical slow activity; EEG; Working memory; Spatial navigation; Episodic memory; Internalised attention; Meditation; Anxiety; Anxiolytic; Personality	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; TRAIT ANXIETY IMPACT; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; PUPPET-SHOW THETA; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALPHA-DESYNCHRONIZATION	Electrical recordings from the surface of the skull have a wide range of rhythmic components. A major task of analysis of this EEG is to determine their source and functional significance. The hippocampal "theta rhythm" has been extensively studied in rats and its rhythmicity has recently been shown to be functionally significant, per se. Here, we use relevant aspects of the hippocampal literature to provide perspective on one of the most studied human EEG rhythms: frontal-midline theta. We review its electrographic features, localization, prevalence, age distribution, behavioural modulation (particularly in relation to working memory, spatial navigation, episodic memory, internalised attention and meditation), relationship to personality, drug interactions, neurochemical relationships, and coherence with rhythmic activity at other sites. We conclude that FM-theta, like hippocampal theta, appears to play a role in (or at least occur during) processing of memory and emotion. It is correlated with working memory and/or sustained attention; but this does not entail a role in function since clear behavioural correlates of hippocampal theta have been demonstrated that are not sensitive to hippocampal damage. FM-theta is increased by anxiolytic drug action and personality-related reductions in anxiety, whereas hippocampal theta is decreased by anxiolytic drugs. In animals, frontal theta and hippocampal theta can be phase-locked or independent, depending on behavioural state. So, the cognitive functions of FM-theta, and their relationship to hippocampal theta, are unclear and definitive evidence for functional involvement in cognitive or emotional processing is lacking. One possible solution to this problem is analysis of FM-theta in animals-provided homology can be determined. The issues of sporadicity and low incidence of FM-theta also need to be addressed in the future. Changes in functional connectivity, indicated by changes in coherence, are also a largely untapped resource. We suggest that the most hopeful path to assessing the functions of FM-theta will be through the use of drugs, and the variation of their effects depending on baseline levels of FM-theta. Finally, we review some theories of theta function. Despite the apparent richness of the current data, we conclude that it is difficult (and may ultimately be impossible) to formulate a theory that attributes a specific cognitive function to FM-theta. However, the theories share some general computational assumptions and these should be a useful guide to future work and, ultimately, a definite theory of the function OF functions of FM-theta.

A total of 21 mild probable AD subjects (10 untreated, 11 treated) were compared with a group of 19 healthy controls. The members of the groups had their EEG recorded from 12 electrodes by means of a visual oddball paradigm. The evoked coherence was analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency ranges for inter-hemispheric (F-3-F-4, C-3-C-4, T-3-T-4, T-5-T-6, P-3-P-4, O-1-O-2) and long range intra-hemi spheric (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The control group showed higher values of evoked coherence in "delta", "theta" and "alpha" bands in the left fronto-parietal electrode pairs in comparison with the untreated AD group (p < 0.01 for all frequency bands). Furthermore, the control group showed higher values of evoked coherence in the left fronto-parietal electrode pair in theta frequency band (p < 0.01) and higher values of evoked coherence in the right fronto-parietal electrode pair in delta band (p < 0.01) when compared to treated AD group. The only significant difference between the treated and untreated AD groups was in the alpha band. The treated AD group showed higher values of evoked coherence at the left fronto-parietal pair in alpha band in comparison to the untreated AD group (p < 0.01). During a working memory process the coherence in the left fronto-parietal electrode pair (F-3-P-3) of AD patients is significantly decreased, thus indicating reduced connectivity between frontal and parietal sites.

During awake-immobility, icv CGP35348 induced a theta rhythm and increased gamma waves (30-100 Hz) in the hippocampus. The immunobility theta peaked at 6-7 Hz and had a theta phase in CA1 stratum radiatum of similar to 160 degrees with reference to the theta at the alveus, when compared with similar to 130 degrees during walking. Immobility theta power peaks at 6-7 Hz was also found in normal rats, and it was detected in 27% of the EEG segments during immobility. Incidence of immobility theta increased to 87.5% after 480 nmol of CGP35348 icv. Muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (5 mg/kg, ip) suppressed the induction of immobility theta and the gamma power increase after icv CGP35348. CGP35348 icv did not significantly change the hippocampal theta power at 7-8 Hz during walking (theta fundamental), but it increased power at 12-15 Hz, at the second harmonic of theta. CGP35348 icv also increased 30-50 Hz gamma l in power during walking. Medial septal infusion of CGP35348 (12 nmo 0.4 mu l) increased the power and the frequency of the hippocampal theta second harmonic during walking, but did not increase gamma activity. Infusion of CGP35348 (8 nmol in 0.4 mu l) in the hippocampus increased the local gamma activity at 30-100 Hz, but did not induce immobility theta or affect the walking theta rhythm. in conclusion, icv GABA(B); receptor blockade increased an atropine-sensitive input that generate an immobility theta rhythm, while GABAB receptor blockade of the medial septum increased atropine-resistant theta harmonics possibly generated by apical dendritic spikes. GABAB receptor blockade may enhance cognitive task performance by activating hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms in behaving rats. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Temporal dynamics of access to consciousness in the attentional blink	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; TOP-DOWN; PHASE SYNCHRONY; ALPHA; EEG; TASK; MODULATION; CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE	Presentation of two targets in close temporal succession often results in an impairment of conscious perception for the second stimulus. Previous studies have identified several electrophysiological correlates for this so-called 'attentional blink'. Components of the event-related potential (ERP) such as the N2 and the P3, but also oscillatory brain signals have been shown to distinguish between detected and missed stimuli, and thus, conscious perception. Here we investigate oscillatory responses that specifically relate to conscious stimulus processing together with potential ERP predictors. Our results show that successful target detection is associated with enhanced coherence in the low beta frequency range, but a decrease in alpha coherence before and during target presentation. In addition, we find an inverse relation between the P3 amplitudes associated with the first and second target. We conclude that the resources allocated to first and second target processing are directly nlirrored by the P3 component and, moreover, that brain states before and during stimulus presentation, as reflected by oscillatory brain activity, strongly determine the access to consciousness. Thus, becoming aware of a stimulus seems to depend on the dynamic interaction between a number of widely distributed neural processes, rather than on the modulation of one single process or component.

Changes in the correlation of activities of these structures during stimulation-evoked seizures (model of acute epilepsy) and during epileptogenesis elicited by the kindling (model of chronic epilepsy) were analysed. In the control, a high correlation between the background activities of the hippocampus and MSDB was observed. In the first days of stimulation at the parameters that evoked seizure discharges in the hippocampus, the MSDB did not show the epileptiform activity: however, repeated daily stimulation gave rise to epileptiform discharges, which increased with time. As a result of kindling, the MSDB became capable of generating seizure activity irrespective of the hippocampus. The degree of correlation between the activities of the two structures sharply decreased during "acute" and "chronic" seizures. In the process of kindling, a progressive disintegration of activities of the hippocampus and MSDB was revealed, indicating the disturbance of the functioning of septohippocampal network during epileptogenesis. The data obtained add to the knowledge about the mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy and may help to develop new approaches to the therapy of this disease. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Such implicit temporal preparation is reflected in slow brain potentials and electroencephalographic oscillations and is attributed to interval timing mechanisms that probably depend on intact basal ganglia function. We investigated implicit timing in Parkinson's disease using a choice reaction task with two temporally regular stimulus presentation regimes, both including occasional deviant interstimulus intervals. Control subjects, but not patients, demonstrated temporal preparation in the form of an adjustment in time course of slow brain potentials to the duration of the interstimulus interval. However, in both groups, timing perturbations were accompanied by a slow brain potential amplitude drop at the time of expected stimulus occurrence, demonstrating intact representation of time in patients. In patients, oscillatory activity in beta and alpha bands showed attenuated preparatory desynchronization and reduced postmovement event-related synchronization, reflecting abnormal engagement and disengagement of sensorimotor and parietal areas. The results demonstrate profoundly deficient temporal preparation with preserved encoding of temporal information, a dissociation that may be explained by impaired dopamine-dependent motor learning. The results are discussed in the context of recent work on oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia.

Silence is golden: Transient neural deactivation in the prefrontal cortex during attentive reading	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						gamma band; intracerebral EEG; reading; task-induced deactivation; ventral lateral prefrontal cortex	HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; HUMANS; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; BLINK; DESYNCHRONIZATION	It is becoming increasingly clear that attention-demanding tasks engage not only activation of specific cortical regions but also deactivation of other regions that could interfere with the task at hand. At the same time, electrophysiological studies in animals and humans have found that the participation of cortical regions to cognitive processes translates into local synchronization of rhythmic neural activity at frequencies above 40 Hz (so-called gamma-band synchronization). Such synchronization is seen as a potential facilitator of neural communication and synaptic plasticity. We found evidence that cognitive processes can also involve the disruption of gamma-band activity in high-order brain regions. Intracerebral electroencephalograms were recorded in 3 epileptic patients during 2 reading tasks. Visual presentation of words induced a strong deactivation in a broad (20-150 Hz) frequency range in the left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, in parallel with gamma-band activations within the reading network, including Broca's area. The observed energy decrease in neural signals was reproducible across patients. It peaked around 500 ms after stimulus onset and appeared subject to attention-modulated amplification. Our results suggest that cognition might be mediated by a coordinated interaction between regional gamma-band synchronizations and desynchronizations, possibly reflecting enhanced versus reduced local neural communication.

To better understand the neural mechanisms involved in concurrent sound processing, we manipulated sound onset asynchrony to induce the segregation or grouping of two concurrent sounds. Each sound consisted of amplitude-modulated tones at different carrier and modulation frequencies, allowing a cortical tagging of each sound. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out in epileptic patients with pharmacologically resistant partial epilepsy, implanted with depth electrodes in the temporal cortex. Patients were presented with the stimuli while they performed an auditory distracting task. We found that transient and steady-state evoked responses, and induced gamma oscillatory activities were enhanced in the case of onset synchrony. These effects were mainly located in the Heschl's gyrus for steady-state responses whereas they were found in the lateral superior temporal gyrus for evoked transient responses and induced gamma oscillations. They can be related to distinct neural mechanisms such as frequency selectivity and habituation. These results in the auditory cortex provide an anatomically refined description of the neurophysiological components which might be involved in the perception of concurrent sounds.

From a face to its category via a few information processing states in the brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; MEMORY	Cognitive neuroscience assumes a correspondence between specific spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity and the states of a mechanism that processes cognitive information. Mechanistic explanations of cognition should therefore translate patterns of neural activity into the components of a formal mechanism: a set of information processing states and their transitions. For the first time, we carried out this research programme with four naive observers instructed to categorise randomly presented face information. With classification image techniques, we revealed the diagnostic features that the brain requires to produce correct behaviour (i.e., two eyes for gender categorisation in one session; the mouth for expression in the other session). With the same techniques applied to brain signals, we revealed the features processing states associated with modulations of oscillatory EEG energy (measured on occipito-temporal face-sensitive electrodes). Here we show how transitions between distinct feature processing states in the theta/alpha 14-12 Hzj oscillatory bands implement two face categorisations. On the left and right occipito-temporal electrodes of each observer, processing of the contra-lateral eye precedes bilateral integration of the features required for behaviour. For the first time, we relate stimulus information to behaviour via sequences of categorisation-specific feature processing states in the brain. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we contrast propagation of the ictal wavefront with the propagation of individual discharges in the clonic phase of the event. In an in vitro model of tonic-clonic epilepsy, the afterdischarges (clonic phase) propagate with relative uniform speed and are independent of the speed of the ictal wavefront (tonic phase). For slowly propagating ictal wavefronts, the source of the afterdischarges, relative to a given recording electrode, switched as the wavefront passed by, indicating that afterdischarges are seeded from wavefront itself. In tissue that has experienced repeated ictal events, the wavefront generalizes rapidly, and the afterdischarges in this case show a different "flip-flop" pattern, with frequent switches in their direction of propagation. This same flip-flop pattern is also seen in subdural EEG recordings in patients suffering intractable focal seizures caused by cortical dysplasias. Thus, in both slowly and rapidly generalizing ictal events, there is not a single source of afterdischarge activity: rather, the source is continuously changing. Our data suggest a complex view of seizures in which the ictal event and its constituent discharges originate from distinct locations.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining both these approaches, and as a result, neuro-fuzzy computing techniques have been evolved. In this study, a new approach based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was presented for epileptic seizure detection. The proposed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction using the wavelet transform (WT) and the ANFIS trained with the backpropagation gradient descent method in combination with the least squares method. Some conclusions concerning the impacts of features on the detection of epileptic seizures were obtained through analysis of the ANFIS. The results are highly promising, and a comparative analysis suggests that the proposed modeling approach outperforms ANN model in terms of training performances and classification accuracies. The results confirmed that the proposed ANFIS model has some potential in epileptic seizure detection. The ANFIS model achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network model. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functional connectivity has been associated with neurocognitive deficits in these patients. Thus far, it is unknown how (surgical) treatment affects functional connectivity. Functional connectivity before and after tumor resection was compared in primary brain tumor patients. Data from 15 newly diagnosed brain tumor patients were analyzed. Patients underwent tumor resection, and both preoperative (up to five months prior to surgery) and postoperative (up to ten months following Surgery) resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Seven of the patients (47%) underwent radiotherapy after neurosurgery. Functional connectivity was assessed by the phase lag index (PLI), a measure of the correlation between MEG sensors that is not sensitive to volume conduction. PLIs were averaged to one short-distance and two long-distance (interhemispheric and intrahemispheric) Scores in seven frequency bands. We found that functional connectivity changed in a complex manner after tumor resection, depending on frequency band and functional connectivity type. Post-hoc analyses yielded a significant decrease of interhemispheric PLI in the theta band after tumor resection. This result proved to be robust and was not influenced by radiotherapy of a variety of tumor- and patient-related factors. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: We studied 28 patients with epilepsy, divided into a partial seizure (PS; N = 9) and a generalized seizure group (GS; N = 19), and 34 control subjects. Resting state, fMRI was performed using a GE 3T scanner by collecting 200 volumes of echo-planar imaging [EPI) images with subjects relaxed, eyes closed. Data were processed using a modification of the method of Fransson (Hum Brain Mapp 2005;26:15-29), which reveals information on regional low-frequency Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal oscillations In the resting state without any a priori hypothesis. The significant active areas in brain were identified with both individual and group analysis. Results:Controls showed active regions in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and media] prefrontal cortex (MPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), there-gions associated with the brain "default mode." Similar active regions were observed in PS, whereas GS showed no significant activation of precuneus/PCC. Conclusion: In GS, the lack of activation in precuneus/ PCC may partly account for their more severe interictal deficits, compared to PS, in cognitive functions such as concentration and memory.

Statistical approach to quantify the presence of phase coupling using the bispectrum	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bicoherence; bispectrum; cross bispectrum; nonlinear interactions; quadratic phase coupling; surrogate data	MYOGENIC OSCILLATIONS; TUBULAR PRESSURE; BLOOD-FLOW; BICOHERENCE; EEG; ANESTHESIA; RHYTHMS	The bispectrum is a method to detect the presence of phase coupling between different components in a signal. The traditional way to quantify phase coupling is by means of the bicoherence index, which is essentially a normalized bispectrum. The major drawback of the bicoherence index (BCI) is that determination of significant phase coupling becomes compromised with noise and low coupling strength. To overcome this limitation, a statistical approach that combines the bispectrum with a surrogate data method to determine the statistical significance of the phase coupling is introduced. Our method does not rely on the use of the BCI, where the normalization procedure of the BCI is the major culprit in its poor specificity. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach using simulation examples that are designed to test its robustness against noise contamination as well as varying levels of phase coupling. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms the bicoherence index in both sensitivity and specificity and provides an unbiased and statistical approach to determining the presence of quadratic phase coupling. Application of this new method to renal hemodynamic data was applied to renal stop flow pressure data obtained from normotensive (N = 7) and hypertensive (N = 7) rats. We found significant nonlinear interactions in both strains of rats with a greater magnitude of coupling and smaller number of interaction peaks in normotensive rats than hypertensive rats.

Burst activation of the cerebral cortex by flash stimuli during isoflurane anesthesia in rats	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Anesthesiologists	OCT 14-18, 2006	Chicago, IL	Amer Soc Anesthesiologists			GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SENSORY RESPONSES; EEG ACTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL; HALOTHANE	Background: The degree of suppression of sensory functions during general anesthesia is controversial. Here, the authors investigated whether discrete flash stimuli induced cortical field potential responses at an isoflurane concentration producing burst suppression and compared the spatiotemporal properties and frequency spectra of flash-induced burst responses with those occurring spontaneously. Methods: Rats were equipped with multiple epidural and intracortical electrodes to record cortical field potentials in the right hemisphere at several locations along the anterior-posterior axis. At isoflurane concentrations of 1.1, 1.4, and 1.8%, discrete light flashes were delivered to the left eye white cortical field potentials were continuously recorded. Results: isoflurane at 1.4-1.8% produced burst suppression. Each flash produced a visual evoked potential in the primary visual cortex followed by secondary bursting activity in more anterior regions. The average latency and duration of these bursts were 220 and 810 ins, respectively. The spontaneous and flash-induced bursts were similar in frequency, duration, and spatial distribution. They had maximum power in the frontal (primary motor) cortex with a dominant frequency of 10 Hz. Conclusions: The results suggest that discrete flash stimuli activate the motor regions of the cerebral cortex during isoflurane anesthesia and that these activations are analogous with those that occur spontaneously during burst suppression. Electrocortical suppression of the cortex during anesthesia does not prevent its response to visual stimuli.

If the physical and chemical mechanisms at the basis of the functioning of a single neuron are quite well understood, the collective behavior of a system of many neurons is an extremely intriguing subject. Crucial ingredient of this complex behavior is the plasticity property of the network, namely the capacity to adapt and evolve depending on the level of activity. This plastic ability is believed, nowadays, to be at the basis of learning and memory in real brains. This fundamental problem in neurobiology has recently shown a number of features in common to other complex systems. These features mainly concern the morphology of the network, namely the spatial organization of the established connections, and a novel kind of neuronal activity. Experimental data have, in fact, shown that electrical information propagates in a cortex slice via an avalanche mode. Both features have been found in other problems in the context of the physics of complex systems and successful models have been developed to describe their behavior. In this contribution, we apply a statistical mechanical model to describe the complex activity in a neuronal network. The network is chosen to have a number of connections in long range, as found for neurons in vitro. The model implements the main physiological properties of living neurons and is able to reproduce recent experimental results. The numerical power spectra for electrical activity reproduces also the power law behavior measured in an EEG of man resting with the eyes closed.

The heritability of alcohol dependence is rather high, ranging between 50% and 60%, although alcohol dependence is a polygenic, complex disorder. Genome-wide scans on large cohorts of multiplex families, including the collaborative study on genetics of alcoholism (COGA), emphasized the role of many chromosome regions and some candidate genes. The genes encoding the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, or those involved in brain reward pathways, have been involved. Since dopamine is the main neurotransmitter in the reward circuit, genes involved in the dopaminergic pathway represent candidates of interest. Furthermore, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter mediates the acute actions of alcohol and is involved in withdrawal symptomatology. Numerous studies showed an association between variants within GABA receptors genes and the risk of alcohol dependence. In accordance with the complexity of the "alcohol dependence" phenotype, another field of research, related to the concept of endophenotypes, received more recent attention. The role of vulnerability genes in alcohol dependence is therefore re-assessed focusing on different phenotypes and endophenotypes. The latter include brain oscillations, EEG alpha and beta variants and alpha power, and amplitude of P300 amplitude elicited from a visual oddball task. Recent enhancement on global characterizations of the genome by high-throughput approach for genotyping of polymorphisms and studies of transcriptomics and proteomics in alcohol dependence is also reviewed.

Bayesian estimation of synaptic physiology from the spectral responses of neural masses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						dynamic systems; dynamic causal modelling; schizophrenia; glutamate; GABA	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; CALCIUM-CHANNEL; GLUTAMATE; MODEL; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY	We describe a Bayesian inference scheme for quantifying the active physiology of neuronal ensembles using local field recordings of synaptic potentials. This entails the inversion of a generative neural mass model of steady-state spectral activity. The inversion uses Expectation Maximization (EM) to furnish the posterior probability of key synaptic parameter and the marginal likelihood of the model itself. The neural mass model embeds prior knowledge pertaining to both the anatomical [synaptic, circuitry and plausible trajectories of neuronal dynamics. This model comprises a population of excitatory pyramidal cells, under local interneuron inhibition and driving excitation from layer IV stellate cells. Under quasi-stationary assumptions, the model can predict the spectral profile of local field potentials (LFP). This means model parameters can be optimised given real electrophysiological observations. The validity of inferences about synaptic parameters is demonstrated using simulated data and experimental recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex of control and isolation-reared Wistar rats. Specifically, we examined the maximum a posteriori estimates of parameters describing synaptic function in the two groups and tested predictions derived from concomitant microdialysis measures. The modelling of the LFP recordings revealed (i) a sensitization of post-synaptic excitatory responses, particularly marked in pyramidal cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex of socially isolated rats and (ii) increased neuronal adaptation. These inferences were consistent with predictions derived from experimental microdialysis measures of extracellular glutamate levels. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Moran, R.

Electroencephalograms were recorded at the cortical surface and from the specific thalamus. Granger coupling strength was measured before, during and after the occurrence of spike-wave discharges (SWD). Before the onset of SWD, coupling strength was low, but associations from thalamus-to-cortex were stronger than vice versa. The onset of SWD was associated with a rapid and significant increase of coupling strength in both directions. There were no changes in Granger causalities before the onset of SWD. The strength of thalamus-to-cortex coupling remained constantly high during the seizures. The strength of cortex-to-thalamus coupling gradually diminished shortly after the onset of SWD and returned to the pre-SWD level when SWD stopped. In contrast, the strength of thalamus-to-cortex coupling remained elevated even after cessation of SWD. The strong and sustained influence of thalamus-to-cortex may facilitate propagation and maintenance of seizure activity, while rapid reduction of cortex-to-thalamus coupling strength may prompt the cessation of SWD. However, the linear estimation of Granger coupling strength does not seem to be sufficient for predicting episodes with absence epilepsy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Brain-computer interfaces: communication and restoration of movement in paralysis	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Journal of Physiology Symposium on Physiology of Brain-Computer Interfaces	OCT 13, 2006	Atlanta, GA				SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; FOREBRAIN INHIBITORY MECHANISMS; SELF-REGULATION; HASTENED DEATH; MOTOR FUNCTION; BIOFEEDBACK; FMRI; DEPRESSION; PLASTICITY; DESIRE	The review describes the status of brain-computer or brain-machine interface research. We focus on non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their clinical utility for direct brain communication in paralysis and motor restoration in stroke. A large gap between the promises of invasive animal and human BCI preparations and the clinical reality characterizes the literature: while intact monkeys learn to execute more or less complex upper limb movements with spike patterns from motor brain regions alone without concomitant peripheral motor activity usually after extensive training, clinical applications in human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and paralysis from stroke or spinal cord lesions show only limited success, with the exception of verbal communication in paralysed and locked-in patients. BCIs based on electroencephalographic potentials or oscillations are ready to undergo large clinical studies and commercial production as an adjunct or a major assisted communication device for paralysed and locked-in patients. However, attempts to train completely locked-in patients with BCI communication after entering the complete locked-in state with no remaining eye movement failed. We propose that a lack of contingencies between goal directed thoughts and intentions may be at the heart of this problem. Experiments with chronically curarized rats support our hypothesis; operant conditioning and voluntary control of autonomic physiological functions turned out to be impossible in this preparation. In addition to assisted communication, BCIs consisting of operant learning of EEG slow cortical potentials and sensorimotor rhythm were demonstrated to be successful in drug resistant focal epilepsy and attention deficit disorder. First studies of non-invasive BCIs using sensorimotor rhythm of the EEG and MEG in restoration of paralysed hand movements in chronic stroke and single cases of high spinal cord lesions show some promise, but need extensive evaluation in well-controlled experiments. Invasive BMIs based on neuronal spike patterns, local field potentials or electrocorticogram may constitute the strategy of choice in severe cases of stroke and spinal cord paralysis. Future directions of BCI research should include the regulation of brain metabolism and blood flow and electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain (invasive and non-invasive). A series of studies using BOLD response regulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy demonstrated a tight correlation between voluntary changes in brain metabolism and behaviour.

However, little is known about the possible contribution of the motor system for evaluating the correctness of others' actions. To address this question we designed an MEG experiment in which subjects were executing and observing motor actions with and without errors. In the execution task subjects were asked to make speeded button presses according to instruction cues. During the observation task, they viewed pictures of an actor's hand making button presses which were correct or incorrect according to the cues. Time-frequency representations of the MEG data demonstrated a depression in oscillatory activity in the beta band activity (15-35 Hz) during execution followed by a beta rebound that was stronger for incorrect compared to correct executions. During the observation task, a similar time-course of the beta activity was identified and importantly the modulations were stronger for the observation of incorrect than correct actions. Sources accounting for the difference in beta activity between correct and incorrect actions were localized using a beamforming technique. Both for the execution and observation conditions sources were identified to the dorsal motor areas comprising both primary and pre-motor cortex. Our findings demonstrate that not only is cortical motor activity modulated by action observation, but the modulation increases when the observed action is erroneous. This suggests that the motor system is engaged in evaluating the correctness of the actions of others. (c) 12007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We analyzed the epileptiform pattern generated on awaked rats by administering 10 nmol of 4-AP and we studied the effect of administering CBX (50 nmol) 30 min later by injection into the entorhinal cortex. The injection of 4-AP produced an epileptiform pattern in EEG recordings characterized by an initial hypersynchronic activity followed by trains of high-amplitude epileptiform discharges. This pattern was associated with convulsive behavior rated as 0, 1 and 3 in the Racine Scale. In contrast, no changes in electrical activity or behavior were observed in animals that received NaCl or CBX alone. The application of CBX to rats that had received 4-AP decreased the amplitude and frequency of the epileptiform discharges, as well as the number and duration of the epileptiform trains in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Indeed, discharge trains were completely blocked by CBX after 22 +/- 4.4 min, and likewise CBX reverted the convulsive behavior of these animals. We conclude that Gap junctions participate in the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity induced by 4-AP in these regions, as well as blocking motor alterations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We previously analyzed electroencephalograms (EEGs) and respiration simultaneously in normal subjects while testing for detection and recognition of odors. We identified changes in respiration pattern in response to odor stimuli and found inspiratory phase-locked alpha oscillations (I-a). The genesis of I-a were identified in olfactoryrelated areas including the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdale and orbitofrontal cortex with an EEG dipole tracing method. In the present study, we used the same protocol in PD patients and compared results of PD with those of age-matched controls. All PD patients detected odor, but 5 out of 10 showed impaired odor recognition. Changes in breathing pattern associated with emotional changes during exposure to odor stimuli were not observed in PD patients. I-a waveforms were not observed; however, positive waves followed by negative waves were identified approximately 100 ms after inspiration onset. Dipoles of this component were localized in the entorhinal cortex for odor detection in all patients and in the entorhinal cortex and middle temporal gyrus for PD patients who Could discriminate odors. Odor recognition in PD could be subserved by a different neural circuit from that of normal Subjects, done through the temporal association cortex as a subsystem for recognizing the odor; however, the system may not be associated with the odor-induced emotions.

In general we may assume that neuronal networks possess multistable dynamics. We may simplify this concept considering the case that a neuronal network may display, at least, two dynamical states: an interictal state characterised by a normal on-going neural activity, as revealed in the Eletcroencephalogram of Magnetoencephalogram (EEG, MEG), that may be apparently random, and another one-the ictal state-that is characterised by the sudden occurrence of synchronous oscillations, most commonly with large amplitude. The latter becomes manifest as a paroxysmal change of behaviour and/of the state of consciousness of a patient, i.e. an epileptic seizure. In the terminology of the mathematics of non-linear systems, we may state that a neuronal network behaves as a bistable system with two attractors, to which the system converges depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. We propose schematically that the transition between the normal on-going to the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I-a transition may occur due to random fluctuations of some system's parameters. These transitions are thus unpredictable. Models II and III-a transition may result from a gradual change of some unstable parameters, either due to endogenous (model II) or exogenous (model III).

J	Rattenborg, NC				Rattenborg, Niels C.			Response to commentary on evolution of slow-wave sleep and palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds: A hypothesis	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Editorial Material						avian; reptile; neocortex; hyperpallium; dorsal cortex; slow oscillation	ELECTROGRAPHIC SHARP WAVES; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CHELONIAN REPTILES; VISUAL-STIMULI; SPIKE ACTIVITY; WAKING EEG; IN-VITRO; TURTLE; HIPPOCAMPAL; WAKEFULNESS	Mammals and birds are the only animals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves (SWs) in the electroencephalogram during sleep. The SWs that characterize slow-wave sleep (SWS) in mammals and birds reflect the large-scale synchronization of slow neuronal activity. In mammals, this synchronization is dependent upon the high degree of interconnectivity within the neocortex, a cytoarchitectonic trait also found in the avian hyperpallium, but not the reptilian dorsal cortex. Consequently, I recently proposed that the presence of SWs in sleeping mammals and birds, and their absence in sleeping reptiles, is attributable to the greater degree of interconnectivity within the neocortex and hyperpallium when compared to the dorsal cortex [N.C. Rattenborg, Evolution of slow-wave sleep and palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds: A hypothesis, Brain Res. Bull. 69 (2006) 20-29]. Rial et al. (this issue) challenge this hypothesis by noting that high-amplitude SWs occur in awake reptiles. Based largely on this observation, they suggest that SWS in homeotherms evolved from reptilian wakefulness. SWs in awake reptiles do not seem to reflect neural processes comparable to those that generate sleep-related SWs in homeotherms, however. Moreover, the proposed conversion of reptilian wakefulness into SWS is untenable from behavioral, mechanistic and functional perspectives. A more parsimonious explanation is that the precursor state to SWS in homeotherms was a state comparable to reptilian sleep, rather than wakefulness, with the primary difference being that the reptilian dorsal cortex lacks the interconnectivity necessary to generate sleep-related SWs in the electroencephalogram.

Here we examined whether gamma ASSR deficits are also present at first hospitalization for psychosis. Methods: Subjects were 16 first episode schizophrenia patients (SZ), 16 first episode affective disorder patients (AFF) (13 with bipolar disorder), and 33 healthy control subjects (HC). Stimuli were 20-, 30-, and 40-Hz binaural click trains. The ASSR phase locking and evoked power were analyzed with the Morlet wavelet transform. Results: At 40-Hz stimulation, SZ and AFF had significantly reduced phase locking compared with HC. This deficit was more pronounced over the left hemisphere in SZ. Evoked power at 40 Hz was also reduced in the patients compared with HC. At 30-Hz stimulation phase locking and evoked power were reduced in both patient groups. The 20-Hz ASSR did not differ between groups, but phase locking and evoked power of the 40-Hz harmonic of the 20-Hz ASSR were reduced in both SZ and AFF. Phase locking of this 40-Hz harmonic was correlated with total positive symptoms in SZ. Conclusions: They ASSR deficit is present at first hospitalization for both schizophrenia and affective disorder but shows a left hemisphere bias in first hospitalized SZ. Some of the neural circuitry abnormalities underlying the gamma ASSR deficit might be common to psychoses in general, whereas others might be specific to particular disorders.

SCR was found to influence sensory information processing in various models, but these studies yielded inconsistent results. We examined sensory processing in anesthetized rats during SCR by recording multiple unit activity (MUA) and evoked field potentials (eFPs). Evoked field potentials as well as spontaneous FP changes around spontaneous activations were analyzed by subsequent cur-rent source density (CSD) analysis. MUA responses and eFPs were recorded from the hindlimb area (HL) of the somatosensory cortex (SI) to electrical stimuli of the tibial nerve during active and silent states, respectively. Stimulus-associated MUA above the ongoing background activity did not differ significantly in active vs. silent states. Short-latency (<50 ms) eFP responses consisted of a sequence of deep-negative and deep-positive waves. Parameters of the first negative deflection were similar in both states. Stimulation in the silent state occasionally induced 500-700 ms long spindles in the alpha range (10-16 Hz). Spindles were never observed in responses to active state stimulation. CSD analysis showed moderately different cortical sink-source patterns when the stimulus was applied during active vs. silent state. Sinks first appeared in layer IV, V and VI, corresponding sources were in layer I/ II, V and VI. Stronger activation appeared in the infraganular layers in the case of active state. CSD of spontaneous FPs revealed some sequential activation pattern in the cortex when strongest and earlier sink appeared in layer III during active states. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

C	da Silva, FHL		Azevedo, L; Londral, AR		da Silva, Fernando Henrique Lopes			Analysis and models of brain epileptic activities	HEALTHINF 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Health Informatics (HEALTHINF 2008)	JAN 28-31, 2008	Funchal, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technol Informat, Control & Commun, Univ Madeira, IEEE EMB, Workflow Management Coalit, Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence				The essence of epilepsy is the sudden occurrence of a qualitative change in the behaviour of neuronal networks of some specific areas of the brain. In general we may assume that neuronal networks possess multistable dynamics. We may simplify this concept considering the case that a neuronal network may display, at least, two dynamical states: an interictal state characterised by a normal on-going neural activity, as revealed in the Eletcroencephalogram of Magnetoencephalogram (EEG, MEG), that may be apparently random, and another one - the ictal state - that is characterised by the sudden occurrence of synchronous oscillations, most commonly with large amplitude. The latter becomes manifest as a paroxysmal change of behaviour and/of the state of consciousness of a patient, i.e. an epileptic seizure. In the terminology of the mathematics of non-linear systems, we may state that a neuronal network behaves as a bistable system with two attractors, to which the system converges depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. We propose schematically that the transition between the normal on-going to the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I - a transition may occur due to random fluctuations of some system's parameters. These transitions are thus unpredictable. Models II and III - a transition may result from a gradual change of some unstable parameters, either due to endogenous (model II) or exogenous (model III). In these cases the change of parameter values causes a deformation of the attractor resulting in a transition from the basin of the attractor corresponding to the normal state, to the attractor corresponding to the seizure dynamical state. Some experimental findings obtained in different cases of epilepsy, both in human and in animals, are compatible with each of these 3 models. Some examples of these cases are illustrated.

Methods: We examined alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) to analyze brain reactivity during the selection of verbal (word production) and non-verbal motor actions (keyboard pressing) under two different response modes: externally selected and self-elected. Results: An alpha and beta ERD was observed for both the verbal and non-verbal tasks in both the externally and the self-selected modes. For both tasks, the beta ERD started earlier and was longer in the self-selected mode than in the externally selected mode. The overall pattern of results between the verbal and non-verbal motor behaviors was similar. Conclusions: The pattern of alpha and beta ERD is affected by the mode of response selection suggesting that the activity in both frequency bands contributes to the process of selecting actions. We suggest that activity in the alpha band may reflect attentional processes while activity in the beta band may be more closely related to the execution and selection process. Significance: These results suggest that a domain general process contributes to the planning of speech and other motor actions. This finding has potential clinical implications, for the use of diverse motor tasks to treat disorders of motor planning. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

However, the value of resting-state studies to a better understanding of brain-behavior relationships has been challenged. That altered states of consciousness are a privileged way to study the relationships between spontaneous brain activity and behavior is proposed, and common resting-state brain activity features observed in various states of altered consciousness are reviewed. Early positron emission tomography studies showed that states of extremely low or high brain activity are often associated with unconsciousness. However, this relationship is not absolute, and the precise link between global brain metabolism and awareness remains yet difficult to assert. In contrast, voxel-based analyses identified a systematic impairment of associative frontoparieto-cingulate areas in altered states of consciousness, such as sleep, anesthesia, coma, vegetative state, epileptic loss of consciousness, and somnambulism. In parallel, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified structured patterns of slow neuronal oscillations in the resting human brain. Similar coherent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) systemwide patterns can also be found, in particular in the default-mode network, in several states of unconsciousness, such as coma, anesthesia, and slow-wave sleep. The latter results suggest that slow coherent spontaneous BOLD fluctuations cannot be exclusively a reflection of conscious mental activity, but may reflect default brain connectivity shaping brain areas of most likely interactions in a way that transcends levels of consciousness, and whose functional significance remains largely in the dark.

Intermittent spatio-temporal desynchronization and sequenced synchrony in ECoG signals	CHAOS			English	Article							BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; ORIGIN; PHASE; TRANSITIONS; MODEL	Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from the brain surface typically exhibit high synchrony across large cortical areas, interrupted by brief periods of desynchronization exhibiting propagating phase discontinuities, across which spatial patterns of phase emerge in selected frequency bands. Experiments with rabbits trained using classical conditioning paradigms indicated that such desynchronization periods demarcate cognitive processing in the subjects; the ECoG in the frames between such periods revealed spatial patterns of amplitude modulation that were classified with respect to sensory stimuli that the rabbits had been trained to recognize. The present work describes intermittent synchrony and desynchronization of ECoG signals measured over the visual cortex. We analyze the analytic amplitude (AA) and analytic phase (AP) of the signals bandpassed over the beta band (12.5-25 Hz) and theta band (3-7 Hz) using the Hilbert transform. The AP of analytic signals evaluated using a Shannon-based synchronization index in theta band exhibits phase synchronization for varying time periods averaging about 1 s, interrupted by desynchronization periods of duration about 0.1 s. Synchronization periods in the beta-band last <100 ms, with interruptions by desynchronization lasting one-tenth that, in which the analytic amplitude drops drastically. During these "null spikes," the analytic phase is undefined, and the spatial and temporal phase differences show high dispersion. Detailed examination of the bandpass filtered ECoG confirms the presence of a shared mean frequency in a frame of synchronized oscillation, at which frequency the spatial pattern of the AP has the form of a cone. Between frames the AA approaches zero. The form of the null spike resembles a tornado (a vortex), as shown in sequential frames by a rotating spatial pattern of amplitude in the filtered ECoG.

Dissociation between MEG alpha modulation and performance accuracy on visual working memory task in obsessive compulsive disorder	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						limited resources inhibitory control; visual-spatial working memory task; event-related alpha modulation; event-related desynchrordzation (ERD); event-related synchronization (ERS); temporal-spectral evolution technique (TSE); magnetoencephalography; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)	GLUCOSE METABOLIC-RATES; EEG ALPHA; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; CHILDHOOD-ONSET; NO EVIDENCE; RHYTHMS; ATTENTION; POWER; ABNORMALITIES	Oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) is modulated by cognitive events. Such modulation is reflected in a decrease of alpha (event-related desynchronization; ERD) with high cognitive load, or an increase (event-related synchronization) with low cognitive demand or with active inhibition of distractors. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate the pattern of prefrontal and parieto-occipital alpha modulation related to two variants of visual working memory task (delayed matching-to-sample) with and without a distractor. We tested nonmedicated, nondepressed patients suffering obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and pair-matched healthy controls. The level of event-related alpha as a function of time was estimated using the temporal-spectral evolution technique. The results in OCD patients indicated: (1) a lower level of prestimulus (reference) alpha when compared to controls, (2) a task-phase specific reduction in event-related alpha ERD in particular for delayed matching-to-sample task with distractor, (3) no significant correlations between the pattern of modulation in prefrontal and parietal-occipital alpha oscillatory activity. Despite showing an abnormally low alpha modulation, the OCD patients' performance accuracy was normal. The results suggest a relationship of alpha oscillations and the underlying thalamocortical network to etiology of OCD and an involvement of a compensatory mechanism related to effortful inhibition of extrinsic and intrinsic interference.

J	Bickel, S; Lipp, HP; Umbricht, D				Bickel, Stephan; Lipp, Hans-Peter; Umbricht, Daniel			Early auditory sensory processing deficits in mouse mutants with reduced NMDA receptor function	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; event-related potentials; NMDA receptor; prepulse inhibition; habituation; mice	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARVALBUMIN-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; PREPULSE INHIBITION DEFICITS; LOW-DOSE KETAMINE; EVOKED POTENTIALS; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; GATING DEFICITS	Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia include impairments at automatic, preattentive stages of sensory information processing. These deficits are evident in the prepulse inhibition- (PPI) and habituation of the auditory startle response paradigm, the paired tone paradigm in the EEG, and the peak recovery function of auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Administration of NMDA receptor antagonists reliably disrupts PPI and habituation of the startle, but not gating of AEPs in rodents. In the peak recovery paradigm, patients with schizophrenia and primates treated with NMDA receptor antagonists show reduced maximal response at long interstimulus intervals (ISI), but normal responses at short ISIs. Thus reduced NMDA receptor signalling may underlie alterations in these paradigms observed in schizophrenia. We tested the paradigms mentioned in mouse mutants with reduced expression of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (N = 15) and their wild- type littermates (N = 16). The NR1 mutant mice showed impaired habituation and PPI of the auditory startle response, as well as impaired gating in the paired tone paradigm. Deficits between the two gating measures did not correlate, corroborating previous evidence that these paradigms measure distinct processes. In the peak recovery paradigm, the NR1 mutants showed increased responses of the AEPs P1 and N1 at short ISIs but no difference between groups were observed at long ISIs. In conclusion, the NR1 hypomorphic mice modelled sensory and sensorimotor gating and startle habituation deficits observed in schizophrenia, but failed to model alterations in the peak recovery function.

(2007) Hippocampus 17:801-802] of grid cell firing is reviewed as an algorithmic level description of path integration and as an implementation level description of grid cells and their inputs. New analyses concern the relationships between the variables in the model and the theta rhythm, running speed, and the intrinsic firing frequencies of grid cells. New simulations concern the implementation of velocity-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with different preferred directions in different neurons. To summarize the model, the distance traveled along a specific direction is encoded by the phase of a VCO relative to a baseline frequency. Each VCO is an intrinsic membrane potential oscillation whose frequency increases from baseline as a result of depolarization by synaptic input from speed modulated head-direction cells. Grid cell firing is driven by the VCOs whose preferred directions match the current direction of motion. VCOs are phase-reset by location-specific input from place cells to prevent accumulation of error. The baseline frequency is identified with the local average of VCO frequencies, while EEG theta frequency is identified with the global average VCO frequency and comprises two components: the frequency at zero speed and a linear response to running speed. Quantitative predictions are given for the inter-relationships between a grid cell's intrinsic firing frequency and grid scale, the two components of theta frequency, and the running speed of the animal. Qualitative predictions are given for the properties of the VCOs, and the relationship between environmental novelty, the two components of theta, grid scale and place cell remapping.

J	Wienbruch, C				Wienbruch, Christian			Abnormal slow wave mapping (ASWAM) - A tool for the investigation of abnormal slow wave activity in the human brain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; slow waves; source localization; delta band; imaging; MEG	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DELTA-ACTIVITY; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; BLOOD-FLOW; EEG; MEG; LOCALIZATION; POWER; AGE; OSCILLATIONS	Slow waves in the delta and theta frequency range, normal signs of deactivated networks in sleep stages, are considered 'abnormal' when prominent in the waking state and when generated in circumscribed brain areas. Structural cortical lesions, e.g. related to stroke, tumors, or scars, generate focal electric and magnetic slow wave activity in the penumbra. Focal concentrations of slow wave activity exceeding those of healthy subjects have also been found in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders without obvious structural brain damage. Hence, identification and mapping of abnormal slow wave activity might contribute to the investigation of cortical indications of psychopathology. Here I propose a method for abnormal slow wave mapping (ASWAM), based on a 5 min resting magnetoencephalogramm (MEG) and equivalent current dipole fitting to sources in the 1-4 Hz frequency band (delta) in anatomically defined cortical regions. The method was tested in a sample of 116 healthy subjects (59 males), with the aim to provide a basis for later comparison with patient samples. As to be expected, delta dipole density was low in healthy subjects. However, its distribution differed between genders with fronto-central > posterior dipole density in male and posterior dominance in female participants, which was not significantly related to either age or headsize. Results suggest that this method allows the identification of ASWA, so that comparison against Z-scores from a larger normal control group might assist diagnostic purposes in patient groups. As specific distributions seem to reflect differences between genders, this should be considered also in the analysis of patient samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Synchronous bursts of neuronal activity in the developing hippocampus: Modulation by active sleep and association with emerging gamma and theta rhythms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						myoclonic twitching; CA1; dentate gyrus; gamma rhythm; theta rhythm; development	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SPONTANEOUS EEG SPIKES; FREELY-MOVING RAT; INFANT RATS; IN-VIVO; NEONATAL HIPPOCAMPUS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PATH-INTEGRATION; POSITIVE PHASE; CALCIUM WAVES	The neonatal hippocampus exhibits regularly recurring waves of synchronized neuronal activity in vitro. Because active sleep (AS), characterized by bursts of phasic motor activity in the form of myoclonic twitching, may provide conditions that are conducive to activity-dependent development of hippocampal circuits, we hypothesized that the waves of synchronous neuronal activity that have been observed in vitro would be associated with AS-related twitching. Using unanesthetized 1- to 12-d-old rats, we report here that the majority of neurons in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are significantly more active during AS than during either quiet sleep or wakefulness. Neuronal activity typically occurs in phasic bursts, during which most neurons are significantly cross-correlated both within and across the CA1 and DG fields. All AS-active neurons increase their firing rates during periods of myoclonic twitching of the limbs, and a subset of these neurons exhibit a burst of activity immediately after limb twitches, suggesting that the twitches themselves provide sensory feedback to the infant hippocampus, as occurs in the infant spinal cord and neocortex. Finally, the synchronous bursts of neuronal activity are coupled to the emergence of the AS-related hippocampal gamma rhythm during the first postnatal week, as well as the emergence of the AS-related theta rhythm during the second postnatal week. We hypothesize that the phasic motor events of active sleep provide the developing hippocampus with discrete sensory stimulation that contributes to the development and refinement of hippocampal circuits as well as the development of synchronized interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.

Update on the Clinical Features and Natural History of Wolf-Hirschhorn (4p-) Syndrome: Experience With 87 Patients and Recommendations for Routine Health Supervision	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART C-SEMINARS IN MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome; del (4p) syndrome; monosomy 4p; health maintenance; health supervision; anticipatory guidance	SYNDROME CRITICAL REGION; CHROMOSOMAL DELETION; SHORT-ARM; PHENOTYPE; TRANSLOCATION; CGH; 4P-SYNDROME; PATTERNS; MAP	Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a well-known multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome, firstly described in 1961 by Cooper and Hirschhorn. its frequency is estimated as 1/50,000-1/20,000 births, with a female predilection of 2:1. The disorder is caused by partial loss of materia I from the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4(4p16.3), and is considered a contiguous gene syndrome. No single gene deletions or intragenic mutations have been shown to confer the full WHS phenotype. Since the disorder was brought to the attention of geneticists, many additional cases have been published. Only in 1999, however, were the first data on the natural history brought to the attention of the medical community. The purpose of the present study is to help delineate in more detail and over a longer period of time, the natural history of WHS, in order to establish appropriate health supervision and anticipatory guidance for individuals with this disorder. We have collected information on 87 patients diagnosed with WHS (54 females and 33 males) both in USA and Italy, Age at first observation ranged between newborn and 17 years, Twenty patients have been followed from 4 months to 23 years. The deletion proximal breakpoint varied from 4p15.32 to 4p16.3, and, by FISH, was terminal and included both WHSCR. Deletion was detected by standard cytogenetics in 44/87 (50.5%) patients, whereas FISH was necessary in the other 43 (49.5%). Array-CGH analysis at 1 Mb resolution was performed in 34/87 patients, and, in 15/34 (44%), showed an unbalanced translocation leading to both a 4p monosomy and a partial trisomy for another chromosome arm. Six more patients had been previously shown to have an unbalanced translocation by karyotype analysis or FISH with a WHS-specific probe. Sixty-five of 87 patients had an apparent pure, de novo, terminal deletion; and 1/87 a tandem duplication of 4p16.1p16.3 associated with 4p16.3pter deletion. Age at diagnosis varied between 7 months gestation and 16 years. Ninety-three percent had a seizure disorder with a good outcome; 80% had prenatal onset growth deficiency followed by short stature and slow weight gain; 60% had skeletal anomalies; 50% had heart lesions; 50% had abnormal tooth development; and 40% had hearing loss. Distinctive EEG findings were seen in 90%. Structural CNS anomalies were detected in 80%. Global developmental delay of varying degrees was present in all patients. Almost 50% was able to walk either alone or with support. Hypotonia was present in virtually all patients. A global improvement was observed in all individuals, over time. Our survey has also shown how the characteristic facial phenotype tends to be less pronounced in those patients with a smaller deletion, and microcephaly is not observed in the patients with certain cryptic unbalanced translocations.

These results have been observed in the EEG at one or two electrode sites. We wished to extend these results using magnetic field data to estimate the responses at the neural generators themselves in each hemisphere. Whole head magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings were used to estimate the phase and amplitude behavior of sources in primary auditory cortex in both hemispheres of schizophrenic and comparison subjects. Both ipsi- and contralateral cases were evaluated using a driving (40 Hz modulated 1 kHz carrier) and a non-driving (1 kHz tone) Stimulus. We used Source space projection (SSP) to collapse the magnetic field data into estimates of the time course of source strengths in individual trials. Complex wavelet based time-frequency decomposition was used to compute inter-trial phase locking factor (PLF), and mean evoked and induced amplitude for each cortical generator. Schizophrenic subjects showed reduced SSP PLF and evoked Source strength for contralateral generators responding to the driving Stimulus in both hemispheres. For the pure tone stimulus, only the left hemisphere PLF's in the transient window were reduced. In contrast, subjects with schizophrenia exhibited higher induced 40 Hz power to both stimulus types, consistent with the reduced PLF findings. The method of SSP combined with wavelet based complex demodulation produces a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and directly estimates the activity of the cortical generators responsible for gamma band auditory MEG evoked fields. Schizophrenic subjects exhibit significant impairment of generation and phase locking of this activity in auditory cortex, suggesting an impairment of GABA-ergic inhibitory interneuronal modulation of pyramidal cell activity.

Contributions of spectral frequency analyses to the study of P50 ERP amplitude and suppression in bipolar disorder with or without a history of psychosis	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						auditory evoked response; bipolar disorder; P50; sensory gating	EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; DEFICITS; EEG; NORMALIZATION; STIMULATION	Objective: The present study investigated event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of auditory processing and sensory gating in bipolar disorder and subgroups of bipolar patients with or without a history of psychosis using the P50 dual-click procedure. Auditory-evoked activity in two discrete frequency bands also was explored to distinguish between sensory registration and selective attention deficits. Methods: Thirty-one individuals with bipolar disorder and 28 non-psychiatric controls were compared on ERP indices of auditory processing using a dual-click procedure. In addition to conventional P50 ERP peak-picking techniques, quantitative frequency analyses were applied to the ERP data to isolate stages of information processing associated with sensory registration (20-50 Hz; gamma band) and selective attention (0-20 Hz; low-frequency band). Results: Compared to the non-psychiatric control group, patients with bipolar disorder exhibited reduced S1 response magnitudes for the conventional P50 peak-picking and low-frequency response analyses. A bipolar subgroup effect suggested that the attenuated S1 magnitudes from the P50 peak- picking and low-frequency analyses were largely attributable to patients without a history of psychosis. Conclusions: The analysis of distinct frequency bands of the auditory-evoked response elicited during the dual-click procedure allowed further specification of the nature of auditory sensory processing and gating deficits in bipolar disorder with or without a history of psychosis. The observed S1 effects in the low-frequency band suggest selective attention deficits in bipolar patients, especially those patients without a history of psychosis, which may reflect a diminished capacity to selectively attend to salient stimuli as opposed to impairments of inhibitory sensory processes.

Our aim was to study the oscillatory changes related to the forced termination of a single complex motor program (signature) and compare them with those observed after the normal termination of the movement. Methods: Fifty-eight reference-free EEG channels were analyzed in 10 healthy subjects. A 2000 Hz tone (S1, go signal) indicated the subject to begin to write his/her complete signature. A second 2000 Hz tone 0.8 s afterwards (50% probability: S2, stop signal) indicated the subject to stop immediately. Movement-related energy changes were evaluated by means of time-frequency (Gabor) transforms. Results: A frontal 15 Hz synchronization was observed after S1, but not after S2. The amplitude of the post-movement beta increase was significantly lower when the movement was abnormally terminated (p = 0.005), while the peri-movement decrease was similar. Conclusions: The forced termination of a motor program reduces significantly the amplitude of the post-movement beta increment, conserving its temporal pattern. Also, the presence of the 15 Hz frontal synchronization only after SI, together with the results of previous studies, suggests that the frontal mechanisms involved in go/no go and stop signals are very different. Significance: Our results indicate that the beta rebound is an active process, independent of the peri-movement beta decrease, which is influenced by how the movement is terminated.

Design: Randomized, parallel group design Setting: 10 instrumental conditioning sessions. pre- and posttreatment investigation including sleep evaluations Participants: 27 healthy subjects (13 male) Interventions: SMIR-conditioning (experimental group) or randomized-frequency conditioning (control group); declarative memory task before and after a 90-min nap Measurement and Results: The experimental group was trained to enhance the amplitude of their SMR-frequency range, whereas the control group participated in a randomized-frequency conditioning program (i.e.. every session a different 3-Hz frequency bin between 7 and 20 Hz). During pre- and posttreatment the subjects had to attend the sleep laboratory to take a 90-min nap (2:00-3:30 pm) and to perform a declarative memory task before and after sleep. The experimental design was successful in conditioning an increase in relative 12-15 Hz amplitude within 10 sessions (d = 0.7). Increased SMR activity was also expressed during subsequent sleep by eliciting positive changes in different sleep parameters (sleep spindle number [d = 0.6], sleep onset latency [d = 0.7]); additionally, this increased 12-15 Hz amplitude was associated with enhancement in retrieval score computed at immediate cued recall (d = 0.9). Conclusion: Relative SMR amplitude increased over 10 instrumental conditioning sessions (in the experimental group only) and this "shaping of one's own brain activity" improved subsequent declarative learning and facilitated the expression of 12-15 Hz spindle oscillations during sleep. Most interestingly, these electrophysiological changes were accompanied by a shortened sleep onset latency.

A dual paradigm was employed: a videogame and the simultaneous presentation of passive auditory oddball stimuli. We analyzed the data concerning ERD/ERS using both Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and wavelet transform (WT). In the FFT data, during the periods with appearance of Fm theta, apparent ERD of the theta band was observed at Fz and Cz. ERD when Fm theta was present was much more prominent than when Fm theta was absent. In the WT data, as in the FFT data, ERD was seen again, but in this case the ERD was preceded by ERS during both the periods with and without Fm theta. Furthermore, the WT analysis indicated that ERD was followed by ERS during the periods without Fm theta. However, during Fm theta, no apparent ERS following ERD was seen. In our study, Fm theta was desynchronized by the auditory stimuli that were independent of the video game task used to evoke the Fm theta. The ERD of Fm theta might be reflecting the mechanism of "positive suppression" to process external auditory stimuli automatically and preventing attentional resources from being unnecessarily allocated to those stimuli. Another possibility is that Fm theta induced by our dual paradigm may reflect information processing modeled by multi-item working memory requirements for playing the videogame and the simultaneous auditory processing using a memory trace. ERS in the WT data without Fm theta might indicate further processing of the auditory information free from "positive suppression" control reflected by Fm theta.

Electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping: A clinical technique for mapping the motor cortex	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						brain mapping; electrocorticography; motor cortex	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CURSOR CONTROL; EEG; LOCALIZATION; PATTERNS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR	OBJECTIVE: Electrocortical stimulation (ECS) has been well established for delineating the eloquent cortex. However, ECS is still coarse and inefficient in delineating regions of the functional cortex and can be hampered by after-discharges. Given these constraints, an adjunct approach to defining the motor cortex is the use of electrocorticographic signal changes associated with active regions of the cortex. The broad range of frequency oscillations are categorized into two main groups with respect to the sensorimotor cortex: low and high frequency bands. The low frequency bands tend to show a power reduction with cortical activation, whereas the high frequency bands show power increases. These power changes associated with the activated cortex could potentially provide a powerful tool in delineating areas of the motor cortex. We explore electrocorticographic signal alterations as they occur with activated regions of the motor cortex, as well as its potential in clinical brain mapping applications. METHODS: We evaluated seven patients who underwent invasive monitoring for seizure localization. Each patient had extraciperative ECS mapping to identify the motor cortex. All patients also performed overt hand and tongue motor tasks to identify associated frequency power changes in regard to location and degree of concordance with ECS results that localized either hand or tongue motor function. RESULTS: The low frequency bands had a high sensitivity (88.9-100%) and a lower specificity (79.0-82.6%) for identifying electrodes with either hand or tongue ECS motor responses. The high frequency bands had a lower sensitivity (72.7-88.9%) and a higher specificity (92.4-94.9%) in correlation with the same respective ECS positive electrodes. CONCLUSION: The concordance between stimulation and spectral power changes demonstrate the possible utility of electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping as an adjunct method to improve the efficiency and resolution of identifying the motor cortex.

Gap junctions mediate large-scale Turing structures in a mean-field cortex driven by subcortical noise	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; PHASE-TRANSITION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PATTERN-FORMATION; HUMAN BRAIN; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	One of the grand puzzles in neuroscience is establishing the link between cognition and the disparate patterns of spontaneous and task-induced brain activity that can be measured clinically using a wide range of detection modalities such as scalp electrodes and imaging tomography. High-level brain function is not a single-neuron property, yet emerges as a cooperative phenomenon of multiply-interacting populations of neurons. Therefore a fruitful modeling approach is to picture the cerebral cortex as a continuum characterized by parameters that have been averaged over a small volume of cortical tissue. Such mean-field cortical models have been used to investigate gross patterns of brain behavior such as anesthesia, the cycles of natural sleep, memory and erasure in slow-wave sleep, and epilepsy. There is persuasive and accumulating evidence that direct gap-junction connections between inhibitory neurons promote synchronous oscillatory behavior both locally and across distances of some centimeters, but, to date, continuum models have ignored gap-junction connectivity. In this paper we employ simple mean-field arguments to derive an expression for D-2, the diffusive coupling strength arising from gap-junction connections between inhibitory neurons. Using recent neurophysiological measurements reported by Fukuda [J. Neurosci. 26, 3434 (2006)], we estimate an upper limit of D-2 approximate to 0.6 cm(2). We apply a linear stability analysis to a standard mean-field cortical model, augmented with gap-junction diffusion, and find this value for the diffusive coupling strength to be close to the critical value required to destabilize the homogeneous steady state. Computer simulations demonstrate that larger values of D-2 cause the noise-driven model cortex to spontaneously crystalize into random mazelike Turing structures: centimeter-scale spatial patterns in which regions of high-firing activity are intermixed with regions of low-firing activity. These structures are consistent with the spatial variations in brain activity patterns detected with the BOLD (blood oxygen-level-dependent) signal detected with magnetic resonance imaging, and may provide a natural substrate for synchronous gamma-band rhythms observed across separated EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.

Neuropeptide Y suppresses absence seizures in a genetic rat model primarily through effects on Y-2 receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; genetic absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg; spike and wave discharge; thalamocortical	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; 5-9 HZ OSCILLATIONS; ANTIEPILEPTIC ACTIONS; DENTATE GYRUS; FOOD-INTAKE; BRAIN; ACID; SYSTEM; HIPPOCAMPUS	Neuropeptide Y (NPY) potently suppresses absence seizures in a model of genetic generalized epilepsy, genetic absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg (GAERS). Here we investigated the Y-receptor subtype(s) on which NPY exerts this anti-absence effect. A dual in vivo approach was used: the cumulative duration of seizures was quantified in adult male GAERS in 90-min electroencephalogram recordings following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of: (i) subtype-selective agonists of Y-1 ([Leu(31)Pro(34)]NPY, 2.5 nmol), Y-2 (Ac[Leu(28,31)]NPY24-36, 3 nmol), Y-5 receptors [hPP1(-17),Ala(31),Aib(32)]NPY, 4 nmol), NPY (3 nmol) or vehicle; and following (ii) i.c.v. injection of antagonists of Y-1 (BIBP3226, 20 nmol), Y-2 (BIIE0246, 20 nmol) and Y-5 (NPY5RA972, 20 nmol) receptors or vehicle, followed by NPY (3 nmol). Injection of the Y-1- and Y-5-selective agonists resulted in significantly less mean seizure suppression (37.4% and 53.9%, respectively) than NPY (83.2%; P < 0.05), while the Y-2 agonist had similar effects to NPY (62.3% suppression, P = 0.57). Food intake was not increased following injection of the Y-2 agonist, while significant increases in food intake were seen following NPY and the other Y-subtype agonists. Compared with vehicle, NPY injection suppressed seizures following the Y-1 and Y-5 antagonists (45.3% and 80.1%, respectively, P < 0.05), but not following the Y-2 antagonist (5.1% suppression, P = 0.46). We conclude that NPY Y-2 receptors are more important than Y-1 and Y-5 receptors in mediating the effect of NPY to suppress absence seizures in a genetic rat model. Y-2 receptor agonists may represent targets for novel drugs against genetic generalized epilepsies without resulting in appetite stimulation.

Slowing of oscillatory brain activity is a stable characteristic of Parkinson's disease without dementia	BRAIN			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; magnetoencephalography (MEG); resting-state; oscillations; spectral analysis	ADULT READING TEST; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NUCLEUS BASALIS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; PREMORBID INTELLIGENCE; NEOCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BASE-LINE; EEG; ALPHA; MEG	Extensive changes in resting-state oscillatory brain activity have recently been demonstrated using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in moderately advanced, non-demented Parkinson's disease patients relative to age-matched controls. The aim of the present study was to determine the onset and evolution of these changes over the disease course and their relationship with clinical parameters. In addition, we evaluated the effects of dopaminomimetics on resting-state oscillatory brain activity in levodopa-treated patients. MEG background oscillatory activity was studied in a group of 70 Parkinson's disease patients with varying disease duration and severity (including 18 de novo patients) as well as in 21 controls that were age-matched to the de novo patients. Whole head 151-channel MEG recordings were obtained in an eyes-closed resting-state condition. Levodopa-treated patients (N = 37) were examined both in a practically defined 'OFF' as well as in the 'ON' state. Relative spectral power was calculated for delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands and averaged for 10 cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Additionally, extensive clinical and neuropsychological testing was performed in all subjects. De novo Parkinson's disease patients showed widespread slowing of background MEG activity relative to controls. Changes included a widespread increase in theta and low alpha power, as well as a loss of beta power over all but the frontal ROIs and a loss of gamma power over all but the right occipital ROI. Neuropsychological assessment revealed abnormal perseveration in de novo patients, which was associated with increased low alpha power in centroparietal ROIs. In the whole group of Parkinson's disease patients, longer disease duration was associated with reduced low alpha power in the right temporal and right occipital ROI, but not with any other spectral power measure. No association was found between spectral power and disease stage, disease severity or dose of dopaminomimetics. In patients on levodopa therapy, a change from the 'OFF' to the 'ON' state was associated with decreases in right frontal theta, left occipital beta and left temporal gamma power and an increase in right parietal gamma power. Widespread slowing of oscillatory brain activity is a characteristic of non-demented Parkinson's disease patients from the earliest clinical stages onwards that is (largely) independent of disease duration, stage and severity and hardly influenced by dopaminomimetic treatment. Some early cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease appear to be associated with increased low alpha power. We postulate a role for hypofunctional non-dopaminergic ascending neurotransmitter systems in spectral power changes in non-demented Parkinson's disease patients.
