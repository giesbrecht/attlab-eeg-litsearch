For the first time, paroxysmal gamma waves (PGW) were observed in eight subjects practicing a yoga technique of breathing control called Bhramari Pranayama (BhPr). To obtain new insights into the nature of the EEG during BhPr, we analyzed EEG signals using time-frequency representations (TFR), independent component analysis (ICA), and EEG tomography (LORETA). We found that the PGW consists of high-frequency biphasic ripples. This unusual activity is discussed in relation to previous reports on yoga and meditation. It is concluded this EEG activity is most probably non-epileptic, and that applying the same methodology to other meditation recordings might yield an improved understanding of the neurocorrelates of meditation.

However, the features of nonlinearity and nonstationarity in physiological time series limit the reliability of the conventional analysis. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), based on nonlinear theory, is an innovative approach to extract the dynamic information at different time scales, in particular, from nonstationary signals. In this paper, HHT is introduced to analyze the alpha waves of human's electroencephalography (EEG), which seemly oscillate regularly between 8 and 12Hz in healthy subject but getting irregular or disappeared in different demented status. Furthermore, conventional time-frequency analyses are adopted to collate the results from those methods and HHT. Finally, the potential usages of HHT are demonstrated in characterizing the biological signals qualitatively and quantitatively, including stationarity analysis, instantaneous frequency and amplitude modulation or correlation analysis. Such applications on EEG have successively disclosed the differences of alpha rhythms between normal and demented brains and the nonlinear characteristics of the underlying mechanisms. Hopefully, in addition to empower the studies of EEGvaried in diseased, aging, and physiological processes, these methods might find other applications in EEG analysis.

The EEG with its highest temporal resolution is still a crucial measurement for localization of activities arising from the electrical behaviour of the brain. A scalp topographic map for an EEG may be a superposition of several simpler subtopographic maps, each resulting from an individual electrical source located at a certain depth. Furthermore, this source may have a temporal characteristic as an oscillation or a rhythm that extends in a certain time window which has been a basis of assumption for the time-frequency analysis methods. A method for the spatio-temporal wavelet decomposition of multichannel EEG data is proposed which facilitates the localization of electrical sources separate and/or overlapping on a continuum of time, frequency and space domains. The subtopographic maps asociated with each of these individual components are then used in the MUSIC source localization algorithm. The validations are performed on simulated EEG data. Spatio-temporal wavelet decomposition as a preprocessing method improves the source localization by simplifying the topographic data formed by the superposition of EEG generators, having possible combinations of temporal, frequency and and/or spatial overlappings. Spatio-temporal analysis of EEG will help enhance the accuracy of dipole source reconstruction in neuroimaging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The spatial distribution of HFOs and their evolution over time leading up to seizure onset is unknown. Also, recording HFOs through conventional intracranial electrodes is not well established. We therefore wished to determine whether HFOs could be recorded using commercially available depth macroelectrodes. We also examined the spatial distribution and temporal progression of HFOs during the transition to seizure activity. Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 19 seizures were obtained from seven patients with temporal lobe epilepsy using commercial depth or subdural electrodes. EEG recordings were analyzed for frequency content in five spectral bands spanning DC-500 Hz. We examined the spatial distribution of the different spectral bands 5 s before and 5 s after seizure onset. Temporal changes in the spectral bands were studied in the 30-s period leading up to seizure onset. Three main observations were made. First, HFOs (100-500 Hz) can be recorded using commercial depth and subdural grid electrodes. Second, HFOs, but not < 100 Hz oscillations, were localized to channels of ictal onset (100-200, 400-500 Hz, p < 0.05; 300-400 Hz, p < 0.001). Third, temporal analysis showed increased HFO power for approximately 8 s prior to electrographic onset (p < 0.05). These results suggest that HFOs can be recorded by depth macroelectrodes. Also, HFOs are localized to the region of primary ictal onset and can exhibit increased power during the transition to seizure. Thus, HFOs likely represent important precursors to seizure initiation.

DCM is based on a spatiotemporal model, where the temporal component is formulated in terms of neurobiologically plausible dynamics. Following an intuitive description of the model, we discuss six recent studies, which use DCM to analyze M/EEG and local field potentials. These studies illustrate how DCM can be used to analyze evoked responses (average response in time), induced responses (average response in time-frequency), and steady-state responses (average response in frequency). Bayesian model comparison plays a critical role in these analyses, by allowing one to compare equally plausible models in terms of their model evidence. This approach might be very useful in M/EEG research, where correlations among spatial and neuronal model parameter estimates can cause uncertainty about which model best explains the data. Bayesian model comparison resolves these uncertainties in a principled and formal way. We suggest that DCM and Bayesian model comparison provides a useful way to test hypotheses about distributed processing in the brain, using electromagnetic data. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1866-1876, 2009.

Results of spectral analysis confirm the importance of very high frequency oscillations (even greater than 600 Hz) in normal (healthy) and abnormal (epileptic) hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that the measures of Recurrence Quanti. cation Analysis (RQA) and Recurrence Time Statistics (RTS) are successful in indicating, rather uniquely, the onset of ictal state and the occurrence of some warnings/precursors during the pre-ictal state, in contrast to the linear measures investigated.

Methods. - Local and distant changes in EEG cortical oscillations were respectively assessed by the Event-Related Desynchronization/Synchronization technique and the Synchronization Likelihood technique. Data collected prior to, during, and after observation and execution of complex sequential finger movements were used to investigate these changes. EEGs were recorded from 19 active sites across the cortex of 10 subjects. Sensorimotor activity was examined in alpha frequency bands. Results. - Local power changes and global inter regional synchronizations were two distinct phenomena, which occurred simultaneously and displayed different spatiotemporal patterns. Discussion and conclusions. - These findings demonstrate the complementary character of both analysis techniques. Results are discussed in tight of the recent findings from the cognitive and behavioural neuroscience literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The goal of this system is to Produce it picture best resembling subject's 'imagined' image. This system evolves images using Compositional SUN Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs) via the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) genetic algorithm. Fitness values for NEAT-based evolution are derived from a real-time EEG classifier its images are presented using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Here, we report the design and performance, for a pilot training session, of a BCI system for real-time single-trial binary classification of viewed images based oil participant-specific brain response signatures present in 128-channel EEG data. Selected training-session image clips created by the image evolution algorithm were presented in 2-s bursts at 8/s. The subject indicated by Subsequent button press whether or not each burst included all image resembling two eyes. Approximately half the bursts included Such an image. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract a set of maximally independent EEG Source time-courses and their 100 minimally-redundant low-dimensional informative features ill the time and time-frequency amplitude domains front the (94%) bursts followed by correct manual responses. To estimate the likelihood that the post-image EEG contained EEG 'flickers' of target recognition, we applied two Fisher discriminant classifiers to the time and/or time-frequency features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by tenfold cross-validation was 0.96 using time-domain features, 0.97 using time-frequency domain features, and 0.98 using both domain features.

BOLD correlates of EEG alpha phase-locking and the fMRI default mode network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; FREQUENCY-BANDS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MATHEMATICAL RATIONALE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TIME-SERIES	Phase locking or synchronization of brain areas is a key concept of information processing in the brain. Synchronous oscillations have been observed and investigated extensively in EEG during the past decades. EEG oscillations occur over a wide frequency range. In EEG, a prominent type of oscillations is alpha-band activity, present typically when a subject is awake, but at rest with closed eyes. The spectral power of alpha rhythms has recently been investigated in simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings, establishing a wide-range cortico-thalamic network. However, spectral power and synchronization are different measures and little is known about the correlations between BOLD effects and EEG synchronization. Interestingly, the fMRI BOLD signal also displays synchronous oscillations across different brain regions. These oscillations delineate so-called resting state networks (RSNs) that resemble the correlation patterns of simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. However, the nature of these BOLD oscillations and their relations to EEG activity is still poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the subunits constituting a specific RSN may be coordinated by different EEG rhythms. In this study we report on evidence for this hypothesis. The BOLD correlates of global EEG synchronization (GFS) in the alpha frequency band are located in brain areas involved in specific RSNs, e. g. the 'default mode network'. Furthermore, our results confirm the hypothesis that specific RSNs are organized by long-range synchronization at least in the alpha frequency band. Finally, we could localize specific areas where the GFS BOLD correlates and the associated RSN overlap. Thus, we claim that not only the spectral dynamics of EEG are important, but also their spatio-temporal organization. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EROs are estimated by a decomposition of the EEG signal into phase and magnitude information for a range of frequencies and then changes in those frequencies are characterized over a millisecond time scale with respect to task events. EROs have been demonstrated to be sensitive measures of both normal and abnormal cognitive functioning in humans but have not been fully described in mice. The results of these studies demonstrate that EROs can be generated in cortical sites in mice in the delta, theta, alpha/beta frequency ranges in response to auditory stimuli. Oscillations in the 7.5-40 Hz frequencies were significantly affected in the 0-50 ms time range in response to differences in tone frequency. Whereas, changes in tone loudness produced changes in oscillations in the 7.5-40 Hz frequencies in the 350-800 ms range. No significant changes in EROs were found to differences in tone probability. These studies suggest that EROs are an electrophysiological assay sensitive to tone characteristics and as such may be suitable for the exploration of the effects of genetic or neuropharmacological manipulations on neurosensory processing in mice.

In an effort to study quantitative markers of attention during reading, we performed simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in four epileptic patients. Patients were asked to attend to a specific color when presented with an intermixed series of red words and green words, with words of a given color forming a cohesive story. We analyzed alpha, beta, and gamma band oscillatory responses to the word presentation and compared the strength and spatial organization of those responses in both electrophysiological recordings. Time-frequency analysis of iEEG revealed a network of clear attention-modulated high gamma band (50-150 Hz) power increases and alpha/beta (9-25 Hz) suppressions in response to the words. In addition to analyses at the sensor level, MEG time-frequency analysis was performed at the source level using a sliding window beamformer technique. Strong alpha/beta suppressions were observed in MEG reconstructions, in tandem with iEEG effects. While the MEG counterpart of high gamma band enhancement was difficult to interpret at the sensor level in two patients, MEG time-frequency source reconstruction revealed additional activation patterns in accordance with iEEG results. Importantly, iEEG allowed us to confirm that several sources of gamma band modulation observed with MEG were indeed of cortical origin rather than EMG muscular or ocular artifact.

In this review we provide an overview of the field of intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) and discuss its strengths and limitations and its relationship to non-invasive brain mapping techniques. We discuss the characteristics of invasive data acquired from implanted epilepsy patients using stereotactic-electroencephalography (SEEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) and the use of spectral analysis to reveal task-related modulations in Multiple frequency components. Increasing evidence suggests that gamma-band activity (>40 Hz) might be a particularly efficient index for functional mapping. Moreover, the detection of high gamma activity may play a crucial role in bridging the gap between electrophysiology and functional imaging studies as well as in linking animal and human data. The present review also describes recent advances in real-time invasive detection of oscillatory modulations (including gamma activity) in humans. Furthermore, the implications of intracerebral findings on future non-invasive studies are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1758-1771, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Although, these findings do not raise doubts about the widely established role of gamma range neural synchrony, it does call for caution when it comes to interpreting high frequency scalp EEG data. By contrast, gamma-band activity detected with intracerebral EEG (iEEG) is assumed to be immune to such miniature saccade artefacts. Here, we show for the first time, that while this is indeed largely the case, intracerebral recordings in the temporal pole of implanted patients can be contaminated by saccadic eye muscle artefacts resulting in typical high gamma-band power increases. By analyzing data from multiple depth electrodes, we show that this artefact is confined to the pole of the temporal lobe because of its immediate vicinity to extraocular muscles (rectus lateralis). For other brain structures, our analysis shows that the use of stereotactic EEG with a bipolar montage provides a robust and convenient tool to explore the functional role of gamma synchronization in humans with high anatomical accuracy during a wide range of cognitive processes, including oculomotor behaviour.

Feature extraction in brain-computer interface (BCI) work is an important task that significantly affects the success of brain signal classification. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied together with Student's two-sample t-statistics for 2D time-scale feature extraction, where features are extracted from EEG signals recorded from subjects performing left and right MI. First, we utilize the CWT to construct a 2D time-scale feature, which yields a highly redundant representation of EEG signals in the time-frequency domain, from which we can obtain precise localization of event-related brain desynchronization and synchronization (ERD and ERS) components. We then weight the 2D time-scale feature with Student's two-sample t-statistics, representing a time-scale plot of discriminant information between left and right MI. These important characteristics, including precise localization and significant discriminative ability, substantially enhance the classification of mental tasks. Finally, a correlation coefficient is used to classify the MI data. Due to its simplicity, it will enable the performance of our proposed method to be clearly demonstrated. Compared to a conventional 2D time-frequency feature and three well-known time-frequency approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed method provides reliable 2D time-scale features for BCI classification.

Methods: We recorded 64-channel EEG in parallel with EMG of the forearm muscles most affected by rest tremor in 21 PD patients. EMG power spectrum, corticomuscular coherence spectra and EEG power spectra for each EEG electrode were calculated. The dynamics of the coherence and relative EMG and EEG power at the basic (tremor) frequency were calculated by a sliding, overlapping window analysis. Corticomuscular delays and direction of interaction were analysed by the maximizing coherence method for narrow band signals. Results: The contralateral EEG electrodes with maximal coherence were different for the basic and first harmonic frequency. The dynamical coherence curves showed non-parallel time courses for the two frequencies. The mean EEG-EMG and EMG-EEG delays were all around 15-20 ms but significantly longer for the first harmonic than for the basic frequency. Conclusions: Our data indicate different cortical representations and corticomuscular interaction of the basic and first harmonic frequencies of Parkinsonian tremor. Significance: Separate central generators seem to contribute to the tremor via different pathways. Further studies on this complex tremor network are warranted.

A space-frequency-time atomic decomposition was applied to EEG data recorded while subjects performed tasks associated with varying levels of cognitive performance. The new atomic decomposition of cognitive workload data revealed alpha and theta EEG oscillations which agree with observations reported in the brain research literature. The temporal signature of the atoms discriminates between different levels of cognitive activity. The results and analysis confirm the utility of the multi-way decomposition method to construct new models and algorithms for monitoring cognitive status, which can supplement or overcome existing approaches based on conventional two-dimensional space-time or frequency-time data decomposition.

Our group is currently performing continuous, long-term electrophysiological recordings in human subjects undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery using hybrid intracranial electrodes composed of up to 320 micro- and clinical macroelectrode arrays. DC-capable amplifiers, sampling at 32 kHz per channel with 18-bits of A/D resolution are capable of resolving extracellular voltages spanning single-neuron action potentials, high frequency oscillations, and high amplitude ultra-slow activity, but this approach generates 3 terabytes of data per day (at 4 bytes per sample) using current data formats. Data compression can provide several practical benefits, but only if data can be compressed and appended to files in real-time in a format that allows random access to data segments of varying size. Here we describe a state-of-the-art, scalable, electrophysiology platform designed for acquisition, compression, encryption, and storage of large-scale data. Data are stored in a file format that incorporates lossless data compression using range-encoded differences, a 32-bit cyclically redundant checksum to ensure data integrity, and 128-bit encryption for protection of patient information.

However, it is reported little in literature that how to make these theoretical research productions be useful algorithms in practice and integrate them into EEG detection and analysis instrument. Based on virtual instrument technology, the time-frequency analysis methods on the detection of EEG signals have been further discussed from theory, then the concrete algorithms of the time-frequency analysis methods used for the extraction of EEG feature rhythms have been established and integrated into the virtual EEG instrument. By this way, the time-frequency analysis methods to be used to detect and extract the feature information in EEG signals automatically can be realized in clinical.

This article introduces the basics of time-frequency methods, which are typically applied for the analysis of event-related oscillations, focusing on adaptive procedures (e.g., wavelet networks). The potential of these methods is illustrated. Findings about event-related oscillations (gamma responses, theta responses) in children performing an auditory selective attention task are reviewed. Both the neuronal substrates of gamma (30-70 Hz) networks and the ability to synchronize these networks in relation to task-specific processes are available in children and adolescents from 9 to 16 years of age. Developmental changes in the task reactivity of synchronized gamma oscillations may provide evidence for a transition in cognitive processing strategies emerging at the age of 12-13 years. Event-related theta (3-7.5 Hz) activity is enhanced in two latency ranges. The early event-related theta response occurring 0-200 ms after a stimulus may be associated with representations of relevant target features in working memory. The late fronto-central theta response (200-450ms) could be related to the processing of task-irrelevant information. In summary, event-related oscillations can be analyzed using time-frequency methods like wavelet networks. This approach should be used intensively to study neurocognitive development in children.

The TMS equipment circuit is switched into three modes, and one of them is the oscillation mode by a capacitance in the equipment and a TMS coil. The electromagnetic induction from the TMS coil to the brain in this mode corresponds to the TMS. The bioelectric measurement system forms a closed circuit by a bioelectric equivalent circuit and an EEG measurement system, and the TMS induces the electromotive force into the closed circuit. The artifact induced by the TMS is measured as the TMS artifact, which is appended to the measured EEG. Under some simplified approximations, the TMS artifact is expressed by two modes, the TMS oscillation mode and the discharge mode, and the solutions of the TMS artifact are solved from circuit equations for each mode. The simulation output calculated from these solutions successfully describes the TMS artifact in the measured EEG data by considering the frequency property of the bioelectric circuit parameters.

High-density EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and Fourier analysis. Across subjects and sessions, when reaction time to lane-departure events increased, several clusters of independent component activities in the occipital, posterior parietal, and middle temporal cortex showed tonic power increases in the delta, theta, and alpha bands. The strongest of these tonic power increases occurred in the alpha band in the occipital and parietal regions. Other independent component clusters in the somatomotor and frontal regions showed less or no significant increase in all frequency bands as RT increased. This study demonstrates additional evidence of the close and specific links between cortical brain activities (via charges in EEG spectral power) and performance (reaction time) during sustained-attention tasks. These results may also provide insights into the development of human-computer interfaces for countermeasures for drowsy driving.

GMCA separates the EEG signals into sources that have different morphological characteristics. Each source is sparse in an overcomplete dictionary, which is constructed using discrete cosine transform, Daubechies wavelet basis and Dirac basis. The sources related to artifacts are then removed. Semi-simulated EEG signals of movement-related potentials trials contaminated by eye-blink and muscle artifacts are used to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The performance of GMCA is compared with those of two other blind source separation algorithms, AMUSE and EFICA. The results demonstrate that GMCA successfully removes artifacts from EEG signals and the resulting distortions in both time and frequency domains are significantly lower than those of the other algorithms.

Scalp EEG or intracerebral EEG signals recorded in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy convey important information about epileptogenic networks that must be localized and understood prior to subsequent therapeutic procedures. However, this information, often subtle, is 'hidden' in the signals. It is precisely the role of signal processing to extract this information and to put it into a 'coherent and interpretable picture' that can participate in the therapeutic strategy. Nowadays, the panel of available methods is very wide depending on the objectives such as, for instance, the detection of transient epileptiform events, the detection and/or prediction of seizures, the recognition and/or the classification of EEG patterns, the localization of epileptic neuronal sources, the characterization of neural synchrony, the determination of functional connectivity, among others. The intent of this paper is to focus on a specific category of methods providing relevant information about epileptogenic networks from the analysis of spatial properties of EEG signals in the time and frequency domain. These methods apply to either interictal or ictal recordings and share the common objective of localizing the subsets of brain structures involved in both types of paroxysmal activity. Most of these methods were developed by our group and are routinely used during pre-surgical evaluation. Examples are detailed. Results, as well as limitations of the methods, are also discussed.

Methods: The subjects were 20 patients with LGS (11 mates, 9 females; age range: 3 years 1 month to 29 years 3 months) who had at least one digitally recorded tonic seizure with minimal artifacts. A time-frequency analysis was applied to each patient's ictal EEG data. Results: A total of 54 seizures were analyzed, excluding spasms in clusters. The ictal EEGs of the tonic seizures showed only diffuse desynchronization in 10 seizures, and desynchronization followed by rhythmic activity in 21. The ictal discharges started as rhythmic activity of varying amplitude without initial desynchronization in 23 seizures. In a total of 25 seizures from 13 patients, gamma rhythms with frequencies ranging from 43 to 101.6 Hz were detected by temporal expansion of the ictal EEG traces and spectral analysis. In 24 (96%) of these seizures, gamma rhythms were observed at seizure onset corresponding to visually identified desynchronization. In the remaining seizure, gamma rhythms were found in association with transient suppression of high-amplitude rapid discharges. Conclusion: The detection of gamma rhythms in the ictal EEGs of tonic seizures indicated that some tonic seizures might have generative mechanisms in common with epileptic spasms, and that these mechanisms are possibly related to desynchronization at seizure onset.

J	Yordanova, J; Kolev, V				Yordanova, Juliana; Kolev, Vasil			Event-Related Brain Oscillations Developmental Effects on Power and Synchronization	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related potentials; phase-locking; single sweep analysis; children; cognitive processing	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; SINGLE-SWEEP ANALYSIS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSE SYSTEM; THETA-RESPONSE; EEG RESPONSES; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; P300	Neuroelectric oscillations provide important tools to study information processing in the brain. In this paper, major concepts and advantages of event-related oscillations (EROs) are considered, with a focus on their relevance for developmental research. Findings from previous studies in passive and oddball conditions are summarized to demonstrate that the age-dependent power decrease of theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) EROs is accompanied by an increase in the synchronization of these oscillations. New data are presented to test whether this dissociation depends on processing demands in a frequency-specific manner. Results from an auditory serial learning task with working memory activation performed by 70 subjects (children from 6 to 10 years of age and adults) indicate that this effect was observed for theta and slow alpha oscillations, whereas an age-dependent decrease in event-related phase synchronization was found for fast alpha oscillations. It is concluded that phase synchronization of only the major theta and alpha EROs may reflect the neurobiological maturation of neural networks involved in perception. Phase synchronization of EROs, however, especially from faster frequency bands, essentially depends on the mode of network involvement and functional competence, which is associated with cognitive processing abilities or strategies in the course of development.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation affects behavior by biasing endogenous cortical oscillations	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oscillations; alpha band; transcranial magnetic stimulation; rTMS; electroencephalography; working memory; spatial	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; LOAD; EXCITABILITY	A governing assumption about repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been that it interferes with task-related neuronal activity - in effect, by "injecting noise" into the brain - and thereby disrupts behavior. Recent reports of rTMS-produced behavioral enhancement, however, call this assumption into question. We investigated the neurophysiological effects of rTMS delivered during the delay period of a visual working memory task by simultaneously recording brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects performed visual working memory for locations or for shapes, and in half the trials a 10-Hz train of rTMS was delivered to the superior parietal lobule (SPL) or a control brain area. The wide range of individual differences in the effects of rTMS on task accuracy, from improvement to impairment, was predicted by individual differences in the effect of rTMS on power in the alpha-band of the EEG (similar to 10 Hz): a decrease in alpha-band power corresponded to improved performance, whereas an increase in alpha-band power corresponded to the opposite. The EEG effect was localized to cortical sources encompassing the frontal eye fi elds and the intraparietal sulcus, and was specifi c to task (location, but not object memory) and to rTMS target (SPL, not control area). Furthermore, for the same task condition, rTMS-induced changes in cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha-and gamma-band (>40 Hz) oscillations predicted changes in behavior. These results suggest that alpha-band oscillations play an active role cognitive processes and do not simply refl ect absence of processing. Furthermore, this study shows that the complex effects of rTMS on behavior can result from biasing endogenous patterns of network-level oscillations.

To study the interactions between these components we analyze the cross modulation of their instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies, separating synchronous and antisynchronous modulation. We apply our novel technique to brain-wave oscillations in the human electroencephalogram and show that interactions between the alpha wave and the delta or beta wave oscillators as well as spatial interactions can be quantified and related with physiological conditions (e.g., sleep stages). Our approach overcomes the limitation to oscillations with similar frequencies and enables us to quantify directly nonlinear effects such as positive or negative frequency modulation.

These different types of long-range synchrony are hypothesized to originate from distinct mechanisms. We tested this by comparing time-resolved EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG coherence in a bilateral precision-grip task. Bilateral EMG activity was synchronized between 7 and 13 Hz for about 1 s when force output from both hands changed from an increasing to a stable force production. In contrast, EEG-EMG coherence was statistically significant between 15 and 30 Hz during stable force production. The disparities in their time-frequency profiles accord with the existence of distinct underlying processes for corticomuscular and bilateral motor unit synchronization. In addition, the absence of synchronization between cortical activity and common spinal input at 10 Hz renders a cortical source unlikely. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, few have evaluated EEG findings in migraineurs during a time period when neither the last attack nor the next attack may interact with the results. We, therefore, compared interictal EEG in migraineurs and headache-free subjects with a design controlled for interference by pre-ictal changes. Pre-ictal EEG findings in the painful cranial side during the next attack after registration were also investigated. Correlations between clinical variables and EEG are reported as well. Interictal EEGs from 33 migraineurs (6 with and 27 without aura) and 31 controls were compared. Absolute power, asymmetry and relative power were studied for delta, theta and alpha frequency bands in parieto-occipital, temporal and fronto-central areas. EEG variables were correlated to attack frequency, headache duration, attack duration, pain intensity, photo- and phonophobia. Compared with controls, migraineurs had increased relative theta power in all cortical regions and increased delta activity in the painful fronto-central region. Absolute power and asymmetry were similar among groups. In age-adjusted analyses, headache intensity correlated with increased delta activity. In this blinded controlled study, we found globally increased relative theta activity in migraineurs. A slight interictal brain dysfunction is probably present between attacks.

A Wavelet Packet-Based Algorithm for the Extraction of Neural Rhythms	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wavelet packet transform; Feature extraction; Brain rhythms; EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NOISE; EEG	Neural rhythms are associated with different brain functions and pathological conditions. These rhythms are often clinically relevant for purposes of diagnosis or treatment, though their complex, time-varying features make them difficult to isolate. The wavelet packet transform has proven itself to be versatile and effective with respect to resolving signal features in both time and frequency. We propose a signal analysis technique, called neural rhythm extraction (NRE) that incorporates wavelet packet analysis along with a threshold-based scheme for separating rhythmic neural features from non-rhythmic ones. We applied NRE to rat in vitro intracellular recordings and human scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and were able to isolate and classify individual neural rhythms in signals containing large amplitude spikes and other artifacts. NRE is capable of discriminating signal features sharing similar time or frequency localization, as well as extracting low-amplitude, low-power rhythms otherwise masked by spectrally dominant signal components. The algorithm allows for independent retention and reconstruction of rhythmic features, which may serve to enhance other analysis techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA), and aid in application-specific tasks such as detection, classification or tracking.

EEG recordings provide valuable information about electrical activity of the neurons in the brain, so it is an important tool in studying and recognizing several neurological disorders like epilepsy. The main goal of this paper was to distinguish different characteristics EEG between pilocarpine-induced and penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges using time-frequency analysis. The results showed that in the course of epilepsy, changes of the frequency and the energy were characteristic. High frequency and high energy distribution period was unsynchronized in pilocarpine-induced epileptiform discharges, especially before onset, EEG appeared the highest frequency, but energy was the lowest. However, frequency was lower in the whole process and energy increased significantly after the attack in penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges. These differences between pilocarpine-induced and penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges may relate to respective excitatory mechanism which needs studying further.

A relationship between SWD and normal sleep spindles is often assumed. This study compares time-frequency parameters of SW and sleep spindles as recorded in the EEG in the WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. Fast Fourier transformation and continuous wavelet transformation were used for EEG analysis. Wavelet analysis was performed in non-segmented full-length EEG. A specific wavelet-based algorithm was developed for the automatic identification of sleep spindles and SWD. None of standard wavelet templates provided precise identification of all sleep spindles and SWD in the EEG and different wavelet templates were imperative in order to accomplish this task. SWD were identified with high probability using standard Morlet wavelet, but sleep spindles were identified using two types of customized adoptive 'spindle wavelets'. It was found that (1) almost 100% of SWD (but only 50-60% of spindles) were identified using the Morlet-based wavelet transform. (2) 82-91% of sleep spindles were selected using adoptive 'spindle wavelet 1'(template's peak frequency similar to 12.2 Hz), the remaining sleep spindles with 'spindle wavelet 2' (peak frequency similar to 20-25 Hz). (3) Sleep spindles and SWD were detected by the elevation of wavelet energy in different frequencies: SWD, in 30-50 Hz band, sleep spindles, in 7-14Hz. It is concluded that the EEG patterns of sleep spindles and SWD belong to different families of phasic EEG events with different time frequency characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A number of EEG studies have indentified the mu rhythm desynchronization a reliable EEG pattern for brain-computer interface. Considering the non-stationary characteristics of the motor imagery EEG, the EMD method is proposed to decompose the EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the IMFs, the characteristics one representing mu rhythm oscillations can be detected. Then by Hilbert transformation, the event-related desynchronization phenomenon can be found by the envelope of the characteristics IMF. Results demonstrate that the EM-D method is an effective time-frequency analysis tool for non-stationary EEG signal.

Analysis of Epileptic EEG Signals by Means of Empirical Mode Decomposition and Time-Varying Two-Sided Autoregressive modelling	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Epileptic EEG; seizure detection; empirical mode decomposition; two-sided autoregressive modelling; time-frequency analysis		The presentation concerns the analysis of EEG recordings for epileptic seizure detection. The EEG signal is decomposed adaptively into oscillating components called implicit mode functions (IMFs) using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm and then a time-frequency analysis is carried out on the first two components using a parametric time-frequency distribution based on two-sided autoregressive modeling. The local frequency of the IMF extracted at some iteration is lower than that of the IMF extracted at the previous iteration which enables to analyze the signal at different scales. The relative variation of the instantaneous frequency of the IMFs estimated using two-sided autoregressive model-based time-frequency distribution is used as a feature for automatic seizure detection in the EEG recordings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on EEG signals recorded from 18 patients suffering from different kinds of epileptic seizures as well as on normal EEG data recorded from control population.

Methods: The method uses the Gabor Transform and detects changes of power in comparison to background activity using t-statistics that are controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct type I error of multiple testing. The analysis was applied to EEGs recorded at 2000 Hz from three patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: Spike-related increase of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) was clearly shown in the FDR-controlled t-spectra: it was most dramatic in spikes recorded from the hippocampus when the hippocampus was the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Depression of fast activity was observed immediately after the spikes, especially consistently in the discharges from the hippocampal SOZ. It corresponded to the slow wave part in case of spike-and-slow-wave complexes, but it was noted even in spikes without apparent slow waves. In one patient, a gradual increase of power above 200 Hz preceded spikes. Conclusions: FDR-controlled t-spectra clearly detected the spike-related changes of HFOs that were unclear in standard power spectra. Significance: We developed a promising tool to study the HFOs that may be closely linked to the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this study, K-complexes (KCs) were evoked by auditory stimuli delivered during sleep. The use of evoked KCs enables testing the sleeping nervous system under good experimental control. This paradigm allowed us to adopt into the KC studies a method of signal analysis that provides time-frequency maps of statistically significant changes in signal energy density. Our results indicate that KCs and sleep spindles may be organized by a slow oscillation. Accordingly, KCs might be evoked only if the stimulus occurs in a certain phase of the slow oscillation. We also observed middle-latency evoked responses following auditory stimulation in the last sleep cycle. This effect was revealed only by the time-frequency maps and was not visible in standard averages.

The main objective is to decompose a multichannel EEG into time-frequency-space atoms. A lot of work was done in the field of subspace estimation with two of the aforementioned three dimensions, e.g., by using an SVD, PCA or ICA as well as space-time filtering or beam-forming. A more powerful approach is the use of tensor decompositions. For example, PARAFAC (Parallel Factor) analysis decomposes a tensor into rank-one components and thereby represents a multidimensional extension of the SVD. This renders it an attractive approach for EEG signal analysis. The selection of an appropriate time-frequency preprocessing scheme improves the results of the PARAFAC analysis. In a first study, we have investigated several time-frequency preprocessing techniques to create a tensor in time, frequency, and space for multichannel EEG signals. The common approach in PARAFAC analysis is the use of a wavelet transformation based on the MORLET wavelet as a preprocessing step. In this paper, we show that preprocessing based on the Wigner distribution leads to much better results than a wavelet analysis. First results have been obtained by the use of EEG signals of evoked potentials.

We applied a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis to compute alpha band power, statistical evaluation was performed using repeated-measures ANOVA and the non-parametric multi-way analysis. Results showed that both stimuli provoked an initial increase of total alpha power emerging not later than in 100 ms after the stimulus onset. The increase was caused by the phase-locked alpha response, and the illusory contour was systematically followed by a higher level of alpha power than the non-illusory one. Further suppression of total alpha power occurred within the time window of 200-500 ms after the stimulus onset and did not depend on the stimulus type. Both stages of the total alpha response were more prominent over the parieto-occipi-to-temporal scalp areas. We hypothesize that the first stage of alpha response is related to the modulation of the activity of neural circuits participating in processing of a coherent pattern whereas a later suppression of total alpha power links to the orienting processes.

We considered 5 CAE patients, all right-handed females and aged 6-8 years. The 15 control individuals had the same characteristics of the CAE ones, but presented a normal EEG. The EEG was obtained using bipolar connections from a standard 10-20 electrode placement (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, 01 and 02). Recordings were undertaken in the resting state with eyes closed. EEG hallmarks of absence seizure activity are widely accepted, but there is a recognition that the bulk of interictal EEG in CAE appears normal to visual inspection. The functional activity between electrodes was evaluated using a wavelet decomposition in conjunction with the Wootters distance. Then, pairs of electrodes with differentiated behavior between CAE and controls were identified using a test statistic-based feature selection technique. This approach identified clear differences between CAE and healthy control background EEG in the frontocentral electrodes, as measured by Principal Component Analysis. The findings of this pilot study can have strong implications in future clinical practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By contrast, cortical inhibition (CI) refers to a neurophysiological process in which GABAergic inhibitory interneurons selectively suppress the activation of other neurons in the cortex. Recently, abnormalities in both CI and gamma-oscillations have been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Animal research suggests that suppression of gamma-oscillations is, in part, mediated through GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. However, no such evidence has been demonstrated in human, largely because of technological limitations. Recently, we reported on novel methods permitting the recording of CI from the DLPFC through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission on gamma-oscillations by combining TMS with EEG. Long interval cortical inhibition (LICI), a paired TMS paradigm, was used to index GABA(B) receptor mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in the motor cortex and DLPFC of healthy individuals. g- Oscillations were significantly inhibited by LICI (38.1 +/- 26.5%; p <= 0.013) in the DLPFC but not in the motor cortex. These results provide neurophysiological evidence to demonstrate gamma-oscillations are inhibited by LICI in the DLPFC but not in the motor cortex. Such specificity suggests that the modulation of gamma-oscillations may represent an important neurophysiological process that may, in part, be responsible for optimal DLPFC functioning in healthy human subjects.

The differences in the responses of the EEG signals, the intrinsic mode function (IMF) and the Hilbert spectrum between the simulation results of the clinical EEG signals of the alcoholic and control groups are discussed. When comparing the clinical EEG signals of the alcoholic and control groups, the EEGs of the control group of picture observers did not appear to indicate significantly larger voltage. The EEG signals of the alcoholic group in the experiment suggested that when they were exposed to the stimulus, brain cells were stimulated and emitted higher voltage.

CORTICO-PONTINE THETA SYNCHRONIZATION PHASE SHIFT FOLLOWING MONOAMINERGIC LESION IN RAT	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; theta oscillations synchronization; phase shift spectra; cortex; pons; rat; monoaminergic lesion	SLEEP CYCLE; REM-SLEEP; WAVES; OSCILLATIONS; PROJECTIONS; DISTURBANCE; GENERATION; SEROTONIN; DISCHARGE; DORSAL	The experiments were performed in 14 adult, male Sprague Dawley rats chronically instrumented for sleep recording and recorded during baseline condition, following sham injection (saline i.p. 1 ml/kg), and every week for 5 weeks following injection of the systemic neurotoxins (DSP-4 or PCA; 1 ml/kg, i.p.) for chemical axotomy of the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe (DR) axon terminals. In our former study we demonstrated that the systemically induced lesion of the noradrenergic or serotonergic axon terminals did not affect the sleep-wake distribution from control condition. In this Study, by using spectral analysis and phase shift spectra of the cortical and pontine EEG we analyzed cortico-pontine theta oscillation synchronization phase shift on 6-hour recordings in control condition and 28 days following the monoaminergic lesions, as a time for permanently established DR or LC chemical axotomy. Our results demonstrated for the first time that chronically decreased brain monoamines in freely moving rats changed cortico-pontine theta synchronization phase shift. Pons became a leading theta oscillator. We assume that deficit of monoamines induced predominance of the NREM/REM transitions, characterized with phasic theta oscillations (the increased density of clustered P waves which intrinsic frequency corresponds to theta frequency oscillations), and may produced preceding phasic theta versus tonic theta oscillation drive.

Epileptic Seizure Detection in EEGs Using Time-Frequency Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Artificial neural networks (ANNs); EEG; epilepsy; seizure detection; time-frequency (t-f) analysis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SPIKE DETECTION; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; LONG	The detection of recorded epileptic seizure activity in EEG segments is crucial for the localization and classification of epileptic seizures. However, since seizure evolution is typically a dynamic and nonstationary process and the signals are composed of multiple frequencies, visual and conventional frequency-based methods have limited application. In this paper, we demonstrate the suitability of the time-frequency (t-f) analysis to classify EEG segments for epileptic seizures, and we compare several methods for t-f analysis of EEGs. Short-time Fourier transform and several t-f distributions are used to calculate the power spectrum density (PSD) of each segment. The analysis is performed in three stages: 1) t-f analysis and calculation of the PSD of each EEG segment; 2) feature extraction, measuring the signal segment fractional energy on specific t-f windows; and 3) classification of the EEG segment (existence of epileptic seizure or not), using artificial neural networks. The methods are evaluated using three classification problems obtained from a benchmark EEG dataset, and qualitative and quantitative results are presented.

Inference of neural function based on the properties of brain rhythms remains a challenging data analysis problem. Algorithms that characterize non-stationary rhythms with high temporal and spectral resolution may be useful for interpreting LFP activity on the timescales in which they are generated. We propose a Kalman smoother based dynamic autoregressive model for tracking the instantaneous frequency (iFreq) and frequency modulation (FM) of noisy and non-stationary sinusoids such as those found in LFP data. We verify the performance of our algorithm using simulated data with broad spectral content, and demonstrate its application using real data recorded from behavioral learning experiments. In analyses of ripple oscillations (100-250 Hz) recorded from the rodent hippocampus, our algorithm identified novel repetitive, short timescale frequency dynamics. Our results suggest that iFreq and FM may be useful measures for the quantification of small timescale LFP dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ocular Reduction in EEG Signals Based on Adaptive Filtering, Regression and Blind Source Separation	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Electrooculography (EOG); Ocular artifacts; Regression analysis; Adaptive filtering; Blind source separation (BSS); Independent component analysis (ICA)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL; DYNAMICS	Quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis is very useful for diagnosing dysfunctional neural states and for evaluating drug effects on the brain, among others. However, the bidirectional contamination between electrooculographic (EOG) and cerebral activities can mislead and induce wrong conclusions from EEG recordings. Different methods for ocular reduction have been developed but only few studies have shown an objective evaluation of their performance. For this purpose, the following approaches were evaluated with simulated data: regression analysis, adaptive filtering, and blind source separation (BSS). In the first two, filtered versions were also taken into account by filtering EOG references in order to reduce the cancellation of cerebral high frequency components in EEG data. Performance of these methods was quantitatively evaluated by level of similarity, agreement and errors in spectral variables both between sources and corrected EEG recordings. Topographic distributions showed that errors were located at anterior sites and especially in frontopolar and lateral-frontal regions. In addition, these errors were higher in theta and especially delta band. In general, filtered versions of time-domain regression and of adaptive filtering with RLS algorithm provided a very effective ocular reduction. However, BSS based on second order statistics showed the highest similarity indexes and the lowest errors in spectral variables.	[Romero, S.; Mananas, M.

Increase of Theta/Gamma and Alpha3/Alpha2 Ratio is Associated with Amygdalo-Hippocampal Complex Atrophy	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Amygdalo-hippocampal complex; cognitive tests; electroencephalography; gamma rhythm; mild cognitive impairment; theta rhythm	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MEDIAL TEMPORAL ATROPHY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; EEG MARKERS; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; VASCULAR DAMAGE	We evaluated the association between amygdalo-hippocampal complex (AHC) atrophy and two electroencephalography (EEG) markers of cognitive decline: increase of theta/gamma and increase of alpha3/alpha2 relative power ratio. Seventy-nine subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent EEG recording and magnetic resonance imaging scan. Based on the tertiles values of decreasing AHC volume, three groups of AHC growing atrophy were obtained. The groups were characterized by the performance to cognitive tests and theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 relative power ratio. AHC atrophy is associated with memory deficits as well as with increase of theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 ratio. Moreover, when the amygdalar and hippocampal volume are separately considered within AHC, the increase of theta/gamma ratio is best associated with amygdalar atrophy whereas alpha3/alpha2 ratio is best associated with hippocampal atrophy. AHC atrophy is associated with memory deficits and EEG markers of cognitive decline. So far, these EEG markers could have a prospective value in differential diagnosis between patients with MCI who develop dementia and those who do not as well as between MCI patients who will develop Alzheimer's disease and those who develop non-Alzheimer's disease dementias. The alterations of the functional connections, inducing global network pathological changes, in the whole AHC could better explain MCI state.

The results indicate a tendency for the, gamma, theta, and alpha frequency bands in EEG signals to have a higher dimensional complexity than the beta and gamma frequency bands. We also investigate the tune-frequency component decomposition of EEG signals and observe very different, perceptual complexity and a difference in evoked spectral responses, which could be a reflection of neuronal recruitment that triggers the epileptogenic process. The results of this study may provide insights to the brain network's mechanism by which local and regional circuits can continuously form and reform with different regions functionally disconnected from other brain areas.

Enhancement of Signal-to-noise Ratio of Peroneal Nerve Somatosensory Evoked Potential Using Independent Component Analysis and Time-Frequency Template	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP); Independent component analysis (ICA); Peroneal nerve; Time-frequency template	ARTIFACTS; EEG	This study aims to recover the somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) from the smearing electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with the proposed time-frequency SSEP template (TF-SSEP). The SSEPs induced from patients with the impaired motor functions exhibit longer latency and lower amplitude than the normal SSEPs and are inevitably contaminated by artifacts and environmental noise. Although ICA has been demonstrated as a novel technique to segregate the EEG into independent sources, the selection of task-related components needs to be further elaborated. The TF-SSEP template, generated by the Morelet wavelet transformation of the averaged SSEPs from three normal subjects, was used to automatically extract the SSEP-related features. The performance of the TF-SSEP template was further validated using EEGs through the left and right peroneal nerve stimulation of four stroke patients. After ICA decomposition, the sources were selected for reconstruction if their correlation coefficients with the TF-SSEP template were higher than the predetermined threshold. On the other hand, the unselected sources were considered as the event-unrelated components or artifacts. Among all patients, the topography maps at four peak times, namely P40, N45, P60 and N75, showed higher contrast in the vicinity of the foot-associated motor area, and the resolved SSEPs demonstrated uncontaminated waveforms in comparison with the conventionally averaging method. This indicated that the proposed method can remarkably suppress artifacts and effectively extracted the SSEP-related features.	[Hung, C. I.; Wu, Y.

In the signal processing literature, there is growing interest in sparse time-frequency representations, where the data are described using few components. A popular algorithm is Matching Pursuit (MP) [Mallat SG, Zhang Z. Matching pursuits with time-frequency dictionaries. IEEE Trans Sig Proc 1993;41:3397-415], which iteratively subtracts from the signal its projection on atoms selected from a dictionary. The MP algorithm was recently adapted for multivariate datasets [Durka PJ, Matysiak A, Martinez-Montes E, Sosa PV, Blinowska KJ. Multichannel matching pursuit and EEG inverse solutions. J Neurosci Methods 2005;148:49-59; Gribonval R. Piecewise linear source separation. Proc SPIE'03 2003. p. 297-310], which is relevant for brain signals that are typically recorded using many channels and trials. So far, most approaches have assumed a stable pattern across channels or trials, even though cross-trial variability is often observed in brain signals. In this study, we adapt Matching Pursuit for brain signals with cross-trial variability in all their characteristics (time, frequency, number of oscillations). The originality of our method is to select each atom using a voting technique that is robust to variability, and to subtract it by adapting the parameters to each trial. Because the inter-trial variability is handled using a voting technique, the method is called Consensus Matching Pursuit (CMP). The CMP method is validated on simulated and real data, and shown to be robust to variability. Compared to existing multivariate Matching Pursuit algorithms, it (i) estimates atoms that are more representative of single-trial waveforms, (ii) leads to a sparser representation of the data, and (iii) permits quantify the amount of variability across trials.

Five ad-hoc functional constraints were used to extract the activity reflecting the temporal sequence of sensory information processing along the somatosensory pathway in response to the separate left and right median nerve galvanic stimulation. Constraints required only the maximization of the responsiveness at specific latencies following sensory stimulation, without taking into account that any frequency or spatial information. After source extraction, the reliability of identified FS was assessed based on the position of single dipoles fitted on its retroprojected signals and on a discrepancy measure. The FS positions were consistent with previously reported data (two early subcortical sources localized in the brain stem and thalamus, the three later sources in cortical areas), leaving negligible residual activity at the corresponding latencies. The high-frequency component of the oscillatory activity (HFO) of the extracted component was analyzed. The integrity of the low amplitude HFOs was preserved for each FS. On the basis of our data, we suggest that FSS can be an effective tool to investigate the HFO behavior of the different neuronal pools, recruited at successive times after median nerve galvanic Stimulation. As FSs are reconstructed along the entire experimental session, directional and dynamic HFO synchronization phenomena can be studied. Hum Brain Mapp 30:660-674, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss. Inc.

Given the intriguing activation of paroxysmal activity during NREM sleep in patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), a thorough characterization of commonalities and differences between the neural correlates of LKS paroxysms and normal sleep oscillations might provide useful information on the neural underpinning of this disorder. Especially, given the suspected role of sleep in brain plasticity, this type of information is needed to assess the link between cognitive deterioration and electroencephalography (EEG) paroxysms during sleep.

Empirical mode decomposition phase locking (EMDPL) analysis is a method for determining the frequency and timing of phase synchrony that is adaptive to intrinsic oscillations within data, alleviating the need for arbitrary bandpass filter cut-off selection. It is extended here to address the choice of reference electrode and removal of spurious synchrony resulting from volume conduction. Spline Laplacian transformation and independent component analysis (ICA) are performed as pre-processing steps, and preservation of phase synchrony between synthetic signals. combined using a simple forward model, is demonstrated. The method is contrasted with use of bandpass filtering following the same preprocessing steps, and filter cut-offs are shown to influence synchrony detection markedly. Furthermore, an approach to the assessment of multiple EEG trials using the method is introduced, and the assessment of statistical significance of phase locking episodes is extended to render it adaptive to local phase synchrony levels. EMDPL is validated in the analysis of real EEG data, during finger tapping. The time course of event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS) is shown to differ from that of longer range phase locking episodes, implying different roles for these different types of synchronisation. It is suggested that the increase in phase locking which occurs just prior to movement, coinciding with a reduction in power (or ERD) may result from selection of the neural assembly relevant to the particular movement.

We analyze event related multi-channel EEG recordings on the basis of the time-varying spectrum for each channel. It is a common approach to use wavelet transformations for the time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the data. To identify the signal components we decompose the data into time-frequency-space atoms using Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) analysis. In this paper we show that a TFA based on the Wigner-Ville distribution together with the recently developed closed-form PARAFAC algorithm enhance the separability of the signal components. This renders it an attractive approach for processing EEG data. Additionally, we introduce the new concept of component amplitudes, which resolve the scaling ambiguity in the PARAFAC model and can be used to judge the relevance of the individual components.

Mental Training Enhances Attentional Stability: Neural and Behavioral Evidence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; MEDITATION; CORTEX; TASK; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXPERTISE	The capacity to stabilize the content of attention over time varies among individuals, and its impairment is a hallmark of several mental illnesses. Impairments in sustained attention in patients with attention disorders have been associated with increased trial-to-trial variability in reaction time and event-related potential deficits during attention tasks. At present, it is unclear whether the ability to sustain attention and its underlying brain circuitry are transformable through training. Here, we show, with dichotic listening task performance and electroencephalography, that training attention, as cultivated by meditation, can improve the ability to sustain attention. Three months of intensive meditation training reduced variability in attentional processing of target tones, as indicated by both enhanced theta-band phase consistency of oscillatory neural responses over anterior brain areas and reduced reaction time variability. Furthermore, those individuals who showed the greatest increase in neural response consistency showed the largest decrease in behavioral response variability. Notably, we also observed reduced variability in neural processing, in particular in low-frequency bands, regardless of whether the deviant tone was attended or unattended. Focused attention meditation may thus affect both distracter and target processing, perhaps by enhancing entrainment of neuronal oscillations to sensory input rhythms, a mechanism important for controlling the content of attention. These novel findings highlight the mechanisms underlying focused attention meditation and support the notion that mental training can significantly affect attention and brain function.

After we made recordings in the normal state, hemiparkinsonism was induced with intracarotid injections of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in one animal, followed by additional recordings. Spiking activity in the pallidum and STN was associated with significant shifts in the level of EEG synchronization. We also found that the spectral power of beta- and gamma-band EEG rhythms covaried positively before the basal ganglia spikes but did not covary or covaried negatively thereafter. In parkinsonism, changes in cortical synchronization and phase coherence were reduced in EEG segments aligned to STN spikes, whereas both were increased in data segments aligned to pallidal spikes. Spiking-related changes in beta/gamma-band covariance were reduced. The findings indicate that basal ganglia and cortex interact in the processing of cortical rhythms that contain oscillations across a broad range of frequencies and that this interaction is severely disrupted in parkinsonism.

Robert; Khosravani, Houman; Federico, Paolo			Time-Frequency Phase Analysis of Ictal EEG Recordings With the S-Transform	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; phase; S-transform; spike-wave discharge; time-frequency; wavelet		The calculation and visualization of temporal and phase information in the brain, such as during cognitive processes and epileptiform activity, is an important tool in EEG-based studies of physiological brain activation. To this end, we present a technique that estimates the phase and time offsets between different channels in EEG recordings of seizure activity. The offset information is visually combined with amplitude information to emphasize the most significant signal features. The estimates of phase and time offset are derived from the S-transform, a time-frequency representation that is similar to a windowed Fourier transform, but with a wavelet-like, scalable window. The phase offsets are obtained from the differences between phase spectra of S-transforms of different traces, and the time offsets are then obtained from the frequency-domain gradients of the phase offsets. This is analogous to the link between frequency "phase ramping" and time translation in ordinary Fourier analysis. In this paper, we present a synthetic example to help describe the method, and then show ictal EEG recordings from two human subjects. The differences between the recording times of spike-wave discharges at different electrodes exhibit behavior that is strongly dependent on time and frequency.	[Pinnegar, C.

A high resolution time-frequency spectral was achieved by using Empirical Mode Decomposition and Hilbert-Huang Transform, and the subject specific spatial-time-frequency joint features were extracted from the restricted spectral of multi-channel EEG recordings. A weighting synthetic classifier was built and used to identify the classes of the imaged motions The test results in four subjects showed that the classification accuracy varied between 77.0% and 95.0%, with an average of 85.9%, which suggested that the present method can achieve a reasonable performance in identifying imaged motions compared with previous methods.

To improve the task-efficiency, we investigated the brain activity for the interaction between emotion induced by sounds and cognitive function, using the Stroop task with EEG measurements. The music leading pleasure increased the upper alpha-wave power of the frontal and parietal brain regions, relative to hearing the unpleasant white noise. The alpha activity decreased during the cognitive tasks. Interestingly, the frontal alpha suppression was reduced in the non-verbal task with the pleasant music and the verbal task with the unpleasant noise, like the task performance, which would indicate the interference between emotion and cognition.

J	Nobili, R				Nobili, Renato			New perspectives in brain information processing	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Subthreshold oscillations; Subthreshold oscillation control; Neuron-firing synchronization; EEG; Brainweb; Phasic and tonic inhibitions	SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODEL; CORTEX	Brain cortex activity, as variously recorded by scalp or cortical electrodes in the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency range, probably reflects the basic strategy of brain information processing. Various hypotheses have been advanced to interpret this phenomenon, the most popular of which is that suitable combinations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons behave as assemblies of oscillators susceptible to synchronization and desynchronization. Implicit in this view is the assumption that EEG potentials are epiphenomena of action potentials, which is consistent with the argument that voltage variations in dendritic membranes reproduce the postsynaptic effects of targeting neurons. However, this classic argument does not really fit the discovery that firing synchronization over extended brain areas often appears to be established in about 1 ms, which is a small fraction of any EEG frequency component period. This is in contrast with the fact that all computational models of dynamic systems formed by more or less weakly interacting oscillators of near frequencies take more than one period to reach synchronization. The discovery that the somatodendritic membranes of specialized populations of neurons exhibit intrinsic subthreshold oscillations (ISOs) in the EEG frequency range, together with experimental evidence that short inhibitory stimuli are capable of resetting ISO phases, radically changes the scheme described above and paves the way to a novel view. This paper aims to elucidate the nature of ISO generation mechanisms, to explain the reasons for their reliability in starting and stopping synchronized firing, and to indicate their potential in brain information processing. The need for a repertoire of extraneuronal regulation mechanisms, putatively mediated by astrocytes, is also inferred. Lastly, the importance of ISOs for the brain as a parallel recursive machine is briefly discussed.

Single-Trial Evoked Brain Responses Modeled by Multivariate Matching Pursuit	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Auditory evoked fields (AEF); electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG); multivariate matching pursuit (MMP)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG; VARIABILITY; DECOMPOSITION	We present a new approach to the analysis of brain evoked electromagnetic potentials and fields. Multivariate version of the matching pursuit algorithm (MMP) performs an iterative, exhaustive search for waveforms, which optimally fit to signal structures, persistent in all the responses (trials) with the same time of occurrence, frequency, phase, and time width, but varying amplitude. The search is performed in a highly redundant time-frequency dictionary of Gabor functions, i.e., sines modulated by Gaussians. We present the feasibility of such a single-trial MMP analysis of the auditory M100 response, using an illustrative dataset acquired in a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurement with auditory stimulation with sinusoidal 1-kHz tones. We find that the morphology of the M100 estimate obtained from simple averaging of single trials can be very well explained by the average reconstruction with a few Gabor functions that parametrize those single trials. The M100 peak amplitude of single-trial reconstructions is observed to decrease with repetitions, which indicates habituation to the stimulus. This finding suggests that certain waveforms fitted by MMP could possibly be related to physiologically distinct components of evoked magnetic fields, which would allow tracing their dynamics on a single-trial level.

In this paper, two groups of six healthy male volunteers of ages 27.6 +/- 14.2 (mean +/- SD) and 28.5 +/- 13.0 (mean +/- SD) and no neurological disease participated in this study. A digital storage of 12-channel EEG recorder was used and spectral analyses of the data set of 18 trials were obtained before, during, and after sham/manual acupuncture. To minimize artefacts. all data were collected with the subjects alert but eyes closed. No significant changes (P > 0.05) were obtained for the sham acupuncture group. As for the manual acupuncture group, the needle was inserted perpendicularly into file PC 6 acupuncture site and manually stimulated about 15 to 30 seconds to achieve De Qi sensation. Needles were left in place for 30 min and then removed. Analysis of the EEG data due to acupuncture was compared to the baseline data and changes were obtained. First, all trials had an increase in file amplitude and power of the alpha hand during manual acupuncture (P < 0.05) when compared with the baseline data. Secondly, in the mean time. the frequency peaks in alpha band of 12-channels were all synchronized with much smaller standard deviation (P < 0.01). Thirdly, the manual acupuncture effects of higher power and synchronized frequencies persisted for at least 10 minutes after the experiment (P < 0.05) and did not disappear immediately for all 18 experiments. Finally, we hypothesized that the higher power and synchronized rhythms in brain oscillations may have to do with autonomic nervous system.

In this review an attempt is made to take a snapshot of the cutting edge of a small. component of the very rapidly evolving field of neuroimaging. For each area covered, a brief context is provided along with a summary of a few of the current developments and issues. Then, several outstanding papers, published in the past year or so, are described, providing an example of the directions in which each area is progressing. The areas covered include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), optical imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET).

Four classes of imagery are recorded: left hand, right hand, the tongue and one foot, with 40 trials each. Knowing the locations of the electrodes and the brain regions where the activation related with this four motor imagery tasks occurs, we apply the time-frequency analysis for the corresponding EEG signals. For separating the source signals, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on JADE algorithm is applied. Then we represent the extracted components with the time-frequency analysis, using the spectrogram and the wavelet transform. Finally, we compare the results obtained for these methods with that obtained from the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP), with the EEGLAB application, to identify the Event Related Synchronization/Desynchronization (ERS/ERD) of the miu band when the imagination of movement starts.

The proposed approach requires no prior knowledge of reactive frequency bands, their temporal behavior or cortical locations. For a given electrode array, it finds all these parameters by constructing electrode adaptive time-frequency segmentations that are optimized for discrimination. This is accomplished first by segmenting the EEG along the time axis with Local Cosine Packets. Next the most discriminant frequency subbands are selected in each time segment with a frequency axis clustering algorithm to achieve time and frequency band adaptation individually. Finally the subject adapted features are sorted according to their discrimination power to reduce dimensionality and the top subset is used for final classification. We provide experimental results for 5 subjects of the BCI competition 2005 dataset IVa to show the superior performance of the proposed method.

These waves arise from the synchronization of slow oscillations in the membrane potentials of millions of neurons. Scalp-level studies have indicated that slow waves are not instantaneous events, but rather they travel across the brain. Previous studies of EEG slow waves were limited by the poor spatial resolution of EEGs and by the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to the activity of the underlying cortex. Here we use high-density EEG (hd-EEG) source modeling to show that individual spontaneous slow waves have distinct cortical origins, propagate uniquely across the cortex, and involve unique subsets of cortical structures. However, when the waves are examined en masse, we find that there are diffuse hot spots of slow wave origins centered on the lateral sulci. Furthermore, slow wave propagation along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain is largely mediated by a cingulate highway. As a group, slow waves are associated with large currents in the medial frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate, the precuneus, and the posterior cingulate. These areas overlap with the major connectional backbone of the cortex and with many parts of the default network.

Twenty adults looked at emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful) or neutral faces. EEG results showed that motivational significance of face can modulate frequency bands, specifically for theta and gamma. Moreover, gamma can be varied related to degree of arousing feature (high or low) of facial expression. As a function of time, ANOVA and regression analysis revealed that emotional discrimination by gamma and theta is observable mainly within 150-250 time interval and, as revealed also by coherence analysis, that it is more distributed on the anterior-right (theta) or right (gamma) side of the scalp for the emotional stimuli, whereas delta is maximally increased within 250-350 interval and it is more posteriorly (parietal site) distributed for all the stimulus type. We proposed that band modulations respond to variations in processing emotional face. and, whereas delta reflects updating of the stimulus, and theta responds to the emotional significance of face, gamma reflects differences in the arousing power of facial expression.

We selected 18 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent a 2-h simultaneous EEG-fMRI and had unilateral or bilateral independent TL spikes for interindividual group analysis, in order to identify consistent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to TL spikes. Methods: EEG was postprocessed and spikes were visually identified. fMRI data were preprocessed with motion correction, spatial smoothing, and removal of low frequency drifts. Spike timings were used as events for fMRI statistical analysis. Four hemodynamic response functions were used to account for variability in the BOLD response. Results: Group analysis revealed common areas of BOLD activations and deactivations. The hemodynamic response function (HRF) peaking 3 s after the spike showed activation involving ipsilaterally the mesial temporal structures (presumably the hippocampus), putamen/globus pallidus, inferior insula, and superior temporal gyrus. The HRF peaking at 5 s showed activations involving ipsi- and contralaterally the superior temporal gyrus and inferior insula. Both HRFs showed bilateral posterior cingulate deactivations. Discussion: We disclosed involvement of a network of activated areas during unilateral TL spikes, including ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, basal ganglia, and bilateral neocortical temporal regions. Despite the low temporal resolution of fMRI we demonstrated that contralateral temporal involvement occurred later than ipsilateral activation. This contralateral change took place in the absence of visible EEG changes. The posterior cingulate deactivation may reflect the interconnections between this region and other limbic structures. It may also partially correspond to a suspension of the default mode network, as previously described for TL spikes.

In this chapter, we focus on the use of implantable radiotelemetry in electroencephalography (EEG), especially on electrocorticographic (ECoG) and deep intracerebral EEG recordings, and its crucial role in neurological characterization of transgenic mouse models. This review covers (1) the general historical, financial and ethical aspects of EEG radiotelemetry and its pros and cons; (2) the planning of radiotelemetric experiments, preoperative preparation of mice and anesthesia; (3) different EEG radiotelemetric implantation procedures, examples of physiological and pathophysiological EEGs and strategies of maximizing signal-to-noise ratio; and (4) specific information on postoperative recovery and pain management. Finally, we demonstrate current state-of-the-art approaches in EEG data acquisition and analysis, among which the possible pitfalls and artifacts therein are discussed in detail.

When modern data analysis software is used, interictal spikes contain considerably more information than had previously been ascribed to them. To optimize the diagnostic value of the EEG, sleep recordings after sleep deprivation is valuable because focal spikes, unless abundant, are relatively rare in the waking state. Recording time should also be sufficiently long to allow spikes to emerge. Spikes are always pathologic and can be associated with impaired cerebral perfusion, metabolic changes and concomitant behavioral changes. They can also be separated into simple and complex forms which may allow prognostic statements. The simplest way to accomplish this is by placing a cursor on the peak of the spike and see whether or not other channels show latency differences. More precise methods are: comparisons of voltage maps with current source density maps, principal component analysis and distinctions between stationary versus moving dipoles. Averaging of spikes is valuable but care must be taken that only those spikes which have the same distribution are averaged, and when the average is obtained only from the spike peak, propagation may already have occurred. It has been recommended that the midpoint of the ascending negative phase be used as the point for averaging. In intracranial recordings the frequencies above the gamma range should also be assessed. Their small electrical field allows a differentiation between locally generated events from those which are volume conducted and can thereby more accurately reflect the epileptogenic zone(s). High frequency activity can also be recorded from foramen ovale electrodes which enhances their diagnostic utility. It is emphasized that for centers which perform pre-surgical evaluations the software supplied by instrument manufacturers is inadequate and needs to be supplemented by additional commercially available programs. Furthermore, archived data should be used for retrospective investigations and follow-up studies of patients who have undergone either excisions, resections, or multiple subpial transections to evaluate the success rates by taking into account all the properties of interictal and ictal recordings which are mentioned in this article.

Characteristic features of the EEG patterns during anaesthesia evoked by fluorinated inhalation anaesthetics	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			EEG patterns; volatile anaesthetics; Higuchi's fractal dimension; mean phase coherence; time-frequency distributions (spectrograms and scalograms for Morlet wavelets)		The presence of the EEG patterns showing some similarities with epileptiform activity as well as epileptic EEG discharges and motor seizures observed in some people during anaesthesia conducted with volatile anaesthetics indicate the necessity of better understanding the nature of these patterns. In this research EEG analysis was performed in the group of twelve adult patients without history of neurological diseases. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol. After laryngeal mask insertion the anaesthesia was maintained with mixture of air/oxygen with either isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. EEG patterns during anaesthesia were evaluated using different methods of signal analysis: Higuchi's fractal dimension, mean phase coherence, time-frequency distributions (spectrograms and scalograms) and time and frequency marginals extracted from scalograms. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate evolution of the EEG activity in the course of anaesthesia. The contribution of the alpha waves in the overall EEG pattern was gradually decreasing with increasing depth of anaesthesia with complete suppression during the deepest level of anaesthesia. The amount of alpha activity was increasing again when the patient was awakening. Diminishing of the alpha wave contribution to the overall EEG pattern corresponded to the fractal dimension decrease. Fractal dimension increased again in the burst-suppression region. Mean interhemispheric phase coherence for the anterior (frontal) as well as posterior (parieto-occipital) derivations rapidly decreased during burst-suppression activity. Correlation between spectral power, fractal dimension and mean phase coherence and the concentration of volatile anaesthetic was observed.

Influence of Ocular Filtering in EEG Data on the Assessment of Drug-Induced Effects on the Brain	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						electroencephalography; electrooculography; ocular filtering; blind source separation; regression analysis; LORETA; antipsychotics; pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ARTIFACTS; REDUCTION	Ocular artifacts in EEG signals affect the interpretation of clinical study results. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of automatic ocular filtering procedures in the conclusions drawn from a pharmaco-EEG trial. Regression analysis, gold standard, and blind source separation (BSS), Second Order Blind Identification algorithm, ocular filtering procedures were compared using time, frequency, topographic and tomographic brain mapping approaches and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships. Data consisted of EEGs obtained from 20 volunteers who received single oral doses of haloperidol 3 mg, risperidone 1 mg, olanzapine 5 mg and placebo in a randomized crossover double-blind design. Although the BSS-based technique preserved brain activity more than regression analysis in anterior leads, in general, topographic significance probability maps globally showed similar results with both methods for most spectral variables. However, different results were obtained when using whole multi-channel information for studying drug effects in the brain: (i) higher correlations between PK and PD time courses showing that BSS allowed estimation of spectral variables more accurately related to drug effects and (ii) larger and more symmetric drug related tomographic LORETA maps showing that BSS led to results that were more neurophysiopharmacologically sound. Definitely, the BSS-based procedure is an effective and efficient preprocessing method to remove ocular artifacts from EEG data. The selection of the ocular filtering procedure could determine different results whose impact depends on the evaluating tool applied to analyze the pharmaco-EEG data.

The advantages of the SOD based feature extraction approach lie in its capability to obtain slice matrix components across the space; time and frequency domains and the discriminative features across different classes without; any prior knowledge of the discriminative frequency bands. Furthermore, the combination of horizontal; lateral and frontal slice features makes our method more robust for the outlier problem.

Still unanswered questions include whether midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation also involves the medial temporal region, which plays a role in memory encoding. Taking advantage of rare and unique opportunities to monitor neuronal activities using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recording, we determined how intravenous administration of midazolam elicited spectral frequency changes in the human cerebral cortex, including the medial temporal region. We studied three children with focal epilepsy who underwent subdural electrode placement and extraoperative ECoG recording for subsequent resection of the seizure focus; an intravenous bolus of midazolam was given to abort an ongoing simple partial seizure or to provide sedation prior to induction of general anesthesia. 'Midazolam-induced ECoG frequency alteration' in sites distant from the seizure focus was sequentially animated on their individual three-dimensional MR images. The common ECoG changes induced by midazolam included gradual augmentation of sigma-oscillations (12-16 Hz) in the widespread non-epileptic regions, including the medial temporal region. The spatial and temporal alteration of ECoG spectral frequency pattern can be appreciated via animation movies. Midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation was observed in the medial temporal region in our relatively small cohort of human subjects. In-vivo animation of ECoG spectral measures provided a unique situation to study the effect of midazolam on neuronal processing in the deep brain regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the analysis of the EEG signal and extraction of features from it has been a challenging task due to the complexity and variability. It is diffcult to recognize different stages of the real-time sleeping EEG signal from single EEG signal automatically. In our study, the features were extracted from single sleeping EEG signal of rats using approximate entropy (ApEn) combined with bispectrum analysis. The results show that ApEn and the maximal amplitude of bispectrum can extract various features in different sleeping EEG stages. The bispectrum can detect the phase coupling among different stages in sleeping EEG signal. The ApEn with change of bispectrum's frequency and maximal amplitude of bispectrum can be effectively applied to automatically compartmentalize real-time sleeping EEG signal into different stages, which is significant to automatic EEG analyze and intelligent diagnose of brain diseases. The results also provide a new way of features extraction for other non-stationary signals in real time.

On the other hand, according to the theory postulated by Crick and Koch, the actual function of primary consciousness is based on the reciprocal interaction between attention and working memory in the automatic and serial mode. The purpose of this study was to investigate for electrophysiological correlates compatible with the cognitive nature of spontaneous blinking, by using the EEG recordings obtained in a group of seven healthy volunteers while they rested quietly though awake, with their eyes open, but not actively engaged in attention-demanding goal-directed behaviours. The global wavelet analysis - at total of 189 three-second EEG epochs time-locked to the blink - revealed an increase in the delta band signal corresponding to the blink. In particular, a reconstruction of the EEG signal by means of inverse-wavelet transform (IWT) showed a blink-related P300-like wave at mid-parietal site. We assumed this phenomenon to represent an electrophysiological sign of the automatic processing of contextual environmental information. This might play a role in maintaining perceptive awareness of the environment at a low level of processing, while the subject is not engaged in attention-demanding tasks but rather introspectively oriented mental activities or free association(s).

The purpose of the study was to test the utility of a multimodal EEG/ERP-MRI technique which combines electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a simultaneously high temporal and spatial resolution. The sample consisted of 32 healthy young adults of both sexes. Auditory stimuli were delivered according to the active and passive oddball paradigms in the MRI environment (MRI-e) and in the standard conditions of the electrophysiology laboratory environment (Lab-e). Tasks were presented in a fixed order. Participants were exposed to the recording environments in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were preprocessed for MRI-related artifacts. Source localization was made using a current density reconstruction technique. The ERP waveforms for the MRI-e were morphologically similar to those for the Lab-e. The effect of the recording environment, experimental paradigm and electrode location were analyzed using a 2 x 2 x 3 analysis of variance for repeated measures. The ERP components in the two environments showed parametric variations and characteristic topographical distributions. The calculated sources were in line with the related literature. The findings indicated effortful cognitive processing in MRI-e. The study provided preliminary data on the feasibility of the multimodal EEG/ERP-MRI technique. It also indicated lines of research that are to be pursued for a decisive testing of this technique and its implementation to clinical practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using combined psychoacoustic and electroencephalography experiments in humans, we found that the sensory-perceptual mechanisms that enable restoration suppress auditory cortical encoding of gaps in interrupted sounds. When physically interrupted tones are perceptually restored, stimulus-evoked synchronization of cortical oscillations at similar to 4 Hz is suppressed as if physically uninterrupted sounds were encoded. The restoration-specific suppression is induced most strongly in primary-like regions in the right auditory cortex during illusorily filled gaps and also shortly before and after these gaps. Our results reveal that spontaneous modulations in slow evoked auditory cortical oscillations that are involved in encoding acoustic boundaries may determine the perceived continuity of sounds in noise. Such fluctuations could facilitate stable hearing of fragmented sounds in natural environments.

The Lomb periodogram is first extended to a time-frequency analysis method by windowing the observation. Furthermore, the window bandwidth is selected adaptively by the intersection of confidence intervals (ICI) rule to improve the time-frequency resolution. By using an adaptive window for each sinusoid and at each time instant, the adaptive windowed Lomb periodogram (AWLP) can achieve better bias and variance tradeoff and optimize the time-frequency resolution. Experimental results show that the AWLP-based coherence can provide useful information indicating the direction of information flow and correlation between different cortical regions.	[Zhang, Z.

These artifacts share frequency overlap with the EEG, making frequency filtering inappropriate for their removal. Spatial decomposition methods, such as principal and independent components analysis, have been employed for the removal of the artifacts from the EEG. However, these methods have limitations that prevent their use in operational environments that require real-time analysis. We have introduced a directed components analysis (DCA) that employs a spatial template to direct the selection of target artifacts. This method is computationally efficient, allowing it to be employed in real-world applications. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of spatial undersampling of the scalp potential field on the ability of DCA to remove blink artifacts.

J	Ingber, L				Ingber, Lester			Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions Nonlinear Columnar Electroencephalography	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; short term memory; nonlinear; statistical; simulated annealing	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PATH-INTEGRAL EVOLUTION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SENSITIVE NEURONS; THETA; EEG; MAGNETORECEPTION; CAPACITY; PREDICT; NOISE	Columnar firings of neocortex, modeled by a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), are investigated for conditions of oscillatory processing at frequencies consistent with observed electroencephalography (EEG). A strong inference is drawn that physiological states of columnar activity receptive to selective attention support oscillatory processing in observed frequency ranges. Direct calculations of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations which are derived from functional variation of the SMNI probability distribution, giving most likely states of the system, are performed for three prototypical Cases, dominate excitatory columnar firings, dominate inhibitory columnar firings, and in-between balanced columnar firings, with and without a Centering mechanism (CM) (based on observed changes in stochastic background of presynaptic interactions) which pulls more stable states into the physical firings ranges. Only states with the CM exhibit robust support for these oscillatory states. These calculations are repeated for the visual neocortex, which has twice as many neurons/minicolumn as other neocortical regions. These calculations argue that robust columnar support for common EEG activity requires the same columnar presynaptic parameter necessary for ideal short-term memory (STM). It is demonstrated at this columnar scale, that both shifts in local columnar presynaptic background as well as local or global regional oscillatory interactions can effect or be affected by attractors that have detailed experimental support to be considered states of STM. Including the CM with other proposed mechanisms for columnar-glial interactions and for glial-presynaptic background interactions, a path for future investigations is outlined to test for quantum interactions, enhanced by magnetic fields from columnar EEG, that directly support cerebral STM and computation by controlling presynaptic noise. This interplay can provide mechanisms for information processing and computation in mammalian neocortex.				ingber@alumni.caltech.edu	Ingber, Lester/C-3211-2018	Ingber, Lester/0000-0003-1502-3910					77	4	4	0	1	ANKA PUBLISHER	BORNOVA	116-11 SOK NO.10 K 2 D 2, BORNOVA, IZMIR 35050, TURKEY	1303-5150			NEUROQUANTOLOGY	NeuroQuantology		2009	7	4					500	529						30	Neurosciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology	531YR					2022-08-02	WOS:000272710000002

The combination of surface Laplacian filtering, Time-Frequency Analysis (Wavelet Transform) and linear classifiers (K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)) are used to detect the discrete emotions (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral) of human through EEG signals. The database is generated with 20 subjects in the age group of 21 similar to 39 years using 64 channels with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. An audio-visual induction (video clips) based protocol has been designed for evoking the discrete emotions. The raw EEG signals are preprocessed through Surface Laplacian filtering method and decomposed into five different EEG frequency bands using Wavelet Transform (WT) and the statistical features from alpha frequency band is considered for classifying the emotions. In our work, there are four different wavelet functions ("db4", "db8", "sym8" and "coif5") are used to derive the linear and non linear features for classifying the emotions. The validation of statistical features is performed using 5 fold cross validation. In this work, KNN outperforms LDA by offering a maximum average classification rate of 78.04 % on 62 channels, 77.61% and 71.30% on 24 channels and 8 channels respectively. Finally we present the average classification accuracy and individual classification accuracy of two different classifiers for justifying the performance of our emotion recognition system.				m.murugappan@gmail.com; nagarajan@unimap.edu.my; s.vaacob@unimap.edu.my	Murugappan, M/E-2402-2014	Murugappan, M/0000-0002-5839-4589					13	10	10	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-2886-1				2009							70	75		10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224237			6	Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Industrial	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BOR32					2022-08-02	WOS:000277386000015

Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 458 Subjects ranging in age from 2 months to 1.6.67 years. Complex demodulation was used to compute instantaneous phase differences between pairs of electrodes and the 1st and 2nd derivatives were used to detect the sudden onset and offset times of a phase shift followed by an extended period of phase locking. Mean phase shift duration and phase locking intervals were computed for two symmetrical electrode arrays in the posterior-to-anterior locations and the anterior-to-posterior directions in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz). Results: Log-log spectral plots demonstrated 1/f(alpha) distributions (alpha approximate to 1) with longer slopes during periods of phase shifting than during periods of phase locking. The mean duration of phase locking (150-450 msec) and phase shift (45-67 msec) generally increased as a function of age. The mean duration of phase shift declined over age in the local frontal regions but increased in distant electrode pairs. Oscillations and growth spurts from mean age 0.4-16 years were consistently present. Conclusions: The development of increased phase stability in local systems is paralleled by lengthened periods of unstable phase in distant connections. Development of the number and/or density of synaptic connections is a likely order parameter to explain oscillations and growth spurts in self-organized criticality during human brain maturation.

Fully Parametric Sleep Staging Compatible with the Classical Criteria	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Sleep EEG; Stager; Hypnogram; Matching pursuit; Time-frequency	HIGH-RESOLUTION; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; EEG	We present an open system for sleep staging, based explicitly on the criteria used in visual EEG analysis. Slow waves, theta and alpha waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are parameterized in terms of time duration, amplitude, and frequency of each waveform by means of the matching pursuit algorithm. It allows the detection of these structures using mostly the criteria from visual EEG analysis. For example, within this framework for the first time we compute directly the relative duration of slow waves, which is a basic parameter in recognition of deep sleep stages. Performance of the system is evaluated on 20 polysomnographic recordings, scored by experienced encephalographers. Seven recordings were scored by more than one expert. Proposed system gives concordance with visual staging close to the inter-expert concordance. The algorithm is implemented in a user-friendly software system for display and analysis of polysomnographic recordings, freely available with complete source code from http://signalml.org/svarog.html.

We analyzed the development of functional networks by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings during a Gestalt perception task in 68 participants ranging in age from 6 to 21 years. Until early adolescence, developmental improvements in cognitive performance were accompanied by increases in neural synchrony. This developmental phase was followed by an unexpected decrease in neural synchrony that occurred during late adolescence and was associated with reduced performance. After this period of destabilization, we observed a reorganization of synchronization patterns that was accompanied by pronounced increases in gamma-band power and in theta and beta phase synchrony. These findings provide evidence for the relationship between neural synchrony and late brain development that has important implications for the understanding of adolescence as a critical period of brain maturation.

Detection of Event-Related Modulations of Oscillatory Brain Activity with Multivariate Statistical Analysis of MEG Data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; multivariate analysis of variance; time-frequency (wavelet); decomposition; cortical oscillations; inter-frequency coupling	RANDOM-FIELD THEORY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMANS; ALPHA; MODEL; POWER	We describe a method to detect brain activation in cortically constrained maps of current density computed from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data using multivariate statistical inference. We apply time-frequency (wavelet) analysis to individual epochs to produce dynamic images of brain signal power on the cerebral cortex in multiple time-frequency bands. We form vector observations by concatenating the power in each frequency band, and fit them into separate multivariate linear models for each time band and cortical location with experimental conditions as predictor variables. The resulting Roy's maximum root statistic maps are thresholded for significance using permutation tests and the maximum statistic approach. A source is considered significant if it exceeds a statistical threshold, which is chosen to control the familywise error rate , or the probability of at least one false positive, across the cortical surface. We compare and evaluate the multivariate approach with existing univariate approaches to time-frequency MEG signal analysis, both on simulated data and experimental data from an MEG visuomotor task study. Our results indicate that the multivariate Method is more powerful than the univariate approach in detecting experimental effects when correlations exist between power across frequency bands. We further describe protected F-tests and linear discriminant analysis to identify individual frequencies that contribute significantly to experimental effects. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1922-1934, 2009.

EEGs were acquired through an auditory attention experiments with the highest entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that corresponds to auditory attention was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEG. Then the inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found a significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is needed to generate the event related potential (ERP). Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles the attention data. These results show direct connections between EEGs and ERPs and thus it is concluded that the phase reset of EEGs plays a very crucial role in the ERP generation.

The driving simulator comprised an actual automobile mounted on a Stewart motion platform with six degrees of freedom, providing both visual and vestibular stimulations to induce motion-sickness in a manner that is close to that in daily life. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using a 32-channel EEG system. The acquired EEG signals were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency analysis to assess EEG correlates of motion sickness. Subject's degree of motion-sickness was simultaneously and continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing non-stop psychophysical references to the recorded EEG changes. Five Motion-sickness related brain processes with equivalent dipoles located in the left motor, the parietal, the right motor, the occipital and the occipital midline areas were consistently identified across all subjects. These components exhibited distinct spectral suppressions or augmentation in motion sickness. The results of this study could lead to a practical human-machine interface for noninvasive monitoring of motion sickness of drivers or passengers in real-world environments.

Recent models Suggest that alpha phase serves as a mechanism especially relevant for the timing of neural activity, whereas alpha amplitude is important for the inhibition of task-irrelevant brain areas. This study investigates directly the influence of top-down modulation on phase-locked and nonphase-locked alpha rhythms. We conducted an EEG experiment where subjects performed a working memory task. In the encoding phase of the task subjects had to learn presented Pictures of nonliving objects that could later be asked to be retrieved. We varied the top-down modulation by including cues indicating either to remember or to forget (not to remember) the next following item. Spectral analyses showed that nonremember cues elicited pronounced alpha amplitude increase compared to remember cues. Furthermore, phase-locking in low frequencies, especially in the alpha range (7-12 Hz), was stronger for remember as opposed to not-to-remember items. In conclusion, we propose that alpha amplitude reflects top-down modulated inhibition and that alpha phase is important for the exact timing of neural activity and can be related to binding processes.

We studied 148 patients suspected of suffering from OSA. Classical spectral parameters based on the relative power in specified frequency bands (A(f-band)) or peak amplitudes (PA) were used to characterize the frequency content of SaO(2) and EEG recordings. Additionally, the median frequency (MF) and the spectral entropy (SE) were applied to obtain further spectral information. We applied a forward stepwise logistic regression (LR) procedure with crossvalidation leave-one-out to obtain the optimum spectral feature set. Two features from the oximetric spectral analysis (PA and MFsat) and three features from the EEG spectral analysis (A(delta), A(alpha) and SEeeg) were automatically selected. 91.0% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity and 88.5% accuracy were obtained. These results suggest that MF and SE could provide additional information to classical frequency characteristics commonly used in OSA diagnosis. Additionally, nocturnal SaO(2) and EEG recordings during the whole night could provide complementary information to help in the detection of OSA syndrome.

The results obtained with the new parameters are compared with those achieved by other indexes proposed in the literature. The HLF ratio and ZC parameters yielded the best results with a 100% of correct identification of both shunt and no-shunt situations.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Normal volunteers; EEG; ERP	EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACTS; EOG CORRECTION; EEG; REMOVAL; TISSUES	Conventional eye correction methods subtract portions (propagation coefficients; Bs) of electrooculogram (EOG) voltages from the electroencephalogram (EEG). The frequency domain approach (FDA) uses different Bs for different frequencies whereas the time domain approach (TDA) uses the same Bs. To determine whether measured Bs are dependent on frequency and whether one should employ frequency-dependent methods, 20 min of EEG from eye movement (EM) and blink data (24 participants) were recorded, and Bs were calculated for eye movement ERPs of differing signal-to-noise ratios for frequency bands ranging from 0 to 40 Hz and compared. At high signal to noise, EM Bs for different frequency bands did not differ, for both vertical and horizontal EOG, at all scalp sites tested. There were small differences in blink Bs for different bands, but smaller than the margin of error of this analysis. This indicates that TDA may be more appropriate than FDA.

In parallel, there is a growing body of research on noninvasive direct stimulation of the human brain via repetitive (rhythmic) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and on those frequencies that have the strongest behavioural impact. There is, therefore, great potential in combining these two lines of research to foster knowledge on brain rhythms, in addition to potential therapeutic applications of rhythmic brain stimulation. Here, we review findings from this rapidly evolving field linking intrinsic brain oscillations to distinct sensory, motor and cognitive operations. The findings emphasize that brain rhythms are causally implicated in cognitive functions.

The focus of the study was visual reactivity of cortical resources in healthy subjects and in a stroke patient. The 64 channel EEG and T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were obtained from 32 healthy subjects and a middle cerebral artery stroke patient. Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was used to estimate EEG sources for both close eyes (CE) vs. open eyes (OE) conditions using individual MRI. The West was performed between source spectra of the two conditions. Thresholds for statistically significant t values were estimated by the local false discovery rate (Ifdr) method. The Z transform was used to quantify the differences in cortical reactivity between the patient and healthy subjects. Closed-open eyes alpha reactivity sources were found mainly in posterior regions (occipito-parietal zones), extended in some Cases to anterior and thalamic regions, Significant cortical reactivity sources were found in frequencies different from alpha (lower t-values). Significant changes at EEG reactivity sources were evident in the damaged brain hemisphere. Reactivity changes were also found in the "healthy" hemisphere when compared with the normal population. In conclusion, our study of brain sources of EEG alpha reactivity provides information that is not evident in the usual topographic analysis.	[Cuspineda, E.

Here we examined brain oscillations, measured with electroencephalography (EEG), during a semantic speech processing task that required both lexically mediated memory matching and selective attention. Participants listened to nouns spoken in male and female voices, and detected an animate target (p = 20%) in a train of inanimate standards or vice versa. For a control task, Subjects listened to the same words and detected a target male voice in standards of a female voice or vice versa. The standard trials of the semantic task showed enhanced upper beta (25-30 Hz) and gamma band (GBA, 30-60 Hz) activity compared to the voice task. Upper beta and GBA enhancement was accompanied by a suppression of alpha (8-12 Hz) and lower to mid beta (13-20 Hz) activity mainly localized to posterior electrodes. Enhancement of phase-locked theta activity peaking near 275 ms also occurred over the midline electrodes. Theta, upper beta, and gamma band enhancement may reflect lexically mediated template matching in auditory memory, whereas the alpha and beta suppression likely indicate increased attentional processes and memory demands.

Processes of memory consolidation typically occurring during this state of sleep were also enhanced. Here, we show that the same tSOS applied in the waking brain also induced an increase in endogenous EEG slow oscillations (0.4-1.2 Hz), although in a topographically restricted fashion. Applied during wakefulness tSOS, additionally, resulted in a marked and widespread increase in EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity. During wake, tSOS did not enhance consolidation of memories when applied after learning, but improved encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories when applied during learning. We conclude that the EEG frequency and related memory processes induced by tSOS critically depend on brain state. In response to tSOS during wakefulness the brain transposes stimulation by responding preferentially with theta oscillations and facilitated encoding.

Most existing studies have focused on using the EEG as the sole information source in automatic seizure detection. Some of these studies concluded that the information obtained from the EEG should be supplemented by other information obtained from other recorded physiological signals.

The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of visual perception in individuals with and without ASD by carrying out a detailed analysis of the dynamic brain processes elicited by perception of a simple visual stimulus. Methods: We investigated perception in 20 individuals with ASD and 20 control subjects with electroencephalography (EEG). Visual evoked potentials elicited by Gabor patches of varying spatial frequency and stimulus-induced changes in alpha- and gamma-frequency bands of independent components were compared in those with and without ASD. Results: By decomposing the EEG data into independent components, we identified several processes that contributed to the average event related potential recorded at the scalp. Differences between the ASD and control groups were found only in some of these processes. Specifically, in those components that were in or near the striate or extrastriate cortex, stimulus spatial frequency exerted a smaller effect on induced increases in alpha- and gamma-band power, and time to peak alpha-band power was reduced, in the participants with ASD. Induced alpha-band power of components that were in or near the cingulate gyrus was increased in the participants with ASD, and the components that were in or near the parietal cortex did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: Atypical processing is evident in individuals with ASD during perception of simple visual stimuli. The implications of these data for existing theories of atypical perception in ASD are discussed.

EEG phase reset due to auditory attention: an inverse time-scale approach	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG phase reset; auditory attention; inverse transform; time-scale; wavelet phase stability	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CONTRIBUTES; GENERATION; COMPONENTS; MECHANISMS	We propose a novel tool to evaluate the electroencephalograph (EEG) phase reset due to auditory attention by utilizing an inverse analysis of the instantaneous phase for the first time. EEGs were acquired through auditory attention experiments with a maximum entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that is associated with auditory attention (6-10 Hz, termed as theta-alpha border) was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEGs. The inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is necessary to generate the event-related potential (ERP). Power spectrum analysis shows a remarkable increase of evoked power but little change of total power after stabilizing the phase of EEGs. Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles attention data. These results show strong connections between EEGs and ERP, in particular, we suggest that the presentation of an auditory stimulus triggers the phase reset process at the theta-alpha border which leads to the emergence of the N100 wave. It is concluded that our study reinforces other studies on the importance of the EEG in ERP genesis.

Intracranial electroencephalography seizure onset patterns and surgical outcomes in nonlesional extratemporal epilepsy Clinical article	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						electroencephalography; epilepsy surgery; high-frequency oscillation	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; SUBDURAL EEG; ICTAL SPECT; SURGERY; MRI; BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; GENERATION	Object. Patients with normal MR imaging (nonlesional) findings and medically refractory extratemporal epilepsy make up a disproportionate number of nonexcellent outcomes after epilepsy surgery. In this paper, the authors investigated the usefulness of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in the identification Of surgical candidates. Methods. Between 1992 and 2002, 51 consecutive patients with normal MR imaging findings and extratemporal epilepsy underwent intracranial electrode monitoring. The implantation of intracranial electrodes was determined by seizure semiology, interictal and ictal scalp EEG, SPECT, and in some patients PET studies. The demographics of patients at the time of surgery, lobar localization of electrode implantation, duration Of follow-up, and Engel outcome score were abstracted from the Mayo Rochester Epilepsy Surgery Database. A blinded independent review of the iEEG records was conducted for this study. Results. Thirty-one (61%) of the 51 patients who underwent iEEG ultimately underwent resection for their epilepsy. For 28 (90.3%) of the 31 patients who had epilepsy surgery, adequate information regarding follow-up (> 1 year), seizure frequency, and iEEG recordings was available. Twenty-six (92.9%) of 28 patients had frontal lobe resections, and 2 had parietal lobe resections. The most common iEEG pattern at seizure onset in the Surgically treated group was a focal high-frequency discharge (in 15 [53.6%] of 28 patients). Ten (35.7%) of the 28 surgically treated patients were seizure free. Fourteen (50%) had Engel Class I outcomes, and overall, 17 (60.7%) had significant improvement (Engel Class I and IIAB with >= 80% seizure reduction). Focal high-frequency oscillation at seizure onset was associated with Engel Class I surgical outcome (12 [85.7%] of 14 patients, p = 0.02), and it was uncommon in the nonexcellent outcome group (3 [21.4%] of 14 patients). Conclusions. A focal high-frequency oscillation (> 20 Hz) at seizure onset on iEEG may identify patients with nonlesional extratemporal epilepsy who are likely to have an Engel Class I Outcome after epilepsy surgery. The prospect of excellent outcome in nonlesional extratemporal lobe epilepsy prior to intracranial monitoring is poor (14 [27.5%] of 51 patients). However, iEEG can further stratify patients and help identify those with a greater likelihood of Engel Class I outcome after surgery.

Typically, such classification has been performed using signals from a set of selected EEG sensors. Because EEG sensor signals are mixtures of effective signals and noise, which has low signal-to-noise ratio, motor imagery EEG signals can be difficult to classification. Energy entropy was used to preprocess motor imagery EEG data, and the Fisher class separability criterion was used to extract features. Finally, classification of four types motor imagery EEG was performed by a method based on the statistical theory. An average of 85% classification accuracy of the six type combination and the three subjects was achieved. The results showed that motor imagery EEG signals can be extracted using energy entropy and that these extracted features offered clear advantages for classification.

Estimating Brain Load from the EEG	THESCIENTIFICWORLDJOURNAL			English	Article						EEG; cognitive; workload; work load; brain; assessment of workload	MENTAL WORKLOAD; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; DUAL-TASK; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; DIFFICULTY; TRACKING; P300	Modern work requires cognitively demanding multitasking and the need for sustained vigilance, which may result in work-related stress and may increase the possibility of human error. Objective methods for estimating cognitive overload and mental fatigue of the brain on-line, during work performance, are needed. We present a two-channel electroencephalography (EEG)-based index, theta Fz/alpha Pz ratio, potentially implementable into a compact wearable device. The index reacts to both acute external and cumulative internal load. The index increased with the number of tasks to be performed concurrently (p = 0.004) and with increased time awake, both after normal sleep (p = 0.002) and sleep restriction (p = 0.004). Moreover, the increase of the index was more pronounced in the afternoon after sleep restriction (p = 0.006). As a measure of brain state and its dynamics, the index can be considered equivalent to the heartbeat, an indicator of the cardiovascular state, thus inspiring the name "brainbeat".

For example, they directly retrieve the answer from memory or calculate by means of procedural strategies. Despite growing insight into the hemodynamic and electrophysiological correlates of these strategies, the functional changes in the oscillatory brain dynamics during the use of these strategies remain unknown. In the present high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) study, we analysed event-related synchronisation (ERS) and desynchronisation (ERD) in the theta and alpha bands while participants solved addition and subtraction problems, which displayed a high probability of retrieval or procedural strategy use. Findings revealed that arithmetic fact retrieval is reflected in left-hemispheric ERS in the theta band, whereas the application of procedural strategies is accompanied by bilateral parietooccipital ERD in the alpha band. The topographical and frequency specificity of the strategy effects provides a start for the development of electrophysiological indices of strategy use in arithmetic.

N-METHYL-D-ASPARTIC ACID RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST-INDUCED FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS IN MICE RECREATE PATTERN OF ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DEFICITS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						animal model; electroencephalography; NMDA; frequency oscillations	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; IN-VITRO; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; RAT; DOPAMINE; NETWORKS; KETAMINE	Introduction: Electrophysiological responses to auditory stimuli have provided a useful means of elucidating mechanisms and evaluating treatments in psychiatric disorders. Deficits in gating during paired-click tasks and lack of mismatch negativity following deviant stimuli have been well characterized in patients with schizophrenia. Recently, analyses of basal, induced, and evoked frequency oscillations have gained support as additional measures of cognitive processing in patients and animal models. The purpose of this study is to examine frequency oscillations in mice across the theta (4-7.5 Hz) and gamma (31-61 Hz) bands in the context of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction and dopaminergic hyperactivity, both of which are thought to serve as pharmacological models of schizophrenia. Experimental procedures: Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from mice in five treatment groups that consisted of haloperidol, risperidone, amphetamine, ketamine, or ketamine plus haloperidol during an auditory task. Basal, induced and evoked powers in both frequencies were calculated. Results: Ketamine increased basal power in the gamma band and decreased the evoked power in the theta band. The increase in basal gamma was not blocked by treatment with a conventional antipsychotic. No other treatment group was able to fully reproduce this pattern in the mice. Conclusions: Ketamine-induced alterations in EEG power spectra are consistent with abnormalities in the theta and gamma frequency ranges reported in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings support the hypothesis that NMDAR hypofunction contributes to the deficits in schizophrenia and that the dopaminergic pathways alone may not account for these changes. (c) 2009 IBRO.

ESTIMATION OF EEG SIGNAL DISPERSION DURING SEIZURE PROPAGATION	2009 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing	JUL 05-07, 2009	Santorini, GREECE			Encephalogram; Signal Dispersion; Time-Frequency Analysis; Seizures	WAVE; DECOMPOSITION; SPECTRUM	Localization of the seizure focus in the brain is a challenging problem in the field of epilepsy. The complexity of the seizure-related EEG waveform, its non-stationarity and degradation with distance due to the dispersive nature of the brain as a propagation medium, make localization difficult. Yet, precise estimation of the focus is critical, particularly when surgical resection is the only therapeutic option. The first step to solving this inverse problem is to estimate and account for frequency- or mode-specific signal dispersion, which is present in both scalp and intracranial EEG recordings during seizures. We estimated dispersion curves in both types of signals using a spatial correlation method and mode-based semblance analysis. We showed that, despite the assumption of spatial stationarity and a simplified array geometry, there is measurable inter-modal and intra-modal dispersion during seizures in both types of EEG recordings, affecting the estimated arrival times and consequently focus localization.

First published May 13, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.90954.2008. We recorded the electrocorticogram directly from the exposed cortical surface of awake neurosurgical patients during the presentation of auditory syllable stimuli. All patients were unanesthetized as part of a language-mapping procedure for subsequent left-hemisphere tumor resection. Time-frequency analyses showed significant high-gamma (gamma(high): 70-160 Hz) responses from the left superior temporal gyrus, but no reliable response from the left inferior frontal gyrus. Alpha suppression (alpha: 7-14 Hz) and event-related potential responses exhibited a more widespread topography. Across electrodes, the alpha suppression from 200 to 450 ms correlated with the preceding (50-200 ms) gamma(high) increase. The results are discussed in terms of the different physiological origins of these electrocortical signals.

From literature we hypothesized delta (0.5-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power to be augmented and alpha (8-12 Hz) power to be decreased with increased negative symptoms in NNFE. Materials and methods: The sample consisted of 27 NNFE. Psychopathology was rated with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). EEG was recorded from 21 electrodes according to the 10/20 system. Spectral analysis was performed on mean power of 8 electrodes in seven frequency bands after artefact removal. Linear regressions were calculated with log transformed power as dependent and psychopathology as independent variable. We controlled for medication, drugs, age, sex, education and day time of EEG recording. Results: A positive correlation of SANS global score with power in delta and theta frequency bands could be confirmed in NNFE. In the alphal (8-10 Hz) band we found no significant correlation with negative symptoms and in the alpha2 (10-12 Hz) band there was a positive correlation with SANS (p = 0.069). Beta1 (12-15 Hz) power also correlated positively with SANS. Discussion: The present results confirm the correlation of negative symptoms with power of slow frequency bands. In addition to previous studies in chronic schizophrenia patients, the effect was shown in NNFE, which is compatible with augmented slow wave power being a marker for negative symptoms in psychosis.

This is the first known research study that incorporated full-scale analysis of sleep auditory evoked potentials (AEP) under the scope of BIS. Material and Methods: The measurements were conducted in twelve subjects (18-32 ages, mean: 24.5 +/- 4.1; 2 female). Recordings were done by using NuAmps 40 channel system [electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and chin electromyography (EMG)], auditory stimulation unit, video and BIS monitor. Sleep data was acquired while (1500 Hz, 80 dB and 500 ms) auditory stimulations were applied into the ear channels (etymotic). The continuous EEG data were grouped according to the BIS index. In this sub-group of recordings, AEPs were analyzed. The evolution of N1, P2, N300, P450, N550 and P900 waveforms recorded from Cz electrode were investigated with regard to correlation of BIS and sleep stages. Results: The reduction of BIS values were followed by the decrease of NI component, whereas N300 and P900 components were found to be increased (Wilcoxon, p<0.05). AEPs dynamically evolved according to the changes in BIS values. The present findings support and advance the outcome of classical designs, which are based solely on the system Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) system. Conclusion: The present study investigated sleep states in extended number of levels with the BIS system, which provided higher time resolution. Based on the results, BIS may be suggested as a useful tool for sleep dynamic research studies also in pathological states.

But even when reinforced with better, faster tools, clinically reliable unsupervised spike detection remains beyond our reach. Expert-selected spike parameters were the first and still most widely used for AESD. Thresholds for amplitude, duration, sharpness, rise-time, fall-time, after-coming slow waves, background frequency, and more have been used. It is still unclear which of these wave parameters are essential, beyond peak-peak amplitude and duration. Wavelet parameters are very appropriate to AESD but need to be combined with other parameters to achieve desired levels of spike detection efficiency. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and expert-system methods may have reached peak efficiency. Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology focuses on outliers rather than centroids of spike and nonspike data clusters and should improve AESD efficiency. An exemplary spike/nonspike database is suggested as a tool for assessing parameters and methods for AESD and is available in CSV or Matlab formats from the author at brainvue@gmail.com. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is presented as a graphic method for finding better spike parameters and for the step-wise evaluation of the spike detection process.

Recently, it has been shown in anaesthetized rats that STN-DBS antidromically activates cortical neurons with coincident reduction of the cortical slow wave oscillations that occur in this preparation. Here we extend this work; recording the effect of STN-DBS upon cortical EEG and akinesia, in unanesthetized rats rendered cataleptic by acute dopaminergic blockade. STN-DBS-like stimulation resulted in a short latency, presumed antidromic, evoked potential in the cortex. In cataleptic animals, there was a significant increase in the power of beta oscillations in the electroencephalography which was reversed by stimulation that evoked the cortical response. We also observed a significant rescue of motor function, with the level of akinesia (bar test score) being inversely correlated to the amplitude of the evoked potential (R-2 = 0.84). These data confirm that (probably antidromic) short latency cortical responses occur in the awake animal and that these are associated with reductions in abnormal cortical oscillations characteristic of PD and with improvements in akinesia. Our results raise the possibility that STN-DBS reduces PD oscillations and symptoms through antidromic cortical activation.

Since nonlinear mechanisms are thought to be involved in the generation of EEG, we hypothesized that a mathematical approach based on nonlinear methods would provide relevant information on the association between EEG and ventilatory oscillations. We studied five patients who developed a sustained non-obstructive PB pattern during a 20 min laboratory, recording. The time course of the fractal dimension of the EEG signal (HFD) was estimated dividing this signal into 2 s segments, with a 1.5 s overlap and computing for each EEG segment the fractal dimension using the Higuchi's algorithm. From the lung volume signal, an instantaneous minute ventilation (IMV) signal was also computed. The relationship between IMV and HFD was assessed by bivariate spectral analysis, computing the magnitude square coherence function (MSC). In four patients the value of the MSC was very high, ranging from 0.75 to 0.91, while in one patient the value was only 0.29. Our results suggest that in patients with PB, rhythmic changes in the EEG signal are very common and, when present, they are associated with ventilatory oscillations. We have also demonstrated that such oscillations can be detected very effectively by a technique based on nonlinear methods.				giandomenico.pinna@fsm.it	pinna, gian domenico/ABI-7618-2020; La Rovere, Maria Teresa/D-6796-2019; Robbi, Elena/E-6252-2019; Maestri, Roberto/J-8168-2016; Maestri, Roberto/AAA-7585-2019	pinna, gian domenico/0000-0001-7667-6662; La Rovere, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-1884-5058; Robbi, Elena/0000-0002-0892-289X; Maestri, Roberto/0000-0002-2873-0430; Maestri, Roberto/0000-0002-2873-0430					18	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X		978-1-4244-3295-0	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2009							6276	6279		10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332385			4	Engineering, Biomedical	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BQB05	19963671				2022-08-02	WOS:000280543605023

Our aims are to analyze interictal fast oscillations and EEG patterns in neonates and infants with hemimegalencephaly. Methods: We collected scalp EEGs and applied multiple band frequency analysis (MBFA) to analyze frequency and power of interictal fast oscillations (FOs). Results: We studied 18 scalp EEGs in 7 patients with catastrophic epilepsy secondary to hemimegalencephaly, between 3 days and 24 months of age. Maximum frequency of FOs (22-57 Hz; mean, 42 Hz) on the hemimegalencephalic side was significantly higher than those (8-27 Hz; mean, 18 Hz) in the unaffected side (p < 0.05). Differences in maximum FOs remained within 1-8 Hz (mean, 3 Hz) across consecutive EEGs. We found four EEG patterns: (1) suppression burst pattern (7 EEGs, 6 patients), (2) continuous triphasic complex pattern (5 EEGs, 3 patients), (3) continuous high amplitude slow waves with spikes (3 EEGs, 2 patients) and (4) frequent spike and slow waves (3 EEGs, 2 patients). Five patients with multiple EEG recordings showed changing EEG patterns. Conclusion: We confirmed the interictal epileptogenic FOs in neonatal EEGs of patients with hemimegalencephaly. The frequency of epileptogenic FOs remains stable from the neonates through increasing age while the patterns of EEG changed during brain maturation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We employed Time Encoded Signal Processing And Recognition (TESPAR), a time-domain signal processing technique, in combination with multi-layer perceptrons to identify DOA levels. The presented system learns to discriminate between five DOA classes assessed by human experts whose judgements were based on EEG mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEPs) and clinical observations. We found that our system closely mimicked the behavior of the human expert, thus proving the utility of the method. Further analyses on the features extracted by our technique indicated that information related to DOA is mostly distributed across frequency bands and that the presence of high frequencies (>80 Hz), which reflect mostly muscle activity, is beneficial for DOA detection.

The established sensitivity of EEG to drug intoxication and in particular to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) made that EEG has become useful as an objective measure for monitoring chronic AED therapy and in investigation of cognitive functions. Therapy with classical AEDs has become associated with slowing of EEG background rhythm and the EEG changes correlated to changes on cognitive measures. So far, it has not been tested whether the relatively new AED, levetiracetam (LEV) has a detrimental effect on the EEG background frequencies, too. Methods: During the time of 6 months 28 patients underwent EEG-recording and neuropsychological testing at the three timepoints: before initiating LEV therapy, after 2 months and again after 4 months after achieving plateau dosing of LEV. EEG background frequency was analysed by using the fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Results: The titration and the following treatment with LEV add-on showed no negative effect on any of the measures analysed. In particular it did not lead to the lower peak frequency within the alpha band, it neither decreased the percentage of alpha band nor increase the percentage of theta and delta band. In addition there could be noticed an increase of the percentage of beta band. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate, that a LEV add-on therapy is not associated with a slowing of the EEG background frequency. This is in accordance with neuropsychological reports of our own lab and others showing that LEV add-on therapy has no negative effects on cognitive functions, either.

However, it is still under debate whether the race affects emotion processing or not. The studies based on Event-related potentials indicated many interesting results, but conflicting conclusions to some degree. This paper presents a study on how race influences emotion cognition during a cognitive task through a time-frequency analysis of event-related electroencephalograph. In our study, a recognition task with racial facial stimuli was utilized to address the influence of race-effect and emotion on working memory. Three expressions of each face (happy-positive, sad-negative and neutral) from different races were chosen for the experiments. Since depression is characterized as a typical mental disease with emotion processing deficits, fifteen patients with depression and eighteen normal controls were chosen to participate in the experiment. The repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) of Gamma EEG revealed that a significant interaction between race and emotion in the time-window 200-300ms at the low gamma band (30-60Hz). Subsequent analysis showed that, with other race stimuli, the average iGBA of low gamma band revealed different emotion effects, i.e. positive> negative > neutral. In addition, two trend effects were found, the emotion effect (positive>neutral>negative) for depression patients in the window of 500ms-600ms at high iGBA(65-90Hz), and the interaction between group and race in the 200ms-300ms window. To depressed participants, average high iGBA between 200ms-300ms for other-race faces was larger than that for own race faces, while which didn't happened to the normal controls. In summary we suppose that race-effect did affect the iGBA of the depressed participants while they performing emotion tasks, especially the negative ones.

Processes common to both conditions, such as attention, activation of working memory, letter identification, and discrimination processes were characterized by increased power and synchrony in the following frequency ranges: delta band (inhibition of the non-relevant stimuli), theta band (activation of working memory), and low alpha band in occipital regions immediately after the stimulus (withhold or control of the execution of a response), and decreased power in the high alpha band from 300 to 700 ms. However, the most important findings were those specific for each condition. Changes in power in frontal areas were observed immediately after the stimulus in delta and high alpha bands for the Go condition and in the theta band for the No-Go condition. Increased synchrony and power at 1 Hz from 350500 ms and increased power at 1, 5 and 6 Hz after 300 ms in the No-Go condition may be related to inhibition. Other important difference between conditions was observed in the synchronization increases of the gamma band between 33 and 36 Hz in the Go condition, whereas synchrony decreased at these frequencies in the No-Go condition; these differences may be due to the preparation and execution of the motor response during the Go condition and its inhibition in the No-Go condition.

The nocturnal sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) time-frequency analysis (TFA) plot (hypnospectrogram for short) is hereby proposed as a means to visualize both the macroscopic and the microscopic architecture of human sleep. It provides the ability to concurrently visually inspect the coarse sleep architecture, that is, the time-course of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM stages, along with finer sleep elements such as slow and fast spindles, NREM delta distribution, REM alpha and beta, microarousals (MAs), and NREM cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs). Furthermore, the hypnospectrogram has the potential to provide visual quality of sleep (QoS) evaluation, as well as reveal the dominant rhythms and their transitions for every cerebral locus - as represented at the electrode space - during the night.

These HFOs are more frequent in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) and reported to be linked to seizure genesis. We evaluated whether HFO activity changes in a systematic way during the preictal period. Methods: Fifteen minutes of preictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were evaluated in seven consecutive patients with well-defined SOZ. EEG was filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were visually marked, and spectral analysis was performed in seizure-onset as well as nonseizure-onset channels. Linear regressions fitted to the power trends corresponding to intervals of 1, 5, and 15 min before the seizure onset was calculated. Results: Total rates of HFOs were significantly higher in the SOZ than outside. Preictal increases and decreases in HFO rates and band power could be detected in all patients, and they were not limited to the SOZs. These measures were very variable, and no systematic trends were observed when comparing patients or seizures in the same patient. Discussion: High frequencies in the range of 80-500 Hz are present during the preictal period and are more prominent in the SOZ. They do not change in a systematic way before seizure onset for the horizons we tested. The 80-500 Hz band may be used for the localization of seizure-onset areas but may be more difficult to use for seizure prediction purposes.

We look at the individual's online EEG recording while performing a time-production task, placing one focus of interest on the individual's peak alpha frequency (PAF), and a second on alpha power and its topography. The participants completed a time-production task with online EEG recording, twice during a single session in the lab, in a pre-post design. We present data concerned with the topography of post-pre differences in alpha power, both during time production and during rest, as a function of an intervening period of either restful wakefulness or motor activity. Our major finding is that left PAF and right PAF mutually suppress each other in predicting produced duration, and that given the size and sign of their regression weights, it is a left-right asymmetry in PAF that plays a pivotal role here. On computing a left-right asymmetry index for PAF, we found that this index had a significant correlation with the mean log-transformed produced duration (r = .364, p < .01), and that the relationship is stronger among females (r = .500, p < .005).

The amplitude of mu rhythm varies when the subject is not moving or not imagining and attenuates when the subject is moving or imagines movement. The classification of events is generally performed in frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute band power. This papers aims to develop an alternative time-domain analysis by estimation of bandlimited signals through adaptive filtering. The design methodology estimates bandlimited signals through multiple fourier series there by estimating the individual components of frequency weights through LMS algorithm. The knowledge of individual frequency components in time-domain provides useful insight into the classification process of EEG. Instead of using the band-power, this paper analyzes the usage of frequency weights to determine the optimum band for a subject. Study is conducted on 3 subjects for optimum band selection and classification.	[Veluvolu, Kalyana C.; Tan, H. G.; Kavuri, S. S.; Latt, W. T.; Shee, C. Y.; Ang, W.

Global theta oscillatory activity includes a posterior phase-locked component related to stimulus processing and a frontal-induced component modulated by directed attention. To investigate the presence of early deficits in the directed attention-related network in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), time-frequency analysis at baseline was used to assess global and induced theta oscillatory activity (4-6 Hz) during n-back working memory tasks in 29 individuals with MCI and 24 elderly controls (EC). At 1-year follow-up, 13 MCI patients were still stable and 16 had progressed. Baseline task performance was similar in stable and progressive MCI cases. Induced theta activity at baseline was significantly reduced in progressive MCI as compared to EC and stable MCI in all n-back tasks, which were similar in terms of directed attention requirements. While performance is maintained, the decrease of induced theta activity suggests early deficits in the directed-attention network in progressive MCI, whereas this network is functionally preserved in stable MCI.

The present study emphasizes the relevance of prolongation of alpha responses in auditory oddball paradigm. Two types of stimuli were applied to twenty subjects. As standard stimuli 80 dB-1500 Hz tones and the target stimuli 80 dB-1600 Hz tones were used. The prolongations of alpha responses were measured in 13 recording sites in the frequency range of 8-13 Hz. At the Cz recording site, the time period for reaching one third (duration of prolongation) of its peak-to-peak amplitude (1/3 latency) of alpha response to target was 446 ms. The prolongation of nontarget stimuli was 277 ms. Thus, the alpha response to target was significantly more prolonged than the alpha response to nontarget stimuli. Similarly, at C3, the alpha response to target stimuli was prolonged to 373 ms. The alpha response to nontarget stimuli was prolonged to 284 ms. The target alpha response was more prolonged in comparison to the non-target alpha results. The alpha response to target stimuli (431 ms) was also more prolonged in comparison with the alpha response upon non-target stimuli (266 ms) at the C4 recording site. The results indicate that the alpha responses are prolonged under a certain level of cognitive load and working memory. Alpha prolongation is a significant component of P300 responses. It can be Suggested that the cognitive load dependency of alpha responses upon the targets could be related to working memory. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study examined electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and performance during a 96-hour laboratory protocol where participants slept a baseline night (8 h), were randomly assigned to 3-, 5-, or 8-hour sleep groups for the next two nights sleep restriction (SR1, SR2), and then slept a recovery night (8 h). There were dose-dependent deficits on measures of mood, sleepiness, and reaction time that were apparent during this short-term bout of sleep restriction. The ratio of alpha to theta EEG recorded at rest indicated dose-dependent changes in CNS arousal. At 9:00 hours, both the 3- and 5-hour groups showed EEG slowing (sleepiness) during restriction, with the 3-hour group exhibiting greater deficits. Later in the day at 13:00 hours, the 5-hour group no longer exhibited EEG slowing, but the extent of slowing was more widespread across the scalp for the 3-hour group. High-frequency EEG, a measure of effort, was greater on the mornings following sleep restriction. The 5-hour group had increased beta EEG at central-parietal sites following both nights of restriction, whereas the 3-hour group had increased beta and gamma EEG at occipital regions following the first night only. Short-term sleep restriction leads to deficits in performance as well as EEG slowing that correspond to the amount and duration of sleep loss. High-frequency EEG may be a marker of effort or compensation.

Epileptic sharp-slow complex wave is one of typical presence of epileptiform activities, which has different time-frequency property compared with spike and spike-slow complex wave. A new scheme is presented for detecting epileptic sharp-slow wave in 8-channel EEG data from normal subjects and epileptic patients. The scheme is based on the characteristic of a multi-resolution and approximate entropy (ApEn) analysis of EEG signals. The EEG signals on each channel are decomposed into three levels using multi-resolution wavelet analysis, and then ApEn values of the detail coefficients are computed. Distinct differences are found between the ApEn values of the epileptic sharp-slow and the normal EEG. The EEG signals are detected by Neyman-Pearson (NP) criteria. The optimal detection rule of detecting sharp-slow is achieved, and it assures a higher detection rate with a lower false detection rate.

In this method, a linear time-scale quantifier of the multivariate relationship between simultaneously observed time series takes advantage of unique properties of complex wavelets such as shift invariance, substantially reduced aliasing and non-oscillating magnitude. The quantifier provides correlation between amplitude of complex wavelet coefficients for different frequencies (controlled by the scale factor) at different times (controlled by the time shift). Biological interpretation of this measure is derived from a priori information about presence of inhibitory back-loop connections between cortical neurones in short distance while the long range excitatory connections do not appear to target or effectively excite inhibitory interneurons and analysis of sample pairs of EEG signals.

Using high-density electroencephalography in 5- to 11-month-old infants and a looming stimulus approaching under three different accelerations, we investigated how the young human nervous system extracts and processes information for impending collision. Here, we show that infants' looming related brain activity is characterised by theta oscillations. Source analyses reveal clear localised activity in the visual cortex. Analysing the temporal dynamics of the source waveform, we provide evidence that the temporal structure of different looming stimuli is sustained during processing in the more mature infant brain, providing infants with increasingly veridical time-to-collision information about looming danger as they grow older and become more mobile.

Error-Related Oscillations Effects of Aging on Neural Systems for Behavioral Monitoring	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						response-related potentials; error negativity; time-frequency analysis; aging; EEG	POTENTIALS; CORTEX; TASK	The present study assesses the origins of reduction of error negativity (Ne) with advancing age in humans. Response-related potentials were recorded from young (mean age 22.5 years, n = 10) and older (mean age 58.3 years, n = 11) adults while they performed a four-choice reaction task (4CRT) in two modalities, auditory and visual. Trials from correct and error responses were analyzed separately for each modality. To achieve a reference-free evaluation, the current source density (CSD) of the signals was computed. RRPs were analyzed in the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of wavelet decomposition. Two TF components of RRPs from the delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency ranges were assessed. The measured parameters were total power reflecting both the phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity, and phase-locking factor (PLF) reflecting the strength of phase-synchronization with stimulus, independent of magnitude. It was found that the total power of both the delta and theta TF components increased after errors in the two age groups, although this increase was more pronounced in young than older adults. Response-locked synchronization of delta responses also increased after errors, with this synchronizing ability being preserved in older subjects. What differentiated the error processing in the two age groups was the synchronization of theta oscillations with error responses, with this parameter being substantially reduced in older subjects. The results demonstrate that Ne reduction with aging is the result of an overall decrease in the power of delta and theta components, primarily of a decrease in the response-locked synchronization of theta oscillations after errors.

Currently there are no biomarkers to detect the at risk brain. Recent research, however, suggests that the appearance of epileptiform transients in the first 6-8 hours after hypoxia (the latent phase of injury) are predictive of neural outcome. To quantify this further a key need is to automate EEG signal analysis to aid clinical staff with the vast amounts of complex data to review. In this study, we present a semi-automated method for spike detection in the fetal sheep EEG. The method utilizes the short time Fourier transform and peak separation to extract spikes. The performance of the method was found to be high in sensitivity and selectivity over 3 distinct time points.

Yet this band contains subtle but valuable physiological signatures such as fast gamma oscillations or evoked high-frequency (600 Hz) bursts related to spiking of thalamocortical and cortical neurons. Here we introduce a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach that integrates hard and software modifications for continuous acquisition of ultrafast EEG oscillations during fMRI. Our approach is based upon and extends the established method of averaged artifact subtraction (AAS). Particularly for recovery of ultrahigh-frequency EEG signatures, AAS requires invariantly sampled and constant imaging-artifact waveforms to achieve optimal imaging-artifact correction. Consequently, we adjusted our acquisition setup such that both physiological ultrahigh-frequency EEG and invariantly sampled imaging artifacts were captured. In addition, we extended the AAS algorithm to cope with other, non-sampling related sources of imaging-artifact variations such as subject movements. A cascaded principal component analysis finally removed remaining imaging-artifact residuals. We provide a detailed evaluation of averaged ultrahigh-frequency signals and unaveraged broadband EEG spectra up to 1 kHz. Evoked nanovolt-sized high-frequency bursts were successfully recovered during periods of MR data acquisition afflicted by imaging artifacts in the millivolt range. Compared to periods without imaging artifacts they exhibited the same mean amplitudes, latencies and waveforms and a signal-to-noise ratio of 72%. Furthermore we identified consistent dipole sources. In conclusion, ultrafast EEG oscillations can be continuously monitored during fMRI using the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bi-phase locking - a tool for probing non-linear interaction in the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cross frequency; Phase coupling; Synchronization; ECoG	EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	We present a novel method for detecting frequency-frequency coupling between the electrical output of cortical areas as measured by electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography ( EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the biphase-locking value (bPLV). Our method is an extension of the well known phase-locking value (PLV) and is specifically sensitive to non-linear interactions, i.e. quadratic phase coupling across frequencies. Due to its sensitivity to non-linear interactions, it is robust to spurious synchronization arising from linear crosstalk, which is an especially useful property when analyzing data recorded by EEG/MEG. We discuss the statistical properties of the bPLV, specifically the distribution of the bPLV under assumption of random phases between the signals of interest. We also compare the bPLV to the PLV for cortical interactions that are computed for simulated EEG/MEG data. These data were mapped to the cortex using an inverse solution. We demonstrate our method for event related ECoG data recorded from the motor cortex of an epileptic patient, who performed a cued finger movement task. We find highly significant, movement related increase of the bPLV between the alpha (12 Hz) and high gamma (77 Hz) band in a pre-motor area, coupling to high gamma at 89 Hz in the motor cortex.

Synchronization Between Sources: Emerging Methods for Understanding Large-Scale Functional Networks in the Human Brain	COORDINATED ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN: MEASUREMENTS AND RELEVANCE TO BRAIN FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR	Springer Series in Computational Neuroscience		English	Article; Book Chapter							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BAND PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG ACTIVITY; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE	This chapter summarizes currently available techniques for measuring synchronization between neural sources identified through EEG and MEG recordings. First the evidence for the involvement of neural synchronization in the implementation of cognitive processes is described. This involvement is mainly through the provision of high-quality communication between active brain regions, allowing integration of processing activities through the exchange of information and control signals. Second, we describe several useful techniques for obtaining phase information from time series of EEG and MEG records, and measuring phase locking or phase coherence using these methods. These include wavelet analysis and the analytic signal using the Hilbert transform for obtaining phase information, and phase-locking value and coherence for obtaining useful indices of synchronization. Finally, we summarize several available techniques for locating neural sources of EEG and MEG records and describe the use of the phase-locking measurements in ascertaining synchronization between sources located with these techniques. The techniques include those involving blind separation of sources, such as independent component analysis or principle component analysis, and those involving use of brain anatomy to constrain source locations, such as beamformer or LORETA. We also provide a few examples of published or forthcoming research that has used these approaches. All of the techniques described are available either in commercial software ( such as BESA and MATLAB) or in freeware that runs in MATLAB ( such as EEGLAB, Fieldtrip, Brainstorm). Some custom programming might be required ( e. g., in MATLAB using the Signal Processing Toolbox) to implement some of the measurements.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the spectral, spatial and coherent features of high-frequency brain oscillations in the developing brain. Sixty healthy children and 20 healthy adults were studied using a 275-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. MEG data were digitized at 12,000 Hz. The frequency characteristics of neuromagnetic signals in 0.5-2000 Hz were quantitatively deter-mined with Morlet wavelet transform. The magnetic sources were volumetrically estimated with wavelet-based beamformer at 2.5 mm resolution. The neural networks of endogenous brain oscillations were analyzed with coherent imaging. Neuromagnetic activities in 8-12 Hz and 800-900 Hz were found to be the most reliable frequency bands in healthy children. The neuromagnetic signals were localized in the occipital, temporal and frontal cortices. The activities in the occipital and temporal cortices were strongly correlated in 8-12 Hz but not in 800-900 Hz. In comparison to adults, children had brain oscillations in intermingled frequency bands. Developmental changes in children were identified for both low- and high-frequency brain activities. The results of the present study suggest that the development of the brain is associated with spatial and coherent changes of endogenous brain activities in both low- and high-frequency ranges. Analysis of high-frequency neuromagnetic oscillation may provide novel insights into cerebral mechanisms of brain function. The noninvasive measurement of neuromagnetic brain oscillations in the developing brain may open a new window for analysis of brain function. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sleep activity record is very long (a few hours). The evaluation of the sleep activity is time-consuming. The evaluation is provided by a doctor. In order to save time various automatic evaluations methods are developed. The one of methods includes dividing the signal into 30 seconds long sections. These sections are analyzed. The 30 seconds length sections are with adaptive segmentation reduced. From these segments mean amplitude, mean frequency, 1st and 2nd derivation are computed. The processing and the evaluation of the segments properties leads to definition of sleep status.

Signal processing as an integrative concept within the scope of medical informatics is demonstrated, Methods: For all examples time-variant multivariate autoregressive models were used. Based on this modeling, the concept of Granger causality in terms of the time-variant Granger causality index and the time-variant partial directed coherence was realized to investigate directed information transfer between different brain regions. Results: Signal informatics encompasses several diverse domains including: processing steps, methodologies, levels and subject fields, and applications. Five trends can be recognized and in order to illustrate these trends, three analysis strategies derived from current neuroscientific studies are presented. These examples comprise high-dimensional fMRI and EEG data. In the first example, the quantification of time-variant-directed information transfer between activated brain regions on the basis of fast-fMRI data is introduced and discussed. The second example deals with the investigation of differences in word processing between dyslexic and normal reading children. Different dynamic neural networks of the directed information transfer are identified on the basis of event-related potentials. The third example shows time-variant cortical connectivity networks derived from a source model. Conclusions: These examples strongly emphasize the integrative nature of signal informatics, encompassing processing steps, methodologies, levels and subject fields, and applications.

SEROTONINERGIC MODULATION OF CORTICAL AND RESPIRATORY RESPONSES TO EPISODIC HYPOXIA	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						serotonin 5-HT2 receptor; phrenic activity; hypoglossal activity; EEG; hypoxia		Biphasic respiratory response to hypoxia in anesthetized animals is accompanied by changes in the EEG mostly in the low EEG frequency bands. Serotonin is a potent modulator of cortical and respiratory activity through 5-HT2 receptors. Present study investigated whether 5-HT2 receptors might be involved in the EEG and respiratory relationship during normoxic and hypoxic respiration assessed from integrated phrenic (Phr) and hypoglossal (HG) nerve activities. EEG signal recorded from the frontal cortex was subjected to power spectral analysis in delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Systemic administration of 5-HT2 agonist DOI (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2- aminopropane) enhanced tonic and lowered peak phasic respiratory activity, and increased frequency of bursts of Phr and HG activity. At the same time, EEG activity became desynchronized and arterial blood pressure (ABP) increased. Following DOI pretreatment, 11% hypoxia induced an augmented respiratory response in comparison with the response in the baseline condition. ABP fell less then in the control hypoxia. EEG pattern changed less than in the baseline state. Subsequent administration of ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist increased respiratory activity, elicited a synchronization of EEG activity and hypotension. The respiratory response to hypoxia was attenuated and cortical response was more potent in comparison with that after DOI injection. Arterial blood pressure decreased more then during baseline hypoxic response. The results suggest that modulation of cortical synchronization and desynchronization through 5-HT2 receptor active agents may impact to hypoxic respiratory response.

Theta-range rhythmicity has also been reported in frontal and posterior cortical areas - where it tends to show consistent phase-relations with hippocampal rhythmicity. Theta-range rhythmicity may, then, be important for cortico-cortical and/or cortico-hippocampal interactions. Here, we surveyed the rat frontal and posterior midline cortices for theta-related oscillations and examined their relationships with hippocampal activity in freely moving rats. Variation in electroencephalography across 4 general classes of spontaneous behavior demonstrated different profiles of theta-like activities through the rat midline cortices. Analysis of cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal coherences showed distinct, behavior-dependent, couplings of theta and delta oscillations. Increased theta coherence between structures was most obvious during nonautomatic behaviors and least during immobility or grooming. Extensive coupling of theta oscillations throughout the rat midline cortices and hippocampus occurred during rearing, and exploratory behavior. Such increases in coherence could reflect binding of cortico-hippocampal pathways into temporary functional units by behavioral demands. Extensive coupling of frontal delta, which lacked coherence with posterior areas (including the hippocampus), suggests that different frequencies of rhythmicity may act to bind groups of structures into different functional circuits on different occasions.

Spectral parameters are formed by averaging periodograms across these discrete sections or trials. A key assumption in this approach is that of weak stationarity. This paper describes a simple test that checks if periodogram ordinates are consistent across sections as a means of assessing weak stationarity. The test is called the Periodogram Coefficient of Variation (PCOV) test, and is a frequency domain test based on a technique of spectral analysis. Application of the test is illustrated to both simulated and experimental data (EMC, physiological tremor, EEG). An additional role for the test as a useful tool in exploratory analysis of time series is highlighted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Halliday, D.

Although commercial software packages are available they, seem not to be used as widely in the preoperative work-Up of epilepsy patients as might be warranted. This review will demonstrate that seizure onset can be better defined by judicious use of post hoc filter settings, expanded electrode coverage. and special electrode montages. In scalp recordings, ictal baseline shifts and infraslow activity (ISA) call be evaluated led with conventional EEG systems by opening the high-pass filter to 0.01 Hz; in intracranial recordings high-frequency activity (>60 Hz: HFA) call be observed in addition. Inasmuch as ISA and HFA have considerably smaller electrical fields than the conventional frequencies they may better define seizure onset than might be possible otherwise. It is recommended that to determine the clinical value of ISA and HFA for epilepsy surgery, retrospective analyses of seizure data. which include assessment of ISA and HFA, be performed from patients who have undergone surgical resections of epileptogenic tissue. These may yield information as to whether or not the epileptogenic areas of ISA and HFA had been included in the resected tissue and their relationship to surgical outcome can then be determined.

Partial directed coherence-based information flow in Parkinson's disease patients performing a visually-guided motor task	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			BASAL GANGLIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	We propose a partial directed coherence (PCD) method based on a sparse multivariate autoregressive (mAR) model to investigate patterns of information flow in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients performing a visually-guided motor task. The use of a sparsity constraint on the mAR matrix addresses issues such as sample size, model order selection and number of parameters to be estimated, particularly when the number of EEG channels used is large and the window size is small in order to capture dynamic chances. The proposed PDC-based information flow analysis demonstrated distinctly altered patterns of connectivity between PD patients off medication and healthy subjects, particularly with respect to net information outflow from the left sensorimotor (L Sm) region, which might indicate excessive spreading of activity in the diseased state. Disrupted patterns of connectivity in PD were partially restored by levodopa medication. In addition, PDC-based analysis proved to be more sensitive to temporally-dynamic connectivity changes as compared to traditional spectral analysis, which might be influenced primarily by large-scale changes. We suggest that the proposed sparse-PDC method is a suitable technique to investigate altered connectivity in Parkinson's disease.	[Tropini, G.; McKeown, M.

Periodic limb movements both in non-REM and REM sleep: Relationships between cerebral and autonomic activities	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Periodic limb movements; EEG; Delta band; REM sleep; NREM sleep; Cyclic alternating pattern	RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; NOCTURNAL MYOCLONUS; HEART-RATE; AROUSAL; PREVALENCE; DISORDER; INSOMNIA; SYSTEM; PLMS	Objective: To investigate the temporal relationship between cerebral and autonomic activities before and during periodic limb movements in NREM and REM sleep (PLMS). Methods: Patterns of EEG, cardiac and muscle activities associated with PLMS were drawn from polysomnographic recordings of 14 outpatients selected for the presence of PLMS both in NREM and REM sleep. PLMS were scored during all sleep stages from tibial EMG. Data from a bipolar EEG channel were analyzed by wavelet transform. Heart rate (HR) was evaluated from the electrocardiogram. EEG, HR and EMG activations were detected as transient increase of signal parameters and examined by analysis of variance and correlation analysis independently in NREM and REM sleep. Homologous parameters in REM and NREM sleep were compared by paired t-test. Results: The autonomic component, expressed by HR increase, took place before the motor phenomenon both in REM and NREM sleep, but it was significantly earlier during NREM. In NREM sleep, PLM onset was heralded by a significant activation of delta-EEG, followed by a progressive increase of all the other bands. No significant activations of delta EEG were found in REM sleep. HR and EEG activations positively correlated with high frequency EEG activations and negatively (in NREM) with slow frequency ones. Conclusions: Our findings suggested a heralding role for delta band only in NREM sleep and for HR during both NREM and REM sleep. Differences in EEG and HR activation between REM and NREM sleep and correlative data suggested a different modulation of the global arousal response. Significance: In this study, time-frequency analysis and advanced statistical methods enabled an accurate comparison between brain and autonomic changes associated to PLM in NREM and REM sleep providing indications about interaction between autonomic and slow and fast EEG components of arousal response.

The cognitive and information processing take place in different brain regions at different time. To investigate how these distributed brain regions are linked together and the information is exchanged with time, this paper proposes a modem time-frequency coherent analysis that employs an alternative way for quantifying synchronization with both temporal and spectral resolution. Wavelet coherent spectrum is defined and computed from the EEG data set such that the cross wavelet magnitude spectra serves to indicate the degree of coherence and the cross wavelet phase can be used to provide the direction of information flow between channels on different brain regions. Several real ERP data are collected based on the cognitive tasks of sentences identification in both English and Chinese. It is observed from the time-varying synchronization that there are obviously differences during identifying both Chinese and English sentences.

Fusion is the combination of both imaging modalities based on a cascade of forward models from ensemble of post-synaptic potentials (ePSP) to net primary current densities (nPCD) to EEG; and from ePSP to vasomotor feed forward signal (VFFSS) to BOLD. In absence of a model, data driven fusion creates maps of correlations between EEG and BOLD or between estimates of nPCD and VFFS. A consistent finding has been that of positive correlations between EEG alpha power and BOLD in both frontal cortices and thalamus and of negative ones for the occipital region. For model driven fusion we formulate a neural mass EEG/fMRI model coupled to a metabolic hemodynamic model. For exploratory Simulations we show that the Local Linearization (LL) method for integrating stochastic differential equations is appropriate for highly nonlinear dynamics. It has been successfully applied to small and medium sized networks, reproducing the described EEG/BOLD correlations. A new LL-algebraic method allows simulations with hundreds of thousands of neural Populations, with connectivities and conduction delays estimated from diffusion weighted MRI. For parameter and state estimation, Kalman filtering combined with the LL method estimates the innovations or prediction errors. From these the likelihood of models given data are obtained. The LL-innovation estimation method has been already applied to small and medium scale models. With improved Bayesian computations the practical estimation of very large scale EEG/fMRI models shall soon be possible. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2701-2721, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that temporal synchronization of theta rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex is related to immediate memorization of repeated words. To address this issue, intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), under presurgical monitoring routine. During the recording of the intracerebral EEG activity, the subjects performed a computerized version of Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT), a popular test for the clinical evaluation of the immediate and delayed memory. They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after listening the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Spectral coherence of the intracerebral EEG activity was computed in order to assess the temporal synchronization of the theta (about 3-8 Hz) rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex. We found that theta coherence values between amygdala and hippocampus, and between hippocampus and occipital-temporal cortex, were higher in amplitude during successful than unsuccessful immediate recall. A control analysis showed that this was true also for a gamma band (40-45 Hz). Furthermore, these theta and gamma effects were not observed in an additional (control) subject with drug-resistant TLE and a wide lesion to hippocampus. In conclusion, a successful immediate recall to the RAVLT was associated to the enhancement of temporal synchronization of the theta (gamma) rhythms within a cerebral network including hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex.

To investigate this, we made simultaneous recordings of surface EEG, intracortical local field potential, and multiunit activity (MUA) in the alert monkey visual cortex during presentation of natural movies. Using a general linear model, we show that in single trials, EEG power in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) and phase in delta band (2-4 Hz) are significant predictors of the MUA response. Specifically, we found that the MUA response was strongest only when increases in EEG gamma power occurred during the negative-going phase of the delta wave, thus revealing a frequency-and coupling mechanism that can be exploited to infer population spiking activity. This finding may open up a new dimension in the use and interpretation of EEG in normal and pathological conditions.

First, a narrow-band oscillatory mode is extracted from a broadband background. Second, it is tested whether the extracted mode is significantly different from linearly filtered noise, modeled as a linear stochastic process possibly passed through a static nonlinear transformation. If a nonlinear oscillatory mode is positively detected, it can be further analyzed using nonlinear approaches such as phase synchronization analysis. For linear processes standard approaches, such as the coherence analysis, are more appropriate. The method is illustrated in a numerical example and applied to analyze experimentally obtained human electroencephalogram time series from a sleeping subject.

Each of these epileptic EEG has different time-frequency characteristics. If they are detected by identical detection rule, it is impossible to obtain optimal detection result. In this paper, we present a classifying detection method to automatically detect different kinds of epileptic EEG data using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with approximate entropy (ApEn). Spike wave, spike-and-slow complex wave and sharp-and-slow complex wave are detected by this method and the optimal detection rules are achieved.

Space-time-frequency analysis of EEG data using within-subject statistical tests followed by sequential PCA	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; PARALLEL ANALYSIS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; NUMBER; VARIANCE; SPECTRA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MISALLOCATION	A new method is developed for analyzing the time-varying spectral content of EEG data collected in cognitive tasks. The goal is to extract and summarize the most salient features of numerical results, which span space, time, frequency, task conditions, and multiple subjects. Direct generalization of an established approach for analyzing event-related potentials, which uses sequential PCA followed by ANOVA to test for differences between conditions across subjects, gave unacceptable results. The new method, termed STAT-PCA, advocates statistical testing for differences between conditions within single subjects, followed by sequential PCA across subjects. In contrast to PCA-ANOVA, it is demonstrated that STAT-PCA gives results which: 1) isolate task-related spectral changes, 2) are insensitive to the precise definition of baseline power, 3) are stable under deletion of a random subject, and 4) are interpretable in terms of the group-averaged power. Furthermore, STAT-PCA permits the detection of activity that is not only different between conditions, but also common to both conditions, providing a complete yet parsimonious view of the data. It is concluded that STAT-PCA is well suited for analyzing the time-varying spectral content of EEG during cognitive tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We tested whether the time course of subjective scores and EEG indexes of sleepiness can be related to chronotype (morning and evening lateness), somnotype (daytime and anytime sleepability) and trototype (daytime and anytime wakeability), and, if yes, whether waking EEG measures can allow the quantification of sleep need and susceptibility to sleep loss. Resting EEG was recorded in 130 healthy subjects in the course of sustained wakefulness every three hours (nine times) from frontal and occipital derivations with eyes closed and open. The analysis included the calculation of the inpsatized values of power density in 10 frequency ranges (slow delta, fast delta, slow theta, fast theta, slow alpha, fast alpha, sigma, slow beta, fast beta and slow gamma) and testing their associations with self-rated sleepiness, sleep history, and chrono-, somno- and trototype self-assessed with the six-scale Sleep-Wake Pattern Assessment Questionnaire. It was found that subject's chronotype and subject's trototype account for a large portion of the individual variation in the mean levels and kinetic of EEG indexes of sleep debt and sleepiness. We also demonstrated the possibility to distinguish between two distinct effects of sleep loss on waking EEG powers in theta and alpha frequency ranges. The first effect is the EEG slowing (i.e., a rise of slow theta power opposing by a drop of fast alpha power) that can serve as an objective measure of trototype (wakeability). The second effect is the EEG amplifying (i.e., a rise of both fast theta and low alpha powers) that informs about the increase in sleep debt.

Frequency- and time-dependent signal processing strategies of cerebral and noncerebral measures can help test current theories of neuronal network maturation in terms of segregation and integration of short-distance versus long-distance neuronal connections throughout the neuroaxis. Specific phenotypic expressions of adaptive or maladaptive neuronal connectivity are proposed based on comparisons of whole-brain EEG/sleep resting states between preterm and full-term cohorts when developmental outcome measures are applied. Combined use of neurophysiological datasets with neuroimaging and genetic methodologies define endophenotypes that will more accurately diagnose children at risk for developmental disorders, as well as design appropriate neuroprotective interventions for the individual's age and disease progress.

One promising technique for solving the EEG inverse problem is Kalman filtering, because it provides a natural framework for incorporating dynamic EEG generation models in source localization. Here, a recently developed inverse solution is introduced, which uses spatiotemporal Kalman filtering tuned through likelihood maximization. Standard diagnostic tests for objectively evaluating Kalman filter performance are then described and applied to inverse solutions for simulated and clinical EEG data. These tests, employed for the first time in Kalman-filter-based source localization, check the statistical properties of the innovation and validate the use of likelihood maximization for filter tuning. However, this analysis also reveals that the filter's existing space- and time-invariant process model,which contains a single fixed-frequency resonance, is unable to completely model the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG data. This finding indicates that the algorithm could be improved by allowing the process model parameters to vary in space.

The proposed system can help individuals get the feel of motor imagery by presenting them with real-time brain activation maps on their cortex. Ten healthy participants took part in our experiment, half of whom were trained by the suggested training system and the others did not use any training. All participants in the trained group succeeded in performing motor imagery after a series of trials to activate their motor cortex without any physical movements of their limbs. To confirm the effect of the suggested system, we recorded EEG signals for the trained group around sensorimotor cortex while they were imagining either left or right hand movements according to our experimental design, before and after the motor imagery training. For the control group, we also recorded EEG signals twice without any training sessions. The participants' intentions were then classified using a time-frequency analysis technique, and the results of the trained group showed significant differences in the sensorimotor rhythms between the signals recorded before and after training. Classification accuracy was also enhanced considerably in all participants after motor imagery training compared to the accuracy before training. On the other hand, the analysis results for the control EEG data set did not show consistent increment in both the number of meaningful time-frequency combinations and the classification accuracy, demonstrating that the suggested system can be used as a tool for training motor imagery tasks in BCI applications. Further, we expect that the motor imagery training system will be useful not only for BCI applications, but for functional brain mapping studies that utilize motor imagery tasks as well.

We tested whether individuals with a phylogenetic fear (spider phobics, n = 17) differed in EEG general activity (delta band power) of the oldest brain system and in complexity from individuals with a non-phylogenetic fear (flight phobics, n = 15) during eyes open and eyes closed resting states. Delta band power was higher during the eyes-closed condition at central sites FZ, CZ and PZ as well as at frontal sites FP1, FP2, and F4. No differences existed in the upper bands theta, alpha, and beta. The EEG complexity was significantly lower among individuals with spider phobia. Differences were found under both eyes closed and eyes open conditions at FZ, F4, CZ, and C4. Lower complexity was also found at PZ and 02 during eyes open. In general, the results of this ex post facto study lend support to the hypothesized prevalence of slow oscillations in phylogenetic fears. Furthermore these results show that the EEG output of spider phobic participants is less complex than the output from flight phobic participants. The prevalence of slow brain oscillations and the lowered EEG complexity could be interpreted as traces of phylogenetic fears.

Recent studies have suggested an oscillatory hierarchy with faster oscillations being locked to preferred phases of underlying slower waves, a functional principle applied up to the level of action potential generation. We here tested the idea that amplitude-phase coupling between frequencies might serve the detection of weak sensory signals. To this end we recorded neuromagnetic responses during a motion discrimination task using near-threshold stimuli. Amplitude modulation of occipital high-frequency oscillations in the gamma range (63 +/- 5 Hz) was phase locked to a slow-frequency oscillation in the delta band (1-5 Hz). Most importantly, the strength of gamma amplitude modulation reflected the success in visual discrimination. This correlation provides evidence for the hypothesis that coupling between low- and high-frequency brain oscillations subserves signal detection. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION WITH OPTIMAL WINDOW LENGTH SCHEME USING FRACTAL DIMENSION AND WAVELET TRANSFORM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Non-Stationary Signal; Adaptive Segmentation; Fractal Dimension; Wavelet Transform; Window Length	EEG; COMPLEXITY; SIGNALS	In many signal processing applications, such as EEG analysis, the non-stationary signal is often required to be segmented into small epochs. This is accomplished by drawing the boundaries of signal at time instances where its statistical characteristics, such as amplitude and/or frequency, change. In the proposed method, the original signal is initially decomposed into signals with different frequency bands using wavelet transform. The fractal dimension of the decomposed signal is calculated in a sliding window and the results are used as a feature for adaptive segmentation. A criterion is introduced in this paper to choose a proper length for the sliding window. Performance of the proposed method is compared with that of three other existing segmentation methods using synthetic and real EEG data. Simulation results show the high efficiency of the proposed method in signal segmentation.	[Anisheh, S.

Spontaneous locally restricted EEG alpha activity determines cortical excitability in the motor cortex	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Sensorimotor cortex; sLORETA; Transcranial magnetic Stimulation (TMS)	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESONANCE; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; RHYTHMS; AREAS	There is growing interest in the functional meaning of rhythmical brain activity. For oscillatory brain activity around 10 Hz in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) it is discussed whether it is associated with the level of cortical excitation. However, it is not clear whether the relation between 10 Hz EEG oscillatory activity and cortical excitability is a global, locally very unspecific phenomenon or whether focal 10 Hz oscillations in the human brain are a highly specific correlate of the cortical excitation level. To determine this open question, multichannel EEG was combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the primary motor cortex in this study. The present data showed that a motor evoked potential was elicited more easily when alpha power immediately preceding the magnetic pulse was low, and vice versa. Interestingly, this effect was only found for very local EEG alpha activity at sites overlying the cortical motor areas to which the TMS pulses were applied. This was verified using source localization in 3D space.

Both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state data are discussed. These reflections of typical development provide a framework for illustrating EEG differences in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), and its main diagnostic types, from children to adults. Comorbidity effects in the EEG of children with AD/HD, particularly comorbid reading disabilities and conduct disorders, are also described. Some recent explorations of the links between arousal/activation and EEG activity may contribute to our understanding of the functional nature of brain oscillations in this context. Other aspects of oscillatory brain activity, coherence and event-related potentials, are also briefly discussed within this framework.

The specific utility of our tracking algorithm is to maximize the oscillatory behavior of its output rather than its spectral power, which shows interesting properties for the observation of neuronal oscillations. In addition, the structure of the filter bank allows for efficiently tracking multiple frequency components perturbed by noise, therefore providing a good framework for EEG spectral analysis. Moreover, our algorithm can be generalized to multivariate data analysis, allowing the simultaneous investigation of several EEG sensors. Thus. a more precise extraction of spectral information can be obtained from the EEG signal under study. After a short introduction, we present our algorithm as well as synthetic examples illustrating its potential. Then, the performance of the method on real EEG signals is presented for the tracking of both a single oscillatory component and multiple components. Finally, future lines of improvement as well as areas of applications are discussed.

Behavioural studies have investigated feature selection and binding in time using fleeting sequences of stimuli in the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm, and found that temporal accuracy is reduced when attentional control is diminished. To reduce the efficacy of attentional deployment, these studies have employed the Attentional Blink (AB) phenomenon. In this article, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to directly investigate the temporal dynamics of conscious perception. Specifically, employing a combination of experimental analysis and neural network modelling, we test the hypothesis that the availability of attention reduces temporal jitter in the latency between a target's visual onset and its consolidation into working memory. We perform time-frequency analysis on data from an AB study to compare the EEG trials underlying the P3 ERPs (Event-related Potential) evoked by targets seen outside vs. inside the AB time window. We find visual differences in phase-sorted ERPimages and statistical differences in the variance of the P3 phase distributions. These results argue for increased variation in the latency of conscious perception during the AB. This experimental analysis is complemented by a theoretical exploration of temporal attention and target processing. Using activation traces from the Neural-ST2 model, we generate virtual ERPs and virtual ERPimages. These are compared to their human counterparts to propose an explanation of how target consolidation in the context of the AB influences the temporal variability of selective attention. The AB provides us with a suitable phenomenon with which to investigate the interplay between attention and perception. The combination of experimental and theoretical elucidation in this article contributes to converging evidence for the notion that the AB reflects a reduction in the temporal acuity of selective attention and the timeliness of perception.

Neural basis of postural instability identified by VTC and EEG	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						VTC; Balance; Falling; EEG; Wavelet; ICA; LORETA	TIME-TO-CONTACT; WORKING-MEMORY; COMPONENT; STABILITY; COLLISION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; TOMOGRAPHY	In this study, we investigated the neural basis of virtual time to contact (VTC) and the hypothesis that VTC provides predictive information for future postural instability. A novel approach to differentiate stable pre-falling and transition-to-instability stages within a single postural trial while a subject was performing a challenging single leg stance with eyes closed was developed. Specifically, we utilized wavelet transform and stage segmentation algorithms using VTC time series data set as an input. The VTC time series was time-locked with multichannel (n = 64) EEG signals to examine its underlying neural substrates. To identify the focal sources of neural substrates of VTC, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution tomography (LORETA) of multichannel EEG. There were two major findings: (1) a significant increase of VTC minimal values (along with enhanced variability of VTC) was observed during the transition-to-instability stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and falling; and (2) this VTC dynamics was associated with pronounced modulation of EEG predominantly within theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. The sources of this EEG modulation were identified at the cingulate cortex (ACC) and the junction of precuneus and parietal lobe, as well as at the occipital cortex. The findings support the hypothesis that the systematic increase of minimal values of VTC concomitant with modulation of EEG signals at the frontal-central and parietal-occipital areas serve collectively to predict the future instability in posture.

Visual Transformation of the EEG in the Intensive Care	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			monitoring; time-frequency plots; EEG; transformation; intensive care unit	BRAIN	In the intensive care unit (ICU), patients are often sedated and ventilated, which makes clinical evaluation of the status of the brain very limited. In these situations, the EEG is a potentially very useful tool to be informed about the status of the brain. EEG rhythms are very sensitive for derangements in brain function, as may occur in hypoxia, and can reliably detect epileptiform discharges. In addition, it can be a valuable tool for follow-up of patients, and can significantly contribute to prognostication of brain-damaged patients. The actual use of continuous EEG monitoring in the ICU is limited, however. An important contributing factor is related to the difficulties in interpreting the raw EEG signal, that does not permit a straightforward understanding by non-trained personnel. We recently proposed a visual transform of the EEG (van Putten, J Clin Neurophysiology 2008; 25:63-68) to facilitate the interpretation. Here, we present a modification of this analysis, including examples of this method in monitoring patients in the ICU.

Evoked activity and EEG phase resetting in the genesis of auditory Go/NoGo ERPs	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP genesis; Phase resetting; Stimulus-processing evoked activity; EEG; Go/NoGo paradigm	CONTRIBUTES; GENERATION; POWER	Current views of the genesis of the event-related potential (ERP) contrast the phase-reset and evoked activity models. In the former, a portion of the ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity becomes phase-locked at stimulus onset; in the latter, processing in the brain contributes additional time-locked activity at each trial. This study aimed to explore these perspectives in an auditory Go/NoGo task. The interactions between these processes were examined using the amplitudes and topographies of pre- and post-stimulus EEGs in traditional bands, and the averaged ERPs, together with time-frequency analysis. Results indicate that both evoked activity and phase locking of ongoing EEG activity contribute substantially to the different Go and NoGo ERP components. Phase locking contributes most strongly to the early exogenous ERP components, with evoked brain activity related to cognitive processing contributing strongly to the endogenous ERP components. Evidence also suggests that extensive phase realignments may generate the power increases associated with early exogenous components. It is concluded that exogenous ERP components arise substantially from phase-resetting mechanisms involving ongoing EEG activity. In contrast, the endogenous components are substantially produced by evoked activity in various frequency bands, and their differences reflect differential cortical processing required for appropriate responding to the Go vs. NoGo stimuli.

Scalp EEGs were recorded in 10 normal volunteers during daytime wakefulness (eyes closed; first period: from 10:00 to 13:00 h; second period: from 14:00 to 18:00 h; third period: from 19:00 to 22:00 h) and nighttime sleep (four NREM-REM cycles). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), sigma (12-15 Hz) and beta (16-28 Hz). The direction of the inter-hemispheric information flow was evaluated by computing the directed transfer function (DTF) from these EEG rhythms. Inter-hemi spheric directional flows varied as a function of the state of consciousness (wake, NREM sleep, REM sleep) and in relation to different cerebral areas. During the daytime, alpha and beta rhythms conveyed inter-hemispheric signals with preferred Left-to-Right hemisphere direction in parietal and central areas, respectively. During the NREM sleep periods of nighttime, the direction of inter-hemispheric DTF information flows conveyed by central beta rhythms was again preponderant from Left-to-Right hemisphere in the stage 2, independent of cortical areas. No preferred direction emerged across the REM periods. These results support the hypothesis that specific directionality of communication flows between brain hemispheres is associated with wakefulness, NREM (particularly stage 2) and REM states during daytime and nighttime. They also reinforce the suggestive hypothesis of a relationship between inter-hemispheric directionality of EEG functional coupling and frequency of the EEG rhythms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, an affective brain-computer interface (ABCI) is proposed to perform affective computation on electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of emotion. The proposed ABCI extracts EEG features from subjects while exposed to 6 emotionally-related musical and vocal stimuli using kernel smoothing density estimation (KSDE) and Gaussian mixture model probability estimation (GMM). A classification algorithm is subsequently used to learn and classify the extracted EEG features. An inter-subject validation study is performed on healthy subjects to assess the performance of ABCI using a selection of classification algorithms.

Here we introduce an algorithm based on constrained independent component analysis (=cICA) for PRA removal. This method has several advantages: (1) automatic detection of the components corresponding to the PRA; (=2) stability of the solution and (3) computational treatability. Using multichannel EEG recordings obtained in a 3 T MR scanner, with and without concomitant fMRI acquisition, we provide evidence for the sensitivity and specitivity of the method in rejecting PRA in various sleep and waking conditions.

Steady state and induced auditory gamma deficits in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							AMPLITUDE-MODULATED SOUNDS; 40 HZ; EVOKED-RESPONSES; STIMULATION; CORTEX; PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYSFUNCTION; PRECISION	Steady state auditory evoked potentials (SSAEPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) have been reported to be reduced in schizophrenia, most consistently to frequencies in the gamma range (40 Hz and greater). The current study evaluated the specificity of this deficit over a broad range of stimulus frequencies and harmonics, the relationship between phase locking and signal power, and whether induced 40 Hz activity was also affected. SSAEPs to amplitude modulated tones from 5 to 50 Hz were obtained from subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy control subjects in 5 Hz steps. Time-frequency spectral analysis was used to differentiate EEG activity synchronized in phase across trials using Phase Locking Factor (PLF) and Mean Power (MP) change from baseline activity. In the SSAEP frequency response condition, patients with SZ showed broad band reductions in both PLF and MP In addition, the control subjects showed a more pronounced increase in PLF with increases in power compared to SZ subjects. A noise Pulse embedded in 40 Hz stimuli resulted in a transient reduction of PLF and MP at 40 Hz in control subjects, while SZ showed diminished overall PLF. Finally, induced gamma (around 40 Hz) response to unmodulated tone stimuli was also reduced in SZ, indicating that disturbances in this oscillatory activity are not confined to SSAEPs. In summary, SZ subjects show impaired oscillatory responses in the gamma range across a wide variety of experimental conditions. Reduction of PLF along with reduced MP may reflect abnormalities in the auditory cortical circuits, such as a reduction in pyramidal cell volume, spine density and alterations in GABAergic neurons.

Detection of high-frequency oscillations and microseizures could provide valuable insights into causes and therapies for the treatment of epilepsy, but requires high spatial and temporal resolution. Our group is currently using hybrid arrays composed of up to 320 micro- and clinical macroelectrode arrays sampled at 32 kHz per channel with 18-bits of A/D resolution. Such recordings produce approximately 3 terabytes of data per day. Existing file formats have limited data compression capabilities, and do not offer mechanisms for protecting patient identifying information or detecting data corruption during transmission or storage. We present a novel file format that employs range encoding to provide a high degree of data compression, a three-tiered 128-bit encryption system for patient information and data security, and a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check to verify the integrity of compressed data blocks. Open-source software to read, write, and process these files are provided.

A substantial part of these interactions consists in synchronized goal-directed actions involving two or more individuals. Hyperscanning techniques for assessing fMRI simultaneously from two individuals have been developed. However, EEG recordings that permit the assessment of synchronized neuronal activities at much higher levels of temporal resolution have not yet been simultaneously assessed in multiple individuals and analyzed in the time-frequency domain. In this study, we simultaneously recorded EEG from the brains of each of eight pairs of guitarists playing a short melody together to explore the extent and the functional significance of synchronized cortical activity in the course of interpersonally coordinated actions. Results: By applying synchronization algorithms to intra- and interbrain analyses, we found that phase synchronization both within and between brains increased significantly during the periods of (i) preparatory metronome tempo setting and (ii) coordinated play onset. Phase alignment extracted from within-brain dynamics was related to behavioral play onset asynchrony between guitarists. Conclusion: Our findings show that interpersonally coordinated actions are preceded and accompanied by between-brain oscillatory couplings. Presumably, these couplings reflect similarities in the temporal properties of the individuals' percepts and actions. Whether betweenbrain oscillatory couplings play a causal role in initiating and maintaining interpersonal action coordination needs to be clarified by further research.

A tunnel task was designed to classify subjects into allocentric or egocentric spatial representation users. Despite of the differences of mental spatial representation, behavioral performance in general were compatible between the two strategies subjects in the tunnel task. Task-related EEC dynamics in power changes were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), time-frequency and non-parametric statistic test. ERSP image results revealed navigation performance-predictive EEG activities which is is expressed in the parietal component by source reconstruction. For egocentric subjects, comparing to trails with well-estimation of homing angle, the power attenuation at the frequencies from 8 to 30 Hz (around alpha and beta band) was stronger when subjects overestimated homing directions, but the attenuated power was decreased when subjects were underestimated the homing angles. However, we did not found performance related brain activities for allocentric subjects, which may due to the functional dissociation between the use of allo- and egocentric reference frames.

Frontal brain oscillatory coupling among men who vary in salivary testosterone levels	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Testosterone; EEG rhythmic coupling; Delta oscillations; Beta oscillations; Cross-frequency interactions	DELTA-BETA OSCILLATIONS; EXOGENOUS TESTOSTERONE; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; THETA; GAMMA; EEG; ALPHA	Recent studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling supports the integration of distinct neuronal oscillatory modes. In particular, spectral coupling between slow-wave delta and fast-wave beta oscillations may reflect subcortical-cortical interactions. Prior experiments have shown that delta-beta coupling appears to be sensitive to steroid hormone patterning. We attempted to extend this hypothesis by examining the relation between delta-beta EEG spectral coupling and endogenous testosterone measures in men. We collected resting regional brain electrical (EEC) activity and salivary testosterone from 34 healthy young adult males (M age = 24 years). Males with high testosterone showed non-significant delta-beta coupling (delta-beta decoupling), while males with low testosterone exhibited significant delta-beta coupling. These relations were only found for the frontal brain region. There was also a significant group difference in the magnitude of coupling, but no differences in absolute delta and beta power. Findings are discussed in terms of emerging evidence relating steroid hormones to cross-frequency spectral coupling and directions for future work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A device that could predict a seizure and notify the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. A patient-specific classification algorithm is proposed to distinguish between preictal and interictal features extracted from EEG recordings. It demonstrates that the classifier based on a Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machine (CSVM) can distinguish preictal from interictal with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, when applied to linear features of power spectrum in 9 different frequency bands. The proposed algorithm was applied to EEG recordings of 9 patients in the Freiburg EEG database, totaling 45 seizures and 219-hour-long interictal, and it produced sensitivity of 77.8% (35 of 45 seizures) and the zero false positive rate using 5-minute-long window of preictal via double-cross validation. This approach is advantageous, for it can help an implantable device for seizure prediction consume less power by real-time analysis based on extraction of linear features and by offline optimization, which may be computationally intensive and by real-time analysis.

Precursors of SWD (preSWD) were classified based on the distribution of EEG power in delta-theta-alpha frequency bands as measured in the frontal cortex. In 95% of preSWD, an elevation of EEG power was detected in delta band (1-4 Hz). 73% of preSWD showed high power in theta frequencies (4.5-8 Hz); these preSWD might correspond to 5-9 Hz oscillations that were found in GAERS before SWD onset [Pinault, D., Vergnes, M., Marescaux, C., 2001. Medium-voltage 5-9 Hz oscillations give rise to spike-and-wave discharges in a genetic model of absence epilepsy: in vivo dual extracellular recording of thalamic relay and reticular neurons. Neuroscience 105, 181-201], however, theta component of preSWD in our WAG/Rij rats was not shaped into a single rhythm. It is concluded that a coalescence of delta and theta in the cortex is favorable for the occurrence of SWD. The onset of SWD was associated with strengthening of intracortical and thalamo-cortical coherence in 9.5-14 Hz and in double beta frequencies. No features of EEG coherence can be considered as unique for any of preSWD subtype. Reticular and ventroposteromedial thalamic nuclei were strongly coupled even before the onset of SWD. All this suggests that SWD derive from an intermixed delta-theto EEG background; seizure onset associates with reinforcement of intracortical and cortico-thalamic associations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation was based on the perspective of the similarities among the tasks of the same processing type and discrepancies between the different processing types. EEG coherence of eighteen volunteers during two simultaneous and three successive tasks varying in task content (verbal-nonverbal) and modality (auditory-visual) was computed. First, we compared the coherence patterns between the tasks of the same processing type, then compared between the tasks of different processing types. Result revealed a specific theta coherence pattern associated with processing type regardless of task contents and modality. Theta coherence during the simultaneous processing showed increased short-range inter-hemispheric connections over central and parietal regions as compared to the successive tasks. Upper beta coherence indicated task-dependent effect regardless of processing types. In addition, our data indicated no hemispheric differences for both processing types. It suggested that confounding of verbal-nonverbal and processing type (simultaneous-successive) dimension could be avoided. Our result presented psychophysiological evidence for the existence of two types of information processing, which has been supported by psychological studies with factor analysis.

Methods: Forty-nine subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent EEG recording and MRI scan. The theta/gamma ratio of the relative power at the peak frequency was Computed. Based on the tertiles values of the ratio, three groups with increasing values of theta/gamma ratio were obtained. The groups were characterized by the performance on cognitive tests. Changes in functional brain connectivity, as expressed by interhemisperic and intrahemispheric EEG linear coherence in the groups were also evaluated. Results: Increase in theta/gamma ratio was associated with impairment in memory tests. This relationship was confirmed by correlation and multiple regression analysis. An independent association was found between theta/gamma ratio and alpha3/alpha2 power ratio. Coherence analysis showed modifications of interhemispheric functional coupling on temporal regions on slow frequencies. Conclusions: Theta/gamma ratio of relative power at peak frequency is significantly associated to memory decline. It could be a useful tool in detecting MCI subjects which are at major risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias. Significance: A global modulation of brain rhythms could be driven by the pathological alterations of theta/gamma ratio. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: The processing of visual input was investigated by quantifying event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Cue-based vertical and horizontal eye movements were measured with an eye tracker. Differences between vertical and horizontal eye movements in EEG and eye-tracking data were analyzed. Results: The results of this Study indicate that vertical and horizontal eye movements result in different ERD and ERS patterns. During the execution of a saccade vertical eye movements are accompanied by a stronger ERS whereas the fixation of the Cue is related to stronger ERD after horizontal eye movements. Conclusion: The fact that eye movements are correlated with a desynchronization of activity in parietal and occipital areas is reasonable, since visual information processing and visual control of movements take place there. Stronger ERD in the alpha band could be related to the fact that information processing tasks like e.g. reading require mostly horizontal and not vertical eye movements. Significance: The differences in the ERD/ERS patterns in relation to the direction of the eye movement should be considered in future investigations and taken into account in the construction of paradigms.

The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity characteristic of waking (beta and alpha oscillations) is gradually replaced by the EEG signs of sleep (sleep spindles and theta/delta waves) during the sleep onset period (SOP) in normal subjects. The decrease in fast oscillations occurs at the first signs of stage 1, whereas theta and delta increase occurs later, indicating that waking promoting mechanisms are turned off before sleep-promoting mechanisms are fully started. It could be therefore hypothesized that difficulty in sleep initiation in insomniacs might be due to either a hyperacfivation of waking promoting systems, a weakness of sleep promoting ' mechanisms or an imbalance between them. Quantitative EEG analysis has revealed higher beta during wakefulness, as well as during sleep and lower slow (delta) activity in insomniacs. The presence of alpha activity during cognitive information processing, especially of slow alpha activity in relation to attention, as well as in some pathologies associated to sleep disturbances, has suggested that alpha activity during sleep is a sign of activation; however, alpha activity during sleep has been less t studied in insomniacs. Only broad bands have been considered in all of the aforementioned studies, and in almost all of them the analyses were restricted to central regions. It is therefore important to study the entire frequency spectrum of EEG activity in insomniacs. Sleep initiation does not occur simultaneously over the entire cortex but starts as a local process which gradually invades the rest of the cortex, in which the frontal lobes play a crucial role. Frontal and parietal regions are part of an important network involved in attention and conduction of thought. Thus, quantitative analysis of narrow EEG bands and their distribution in the cerebral cortex may contribute to a better understanding of neural mechanisms compromised in etiology of sleep initiation in primary insomnia. The main objective of the present investigation was, therefore, to analyze the spectral power of narrow EEG bands in the 19 derivations of the 10-20 International System during SOP in primary insomniacs with difficulty in sleep initiation. Given that one of the main complaints of insomniacs is the difficulty to initiate sleep and that hyperarousal is one of the factors proposed to be involved in the etiology of insomnia, EEG activity during SOP of the first night in the laboratory was analyzed to control activating effects of surrounding circumstances and isolate permanent EEG characteristics.; Subjects were 19-34 years old, right-handed with primary sleep insomnia, which were thoroughly screened via structured psychiatric, medical and sleep interviews and scales. Subjects were younger and the age range was narrower than in other EEG frequency spectral content studies of primary insomniacs to avoid confounding effects of changes in sleep architecture or in EEG generated by development. All patients met the criteria for primary insomnia with sleep onset difficulty and impaired daytime function on three or more nights per week for at least six months and with no medical, psychiatric or neurological conditions; they were not medicated and had no other sleep disorders. Participants taking sleep medications or other drugs (urine test), respiratory or sleep disorders such as apnea and periodic limb movements (PSG) were excluded. The control group (n=9) was matched for age and dexterity, but had no complaints of insomnia and reported their sleep as restorative and satisfactory. All participants underwent a single night of standard polysomnography (EEG, EOG and EMG) in the laboratory. In addition, the 19 electrode sites of the 10-20 International System referred to ipsilateral earlobes, oral-nasal airflow and anterior tibialis EMG were.recorded. PSG was scored in 30 sec epochs, blind to the subject group according to Rechlschaffen and Kales criteria. EEG from SOP (lights out to consolidate sleep), defined as 3 consecutive minutes of delta sleep, was digitized at 1024 Hz with 12 bits resolution and filter settings of 0.03-70 Hz. EEG was segmented into two-sec non-overlapping epochs and inspected for' artifacts. All artifact-free epochs were Fast Fourier Transformed and absolute (AP) and relative power (RP: AP in each Hz bin/total spectrum power x 100) was obtained for 1 Hz bins. AP and RP was logtransformed before statistical analysis, and was averaged over each derivation and sleep stage of SOP Group differences were compared by means of Student's t tests and probability level was set of p<0.05. In contrast with healthy controls, insomniac patients exhibited higher alpha RP (7 and 8 Hz) over all frontal derivations during stage 2 of SOP and higher RP of isolated beta and gamma frequencies during wakefulness. PSG of both groups showed the first night effect)) with decreased total sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency index and REM sleep percentage compared to normal values for the 20-30 age decade; PSG variables were not significantly different between the two groups except for wakefulness percentage during SOP. Insomniacs did differ from controls in subjective estimation of sleep quality and continuity in spite of similar PSG. The absence of significant differences between insomniacs and controls in sleep EEG activity (delta, theta and sigma frequencies) suggests that sleep homeostatic function is preserved in insomniacs, which agrees with results obtained in other studies after partial sleep deprivation. The absence of a stronger promoting effect of insomnia in the insomniac group by the first recording night indicates that EEG characteristics found in this group cannot be attributed to external stimuli nor surrounding circumstances and rather suggests a more stable alteration; however, further studies of larger groups and other age spans are needed to confirm present results. The evidence mentioned above suggests an imbalance between waking and sleep promoting mechanisms in primary insomniacs with difficulty in sleep initiation and sleep perception. Attention depends not only on vigilance level, but also on frontal regions which, together with posterior association areas, conform an essential network for purposive endogenously guided attention. The presence in insomniacs of alpha activity in frontal regions, which is a sign of top-down control of attention, and its absence in posterior regions during stage 2 suggests the persistence of a certain level of endogenous attention during stage 2 of SOP, which contributes in turn to the subjective perception of sleep onset difficulties and bad sleep quality.

Ten-minute epochs of wakefulness (W), stage 1-2 non-REM (N1-N2), stage 3 non-REM (N3) and REM sleep (R) were identified from stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) data recorded at 2 kHz in nine patients. Rates of spikes, ripples (> 80 Hz), and fast ripples (> 250 Hz) were calculated, as were HFO durations, degree of spike-HFO overlap, HFO rates inside and outside of spikes, and inside and outside of the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). Ripples were observed in nine patients and fast ripples in eight. Spike rate was highest in N1-N2 in 5 of 9 patients, and in N3 in 4 of 9 patients, whereas ripple rate was highest in N1-N2 in 4 of 9 patients, in N3 in 4 of 9 patients, and in W in 1 of 9 patients. Fast ripple rate was highest in N1-N2 in 4 of 8 patients, and in N3 in 4 of 8 patients. HFO properties changed significantly with sleep stage, although the absolute effects were small. The difference in HFO rates inside and outside of the SOZ was highly significant (p < 0.000001) in all stages except for R and, for fast ripples, only marginally significant (p = 0.018) in W. Rates of HFOs recorded from depth macroelectrodes are highest in non-REM sleep. HFO properties were similar in stages N1-N2 and N3, suggesting that accurate sleep staging is not necessary. The spatial specificity of HFO, particularly fast ripples, was affected by sleep stage, suggesting that recordings excluding REM sleep and wakefulness provide a more reliable indicator of the SOZ.

Frequency Domain Connectivity Identification: An Application of Partial Directed Coherence in fMRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						fMRI; connectivity; Granger causality; frequency domain; multisubject; bootstrap	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GRANGER CAUSALITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; DEPENDENCE; REGIONS; MRI	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an important tool in Neuroscience due to its noninvasive and high spatial resolution properties compared to other methods like PET or EEG. Characterization of the neural connectivity has been the aim of several cognitive researches, as the interactions among cortical areas lie at the heart of many brain dysfunctions and mental disorders. Several methods like correlation analysis, structural equation modeling, and dynamic causal models have been proposed to quantify connectivity strength. An important concept related to connectivity modeling is Granger causality, which is one of the most popular definitions for the measure of directional dependence between time series. In this article, we propose the application of the partial directed coherence (PDC) for the connectivity analysis of multisubject fMRI data using multivariate bootstrap. PDC is a frequency domain counterpart of Granger causality and has become a very prominent tool in EEG studies. The achieved frequency decomposition of connectivity is useful in separating interactions from neural modules from those originating in scanner noise, breath, and heart beating. Real fMRI dataset of six subjects executing a language processing protocol was used for the analysis of connectivity. Hum Brain Mapp 30:452-461, 2009. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The visuotactile integration process appears to cause this illusion; the corresponding brain activity was revealed in many Studies. In this Study, We investigated the effect of the rubber hand illusion on the crossmodal integration process by measuring EEG. The participants who experienced less intensive illusion showed greater Congruency effect on reaction time (RT), greater power increase at the parietal zero electrode (Pz) and smaller interelectrode synchrony of the gamma band activity. On the other hand, the participants who experienced more intense illusion showed greater interelectrode synchrony. The results suggested that the gamma band activity in the parietal area reflects the visuotactile integration process and that its synchrony causes the illusory intensity.

J	Payne, L; Kounios, J				Payne, Lisa; Kounios, John			Coherent oscillatory networks supporting short-term memory retention	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Coherence; Short-term memory; Working memory; Alpha oscillation; Theta oscillation; Sensory gating	INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL ACTIVITY; TASK; BRAIN; MIND; DISSOCIATION	Accumulating evidence suggests that top-down processes, reflected by frontal-midline theta-band (4-8 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations, strengthen the activation of a memory set during short-term memory (STM) retention. In addition, the amplitude of posterior alpha-band (8-13 Hz) oscillations during STM retention is thought to reflect a mechanism that protects fragile STM activations from interference by gating bottom-up sensory inputs. The present study addressed two important questions about these phenomena. First, why have previous studies not consistently found memory set-size effects on frontal-midline theta? Second, how does posterior alpha participate in STM retention? To answer these questions, large-scale network connectivity during STM retention was examined by computing EEG wavelet coherence during the retention period of a modified Sternberg task using visually-presented letters as stimuli. The results showed (a) increasing theta-band coherence between frontal-midline and left temporal-parietal sites with increasing memory load, and (b) increasing alpha-band coherence between midline parietal and left temporal/parietal sites with increasing memory load. These findings support the view that theta-band coherence, rather than amplitude, is the key factor in selective top-down strengthening of the memory set and demonstrate that posterior alpha-band oscillations associated with sensory gating are involved in STM retention by participating in the STM network.

Interhemispheric Relations of the EEG Power of Cortical Potentials in the Band of 1-60 Hz during Formation and Testing of Cognitive Set to Facial Expression	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						cognitive set; facial expression; EEG; 1-20 Hz and gamma frequency bands; prestimulus periods; stages of set formation and testing	GAMMA-BAND; ORGANIZATION; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; RHYTHM	Interhemispheric relations of the EEG power in the 1-60 frequency band were studied at the stages of formation and testing of the cognitive set to facial expression. Different topographic asymmetry patterns were revealed in subjects with different set plasticity. In subjects without behavioral actualization (n = 11) of the set at the stage of set formation, EEG power in the gamma band (21-40 and 41-60 Hz) prevailed in the frontal areas of the right hemisphere, whereas the power of electrical oscillations in the bands of 2-7 and 8-13 Hz was higher also in the frontal areas but of the left hemisphere. At the stage of set testing, this basic topographical asymmetry pattern persisted. Formation of the set in subjects with pronounced actualization (n = 18) was characterized by another topographical asymmetry pattern: a significant excess of the power of gamma oscillations was observed in the posterotemporal and occipital areas of the left hemisphere, whereas the power of oscillations in the bands 2-7, 8-13, and 14-20 Hz was higher also in the posterior areas but of the right hemisphere. No asymmetry in the EEG power was observed in these subjects at the stage of set testing.	[Dumenko, V. N.; Kozlov, M. K.; Kurova, N. S.; Cheremushkin, E.

Human brain networks in health and disease	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						graph; modularity; network; small world; wiring cost	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; CORTICAL THICKNESS; ORGANIZATION; EEG; ARCHITECTURE; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS	Purpose of review Recent developments in the statistical physics of complex networks have been translated to neuroimaging data in an effort to enhance our understanding of human brain structural and functional networks. This review focuses on studies using graph theoretical measures applied to structural MRI, diffusion MRI, functional MRI, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography data. Recent findings Complex network properties have been identified with some consistency in all modalities of neuroimaging data and over a range of spatial and time scales. Conserved properties include small worldness, high efficiency of information transfer for low wiring cost, modularity, and the existence of network hubs. Structural and functional network metrics have been found to be heritable and to change with normal aging. Clinical studies, principally in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, have identified abnormalities of network configuration in patients. Future work will likely involve efforts to synthesize structural and functional networks in integrated models and to explore the interdependence of network configuration and cognitive performance. Summary Graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data is growing rapidly and could potentially provide a relatively simple but powerful quantitative framework to describe and compare whole human brain structural and functional networks under diverse experimental and clinical conditions.

Each of these signals has been tested many times, but an interesting issue seems to be to determine the relationship between them by testing them together. In this study, simultaneously recorded changes of the pupillometry and EEG signals, in response to two-color flicker stimuli was examined and compared to changes in response to single-color flicker stimuli and to a control condition without flicker stimulation. In this experiment we used red and blue colors because they have been found most effective in producing pupil responses to light, when the recently discovered activity mechanism of melanopsin is taken into consideration. The sensitivity of EEG and pupillometry spectra to flicker stimuli parameters was tested. The results which were obtained confirm the sensitivity of EEG and pupillometry to both the color and the frequency of flicker stimuli. Two-color flicker stimuli consistently produced the greatest responses. Stimuli using red-light shows longer activity areas across pupillometry power spectra than using blue-light stimuli. The values and tendency for alpha and beta rhythms for blue and red flicker stimuli are different. On the basis of our preliminary results we can conclude that flicker stimuli with long wavelengths and small frequencies can produce the most sensitivity in tests which simultaneously record pupillometry and EEG responses. The results provide some new insight into the behaviour of the pupil and the brain in respect to flicker stimuli, but further experiments and analysis are needed to conclusively establish the proposed hypothesis.

The validity of this observation-based conclusion can be rigorously tested if the basic methodological rule of investigating neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) is followed: the varying contents of Consciousness should be contrasted with invariant stimulation. We asked whether reliable gamma-band oscillations recorded from primary visual cortex appear as signatures of target awareness in metacontrast masking with invariant stimulation parameters. Surprisingly, clear target-stimuli awareness was associated with less expressed gamma power. However, because when target awareness was effectively masked more gamma power of the EEG response was found, and because this gamma-boost emerged at the post-target time when mask information was presented, we were able to explain our results as target substitution in consciousness by mask representation due to enhanced mask processing.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for the detection of SWDs, based on the key observation that SWDs are quasi-periodic signals. The method consists of the following steps: 1) calculation of the spectrogram; 2) estimation of the background spectrum and detection of stimulation artifacts; 3) harmonic analysis with continuity analysis to estimate the fundamental frequency; and 4) classification based on the percentage of power in the harmonics to the total power of the spectrum. We evaluated the performance of the novel detection method and six SWD/seizure detection methods from literature on a large database of labeled EEG data consisting of two datasets running to a total duration of more than 26 days of recording. The method outperforms all tested SWD/seizure detection methods, showing a sensitivity and selectivity of 96% and 97%, respectively, on the first test set, and a sensitivity and selectivity of 94% and 92%, respectively, on the second test set. The detection performance is less satisfactory (as for all other methods) for EEG fragments showing more irregular and less periodic SWDs.

Evoked potentials in imagery exhibited lower and delayed peaks compared to actual-movement responses, but activations in the primary and the supplementary motor area were similar. Source-modeling analysis revealed that the motor and the parietal cortex were activated similarly, but several dipole sources were active in the frontal cortex for imagery. We compared thirteen classification methods and a combination of template matching and time-frequency methods showed the highest average of 70% classification rate for all limbs.

In recent years, resting brain activity and its influence on evoked activity has become accessible for investigation. However, despite numerous studies on background and evoked activities, either observed with vascular (functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, optical) or electrophysiological (electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography) or a combination of both methods, so far, there is no generally accepted view concerning both the precise meaning of background activity and its relationship to evoked activity. In this article, we give an overview of the current knowledge on this issue and we review recent studies examining the influence of ongoing activity on behavioral responses and the relationship between ongoing and evoked activity.

EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS AS RISK MARKERS IN GENETIC MOUSE MODELS OF HIGH ALCOHOL PREFERENCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						HAP-1 mice; LAP-1 mice; C57BL/6 mice; DBA/2 mice; EEG; neuroendophenotype	CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION; HUMAN BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; RECOMBINANT INBRED MICE; GAMMA BAND RESPONSE; VISUAL ODDBALL TASK; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PREFERRING MICE; EVOKED GAMMA; HUMAN EEG; STIMULUS CHARACTERISTICS	Mouse models have been developed to simulate several relevant human traits associated with alcohol use and dependence. However, the neurophysiological substrates regulating these traits remain to be completely elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) responses can be found that distinguish high-alcohol preferring from low alcohol preferring mice that resemble differences seen in human studies of individuals with high and low risk for alcohol dependence. Recently, evidence of genes that affect event-related oscillations (EROs) and the risk for alcohol dependence has emerged, however, to date EROs have not been evaluated in genetic mouse models of high and low alcohol preference. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize EROs in mouse models of high (C57BL/6 [B6] and high alcohol preference I [HAP-1] mice) and low (DBA/2J [D2] and low alcohol preference-1 [LAP-1] mice) alcohol preference. A time-frequency representation method was used to determine delta, theta and alpha/beta ERO energy and the degree of phase variation in these mouse models. The present results suggest that the decrease in P3 amplitudes previously shown in 136 mice, compared to D2 mice, is related to reductions in evoked delta ERO energy and delta and theta phase locking. In contrast, the increase in P1 amplitudes reported in HAP-1 mice, compared to LAP-1 mice, is associated with increases in evoked theta ERO energy. These studies suggest that differences in delta and theta ERO measures in mice mirror changes observed between groups at high- and low-risk for alcoholism where changes in EROs were found to be more significant than group differences in P3 amplitudes, further suggesting that ERO measures are more stable endophenotypes in the study of alcohol dependence. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between expression of these neurophysiological endophenotypes and the genetic profile of these mouse models. (C) 2009 IBRO.

Scott			Brain coordination dynamics: True and false faces of phase synchrony and metastability	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Synchronization; Relative phase; Coordination dynamics; EEG; Alpha	EEG; NEUROSCIENCE; OSCILLATIONS; COINCIDENCE; TRANSITIONS; MEG	Understanding the coordination of multiple parts in a complex system such as the brain is a fundamental challenge. We present a theoretical model of cortical coordination dynamics that shows how brain areas may cooperate (integration) and at the same time retain their functional specificity (segregation). This model expresses a range of desirable properties that the brain is known to exhibit, including self-organization, multi-functionality, metastability and switching. Empirically, the model motivates a thorough investigation of collective phase relationships among brain oscillations in neurophysiological data. The most serious obstacle to interpreting coupled oscillations as genuine evidence of inter-areal coordination in the brain stems from volume conduction of electrical fields. Spurious coupling due to volume conduction gives rise to zero-lag (inphase) and antiphase synchronization whose magnitude and persistence obscure the subtle expression of real synchrony. Through forward modeling and the help of a novel colorimetric method. we show how true synchronization can be deciphered from continuous EEG patterns. Developing empirical efforts along the lines of continuous EEG analysis constitutes a major response to the challenge of understanding how different brain areas work together. Key predictions of cortical coordination dynamics can now be tested thereby revealing the essential modus operandi of the intact living brain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Busch, NA; Dubois, J; VanRullen, R				Busch, Niko A.; Dubois, Julien; VanRullen, Rufin			The Phase of Ongoing EEG Oscillations Predicts Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; STIMULUS ONSET; REACTION TIME; EXCITABILITY	Oscillations are ubiquitous in electrical recordings of brain activity. While the amplitude of ongoing oscillatory activity is known to correlate with various aspects of perception, the influence of oscillatory phase on perception remains unknown. In particular, since phase varies on a much faster timescale than the more sluggish amplitude fluctuations, phase effects could reveal the fine-grained neural mechanisms underlying perception. We presented brief flashes of light at the individual luminance threshold while EEG was recorded. Although the stimulus on each trial was identical, subjects detected approximately half of the flashes (hits) and entirely missed the other half (misses). Phase distributions across trials were compared between hits and misses. We found that shortly before stimulus onset, each of the two distributions exhibited significant phase concentration, but at different phase angles. This effect was strongest in the theta and alpha frequency bands. In this time-frequency range, oscillatory phase accounted for at least 16% of variability in detection performance and allowed the prediction of performance on the single-trial level. This finding indicates that the visual detection threshold fluctuates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG activity. The results support the notion that ongoing oscillations shape our perception, possibly by providing a temporal reference frame for neural codes that rely on precise spike timing.

An emerging parallelism between theta reactivity and hippocampal functional magnetic resonance imaging activation has suggested a homology between theta activity in humans and rodents, representing a process of cortico-hippocampal interaction involved in memory. In the present study, we investigated EEG reactivity during performance of a relational memory task that induces a negative hippocampal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal change, compared to a nonrelational control condition. Relational trials induced theta increases and alpha decreases. Low Resolution Electromagnetic Brain Tomography estimates localized theta and alpha modulation to frontal midline and parietal midline cortices, respectively, both of which exhibit negative BOLD responses in this task. Thus, theta and alpha dynamics are dissociable from positive BOLD activation, and may, in fact, colocalize with negative BOLD responses.	[Meltzer, Jed A.; Constable, R.

Averaged data indicated significantly reduced amplitudes in schizophrenia patients in all analyzed frequency bands, mainly at anterior locations. Single-trial analysis suggested that the amplitude reductions observed in the averaged delta, theta, and alpha response in patients originated from increased inter-trial phase variability. Gamma activity maximum amplitudes were reduced at the single-trial level. The findings imply that EEG activity in patients with schizophrenia can be characterized by multiple deficits in oscillatory networks, which indicates a disturbance in the temporal integration and interaction of all frequency components and their inter-trial variability.

Potentiation of Gamma Oscillatory Activity through Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cognition; DLPFC; EEG; gamma oscillations; rTMS; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL INHIBITION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; TASK; NEURONS; ALPHA	Neuronal oscillations in the gamma (gamma) frequency range (30-50 Hz) have been associated with cognition. Working memory (WM), a cognitive task involving the on-line maintenance and manipulation of information, elicits increases in gamma oscillations with greater cognitive demand, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The generation and modulation of gamma oscillations have been attributed to inhibitory interneuron networks that use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their principal neurotransmitter. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a non-invasive method to stimulate the cortex that has been shown to modify cognition and GABA inhibitory mechanisms, particularly with higher frequencies (ie, 10-20 Hz). We measured the effect of high-frequency rTMS applied to the DLPFC on gamma-oscillations elicited during the N-back WM task in healthy individuals. Active rTMS significantly increased gamma-oscillations generated during the N-back conditions with the greatest cognitive demand. Further, no significant changes were found in other frequency ranges, suggesting that rTMS selectively modulates gamma-oscillations in the frontal brain regions. These findings provide important insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie higher-order cognitive processes, and suggest that rTMS may be used as a cognitive enhancing strategy in neuropsychiatric disorders that suffer from cognitive deficits.

The Removal Of Ocular Artifacts From EEG Signals: A Comparison of Performances For Different Methods	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			EOG; EEG; Artifacts; LMS; ICA		The presence of electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal is a major problem in the study of brain potentials. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to reject these artifacts including methods based on regression and blind source separation (BSS) techniques. None of them has so far been established as the method of choice. In the present study, the performances of five widely used EOG artifact rejection techniques are compared. The compared methodologies include two fully automated regression methods, one based on Least Mean Square (LMS) for its optimization process, and the other on Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm, two BSS techniques which use respectively the Extended Independent Component Analysis (ext - ICA) and the Second Order Blind Identification (SOBI), and finally a time-varying adaptive algorithm based on H-infinity principles (H-infinity - TV). Each algorithm was applied in real EEG data and then their performance quantified in the time domain. The performance of RLS and H-infinity - TV were poor in removing eye - blink artifacts. For the rest of the methods the results supported the use of LMS technique and suggested the need for further research examining the performance of various artifact rejection techniques in both time and frequency domain.

In this article, we propose a time-frequency functional model for a family of time series indexed by a set of covariates. This model can be used to compare groups Of time series ill terms of the patterns of stochastic variation and to estimate the covariate effects. We focus our development on locally stationary time series and propose the covariate-indexed locally stationary setting, which include stationary processes as special cases. We use smoothing spline ANOVA models for the time-frequency coefficients. A two-stage procedure is introduced for estimation. To reduce the computational demand, we develop all equivalent state space model to the proposed model with ail efficient algorithm. We also propose a new Simulation method to generate replicated time series from their design spectra. An epileptic intracranial electroencephalogram (IEEG) dataset is analyzed for illustration.

The main goal of the system, based on electroencephalogram (EEC) recordings, is to create mechanical action from brain activity. Experimental work presented in this paper outlines the operation of a system which is based on a tuneable continuous-time bandpass Sigma Delta modulator used to detect the frequency signature of SSVEP waveforms. Simple time-frequency-space domain signal analysis methods are employed to generate the electrical control-signal, sufficient to control a robotic motion.

A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme playing an important role in cortical dopamine metabolism, causes a common substitution of methionine (Met) for valine (Val) at codon 158 of COMT protein. Val allele homozygotes exhibit higher COMT activity and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal cortex than Met/Met homozygotes. Evidence suggests that this polymorphism affects executive functions in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that it also modulates functional aspects of EEG in wakefulness and sleep. EEG recordings were conducted twice on separate occasions in 10 Val/Val and 12 Met/Met allele carriers (all men) in wakefulness, and in baseline and recovery sleep before and after 40 h prolonged waking. During sleep deprivation, subjects received placebo and modafinil in randomized, cross-over manner. We show that the Val158Met polymorphism predicts stable and frequency-specific, inter-individual variation in brain alpha oscillations. alpha peak frequency in wakefulness was 1.4 Hz slower in Val/Val genotype than in Met/Met genotype. Moreover, Val/Val allele carriers exhibited less 11-13 Hz activity than Met/Met homozygotes in wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep. This difference was resistant against the effects of sleep deprivation and modafinil. The data demonstrate that mechanisms involving COMT contribute to interindividual differences in brain alpha oscillations, which are functionally related to executive performance such as counting tendency on a random number generation task in young adults.

Inter- and intra-individual covariations of hemodynamic and oscillatory gamma responses in the human cortex	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						gamma-band response; EEG; fMRI; gamma trait; 40 Hz; BOLD	RESONANCE-IMAGING SIGNAL; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EARLY EVOKED GAMMA; BAND ACTIVITY; BOLD FMRI; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TEMPORAL-LOBE	The time course of local field potentials (LFPs) displaying typical discharge frequencies in the gamma frequency range highly correlates with the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in response to rotating checkerboard stimuli in animals. In humans, oscillatory gamma-band responses (GBRs) show strong inter-individual variations in frequency and amplitude but considerable intra-individual reliability indicating that individual gamma activity reflects a personal trait. While the functional role of these GBRs is still debated, investigations combining electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) measurements provide a tool to obtain further insights into the underlying functional architecture of the human brain and will shed light onto the understanding of the dynamic relation between the BOLD signal and the properties of the electrical activity recorded on the scalp. We investigated the relation between the hemodynamic response and evoked gamma-band response (eGBR) to visual stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that the amplitude of human eGBRs and BOLD responses covary intra-individually as a function of stimulation as well as inter-individually as a function of gamma-trait. Seventeen participants performed visual discrimination tasks during separate EEG and fMRI recordings. Results revealed that visual stimuli that evoked high GBRs also elicited strong BOLD responses in the human V1/V2 complex. Furthermore, inter-individual variations of BOLD responses to visual stimuli in the bilateral primary (Area 17) and secondary (Area V5/MT) visual cortex and the right hippocampal formation were correlated with the individual gamma-trait of the subjects. The present study further supports the notion that neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range are involved in the cascade of neural processes that underlie the hemodynamic responses measured with fMRI.

Electroencephalographic correlates of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; TWINS DISCORDANT; ALPHA-RHYTHM; EEG; FIBROMYALGIA; GENERATION; SYMPTOMS	Background: Unremitting fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, hallmark traits of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), are also pathognomonic of sleep disorders. Yet, no reproducible perturbations of sleep architecture, multiple sleep latency times or Epworth Sleepiness Scores are found to be associated consistently with CFS. This led us to hypothesize that sleep homeostasis, rather than sleep architecture, may be perturbed in CFS. To probe this hypothesis, we measured and compared EEG frequencies associated with restorative sleep between persons with CFS and matched controls, both derived from a population-based sample. Methods: We evaluated overnight polysomnography (PSG) in 35 CFS and 40 control subjects. PSG records were manually scored and epochs containing artifact removed. Fast Fourier Transformation was utilized to deconstruct individual EEG signals into primary frequency bands of alpha, delta, theta, sigma, and beta frequency domains. The spectral power of each frequency domain for each sleep state was compared between persons with CFS and matched controls. Results: In persons with CFS, delta power was diminished during slow wave sleep, but elevated during both stage 1 and REM. Alpha power was reduced during stage 2, slow wave, and REM sleep. Those with CFS also had significantly lower theta, sigma, and beta spectral power during stage 2, Slow Wave Sleep, and REM. Discussion: Employing quantitative EEG analysis we demonstrate reduced spectral power of cortical delta activity during SWS. We also establish reduced spectral power of cortical alpha activity, with the greatest reduction occurring during REM sleep. Reductions in theta, beta, and sigma spectral power were also apparent. Conclusion: Unremitting fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, the waking manifestations of CFS, may be the consequence of impaired sleep homeostasis rather than a primary sleep disorder.

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis emerges as a promising diagnostic tool. Entropy and long-range fractal correlation are decreased in premature infants with proven sepsis. Besides this, respiration and its relations to HRV appear to be less. The objective of this study was to determine if analysis of time-frequency correlations between the heart rate and respiration amplitude may help for the diagnosis of infection in premature infants. An estimator of the linear relationship between nonstationary signals, recently introduced, is explored. The tests were performed on a cohort study of 60 premature infants. The results show that the correlation in the low,frequency band tended to be higher in the sepsis group.

Spatial memory was characterized using a novel cognitive test. A decrease in low-frequency theta band oscillations in the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex was observed. The mean coefficient of EEG cross-correlation between these structures was significantly reduced at the early stage of A beta(25-35) action both in adult and aged rats. In addition, we found that one month after A beta(25-35) injection spatial memory was impaired. These results suggest that the decrease in low-frequency theta band oscillations and the weakening of binding between the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex under the action of A beta(25-35) may be an underlying cause of the typical memory breakdown associated with the Alzheimer's disease.

Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: University hospital-based sleep research laboratory. Participants: Thirteen normotensive subjects with chronic primary insomnia (9 women, 42 +/- 7 y) and 13 sex- and age-matched good sleepers. Measurements and results: Subjects underwent 2-week sleep diary and 3 sleep studies to provide subjective and objective sleep variables, and 24-h beat-to-beat BP recording to provide daytime, night-time and day-to-night BP changes ([nighttime-daytime]/daytime)(star)100) (BP dipping). Spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was also performed during sleep of night 3 to assess EEG activity in the beta frequency (16-32 Hz), a measure of brain cortical activation. Nighttime SBP was higher (111 +/- 15 vs 102 +/- 12 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and day-tonight SBP dipping was lower (-8% +/- 6% vs -15% +/- 5%, P < 0.01) in insomniacs than good sleepers. Insomniacs also had higher activity in EEG beta frequency (P < 0.05). Higher nighttime SBP and smaller SBP dipping were independently associated with increased EEG beta activity (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Higher nighttime SBP and blunted day-to-night SBP dipping are present in normotensive subjects with chronic insomnia and are associated with a hyperactivity of the central nervous system during sleep. An altered BP profile in insomniacs could be one mechanism implicated in the link between insomnia and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality documented in epidemiological studies.

Generation and control of cortical gamma: findings from simulation at two scales	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Gamma activity; Synchronous oscillation; Cortical self-regulation; EEG	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONOUS OSCILLATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL CORRELATION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; NETWORKS	A continuum model of electrocortical activity was applied separately at centimetric and macrocolumnar scales, permitting analysis of interaction between scales. State equations included effects of retrograde action potential propagation in dendritic trees, and kinetics of AMPA, GABA and NMDA receptors. Parameter values were provided from independent physiological and anatomical estimates. Realistic field potentials and pulse rates were obtained, including resonances in the alpha/theta and gamma ranges, 1/f(2) background activity, and autonomous gamma activity. Zero-lag synchrony and travelling waves occurred as complementary aspects of cortical transmission, and lead/lag relations between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations varied systematically around transition to autonomous gamma oscillation. Properties of the simulations can account for generation and control of gamma activity. All factors acting on excitatory/inhibitory balance controlled the onset and offset of gamma oscillation. Autonomous gamma was initiated by focal excitation of excitatory cells, and suppressed by laterally spreading transcortical excitation, which acted on both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. Consequently, although spatially extensive non-specific reticular activation tended to suppress autonomous gamma, spatial variation Of reticular activation could preferentially select fields of synchrony.

Brain oscillations: pathophysiological and therapeutic role in some neurological and psychiatric diseases	ANALES DEL SISTEMA SANITARIO DE NAVARRA			Spanish	Article						Oscillations; Basal ganglia; Parkinson's disease; Epilepsy; Schizophrenia	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; DEPENDENT CHANGES	The terms "oscillations" or "oscillatory activity" are frequently used not only to define the rhythmic fluctuations of the postsynaptic potentials of a neuronal group (local field potentials) or a cortical region (EEG, MEG), but also to indicate the rhythmic discharge pattern of action potentials from a neuron or a small group of neurons. Oscillatory activity makes possible the synchronization of different neuronal groups from nearby or distant cortical regions that participate in the same motor, sensory or cognitive task. The presence of oscillatory activity is usually associated to the existence of synchronization, but both phenomena are not necessarily always equivalent. Abnormalities of oscillatory activities or synchronization within or between different brain structures have been described in several neurological and psychiatric diseases; these abnormalities might play a relevant pathophysiological role in Parkinson's disease (and other movement disorders), schizophrenia or epilepsy. This review discusses all these aspects, with emphasis on their potential role both as a basic mechanism in brain function and as a pathophysiological Substrate for some of the symptoms and signs observed in several diseases.

EEG Frequency-Amplitude Characteristics of Successful Recognition of Emotion in Speech	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						EEG; emotions; recognition of emotion in speech	PERFORMANCE; STRESS; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; GAMMA	Psychophysiological mechanisms of perception of speech emotional expression were I studied. Comparison of EEG between 2 extreme groups (with high and low indexes of) identification of emotional intonation) revealed significant differences in frequency-amplitude characteristics of brain electrical activity. Two general conclusions can be made from the data obtained. Firstly, the subjects with low identification rates show a higher brain activation and reactivity both during the emotion identification task and at rest as compared to the subjects with high identification rates. Secondly, the data reveal specific activation within the right posterior temporal cortex. Therefore, high initial cortical activation and more pronounced EEG reactivity impede recognition of emotion in speech.	[Kislova, O. O.; Rusalova, M.

J	Igumnov, S				Igumnov, Sergey			The brain bioelectric activity of the Belarusian persons irradiated in utero as a result of Chernobyl accident	ACTIVITAS NERVOSA SUPERIOR REDIVIVA			English	Article						children; irradiated prenatal brain; EEG formation; dominant amplitude and activity; cerebral assymetry		OBJECTIVE: The study examined the formation of bioelectric activity (BEA) of the brain of 250 children at the age of 6-7, 10-12 and 15-16 years from regions highly contaminated by Chernobyl fallout, who were irradiated in the prenatal period at the time of the Chernobyl accident in 1986. These children were compared with a control group of 250 children of the same age from non-contaminated areas of Belarus. METHODS: The examination included visual and computerized analysis of EEG as well as psychiatric examination and assessment of intellectual level. RESULTS: In the both groups of children at the age of 6-7 the dominant were the variants of age norms (46.4% vs 44.8%; p=0.592) and synchronized (borderline) EEG ( 26.4% vs 28.0%; P=0.763). Quite noticeable was the relevant frequency of the slow type of EEG (19.2% vs 18.4%; p=0.820) as well as paroxysmal activity (8.0% vs 8.8%; p=0.830) in the both groups. At the age of 15-16 in the both groups we registered relevant decrease of index of theta- and delta-activity. The slow type of EEG in most cases was transformed into the age norm and synchronized type of EEG. The correlation analysis showed that the intellectual level of children (IQ) estimated by Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-III) was in the direct proportion to spectral power of alpha-diapason in frontal lobes of the brain (r=0.38 in the both groups). Mental deficiency of children of the both groups was accompanied by the decreased level of the coherency of alpha-diapason. When comparing the results of BEA research with the dosimetric data we found no relevant correlation of these indices. The children with different EEG types did not demonstrate any relevant differences of medium doses of antenatal exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The revealed changes of BEA of the brain show distinct age dependency. Their frequency in the cohort of persons exposed to antenatal irradiation did not have relevant differences from that in control group.

Individual differences in these three measures were examined in 531 adult twins and siblings. Heritability of the SCP at occipital-parietal leads varied from 30% to 43%. Heritability of upper alpha synchronization (35% to 65%) and theta desynchronization (31% to 50%) was significant at all leads. Theta desynchronization and upper alpha synchronization were significantly correlated (r similar to 43%), but SCP was not correlated with either. The effect of working memory load on all three measures was not heritable. Response anticipation reliably evokes an SCP, upper alpha synchronization and theta desynchronization, but variation in these measures reflects different (genetic) sources.	[Smit, Dirk J.

J	Phillips, S; Takeda, Y				Phillips, Steven; Takeda, Yuji			Greater frontal-parietal synchrony at low gamma-band frequencies for inefficient than efficient visual search in human EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Synchrony; Phase-locking; Visual search; Gamma-band	ATTENTION; BRAIN	In a study on monkeys, [Buschman, T.J., Miller, EX, 2007. Top-down versus bottom-up control of attention in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Science 315 (5820),1860-1862.] reported more frontal-parietal neuronal synchrony in a low gamma-band (22-34 Hz) for inefficient than efficient visual search, but a reverse effect in a higher gamma-band (36-56 Hz). We examine whether this difference in top-down versus bottom-up influence on visual search also occurs in humans using scalp EEG. Ten participants identified the location of a target item (coloured, oriented rectangular bar) in search displays also containing similar distractors. For the efficient search condition, in which response time was less dependent on set size (two or four items), distractors had no feature in common with the target. For the inefficient search condition, in which response time increased with set size, distractors shared one feature with the target. Analysis of phase-locking values revealed significantly greater synchronization between frontal-parietal electrode pairs in the lower frequency band around 160-480 ms post-stimulus for inefficient search. No significant difference was observed in the higher frequency band. These results partly correspond to [Buschman, T.J., Miller, EX, 2007. Top-down versus bottom-up control of attention in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Science 315 (5820), 1860-1862.]. suggesting that top-down control is mediated by neuronal synchrony at lower frequencies. The failure to observe a bottom-up effect may be due to stimulus familiarity - monkeys require weeks of training in contrast to the few minutes given to humans. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Sleep spindles; AM/FM signals; Instantaneous envelope; Instantaneous frequency; Biomarkers; Dementia	TOPOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; EXTRACTION; WAVELET	The time-varying microstructure of sleep EEG spindles may have clinical significance in dementia studies and can be quantified with a number of techniques. In this paper, real and simulated sleep spindles were regarded as AM/FM signals modeled by six parameters that define the instantaneous envelope (IE) and instantaneous frequency (IF) waveforms for a sleep spindle. These parameters were estimated using four different methods, namely the Hilbert transform (HT), complex demodulation (CD), matching pursuit (IMP) and wavelet transform (WT). The average error in estimating these parameters was lowest for HT, higher but still less than 10% for CD and MP, and highest (greater than 10%) for WT. The signal distortion induced by the use of a given method was greatest in the case of HT and IMP. These two techniques would necessitate the removal of about 0.4 s from the spindle data, which is an important limitation for the case of spindles with duration less than I s. Although the CD method may lead to a higher error than HT and MP, it requires a removal of only about 0.23 s of data. An application of this sleep spindle parameterization via the CD method is proposed, in search of efficient EEG-based biomarkers in dementia. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed parameterization may be promising, since it can quantify specific differences in IE and IF characteristics between sleep spindles from dementia subjects and those from aged controls.

At rest, a power enhancement and a significant phase-locking of the electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillation in the beta/gamma range (25-35 Hz) are related to the emergence of the N30. The latter was also perfectly identified in presence of pure phase-locking situation. Here, we investigated the contribution of these rhythmic activities to the specific gating of the N30 component during movement. We demonstrated that concomitant execution of finger movement of the stimulated hand impinges such temporal concentration of the ongoing beta/gamma EEG oscillations and abolishes the N30 component throughout their large topographical extent on the scalp. This also proves that the phase-locking phenomenon is one of the main actors for the N30 generation. These findings could be explained by the involvement of neuronal populations of the sensorimotor cortex and other related areas, which are unable to respond to the phasic sensory activation and to phase-lock their firing discharges to the external sensory input during the movement. This new insight into the contribution of phase-locked oscillation in the emergence of the N30 and in its gating behavior calls for a reappraisal of fundamental and clinical interpretation of the frontal N30 component.

EEG cortical measures (delta, theta, alpha, and gamma) were recorded, during viewing IAPS figures, that varied in terms of pleasantness and arousal. Withdrawal (BIS system) and appetitive (BAS system) behaviour showed opposite patterns of subjective responses. Also, a specific frontal network was found to be responsive to the relevance of emotional cues. Moreover an increased response for high arousing (negative and positive) stimuli in comparison with low arousing and neutral stimuli was found within the left and right frontal areas. Specifically delta and theta band have a significant role in monitoring the attentional significance of emotions. Finally, the effects of subjective evaluation and individual differences were discussed at light of the two-dimensional model of emotion processing, that is the valence and the arousing power of emotional cues.

The Visual Evoked Potential is independent of surface alpha rhythm phase	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN DYNAMICS; RESET; EEG; PRESTIMULUS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; GENERATION; RESPONSES	A Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is an electrical signal picked up by a surface electrode in response to the activation of visual cortex by a visual stimulus. Because the VEP is typically much smaller in magnitude than the ongoing spontaneous EEG signal, the VEP is derived by averaging a large number of responses time-locked to stimulus presentation. Standard theory has it that the VEP is independent of the ongoing EEG, however, there has long been a competing view that the VEP is caused by a partial phase reset of the spontaneous alpha rhythm. We calculated the VEP where stimuli were presented at four different phases of the ongoing alpha rhythm, and subtracted away the responses to null trials synchronized to the same alpha rhythm phases, creating estimates of the VEP as a function of ongoing alpha rhythm phase. For some subjects there was evidence of an interaction between the VEP and the phase of the ongoing alpha rhythm, but this was idiosyncratic between subjects and conditions, and mostly evident in a later period when the VEP magnitude was very small. However, in general the VEP is independent of the phase of the ongoing alpha rhythm, and hence cannot be primarily caused by a partial phase resetting of the spontaneous EEG. It is possible that the VEP is either a phase-reset of an ongoing oscillation, or an oscillation induced by the sudden onset of a stimulus, but it cannot be the same oscillation as the surface alpha.

An unexpected role for TASK-3 potassium channels in network oscillations with implications for sleep mechanisms and anesthetic action	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						EEG; knockout; REM; theta; wavelet	CEREBELLAR GRANULE NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM; GENERAL-ANESTHETICS; VOLATILE ANESTHETICS; MOVEMENT SELECTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FAST INHIBITION; FIELD ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; K+ CHANNELS	TASK channels are acid-sensitive and anesthetic-activated members of the family of two-pore-domain potassium channels. We have made the surprising discovery that the genetic ablation of TASK-3 channels eliminates a specific type of theta oscillation in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) resembling type II theta (4-9 Hz), which is thought to be important in processing sensory stimuli before initiating motor activity. In contrast, ablation of TASK-1 channels has no effect on theta oscillations. Despite the absence of type II theta oscillations in the TASK-3 knockout (KO) mice, the related type I theta, which has certain neuronal pathways in common and is involved in exploratory behavior, is unaffected. In addition to the absence of type II theta oscillations, the TASK-3 KO animals show marked alterations in both anesthetic sensitivity and natural sleep behavior. Their sensitivity to halothane, a potent activator of TASK channels, is greatly reduced, whereas their sensitivity to cyclopropane, which does not activate TASK-3 channels, is unchanged. The TASK-3 KO animals exhibit a slower progression from their waking to sleeping states and, during their sleeping period, their sleep episodes as well as their REM theta oscillations are more fragmented. These results imply a previously unexpected role for TASK-3 channels in the cellular mechanisms underlying these behaviors and suggest that endogenous modulators of these channels may regulate theta oscillations.

However, ballistocardiographic artifacts along with ocular artifacts are a major obstacle for the detection of the EEG signatures of interest. Since the sources corresponding to these artifacts are independent from those producing the EEG signatures, we applied the Infomax-based independent component analysis (ICA) technique to separate the EEG signatures from the artifacts. The isolated EEG signatures were further utilized to model the canonical hemodynamic response functions (HRFs). Subsequently, the brain areas from which these EEG signatures originated were identified as locales of activation patterns from the analysis of fMRI data. Upon the identification and subsequent evaluation of brain areas generating interictal epileptic discharge (IED) spikes from an epileptic subject, the presented method was successfully applied to detect the theta and alpha rhythms that are sleep onset-related EEG signatures along with the subsequent neural circuitries from a sleep-deprived volunteer. These results suggest that the ICA technique may be useful for the preprocessing of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, especially when a reference paradigm is unavailable.

The separation and identification of such components could not only serve diagnostic purposes, but also facilitate the design of brain-computer interface systems. However, the effective analysis of components is hindered by many factors including the complexity of the EEG signal and its variation over the trials. In this paper we study several measures for the identification of the nature of independent components and address the means for efficient decomposition of the rich information content embedded in the multi-channel EEC recordings associated with the multiple trials of an event-related experiment.

The aim is to apply artifact correction whenever possible in order to lose a minimum of data, and to identify the remaining artifacts so as not take them into account during the sleep stage classification. Nine procedures were implemented to minimize cardiac interference and slow ondulations, and to detect muscle artifacts, failing electrode, 50/60Hz main interference, saturations, highlights abrupt transitions, EOG interferences and artifacts in EOG. Detection methods were developed in the time domain as well as in the frequency domain, using adjustable parameters. A database of 20 excerpts of polysomnographic sleep recordings scored in artifacts by an expert was available for developing (excerpts 1 to 10) and testing (excerpts 11 to 20) the automatic artifact detection algorithms. We obtained a global agreement rate of 96.06%, with sensitivity and specificity of 83.67% and 96.47% respectively.

Whereas most studies focus on averaged raw EEG responses, this study considers oscillatory events within EEG of single trials, which leads to various new insights. We recorded EEG signals before, during and after stimulation by a flickering square of light in medium (16 Hz) and high frequency (32 Hz) ranges. Similar oscillatory bursts, to those observed in spontaneous EEG, can be found in single-trial synchrony of steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). These bursts are extracted from the EEG of single trials using bump modeling. Stochastic event synchrony method is applied to those events, which quantifies synchronies of oscillatory bursts on a large-scale basis. Those oscillatory patterns have a significantly higher degree of co-occurrence during SSVEP, uncorrelated with ongoing signal synchrony. It means that EEG oscillatory patterns are presumably an outcome of brain activity, rather than a mere side effect of ongoing EEG.

Ovarian hormones and the brain signals	ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						Alpha; Beta; Theta; Delta; EEG; Estrogen and Progesterone	RHYTHMS	Many clinical studies of biological signals reveal correlation between the effect of estrogen, progesterone and brain signals captured in the form of Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta by Electro Encephalography (EEG) recordings. It is known that there is significant and sustained changes in the levels of sex hormones that may have profound effect on brain functioning leading to changes in mood, memory and learning in women. The theta oscillations are involved with the memory encoding processes and anxiety; the alpha oscillations are associated with memory processing, whereas beta and delta pertain to attention. The release of the estrogen and progesterone hormones is divided into three phases that is premenstrual, menstrual and postmenstrual states. The frequency patterns of the brain signal and hormones are reported to be correlated. We have reviewed the use of EEG recordings in interpreting the variations in estrogen and progesterone level with the purpose of highlighting the area for further research. This technique can also be applied to study other biological signals, their frequencies and relative phases.	[Gawali, B. W.; Rokade, P. B.; Janvale, G. B.; Mehrotra, S.

The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of focal electroencephalographic discharges with or without clinical evidence in children with CAE and to explore the clinical course in patients with two types of epileptic seizures: simple absences and partial seizures. Patients and methods: During a 10-year period (1998-2008) we treated and followed-up 66 patients (35 girls and 31 boy), from 1.8 to 13 years of age (median age 6.7 years) with typical absences. Average duration of clinical follow-up was five years. Results: In 11/66 (16, 7%) children with CAE focal EEG discharges revealed changes identical to those in benign partial epilepsies (BPE). Five of 11 patients also manifested partial seizures indicative of Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) (4 children), or benign partial epilepsy with occipital paroxyms - of the Gastaut type (1 patient). The age of children at the time of the first partial beginning of seizure was 1.7 - 11 years. In three children BPE attacks proceeded, and in two they began simultaneously or after the beginning of the absences. In all patients absence seizure control was achieved inside six weeks to 11 months. Focal EEG discharges disappeared in 7/11 patients, in four they are still present, but without relapse of partial seizures. Conclusion: Although the relationship between partial and generalized seizures in the same patient can be coincidental, the possibility of genetic linkage cannot be excluded and further investigation is needed. Detailed analysis of clinical and electroencephalographic feautres, the results of treatment and establishment of long-term prognosis in patients with focal electroencephalographic changes with or without clinically evident partial seizures characteristic for BPE and generalized changes characteristic for CAE, could lead its to the definition of the specific form of CAE.

Glucose Metabolism on PET Correlates with the Underlying Cortical Oscillations in Pediatric Epilepsy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH ASIAN & OCEANIAN CONGRESS OF CHILD NEUROLOGY - AOCCN			English	Proceedings Paper	10th Asian and Oceanian Congress of Child Neurology/32nd Congress of the Korean-Child-Neurology-Society	JUN 10-13, 2009	Daegu, SOUTH KOREA	Korean Child Neurol Soc			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FOCAL EPILEPSY; SLEEP; EEG	We recently conducted two studies to determine how well cortical glucose metabolism on interictal glucose metabolism PET was correlated with the underlying cortical oscillations on intracranial electrocorticography in children with focal epilepsy. We found that glucose metabolism was negatively correlated with the amplitude of delta-oscillations as well as the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges in children with tuberous sclerosis complex. We also found that glucose metabolism was positively correlated with the amplitude of gamma-oscillations in children with nonlesional focal epilepsy. These observations support the hypotheses that gamma oscillations derived from physiological and pathological neuronal activities are associated with increased glucose metabolism, whereas delta slowing is associated with decreased metabolism. Association between frequent interictal spikes and decreased glucose metabolism may be attributed to delta components following spike discharges.

We present a complete explanation of the transition from inter-ictal activity to spike and wave using a combination of bifurcation theory, numerical continuation and techniques for detecting the occurrence of inflection points in systems of delay differential equations (DDEs). We demonstrate that the initial transition to oscillatory behaviour occurs as a result of a Hopf bifurcation, whereas the addition of spikes arises as a result of an inflection point of the vector field. Strikingly these findings are consistent with EEG data recorded from patients with absence seizures and we present a discussion of the clinical significance of these results, suggesting potential new techniques for detection and anticipation of seizures.

High-frequency oscillations mirror disease activity in patients with epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTERICTAL SPIKES; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; SUBDURAL EEG; 100-500 HZ; SEIZURES; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS	Objective: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded in epileptic patients with clinical intracranial EEG. HFOs have been associated with seizure genesis because they occur in the seizure focus and during seizure onset. HFOs are also found interictally, partly co-occurring with epileptic spikes. We studied how HFOs are influenced by antiepileptic medication and seizure occurrence, to improve understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical meaning of HFOs. Methods: Intracerebral depth EEG was partly sampled at 2,000 Hz in 42 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with five or more usable nights of recording were selected. A sample of slow-wave sleep from each night was analyzed, and HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) and spikes were identified on all artifact-free channels. The HFOs and spikes were compared before and after seizures with stable medication dose and during medication reduction with no intervening seizures. Results: Twelve patients with five to eight nights were included. After seizures, there was an increase in spikes, whereas HFO rates remained the same. Medication reduction was followed by an increase in HFO rates and mean duration. Conclusions: Contrary to spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) do not increase after seizures, but do so after medication reduction, similarly to seizures. This implies that spikes and HFOs have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and that HFOs are more tightly linked to seizures than spikes. HFOs seem to play an important role in seizure genesis and can be a useful clinical marker for disease activity.

The neurological background of ssMRPs is briefly reviewed. Averaged ssMRPs represent the development of a lateralized rhythmic potential, and the energy of the EEG signals at the finger tapping frequency can be used for single-trial ssMRP classification. The proposed ssMRP-based BCI approach is tested using the classic Fisher's linear discriminant classifier. Moreover, the influence of the current source density transform on the performance of BCI system is investigated. The averaged correct classification rates (CCRs) as well as averaged information transfer rates (ITRs) for different sliding time windows are reported. Reliable single-trial classification rates of 88%-100% accuracy are achievable at relatively high ITRs. Furthermore, we have been able to achieve CCRs of up to 93% in classification of the ssMRPs recorded during imagined rhythmic finger movements. The merit of this approach is in the application of rhythmic cues for BCI, the relatively simple recording setup, and straightforward computations that make the real-time implementations plausible.

Studying this trait helps to learn about mechanisms of epileptogenicity. While simultaneous recordings of EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) in patients with spontaneous generalised spike-wave discharges (GSW) have revealed activation of the thalamus and deactivation in frontoparietal areas, EEG-fMRI studies on evoked GSW such as PPR are lacking. In this EEG-fMRI study, 30 subjects with reported generalised PPR underwent intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) in a 3 T MR scanner. PPR was elicited in 6 subjects, four diagnosed with idiopathic generalised epilepsy and two with tension-type headache. Because PPR is preceded by synchronization of cortical gamma oscillations, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were analysed at the onset of the PPR (standard regressor) and 3 s before the onset of PPR (early regressor) in one model. In all subjects, IPS led to a significant activation of the visual cortex. Based on the early regressor, PPR associated activation was found in the parietal cortex adjacent to the intraparietal sulcus in five and in the premotor cortex in all 6 subjects. The standard regressor revealed deactivation in early activated areas in all subjects and thalamic activation in one subject. In contrast to spontaneous GSW, these results suggest that PPR is a cortical phenomenon with an involvement of the parietal and frontal cortices. Pronounced haemodynamic changes seen with the early regressor could mirror gamma activity that is known to precede PPR. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To explore the possible effects of EEG derivations, an automatic computer method was established and confirmed by agreement analysis between the computer and two independent raters, and four fronto-parietal bipolar leads were compared for sleep scoring in rats. The results demonstrated that different bipolar electrodes have significantly different sleep-staging accuracies, and that the optimal frontal electrode for sleep scoring is located at the anterior midline.

J	Rothenberger, A				Rothenberger, Aribert			Brain oscillations forever - neurophysiology in future research of child psychiatric problems	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Neurophysiology; children; EEG; brain oscillations; computational neuropsychiatry	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; ALPHA-RHYTHM; EEG; ANNOTATION; FREQUENCY; PHASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COMORBIDITY; PATTERNS	For decades neurophysiology has successfully contributed to research and clinical care in child psychiatry. Recently, methodological progress has led to a revival of interest in brain oscillations (i.e., a band of periodic neuronal frequencies with a wave-duration from milliseconds to several seconds which may code and decode information). These oscillations will nurture future information processing research during normal and pathological brain development, allowing us to investigate basic neuronal connectivity as well as interactions of brain systems and their modulation (e.g., by temporal neuronal synchronisation) as close correlates of behaviour and intermediate phenotypes from genes to behavioural variations. Especially, a systematic neurodynamic look at transitional processes from rest to stimulus-triggered goal-directed performance will aid behavioural understanding and guidance of children. Preliminary data suggest two separate oscillatory mechanisms in this respect. One is ongoing from pre- to post-stimulus processing and related to quantitative modification of behaviour, while another is merely related to qualitative effects of behaviour and reflects 'on-top' post-stimulus processing by temporal neuronal synchronisation of the oscillatory network in question. Suggested neurodynamic models may be tested in multilevel clinical experiments as well as in the framework of computational neuropsychiatry.

J	Aru, J; Bachmann, T				Aru, Jaan; Bachmann, Talis			Occipital EEG correlates of conscious awareness when subjective target shine-through and effective visual masking are compared: Bifocal early increase in gamma power and speed-up of P1	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Masking; Awareness; Neural correlate; Consciousness; Gamma oscillations; Perceptual facilitation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; THALAMIC INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX V1; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; ACTIVATION; FREQUENCY; OBJECT	Neural correlates of conscious awareness can be comfortably studied when awareness of the target stimuli is a varying dependent variable in the experimental conditions where the key independent variables are kept invariant. We presented vernier targets backward masked by an invariant grating with invariant SOA. EEG data recorded from occipital and parietal electrodes was analyzed for ERPs and time-frequency functions of oscillatory responses. Comparison of data from correct aware trials with data from correct unaware trials showed that conscious awareness of targets was associated with decrease in the latency of ERP/P1, increase in the amplitude of P300, and increase in the power of 70-Hz and 30-Hz gamma band oscillations from SO ms before target onset up to 100 ms after target onset. Results are interpreted in the context of the well-known views about the role of brain-activity oscillations in conscious awareness and as related to the perceptual retouch theory.

EEG data from an eyes-closed emotion imagination task were linearly decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA) into maximally independent component (IC) processes. Joint decomposition of IC log spectrograms into source-and frequency-independent modulator (IM) processes revealed three distinct classes of IMs that separately modulated broadband high-frequency (similar to 15-200 Hz) power of brain, scalp muscle, and likely ocular motor IC processes. Multi-dimensional scaling revealed significant but spatially complex relationships between mean broadband brain IM effects and the valence of the imagined emotions. Thus, contrary to prevalent assumption, unitary modes of spectral modulation of frequencies encompassing the beta, gamma, and high gamma frequency ranges can be isolated from scalp-recorded EEG data and may be differentially associated with brain sources and cognitive activities.

Thus far, the fastest and more accurate control of neuroprostheses is achieved through direct recordings of neural activity [Nicolelis, M.A., 2001. Actions from thoughts. Nature 409, 403-407; Donoghue, J.P., 2002. Connecting cortex to machines: recent advances in brain interfaces. Nat. Neurosci. 5 (Suppl.), 1085-1088]. However, invasive recordings have inherent medical risks. Here we discuss some approaches that could enhance the speed and accuracy of non-invasive devices, namely, (1) enlarging the spectral analysis to include higher frequency oscillations, able to transmit substantial information over short analysis windows; (2) using spectral analysis procedures that minimize the variance of the estimates: and (3) transforming EEG recorded activity into local field potential estimates (eLFP). Theoretical and experimental arguments are used to explain why it is erroneous to think that scalp EEG cannot sense high frequency oscillations and how this might hinders further developments. We further illustrate how non-invasive eLFPs derived from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) can be combined with robust, broad band spectral analysis to accurately detect (off-line) the laterality of upcoming hand movements. Interestingly, the use of pattern recognition to select the brain voxels differentially engaged by the explored tasks leads to sound neural activation images. Consequently, our results indicate that both research lines, i.e., neuroprosthetics and electrical neuroimaging, might effectively benefit from their mutual interaction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

EEG data for subjects with epilepsy were acquired during the covert object naming tasks using a net of 256 electrodes. The trials required each subject to provide the names of common objects presented every 4 seconds on slides. Each trial comprised the 1.0 second before and 3.0 seconds after initial object presentation. PSDt values at baseline and during tasks were calculated in the theta, alpha, beta, low gamma, and high gamma bands. The spatial contour plots reveal that PSDt values during object naming were 10-20% higher than the baseline values for different bands. Language was lateralized to left frontal or temporal areas. In all cases, the Wada test disclosed language lateralization to the left hemisphere as well. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To examine predictors and the prognostic value of electrographic seizures (ESZs) and periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) in medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients without a primary acute neurologic condition. Design: Retrospective study. Setting. MICU in a university hospital. Patients. A total of 201 consecutive patients admitted to the MICU between July 2004 and January 2007 without known acute neurologic injury and who underwent continuous electroencephalography monitoring (cEEG) for investigation of possible seizures or changes in mental status. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results. Median time from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to cEEG was I day (interquartile range 1-4). The majority of patients (60%) had sepsis as the primary admission diagnosis and 48% were comatose at the time of cEEG. Ten percent (n = 21) of patients had ESZs, 17% (n = 34) had PEDs, 5% (n = 10) had both, and 22% (n = 45) had either ESZs or PEDs. Seizures during cEEG were purely electrographic (no detectable clinical correlate) in the majority (67%) of patients. Patients with sepsis had a higher rate of ESZs or PEDs than those without sepsis (32% vs. 9%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, sepsis at ICU admission was the only significant predictor of ESZs or PEDs (odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval 1.9-12.7, p = 0.002). After controlling for age, coma, and organ dysfunction, the presence of ESZs or PEDs was associated with death or severe disability at hospital discharge (89% with ESZs or PEDs, vs. 39% if not; odds ratio 19.1, 95% confidence interval 6.3-74.6, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this retrospective study of MICU patients monitored with cEEG, ESZs and PEDs were frequent, predominantly in patients with sepsis. Seizures were mainly nonconvulsive. Both seizures and periodic discharges were associated with poor outcome. Prospective studies are warranted to determine more precisely the frequency and clinical impact of nonconvulsive seizures and periodic discharges, particularly in septic patients.

It is well recognized that individuals have highly different magnitudes of alpha EEG. This study examined occipital alpha EEG activity during different levels of experimental tonic cuff-pressure pain. The aim was to study the pain reactions and pain-EEG relationship in subjects with high alpha (H-alpha) and low alpha (L-alpha) EEG. Tonic experimental cuff-pressure induced pain, and high density EEG (124 channels) were used. The pain-EEG responses for the high alpha (above 600 mu VA(2) in total alpha power at baseline), and low alpha (below 600 mu VA(2) in alpha power at baseline) subjects were analyzed. Forty healthy volunteers were included and received tonic pain for 3 min at three intensities (VRS2) intense, but no pain, (VRS4) slight pain, and (VRS6) moderate pain. There were no differences in stimulus intensities to reach the three ratings between the H-alpha and the L-alpha groups. The H-alpha and L-alpha groups are highly different in alpha1(PO3), alpha1(PO4), alpha1(PO7) and alpha1(PO8) EEG powers. A positive correlation (P = 0.008) between alpha2(PO3) EEG and average subjective pain ratings was specific for the L-alpha group. The H-alpha group showed alpha1 desynchronization as pain increased, but no significant correlation between alpha1 EEG powers and average subjective pain ratings. The differences between the L-alpha and the H-alpha in alpha EEG powers and the different pain-EEG responses may be related to different degrees of attention, fear of pain and pain related coping strategies.

Modifications of EEG Related to Directed Perception and Analysis of Olfactory Information in Humans	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; olfactory stimulation; olfactory analyzer; spectral composition; coherence; essential oils; attention	STIMULATION; BRAIN; ODORS; THETA	We recorded EEG in adult volunteers in the course of perception of smells of plant essential oils under conditions of directed attention. It was found that perception of olfactory information, even in the case of mild intensity of the smells inducing no aversive effects, correlates with noticeable changes in the EEG characteristics mostly typical of the reaction of nonspecific EEG activation induced by sensory stimulation and manifested in a decrease in the spectral power, SP, of low-frequency EEG components (6-10 Hz)). In addition, the SP of relatively high-frequency EEG components (11-25 Hz) increased; this effect was most pronounced in the occipital regions of the neocortex. Perception of the smells of essential oils was also accompanied by increases in the coherence of EEG oscillations, most intense in the beta 2 range (20-25 Hz). Such modifications were maximum in the left temporal/parietal region; this is interpreted as an indication of the special role of these cortical areas in the processes of interaction between the neocortical part of the olfactory analyzer and the respective structures of other analyzer systems. It is hypothesized that such interaction is necessary for the formation of a semantic image of the analyzed stimuli.	[Cherninskii, A. A.; Zima, I. G.; Makarchouk, N. Ye.; Piskorskaya, N.

Heart rate variability during sleep in healthy term newborns in the early postnatal period	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						newborn; sleep; EEG; ECG; heart rate variability; respiratory sinus arrhythmia	FULL-TERM; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; INFANTS; ARRHYTHMIA; NEONATE	Normative time-and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) measures were extracted during quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) periods in 30 healthy babies. All newborn infants studied were less than 12 h old and the sleep state was classified using multi-channel video EEG. Three bands were extracted from the heart rate (HR) spectrum: very low frequency (VLF), 0.01-0.04 Hz; low frequency (LF), 0.04-0.2 Hz, and high frequency (HF), > 0.2 Hz. All metrics were averaged across all patients and per sleep state to produce a table of normative values. A noticeable peak corresponding to activity in the RSA band was found in 80% patients during QS and 0% of patients during AS, although some broadband activity was observed. The majority of HRV metrics showed a statistically significant separation between QS and AS. It can be concluded that (i) activity in the RSA band is present during QS in the healthy newborn, in the first 12 h of life, (ii) HRV measures are affected by sleep state and (iii) the averaged HRV metrics reported here could assist the interpretation of HRV data from newborns with neonatal illnesses.

J	Ruiz, MH; Koelsch, S; Bhattacharya, J				Ruiz, Maria Herrojo; Koelsch, Stefan; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Decrease in Early Right Alpha Band Phase Synchronization and Late Gamma Band Oscillations in Processing Syntax in Music	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						music; syntax; oscillations; synchronization; phase; EEG; network	NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; EEG; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION; MEMORY; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	The present study investigated the neural correlates associated with the processing of music-syntactical irregularities as compared with regular syntactic structures in music. Previous studies reported an early (similar to 200 ms) right anterior negative component (ERAN) by traditional event-related-potential analysis during music-syntactical irregularities, vet little is known about the underlying oscillatory and synchronization properties of brain responses which are supposed to play a crucial role in general cognition including music perception. First we showed that the ERAN was primarily represented by low frequency (<8 Hz) brain oscillations. Further, we found that music-syntactical irregularities as compared with music-syntactical regularities, were associated with (i) an early decrease in the alpha band (9-10 Hz) phase synchronization between right fronto-central and left temporal brain regions, and (ii) a late (similar to 500 ms) decrease in gamma band (38-50 Hz) oscillations over fronto-central brain regions. These results indicate a weaker degree of long-range integration when the musical expectancy is violated. In summary, our results reveal neural mechanisms of music-syntactic processing that operate at different levels of cortical integration, ranging from early decrease in long-range alpha phase synchronization to late local gamma oscillations.

J	Sun, LM; Hinrichs, H				Sun, Limin; Hinrichs, Hermann			Simultaneously Recorded EEG-fMRI: Removal of Gradient Artifacts by Subtraction of Head Movement Related Average Artifact Waveforms	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; gradient artifact; resampling; head movement	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG/FMRI; REDUCTION; TESLA; ECG	Electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are corrupted by large repetitive artifacts generated by the switched MR gradients. Several methods have been proposed to remove these distortions by Subtraction of averaged artifact templates from the ongoing EEG. Here, we present a modification of this approach which accounts for head movements to improve the extracted template. Using the fMRI analysis package statistical parametric mapping (SPM; FIL London) the head displacement is determined at each half fMRI-volume. The basic idea is to apply a moving average algorithm for template extraction but to include only epochs that were obtained at the same head position as the artefact to be removed. This approach was derived from phantom EEG measurements demonstrating substantial variations of the artefact waveform in response to movements of the phantom in the MRI magnet. To further reduce the residual noise, we applied a resampling algorithm which aligns the EEG samples in a strict adaptive manner to the fMRI timing. Finally, we propose a new algorithm to suppress residual artifacts Such as those occasionally observed in case of brief strong movements, which are not reflected by the movement indicator because of the limited temporal resolution of the fMRI sequence. On the basis of EEG recordings of six subjects these measures combined reduce the residual artefact activity quantified in terms of the spectral power at the gradient repetition rate and its harmonics by roughly 20 to 50%, (depending on the amount of movement) predominantly in frequencies beyond 30 Hz.

Synchronization within a single and between distributed neuronal clusters reflects the dynamics of these cooperative patterns. Thus absence epilepsy can be used as a model for integrated, large-scale investigation of the emergence of pathological collective dynamics in the brain. Indeed, spike-wave discharges (SWD) of an absence seizure are thought to reflect abnormal cortical hypersynchronization. In this paper, we address two questions: how and where do SWD arise in the human brain? Therefore, we explored the spatio-temporal dynamics of interactions within and between widely distributed cortical sites using magneto-encephalographic recordings of spontaneous absence seizures. We then extracted, from their time-frequency analysis, local synchronization of cortical sources and long-range synchronization linking distant sites. Our analyses revealed a reproducible sequence of 1) long-range desynchronization, 2) increased local synchronization and 3) increased long-range synchronization. Although both local and long-range synchronization displayed different spatio-temporal profiles, their cortical projection within an initiation time window overlap and reveal a multifocal fronto-central network. These observations contradict the classical view of sudden generalized synchronous activities in absence epilepsy. Furthermore, they suggest that brain states transition may rely on multi-scale processes involving both local and distant interactions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The neuronal pathways involved in wake promotion are multiple and often not well characterized. We tested d-amphetamine, modafinil, and YKP10A, a novel wake-promoting compound, in three inbred strains of mice. The wake duration induced by YKP10A and d-amphetamine depended similarly on genotype, whereas opposite strain differences were observed after modafinil. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis during drug-induced wakefulness revealed a transient similar to 2Hz slowing of theta oscillations and an increase in beta-2 (20-35 Hz) activity only after YKP10A. Gamma activity (35-60 Hz) was induced by all drugs in a drug-and genotype-dependent manner. Brain transcriptome and clustering analyses indicated that the three drugs have both common and specific molecular signatures. The correlation between specific EEG and gene-expression signatures suggests that the neuronal pathways activated to stay awake vary among drugs and genetic background.

Here we investigate audiovisual binding by presenting continuously changing, temporally congruent and incongruent stimuli. Recorded EEG signals are used to quantify spectrotemporal and waveform locking of neural activity to stimulus dynamics. Spectrotemporal analysis reveals locking to visual stimulus dynamics in both a broad alpha and the beta band. The properties of these effects suggest they are a correlate of bottom-up processing in the visual system. Waveform locking reveals two cortically distinct processes that lock to visual stimulus dynamics with differing topographies and time lags relative to the stimuli. Most importantly, these are modulated in strength by the congruency of an accompanying auditory stream. In addition, the waveform locking found at occipital electrodes shows an increase over stimulus duration for visual and congruent audiovisual stimuli. Hence we argue that these effects reflect audiovisual interaction. We thus propose that spectrotemporal and waveform locking reflect different mechanisms involved in the processing of dynamic audiovisual stimuli.

Using incidental learning, this study investigated whether these brain oscillatory subsequent memory effects can be differentiated by encoding task. One group of subjects studied material performing a semantic (deep) encoding task, whereas the other group studied the same material performing a nonsemantic (shallow) encoding task. Successful encoding in the semantic task was related to power decreases in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-20 Hz) frequency band, and a power increase in the gamma band (55-70 Hz). In the shallow task, successful encoding was related to a power decrease in the alpha band and a power increase in the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz). A direct comparison of results between the 2 encoding tasks revealed that semantic subsequent memory effects were specifically reflected by power decreases in the beta (0.5-1.5 s) and the alpha frequency band (0.5-1.0 s), whereas nonsemantic subsequent memory effects were specifically reflected by a power increase in the theta frequency band (0.5-1.0 s).

The Attenuation of Very Low Frequency Brain Oscillations in Transitions from a Rest State to Active Attention	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						low-frequency oscillations; direct current EEG; rest task attenuation; default mode; spontaneous neuronal activity	INTRA-SUBJECT VARIABILITY; DEFAULT-MODE; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; CORTEX; NETWORKS; ADHD	Background: The default mode interference hypothesis (Sonuga-Barke & Castellanos, 2007) predicts (1) the attenuation of very low frequency oscillations (VLFO; e.g.,.05 Hz) in brain activity within the default mode network during the transition from rest to task, and (2) that failures to attenuate in this way will lead to an increased likelihood of periodic attention lapses that are synchronized to the VLFO pattern. Here, we tested these predictions using DC-EEG recordings within and outside of a previously identified network of electrode locations hypothesized to reflect DMN activity (i.e., S3 network; Helps et al., 2008). Method: 24 young adults (mean age 22.3 years; 8 male), sampled to include a wide range of ADHD symptoms, took part in a study of rest to task transitions. Two conditions were compared: 5min of rest (eyes open) and a 10-min simple 2-choice RT task with a relatively high sampling rate (ISI 1 s). DC-EEG was recorded during both conditions, and the low-frequency spectrum was decomposed and measures of the power within specific bands extracted. Results: Shift from rest to task led to an attenuation of VLFO activity within the S3 network which was inversely associated with ADHD symptoms. RT during task also showed a VLFO signature. During task there was a small but significant degree of synchronization between EEG and RT in the VLFO band. Attenuators showed a lower degree of synchrony than nonattenuators. Discussion: The results provide some initial EEG-based support for the default mode interference hypothesis and suggest that failure to attenuate VLFO in the S3 network is associated with higher synchrony between low-frequency brain activity and RT fluctuations during a simple RT task. Although significant, the effects were small and future research should employ tasks with a higher sampling rate to increase the possibility of extracting robust and stable signals.

Synchronization Between Sources: Emerging Methods for Understanding Large-Scale Functional Networks in the Human Brain	COORDINATED ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN: MEASUREMENTS AND RELEVANCE TO BRAIN FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR	Springer Series in Computational Neuroscience		English	Article; Book Chapter							GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG ACTIVITY; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; TASK; COMMUNICATION; MODULATION	This chapter summarizes currently available techniques for measuring synchronization between neural sources identified through EEG and MEG recordings. First the evidence for the involvement of neural synchronization in the implementation of cognitive processes is described. This involvement is mainly through the provision of high-quality communication between active brain regions, allowing integration of processing activities through the exchange of information and control signals. Second, we describe several useful techniques for obtaining phase information from time series of EEG and MEG records, and measuring phase locking or phase coherence using these methods. These include wavelet analysis and the analytic signal using the Hilbert transform for obtaining phase information, and phase-locking value and coherence for obtaining useful indices of synchronization. Finally, we summarize several available techniques for locating neural sources of EEG and MEG records and describe the use of the phase-locking measurements in ascertaining synchronization between sources located with these techniques. The techniques include those involving blind separation of sources, such as independent component analysis or principle component analysis, and those involving use of brain anatomy to constrain source locations, such as beamformer or LORETA. We also provide a few examples of published or forthcoming research that has used these approaches. All of the techniques described are available either in commercial software (such as BESA and MATLAB) or in freeware that runs in MATLAB (such as EEGLAB, Fieldtrip, Brainstorm). Some custom programming might be required (e.g., in MATLAB using the Signal Processing Toolbox) to implement some of the measurements.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings offer the possibility to greatly enrich the significance and the interpretation of the single modality results because the same neural processes are observed from the same brain at the same time. Nonetheless, the different physical nature of the measured signals by the two techniques renders the coupling not always straightforward, especially in cognitive experiments where spatially localized and distributed effects coexist and evolve temporally at different temporal scales. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the combination of simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI signals exploiting the principles of EEG distributed source modeling. We define a common source space for fMRI and EEG signal projection and gather a conceptually unique framework for the spatial and temporal comparative analysis. We illustrate this framework in a graded-load working-memory simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment based on the n-back task where sustained load-dependent changes in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during continuous item memorization co-occur with parametric changes in the EEG theta power induced at each single item. In line with previous studies, we demonstrate on two single-subject cases how the presented approach is capable of colocalizing in midline frontal regions two phenomena Simultaneously observed at different temporal scales, such as the sustained negative changes in BOLD activity and the parametric EEG theta synchronization. We discuss the presented approach in relation to modeling and interpretation issues typically arising in simultaneous EEG-fMRI Studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, behavioural activation (BAS) and behavioural inhibition systems (BIS) were considered as an explicative factor to verify the effect of motivational significance on cortical activity. Nineteen subjects were submitted to an ample range of facial expressions of emotions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral). The results demonstrated that anterior frontal sites were more active than central and posterior sites in response to facial stimuli. Moreover, right-side responses varied as a function of emotional types, with an increased right-frontal activity for negative emotions. Finally, whereas higher BIS subjects generated a more right hemisphere activation for some negative emotions (such as fear, anger, and surprise), Reward-BAS subjects were more responsive to positive emotion (happiness) within the left hemisphere. Valence and potential threatening power of facial expressions were considered to elucidate these cortical differences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Nonlinear dynamical EEG analysis; Epilepsy; Seizure prediction; Surrogates; Monte Carlo simulation	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EEG RECORDINGS; LONG; PREDICTABILITY; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Objective: To test whether epileptic seizure prediction algorithms have true predictive power, their performance must be compared with the one expected under well-defined null hypotheses. For this purpose, analytical performance estimates and seizure predictor surrogates were introduced. We here extend the Monte Carlo framework of seizure predictor surrogates by introducing alarm times surrogates. Methods: We construct artificial seizure time sequences and artificial seizure predictors to be consistent or inconsistent with various null hypotheses to determine the frequency of null hypothesis rejections obtained from analytical performance estimates and alarm times surrogates under controlled conditions. Results: Compared to analytical performance estimates, alarm times surrogates are more flexible with regard to the testable null hypotheses. Both approaches have similar, high statistical power to indicate true predictive power. For Poisson predictors that fulfill the null hypothesis of analytical performance estimates, the frequency of false positive null hypothesis rejections can exceed the significance level for long mean inter-alarm intervals, revealing an intrinsic bias of these analytical estimates. Conclusions: Alarm times surrogates offer important advantages over analytical performance estimates. Significance: The key question in the field of seizure prediction is whether seizures can in principle be predicted or whether algorithms which have been presumed to perform better than chance actually are unable to predict seizures and simply have not yet been tested against the appropriate null hypotheses. Alarm times surrogates can help to answer this question. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characterisation of the effects of caffeine on sleep in the rat: a potential model of sleep disruption	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT; caffeine; EEG; insomnia; rat; sleep; telemetry; trazodone; zolpidem	EEG POWER-DENSITY; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; AWAKENING QUALITY; SUBJECTIVE SLEEP; ADENOSINE A(1); REM-SLEEP; TRAZODONE; ZOLPIDEM; INSOMNIA; BRAIN	Caffeine is known to disrupt sleep and its administration to human subjects has been used to model sleep disruption. We previously showed that its effects on sleep onset latency are comparable between rats and humans. This study evaluated the potential use of caffeine as a model of sleep disruption in the rat, by assessing its effects on sleep architecture and electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectrum, and using sleep-promoting drugs to reverse these effects. Rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices for body temperature, EEG, electromyogram and locomotor activity. Following recovery, animals were dosed with caffeine (10 mg/kg) alone or in combination with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) or trazodone (20 mg/kg). Sleep was scored for the subsequent 12 h using automated analysis software. Caffeine dose- dependently disrupted sleep: it increased WAKE time, decreased NREM (non- REM) sleep time and NREM bout duration (but not bout number), and decreased delta activity in NREM sleep. It also dose- dependently increased locomotor activity and body temperature. When given alone, zolpidem suppressed REM whilst trazodone increased NREM sleep time at the expense of WAKE, increased NREM bout duration, increased delta activity in NREM sleep and reduced body temperature. In combination, zolpidem attenuated caffeine's effects on WAKE, whilst trazodone attenuated its effects on NREM sleep, NREM bout duration, delta activity, body temperature and locomotor activity. Caffeine administration produced many of the signs of insomnia that were improved by two of its most successful current treatments. This model may therefore be useful in the study of new drugs for the treatment of sleep disturbance.	[Paterson, L. M.; Wilson, S. J.; Nutt, D.

EEG Correlates of Anxiety and Emotional Stability in Adult Healthy Subjects	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; test systems of Spielberger and Cattel; situative anxiety; personal anxiety; emotional stability	ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; POWER; PERSONALITY; MOTIVATION; DISORDERS	We studied peculiarities of the spectral characteristics of EEG in 111 healthy adult subjects of both sexes. The levels of situative anxiety (anxiety state) and personal anxiety were estimated using the Spielberger-Khanin test system. To estimate anxiety-related properties of the personality, Cattel's technique 16 PF (form.) was used. Estimates of situative anxiety demonstrated only two cases of positive correlation with the spectral power density (SPD) of EEG rhythms (SPDs of the beta2 rhythm in the right-hemisphere temporal and occipital regions; recording with the eyes open). Estimates of personal anxiety positively correlated with the SPDs of the beta1 and (especially) beta2 EEG rhythms. Under conditions with the eyes open, the number of significant correlations was greater, and correlations themselves were tighter than with the eyes closed. The closest correlations of the estimates of personal anxiety with the SPDs of the beta rhythm were found in frontal and central leads of both hemispheres and in parietal and occipital loci of the right hemisphere. Only a single case of correlation of the alpha rhythm SPD with personal anxiety (negative correlation, a parietal lead in the left hemisphere) was found. At the same time, rather numerous correlations of the alpha rhythm expression with an index congeneric to anxiety, the C factor by the Cattel's questionnaire (emotional stability/instability), were found. Thus, the intense beta EEG rhythm can be considered an electrographic correlate of high situative and personal anxieties. At the same time, the alpha rhythm power correlates with the emotional stability of the individual. We suppose that persons with a well-developed alpha rhythm are characterized by active and stable functioning of the cerebral dopaminergic system; this simultaneously serves as a pre-requisite of high emotional stability and social adaptability.

JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aging; VEP; stimulus-response processing; Go/NoGo; alpha oscillations	GO NOGO TASKS; ERP COMPONENTS; RESPONSE PRODUCTION; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; EEG; AGE; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; THETA	A major challenge for developmental cognitive neuroscience is to understand how changes in cognitive functions related to aging are associated with changes in the neuronal information processing architecture. Previous studies on EEG event-related brain oscillations suggest functional changes in alpha-bands with age during sensory and memory tasks. Specifically, the topographical distribution of both single-trial lower and upper alpha magnitude and the corresponding phase coherence is altered in elderly persons. Thus, alpha oscillations, associated not only with sensory, but also with sensorimotor functions, may be altered with age. Compensatory mechanisms, possibly reflected in increased frontal alpha synchronization, may thereby be of profound relevance. The present study investigates age-related differences in the modulation of alpha oscillatory activity related to sensory and sensorimotor functions, including response preparation, execution, and inhibition. EEG was recorded while 10 young and 10 elderly persons performed a visual evoked potential (VEP), a cued stimulus response (S-R), and a cued visual Go/NoGo task. Early event-related synchronization (ERS, 0-250ms) and late event-related desynchronization (ERD, 200-600ms) of single-trial lower and upper alpha was analyzed using poststimulus amplitude enhancement and intertrial phase coherence measures. The results show comparable modulations of lower (8-10 Hz) and upper (10-15 Hz) alpha activity in young and elderly related to the sensory and different forms of motor response processing. Specifically, reduced early lower alpha ERS as well as late upper alpha ERD at central locations characterized response inhibition processing in both age groups. We discuss the counterintuitive hypothesis that reduced efficacy of some basal neural inhibitory mechanisms enables older observers to perform better than or comparable to younger observers on some visual tasks, and conclude that alterations in alpha oscillatory networks with age may depend on the stimuli applied.

Slow Oscillation State Facilitates Epileptiform Events in the Hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CURRENT SOURCE-DENSITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SLEEP OSCILLATIONS; NOCTURNAL SEIZURES; ANURAN CEREBELLUM; SYNAPTIC EVENTS; PIRIFORM CORTEX; MEMORY; EEG; LOCALIZATION	Nazer F, Dickson CT. Slow oscillation state facilitates epileptiform events in the hippocampus. J Neurophysiol 102: 1880-1889, 2009. First published June 24, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.90795.2008. In mesial temporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy, which typically involves the hippocampus (HPC), epileptiform events are enhanced during slow wave sleep (SWS). It remains unclear how and why the electroencephalographic (EEG) states that constitute SWS might predispose the HPC to this type of pathological activity. Recently our laboratory has described a novel state of deactivated hippocampal EEG activity that occurs during both SWS and urethan anesthesia: the slow oscillation (SO). This activity is characterized by a high-amplitude similar to 1-Hz signal, high synchrony within the hippocampus, and a dynamic coordination with neocortical SO. To assess how this activity state might influence epileptiform discharges, we studied the properties of stimulation-evoked and spontaneous epileptiform events elicited in the HPC of urethan-anesthetized rats. We compared those elicited during the SO to those occurring during the theta rhythm. The average duration but not the amplitude of evoked afterdischarges (ADs) was consistently larger during the SO. In addition, spontaneous epileptiform events were more frequent and of higher amplitude during the SO. Last, the bilateral propagation of both ADs and spontaneous events in the hippocampus was enhanced during the SO. These results imply that the threshold for the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity in the hippocampus is lowered during the SO and that this state may be a seed for the initiation, maintenance, and generalization of MTL epilepsy. Further examination of the pathophysiology of sleep-epilepsy interactions in the HPC will be of benefit for an understanding of the mechanisms, prognosis, and therapy for this form of epilepsy.

Among the many different treatments, Korean acupuncture is being favored for its lack of side effects. However, in order to prove that it is effective, it is necessary for Korean medicine to have a scientific medical basis. Therefore, greatly improving medical technologies are being used to perform studies to prove its effect scientifically. BCI (Brain Computer Interface) technology is especially used frequently to research frequency range variation and correlation coefficient. alpha -wave is between 8 similar to 12.99Hz and increase in this frequency range will be especially effective for neurological disease patients who will experience decreased a-wave. This is an important frequency range for treating neurological diseases. It helps us to determine the best diagnosis and treatment based on BCI. Therefore, in this study 10 different acupuncture spots were treated to look at the alpha-wave appearance and correlation coefficient for each channel.

EEG data was recorded from 17 young schizophrenia patients in a stable phase of their illness and 17 healthy controls performing an auditory oddball task. Evoked and induced delta and theta activity, N100, P300 amplitude were computed. Between 200-500 ms after a stimulus was presented, patients displayed significantly reduced P300, less evoked and induced delta and theta activity than controls. We conclude that the well known finding of P300 reduction in schizophrenia can be linked to reductions in delta and theta activity, which are a manifestation of impaired stimulus evaluation, memory retrieval, and a lack of sustained attention.

The effects of factors INTELLIGENCE and CREATIVITY on coherence scores were obtained for EEG in a broad frequency band from 4 to 30 Hz. The effects were more pronounced in the anterior cortex and in the left hemisphere in persons with higher intelligence and creativity as compared to individuals with lower indices. The highest coherence was observed in high-intelligent and high-creative individuals.

Here we test the hypothesis that errors lead to increased cortical arousal, measurable as changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha band power. Participants performed a Stroop task while EEG was recorded. Following correct responses, alpha power increased and then decreased in a quadratic pattern, implying transient mental disengagement during the intertrial interval. This trend was absent following errors, which elicited significantly less alpha power than correct trials. Moreover, post-error alpha power was a better predictor of individual differences in post-error slowing than the error-related negativity (ERN), whereas the ERN was a better predictor of post-error accuracy than alpha power. These findings imply that changes in cortical arousal play a unique role in modulating post-error behavior.

Changes in EEG Rhythms and Spike Activity of Brainstem Dopaminergic Neurons Induced by Neurofeedback Sessions in Cats	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG characteristics-neurofeedback; spectral power density; EEG rhythms; dopaminergic neurons; ventral tegmentum	MODULATION	We examined the dynamics of the ratios of spectral power densities (SPDs) of the alpha vs theta rhythms (alpha/theta ratio). of EEG and of the spiking frequency of supposedly dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmentum in the course of neurofeedback sessions directed toward changes in the EEG characteristics. Trainings were performed using techniques analogous to that used in neurofeedback sessions in humans. The level of the noise acoustic signal presented to the animal decreased with increase in the alpha/theta ratio in the occipital leads. In the control realizations, there were no dependences between the intensity of the acoustic signal and modulation of the current EEG. It was found that the animals learned, in a conditioned-reflex mode, to correlate changes in the intensity of the sound signal and power of the EEG rhythms and to control the latter; a high sound intensity was probably considered a factor of discomfort. The alpha/theta ratio in the course of neurofeedback sessions changed due to some increase in the SPD of the alpha EEG component and a noticeable drop in the SPD of theta oscillations. In a parallel manner with such modifications, augmentation of the spike activity of DA neurons was observed. Probable mechanisms of the involvement of the cerebral DA system in the formation of the effects of neurofeedback sessions are discussed.	[Kulichenko, A. M.; Fokina, Yu. O.; Pavlenko, V.

Three affective musical stimuli either expressing neutral, positive or negative mood were evaluated by the subjects concerning "expressed mood" and "level of enjoyment". The results show that individuals with relatively higher alpha power over right frontal electrode sites rated all stimuli more positive than participants with relatively higher alpha power over left frontal electrode sites. On the "expressed mood" scale, the valence of the stimuli did not influence the difference between the ratings of left- and right-active individuals. On the "enjoyment" scale, the largest difference between the ratings of left- and right-active individuals emerged in the negative condition. The results are specific to the alpha frequency band. In line with previous studies, these results suggest that resting frontal alpha-asymmetry reflects a person's predisposition to respond affectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Bipolar EEG coherence values were calculated at 50 frequency bins ranging from 3 to 28 Hz for 39 coherence pairs. Data were derived from 4.25 min of resting EEG obtained from 106 healthy adult male subjects and analyzed in 0.5 Hz bins by Fourier transform methods. Frequency bands were clearly separated at 8.5 and 13 Hz, with a less distinct separations at 6 and 20 Hz. Within pair (non-topographic) and across pair (topographic), measures gave similar patterns of separation. Significant pathways were primarily anterior-posterior interhemispheric or perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis. There was little difference between left and right for comparable pairs. Theta band coherent activity involves distinct midline and temporal sources, with temporal sources showing anterior/posterior differentiation. In contrast, alpha activity has a distinct posterior focus, while beta activity shows no clear global structure. A spatially homogeneous model based on characteristics of thalamocortical connectivity accounts for much of the data, but departures from the model indicate the contribution of other neural factors to coherence.

The advanced analysis of cerebral electro-physiological activity during the course of planning (PRE) or execution of movement (EYE) in a high temporal resolution could reveal interesting information about the brain functional organization in patients following stroke damage. High-power (128 channels) electroencephalography registration was carried out on 8 healthy subjects and on a patient with stroke with capsular lacuna in the right hemisphere. For activation of motor cortex, the finger tapping paradigm was used. In this preliminary study, we tested a theoretical graph approach to characterize the task-related spectral coherence. All of the obtained brain functional networks were analyzed by the connectivity degree, the degree distribution, and efficiency parameters in the Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands during the PRE and EYE intervals. All the brain networks were found to hold a regular and ordered topology. However, significant differences (P < 0.01) emerged between the patient with stroke and the control subjects, independently of the neural processes related to the PRE or EXE periods. In the Beta (13-29 Hz) and Gamma (30-40 Hz) bands, the significant (P < 0.01) decrease in global- and local-efficiency in the patient's networks, reflected a lower capacity to integrate communication between distant brain regions and a lower tendency to be modular. This weak organization is principally due to the significant (P < 0.01 Bonferroni corrected) increase in disconnected nodes together with the significant increase in the links in some other crucial vertices.

Features are used to represent patterns with the goal of minimizing the loss of important information. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a feature extraction method was used in representing the spike-wave discharges (SWDs) records of Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The SWD records of WAG/Rij rats were decomposed into time-frequency representations using the DWT and the statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. The obtained wavelet coefficients were used to identify characteristics of the signal that were not apparent from the original time domain signal. The present study demonstrates that the wavelet coefficients are useful in determining the dynamics in the time-frequency domain of SWD records. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The largest event in healthy human EEGs is the K-complex (KC), which occurs in slow-wave sleep. Here, we show that KCs are generated in widespread cortical areas by outward dendritic currents in the middle and upper cortical layers, accompanied by decreased broadband EEG power and decreased neuronal firing, which demonstrate a steep decline in network activity. Thus, KCs are isolated "down-states," a fundamental cortico-thalamic processing mode already characterized in animals. This correspondence is compatible with proposed contributions of the KC to sleep preservation and memory consolidation.

In humans, reports of invasive data acquisition for the purpose of BCI developments are less numerous and signal selection for optimal control still remains poorly investigated. Here we report on our recent implementation of a real-time analysis platform for the investigation of ongoing oscillations in human intracerebral recordings and review various results illustrating its utility for the development of novel brain computer and brain robot interfaces. Our findings show that the insight gained both from off-line experiments and from online functional exploration can be used to guide future selection of the sites and frequency bands to be used in a translation algorithm such as the one needed for a BCI-driven cursor control. Overall, the findings reported with our online spectral analysis platforms (Brain TV and Brain Ball) indicate the feasibility of online functional exploration via intracranial recordings in humans and outline the direct benefits of this approach for the improvement of invasive BCI strategies in humans. In particular, our findings suggest that current BCI performance may be improved by using signals recorded from various systems previously unexplored in the context of BCI research such as the oscillatory activity recorded in the oculomotor networks as well as higher cognitive processes including working memory, attention, and mental calculation networks. Finally, we discuss current limitations of the methodology and outline future paths for innovative BCI research.

The main features are: (1)The growth of the alpha activity during evolution, increase of alpha during cognitive processes, and decrease of the alpha entropy during evolution provide an indicator for evolution of brain cognitive performance. (2) Human children younger than 3 years are unable to produce higher cognitive processes and do not show alpha activity till the age of 3 years. The mature brain can perform higher cognitive processes and demonstrates regular alpha activity. (3) Alpha activity also is significantly associated with highly complex cognitive processes, such as the recognition of facial expressions. The neural activity reflected by these brain oscillations can be considered as constituent "building blocks" for a great number of functions. An overarching statement on the alpha function is presented by extended analyzes with multiple dimensions that constitute a "Cartesian Hyperspace" as the basis for oscillatory function. Theoretical implications are considered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG-EMG coherence in the beta band (15-30Hz) has been extensively studied under isometric muscle contraction tasks. We attempted to study the time-course of corticomuscular connectivity under a dynamic target tracking task. A new device was developed for the real-time measurement of dynamic force created by pinching the thumb and index finger. Healthy subjects were asked to track visual targets with the feedback forces. Spectral parameters were explored for reliable estimation of event-related coherence and correlogram for representing corticomuscular connectivity.

Early gamma-band responses reflect anticipatory top-down modulation in the auditory cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; gamma oscillations; Expectancy; Tone sequences; Good continuation	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HUMAN EEG; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; SEQUENTIAL SOUNDS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT SEQUENCES; P300 COMPONENT; PHASE-LOCKING; TERM-MEMORY	For efficient and fast encoding of our complex acoustic environment, not only aspects of bottorn-up processing are significant, but rather top-down influences Such as attention, memory, and anticipation promote specific behavior and perception. Neural oscillatory activity in the gamma-range (30-80 Hz) is discussed as a conceivable candidate to represent very rapid modulations of top-down factors. We investigated effects of anticipation on early gamma-band responses (GBRs) of the EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to tone sequences. These sequences were composed of six sinusoidal tones, which could be either regularly ascending or descending in frequency. Thus, the sequences reflected a good continuation of pitch, which also resulted in the buildup Of Strong expectancies for the upcoming Stimulus Within the sequence. However, some of the tone sequences contained a violation of the good continuation of pitch at the third or fifth tone position. The early phase-locked portion of the gamma-band activity was significantly increased when tones were in line with the good continuation of sequences compared to deviant tones. Further, a pronounced early negative ERP response, starting at 150 ins, was elicited by deviant tones at the third and fifth position. Our results support the notion that gamma-band oscillations reflect perceptual grouping processes of concurrent Sounds and anticipatory top-down modulation, which involves some of the first stages of auditory information processing.

HFOs occur predominantly in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) but their relationship to the underlying pathology is unknown. It was the aim of this study to investigate whether HFOs are specific to the SOZ or result from pathologically changed tissue, whether or not it is epileptogenic. Patients with different lesion types, namely mesial temporal atrophy (MTA), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and nodular heterotopias (NH) were investigated. Intracranial EEG was recorded from depth macroelectrodes with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz. Ripples (80250 Hz) and Fast Ripples (250500 Hz) were visually marked in 12 patients: five with MTA, four with FCD and three with NH. Rates of events were statistically compared in channels in four areas: lesional SOZ, non-lesional SOZ, lesional non-SOZ and non-lesional non-SOZ. HFO rates were clearly more linked to the SOZ than to the lesion. They were highest in areas in which lesion and SOZ overlap, but in patients with a SOZ outside the lesion, such as in NHs, HFO rates were clearly higher in the non-lesional SOZ than in the inactive lesions. No specific HFO pattern could be identified for the different lesion types. The findings suggest that HFOs represent a marker for SOZ areas independent of the underlying pathology and that pathologic tissue changes alone do not lead to high rates of HFOs.

A Novel Segmentation, Mutual Information Network Framework for EEG Analysis of Motor Tasks	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIDDEN MARKOV; SYNCHRONIZATION; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT; EEG/MEG	Background: Monitoring the functional connectivity between brain regions is becoming increasingly important in elucidating brain functionality in normal and disease states. Current methods of detecting networks in the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) such as correlation and coherence are limited by the fact that they assume stationarity of the relationship between channels, and rely on linear dependencies. In contrast to diseases of the brain cortex (e. g. Alzheimer's disease), with motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) the EEG abnormalities are most apparent during performance of dynamic motor tasks, but this makes the stationarity assumption untenable. Methods: We therefore propose a novel EEG segmentation method based on the temporal dynamics of the cross-spectrogram of the computed Independent Components (ICs). We then utilize mutual information (MI) as the metric for determining also nonlinear statistical dependencies between EEG channels. Graphical theoretical analysis is then applied to the derived MI networks. The method was applied to EEG data recorded from six normal subjects and seven PD subjects off medication. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests demonstrated statistically significant difference in the connectivity patterns between groups. Results: The results suggested that PD subjects are unable to independently recruit different areas of the brain while performing simultaneous tasks compared to individual tasks, but instead they attempt to recruit disparate clusters of synchronous activity to maintain behavioral performance. Conclusion: The proposed segmentation/MI network method appears to be a promising approach for analyzing the EEG recorded during dynamic behaviors.	[Wang, Z.

Functional definition of seizure provides new insight into post-traumatic epileptogenesis	BRAIN			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; epileptogenesis; biomarkers; drug screening; prophylaxis	FLUID PERCUSSION INJURY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; ANIMAL-MODELS; THETA RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS; PATHWAYS; RATS	Experimental animals' seizures are often defined arbitrarily based on duration, which may lead to misjudgement of the syndrome and failure to develop a cure. We employed a functional definition of seizures based on the clinical practice of observing epileptiform electrocorticography and simultaneous ictal behaviour, and examined post-traumatic epilepsy induced in rats by rostral parasagittal fluid percussion injury and epilepsy patients evaluated with invasive monitoring. We showed previously that rostral parasagittal fluid percussion injury induces different types of chronic recurrent spontaneous partial seizures that worsen in frequency and duration over the months post injury. However, a remarkable feature of rostral parasagittal fluid percussion injury is the occurrence, in the early months post injury, of brief (< 2 s) focal, recurrent and spontaneous epileptiform electrocorticography events (EEEs) that are never observed in sham-injured animals and have electrographic appearance similar to the onset of obvious chronic recurrent spontaneous partial seizures. Simultaneous epidural-electrocorticography and scalp-electroencephalography recordings in the rat demonstrated that these short EEEs are undetectable by scalp electrocorticography. Behavioural analysis performed blinded to the electrocorticography revealed that (i) brief EEEs lasting 0.8-2 s occur simultaneously with behavioural arrest; and (ii) while behavioural arrest is part of the rat's behavioural repertoire, the probability of behavioural arrest is greatly elevated during EEEs. Moreover, spectral analysis showed that EEEs lasting 0.8-2 s occurring during periods of active behaviour with dominant theta activity are immediately followed by loss of such theta activity. We thus conclude that EEEs lasting 0.8-2 s are ictal in the rat. We demonstrate that the assessment of the time course of fluid percussion injury-induced epileptogenesis is dramatically biased by the definition of seizure employed, with common duration-based arbitrary definitions resulting in artificially prolonged latencies for epileptogenesis. Finally, we present four human examples of electrocorticography capturing short (< 2 s), stereotyped, neocortically generated EEEs that occurred in the same ictal sites as obvious complex partial seizures, were electrographically similar to rat EEEs and were not noted during scalp electroencephalography. When occurring in the motor cortex, these short EEEs were accompanied by ictal behaviour detectable with simultaneous surface electromyography. These data demonstrate that short (< 2 s) focal recurrent spontaneous EEEs are seizures in both rats and humans, that they are undetectable by scalp electroencephalography, and that they are typically associated with subtle and easily missed behavioural correlates. These findings define the earliest identifiable markers of progressive post-traumatic epilepsy in the rat, with implications for mechanistic and prophylactic studies, and should prompt a re-evaluation of the concept of post-traumatic silent period in both animals and humans.

Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single systemic dose of kainic acid (KA; 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and local field potential activity (1-475 Hz) of the dorsal hippocampus, the amygdala and the neocortex was recorded. Of 135 ictal discharges, 55 (40.7%) involved both limbic structures. We demonstrated that 78.2% of seizures involving both the hippocampus and amygdala showed hippocampal gamma oscillations. Seizure duration was also significantly correlated with the frequency of hippocampal gamma oscillations (r(2) = 0.31, p<0.01) and LFP synchrony in the amygdalo-hippocampal network (r(2)=0.21, p<0.05). These results suggest that gamma oscillations in the amygdalo-hippocampal network could facilitate long-range synchrony and participate in the propagation of seizures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We reasoned that coordination of oscillatory activity over time might be important for memory and, therefore, that the amplitude modulation of oscillations may be abnormal in Alzheimer disease (AD). To test this hypothesis, we measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) during eyes-closed rest in 19 patients diagnosed with early-stage AD and 16 age-matched control subjects and characterized the autocorrelation structure of ongoing oscillations using detrended fluctuation analysis and an analysis of the life- and waiting-time statistics of oscillation bursts. We found that Alzheimer's patients had a strongly reduced incidence of alpha-band oscillation bursts with long life- or waiting-times (< 1 s) over temporo-parietal regions and markedly weaker autocorrelations on long time scales (1-25 seconds). Interestingly, the life- and waiting-times of theta oscillations over medial prefrontal regions were greatly increased. Whereas both temporo-parietal alpha and medial prefrontal theta oscillations are associated with retrieval and retention of information, metabolic and structural deficits in early-stage AD are observed primarily in temporo-parietal areas, suggesting that the enhanced oscillations in medial prefrontal cortex reflect a compensatory mechanism. Together, our results suggest that amplitude modulation of neuronal oscillations is important for cognition and that indices of amplitude dynamics of oscillations may prove useful as neuroimaging biomarkers of early-stage AD.

At present, an electroencephalography-based rule is generally used for classifying sleep stages. However, scoring the PSG record is quite laborious and time consuming. In this paper, movement and cardiac activity were measured unobtrusively by a load-cell-installed bed, and sleep was classified into two stages: slow-wave sleep and non-slow-wave sleep. From the measured cardiac activity, we extracted heartbeat data and calculated heart rate variability parameters: standard deviation of R-R intervals SDNN, low frequency-to-high frequency ratio, alpha of detrended fluctuation analysis and correlation coefficient of R-R interval. The developed system showed a substantial concordance with PSG results when compared using a contingency test. The mean epoch-by-epoch agreement between the proposed method and PSG was 92.5% and Cohen's kappa was 0.62.

EEG generator -a model of potentials in a volume conductor. J Neurophysiol 102: 3046-3059, 2009. First published August 26, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91143.2008. EEG generator-a model of potentials in a volume conductor. The potential recorded over the cortex electro-corticogram (ECoG) or over the scalp [electroencephalograph (EEG)] derives from the activity of many sources known as "EEG generators." The recorded amplitude is basically a function of the unitary potential of a generator and the statistical relationship between different EEG generators in the recorded population. In this study, we first suggest a new definition of the EEG generator. We use the theory of potentials in a volume conductor and model the contribution of a single synapse activated to the surface potential. We then model the contribution of the generator to the surface potential. Once the generator and its contribution are well defined, we can quantitatively assess the degree of synchronization among generators. The measures obtained by the model for a real life scenario of a group of generators organized in a specific statistical way were consistent with the expected values that were reported experimentally. The study sheds new light on macroscopic modeling approaches which make use of mean soma membrane potential. We showed major contribution of activity of superficial apical synapses to the ECoG signal recorded relative to lower somatic or basal synapses activity.

EEG-alpha slowing characterizes both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy aging, but it remains ambiguous whether different neural mechanisms underlie this oscillatory behavior in normal and pathological senescence. In this study, we show that the strength of phase coupling and the level of phase predictability between thalamocortical and cortico-cortical EEG sources of low alpha frequency are abnormally facilitated in MCI patients when compared to healthy elderly subjects. Additionally, we found a loss of neural complexity intrinsic to both thalamic and cortical generators of lower alpha in MCI patients, which likely influenced the aberrant phase synchronization behavior between EEG-alpha sources in this high risk group of AD. Taken together, these results suggest that different neural mechanisms account for the well known slowing of alpha rhythm present in normal aging and MCI patients. Whether these anomalous neural coding mechanisms of lower alpha generation in MCI patients represent a potential electrophysiological marker of mild AD is a topic for future research.

The Creative Brain: Investigation of Brain Activity During Creative Problem Solving by Means of EEG and fMRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						alpha; creativity; EEG; fMRI; originality	ALPHA-BAND; CORTICAL INTEGRATION; VERBAL CREATIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; PERFORMANCE; NEUROSCIENCE	Cortical activity in the EEG alpha band has proven to be particularly sensitive to creativity-related demands, but its functional meaning in the context of creative cognition has not been clarified yet. Specifically, increases in alpha activity (i.e., alpha synchronisation) in response to creative thinking can be interpreted in different ways: As a functional correlate of cortical idling, as a sign of internal top-down activity or, more specifically, as selective inhibition of brain regions. We measured brain activity during creative thinking in two studies employing different neurophysiological measurement methods (EEG and fMRI). In both studies, participants worked on four verbal tasks differentially drawing on creative idea generation. The EEG study revealed that the generation of original ideas was associated with alpha synchronisation in frontal brain regions and with a diffuse and widespread pattern of alpha synchronisation over parietal cortical regions. The fMRI study revealed that task performance was associated with strong activation in frontal regions of the left hemisphere. In addition, we found task-specific effects in parietotemporal brain areas. The findings suggest that EEG alpha band synchronisation during creative thinking can be interpreted as a sign of active cognitive processes rather than cortical idling.

Relation of Gamma Oscillations in Scalp Recordings to Muscular Activity	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Gamma; EEG; EMG; Paralysis	EEG; EMG	We recorded scalp electrical activity before and after full neuro-muscular paralysis in 5 volunteers and determined differences due to elimination of muscular activity on several standard applications of EEG. Due to paralysis, there were reductions in 'noisiness' of the standard scalp recordings which were maximal over the peripheral scalp, not explained by abolition of movement artefact, and best accounted for by sustained EMG activity in resting individuals. There was a corresponding reduction in spectral power in the gamma range. In central leads, the extent of gamma frequency coherence during a non-timelocked mental task (1 s epochs) was reduced by paralysis, likely due to a reduction in gamma-frequency coherence in widely arising EMG signals. In a time-locked mental task (auditory oddball), evoked responses were qualitatively unaffected by paralysis but 3 of 4 induced gamma responses were obscured by EMG.

Sleep characterization of a one-month-old freely moving stumptail macaque (Macaca arctoides): a pilot study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Brain development; Macaca arctoides; monkey; sleep; sleep micro-architecture	OSCILLATIONS; MONKEYS	Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during both human and adult primates' sleep has been proven to be similar and consequently, it could be assessed under similar parameters. However, there is no information regarding this EEG activity in the early stages of development in non-human primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe EEG sleep patterns in a 1-month-old Macaca arctoides with a non-invasive and free-movement method. Sleep stages were initially scored using the criteria of quiet sleep and active sleep. This procedure allowed us to observe graphoelements to distinguish sleep phases as described in adult macaques.

Low-frequency EEG oscillations associated with information processing in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Delta; Theta; Oscillations; Schizophrenia; Go/no-go	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; PHASE-RESET; BRAIN; P300; DEFICIT; DELTA; POWER	Numerous studies have described attenuated event-related potential (ERP) component amplitudes in schizophrenia (e.g., P300, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Error Negativity/Error-Related Negativity (Ne/ERN)). Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI) studies have typically shown decreased recruitment of diverse brain areas during performance of tasks that elicit the above ERP components. Recent research suggests that phase-resetting of slow-oscillations (e.g., in the delta and theta bands) underlies the potentials observed in ERP averages. Several studies have reported that slow-oscillations are increased in amplitude in people with schizophrenia at rest. Few studies have examined event-related low-frequency oscillations in schizophrenia. We examined event-related evoked and induced delta and theta activity in 17 people with schizophrenia and 17 healthy controls in two go/no-go task variants. We analyzed stimulus-related and response-related oscillations associated with correct-hits, correct-rejects and false-alarms. Our results reveal a pattern of reduced delta and theta activity for task-relevant events in schizophrenia. The findings indicate that while low-frequency oscillations are increased in amplitude at rest, they are not coordinated effectively in schizophrenia during various information processing tasks including target-detection, response-inhibition and error-detection. This slow-oscillation coordination abnormality may help explain the decreased recruitment of brain areas seen in fMRI studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we tested the hypothesis that these rhythms are abnormal in persistent vegetative state (PVS) patients, who are awake but not aware of self and environment. Methods: Clinical and resting-state, eyes-closed electrorencephalographic (EEG) data were taken from a clinical archive. These data were recorded in 50 PVS subjects (level of cognitive functioning - LCF score: I-II) and in 30 cognitively normal subjects. Rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Based on LCF score at 3-months follow-up, PVS patients were retrospectively divided into three groups: 30 subjects who did not recover (NON-REC patients; follow-up LCF: I-II), 8 Subjects classified as minimally conscious state patients (MCS patients; follow-up LCF: III-IV), and 12 subjects who recovered (REC patients; follow-up LCF: V-VIII). Results: Occipital Source power of alpha I and alpha 2 was high in normal subjects, low in REC patients, and practically null in NON-REC patients. A Cox regression analysis showed that the power of alpha Source predicted the rate of the follow up recovery, namely the higher its power. the higher the chance to recover consciousness. Furthermore, the MCS patients showed intermediate values of occipital alpha Source power between REC and NON-REC patients. Conclusions: These results Suggest that cortical sources of alpha rhythms are related to the chance of recovery at a 3-months follow-up in patients in persistent vegetative state. Significance: Cortical sources of resting alpha rhythms might predict recovery in PVS patients. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this paper, we proposed an automatic sleep stages classification system by analyzing rat's EEG signal. The rat's EEG signal is transferred by FFT and then extracted features. These extracted features are used as training patterns to further construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two components, the principle component analysis (PCA) as the first component is used to projects the high dimensional features into lower dimensional subspace, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method as the second component is applied to identify the physiological state for a period of EEG signal. By experimenting on 810 periods of EEG signal, the proposed classification system achieves satisfactory classification accuracy of sleep stages.

Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is used for defining the level of sustained attention. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is applied on 19-channel recorded EEG and the best component is determined based on time, frequency and spatial specifications of the components. The ERPs are extracted for each group of stimuli and eighteen morphological features (including P3) were extracted. Nineteen subjects were divided into three groups according to their attention level. LDA classifier is then used for discrimination of classes. The results are compared with two other common methods. Classification based on the proposed method yields in accuracy of 81% with the advantage of preserving almost all the data. Outcomes represent a significant correlation between CPT result and some parameters of brain signal's components which can be used in evaluating the level of attention.

Broadband Shifts in Local Field Potential Power Spectra Are Correlated with Single-Neuron Spiking in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; MEMORY; MOVEMENT; STIMULI	A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the relation between the spiking of individual neurons and the aggregate electrical activity of neuronal ensembles as seen in local field potentials (LFPs). Because LFPs reflect both spiking activity and subthreshold events, this question is not simply one of data aggregation. Recording from 20 neurosurgical patients, we directly examined the relation between LFPs and neuronal spiking. Examining 2030 neurons in widespread brain regions, we found that firing rates were positively correlated with broadband (2-150 Hz) shifts in the LFP power spectrum. In contrast, narrowband oscillations correlated both positively and negatively with firing rates at different recording sites. Broadband power shifts were a more reliable predictor of neuronal spiking than narrowband power shifts. These findings suggest that broadband LFP power provides valuable information concerning neuronal activity beyond that contained in narrowband oscillations.

In order to analyze scattering processes at the level of elementary particles Werner Heisenberg proposed the use of the so-called S-Matrix to understand nuclear interactions by studying ingoing at outgoing particles. Later, Richard Feynman developed useful schemes in order to visualize processes of elementary particle interactions. In the present report a metaphor to Feynman Diagrams is developed in order to model the "Ongoing Brain Activity and Event Related Oscillations". The response susceptibility of the brain shows a probabilistic causality similar to uncertain processes in elementary particle physics. A new grammar called Brain Feynman Diagrams is proposed in order to show brain oscillatory responses as a more visible construct in comparison to conventional compound brain potentials.

The major problem with existing methods for quantifying the causality in the brain, e.g. Granger causality, is that they assume an multivariate autoregressive signal model for the multi-channel EEG signals and do not take the nonlinear dependencies between neuronal oscillations into account. In this paper, we propose to quantify the causality of the interactions based on the directed information (DI) criterion, which measures the information flow between two signals over time. The proposed measure is applied to real EEG data from control and schizophrenic subject groups. The significance of the computed DI values are verified by Fourier bootstrapping technique.

The impact of chronic primary insomnia on the heart rate - EEG variability link	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Chronic primary insomnia; Heart rate variability; Coherency analysis; Delta sleep EEG	POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE; SLEEP EEG; DELTA; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; COMPONENTS; PRESSURE; DISEASE; EVENTS	Objective: To determine if chronic insomnia alters the relationship between heart rate variability and delta sleep determined at the EEG. Methods: After one night of accommodation, polysomnography was performed in 14 male patients with chronic primary insomnia matched with 14 healthy men. ECG and EEG recordings allowed the determination of High Frequency (HF) power of RR-interval and delta sleep EEG power across the first three Non Rapid Eye Movement (NREM)-REM cycles. Interaction between normalized HF RR-interval variability and normalized delta sleep EEG power was studied by coherency analysis. Results: Patients showed increased total number of awakenings, longer sleep latency and wake durations and shorter sleep efficiency and REM duration than controls (p < .01). Heart rate variability across first three NREM-REM cycles and sleep stages (NREM, REM and awake) were similar between both groups. In each group, normalized HF variability of RR-interval decreased from NREM to both REM and awake. Patients showed decreased linear relationship between normalized HF RR-interval variability and delta EEG power, expressed by decreased coherence, in comparison to controls (p < .05). Gain and phase shift between these signals were similar between both groups. Conclusions: Interaction between changes in cardiac autonomic activity and delta power is altered in chronic primary insomniac patients, even in the absence of modifications in heart rate variability and cardiovascular diseases. Significance: This altered interaction could reflect the first step to cardiovascular disorders. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

From childhood to old age, phase synchronization increased within and between electrodes, whereas whole power and evoked power decreased. We conclude that the cortical dynamics of perceptual processing undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to old age, and discuss possible reasons for the inverse relation between age trends in phase synchronization and power, such as lifespan differences in neural background activity, or a lifespan shift from rate coding in children to temporal coding in adults.

Gamma-band activity in the human superior temporal sulcus during mentalizing from nonverbal social cues	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Social cognition; Intracranial EEG; Gamma band; Superior temporal sulcus; Mentalizing	YOUNG CHILDRENS KNOWLEDGE; OF-BODY EXPERIENCE; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG-ALPHA; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MIRROR NEURON; BOLD RESPONSE; MU-RHYTHM; BRAIN; FMRI	The posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is a key structure for our ability to infer others' mental states based on social cues including facial expressions, body posture, and gestures ("mentalizing"), but the neural mechanisms of this ability remain largely unknown. We recorded electrocorticogram directly from the pSTS in humans to show that enhanced neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range (35-55 Hz) accompany mentalizing. One patient with a lesion in pSTS was tested behaviorally on this task; he was unable to infer a virtual character's preferences from nonverbal social cues. Enhanced coherent gamma oscillations in the patients with intact pSTS may reflect a process by which social signals are bound into a unified representation to support mentalizing. This may be relevant for other social cognitive processes, as well as to the study of autism spectrum disorders, for which both mentalizing deficits and abnormal gamma activity have been reported.

Neocortical oscillations provide critical information about the integrity of thalamocortical circuits and functional connectivity of cortical networks, which seem to be significantly disrupted by the neuronal death and synapse loss characterizing Alzheimer's disease (AD). By applying a novel analysis methodology to overcome volume conduction effects between scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements, we were able to estimate the temporal activation of EEG-alpha sources in the thalamus and parieto-occipital regions of the cortex. We found that synaptic flow underlying the lower alpha band (7.5-10 Hz) was abnormally facilitated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as compared to healthy elderly individuals, particularly from thalamus to cortex (similar to 38% higher). In addition, the thalamic generator of lower alpha oscillations was also abnormally activated in patients with MCI. Regarding the upper alpha subdivision (10.1-12.5 Hz), both controls and patients with MCI showed a bidirectional decrease of thalamocortical synaptic transmission, which was age-dependent only in the control group. Altogether, our results suggest that functional dynamics of thalamocortical networks differentiate individuals at high risk of developing AD from healthy elderly subjects, supporting the hypothesis that neurodegeneration mechanisms are active years before the patient is clinically diagnosed with dementia.

Learning of hippocampus-dependent tasks increases neocortical slow oscillation synchrony, and thalamocortical spindle and hippocampal ripple activity during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep. Slow oscillations representing an oscillation between global neocortical states of increased (up-state) and decreased (down-state) neuronal firing temporally group thalamic spindle and hippocampal ripple activity, which both occur preferentially during slow oscillation up-states. Here we examined whether slow oscillations also group learning-induced increases in spindle and ripple activity, thereby providing time-frames of facilitated hippocampus-to-neocortical information transfer underlying the conversion of temporary into long-term memories. Learning (word-pairs in humans, odor-reward associations in rats) increased slow oscillation up-states and, in humans, shaped the timing of down-states. Slow oscillations grouped spindle and rat ripple activity into up-states under basal conditions. Prior learning produced in humans an increase in spindle activity focused on slow oscillation up-states. In rats, learning induced a distinct increase in spindle and ripple activity that was not synchronized to up-states. Event-correlation histograms indicated an increase in spindle activity with the occurrence of ripples. This increase was prolonged after learning, suggesting a direct temporal tuning between ripples and spindles. The lack of a grouping effect of slow oscillations on learning-induced spindles and ripples in rats, together with the less pronounced effects of learning on slow oscillations, presumably reflects a weaker dependence of odor learning on thalamo-neocortical circuitry. Slow oscillations might provide an effective temporal frame for hippocampus-to-neocortical information transfer only when thalamo-neocortical systems are already critically involved during learning.

ATP-Dependent Infra-Slow (< 0.1 Hz) Oscillations in Thalamic Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article								An increasing number of EEG and resting state fMRI studies in both humans and animals indicate that spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in cerebral activity at <0.1 Hz (infra-slow oscillations, ISOs) represent a fundamental component of brain functioning, being known to correlate with faster neuronal ensemble oscillations, regulate behavioural performance and influence seizure susceptibility. Although these oscillations have been commonly indicated to involve the thalamus their basic cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that various nuclei in the dorsal thalamus in vitro can express a robust ISO at similar to 0.005-0.1 Hz that is greatly facilitated by activating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and/or Ach receptors (AchRs). This ISO is a neuronal population phenomenon which modulates faster gap junction (GJ)-dependent network oscillations, and can underlie epileptic activity when AchRs or mGluRs are stimulated excessively. In individual thalamocortical neurons the ISO is primarily shaped by rhythmic, long-lasting hyperpolarizing potentials which reflect the activation of A1 receptors, by ATP-derived adenosine, and subsequent opening of Ba2+-sensitive K+ channels. We argue that this ISO has a likely non-neuronal origin and may contribute to shaping ISOs in the intact brain.

Resting GABA concentration predicts peak gamma frequency and fMRI amplitude in response to visual stimulation in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; magnetoencephalography; oscillations	NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; IN-VITRO; INHIBITION; NEURONS; CORTEX; BRAIN; BOLD; MECHANISMS; CONTRAST; SIGNALS	Functional imaging of the human brain is an increasingly important technique for clinical and cognitive neuroscience research, with functional MRI (fMRI) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of neural oscillations being 2 of the most popular approaches. However, the neural and physiological mechanisms that generate these responses are only partially understood and sources of interparticipant variability in these measures are rarely investigated. Here, we test the hypothesis that the properties of these neuroimaging metrics are related to individual levels of cortical inhibition by combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify resting GABA concentration in the visual cortex, MEG to measure stimulus-induced visual gamma oscillations and fMRI to measure the BOLD response to a simple visual grating stimulus. Our results demonstrate that across individuals gamma oscillation frequency is positively correlated with resting GABA concentration in visual cortex (R = 0.68; P< 0.02), BOLD magnitude is inversely correlated with resting GABA (R = -0.64; P < 0.05) and that gamma oscillation frequency is strongly inversely correlated with the magnitude of the BOLD response (R = -0.88; P < 0.001). Our results are therefore supportive of recent theories suggesting that these functional neuroimaging metrics are dependent on the excitation/inhibition balance in an individual's cortex and have important implications for the interpretation of functional imaging results, particularly when making between-group comparisons in clinical research.

The DFA(detrended fluctuation analysis) is used to quantify the fractal-like scaling properties of the EEG. In this paper, we have used the DFA method to estimate the depth of anesthesia. The power-law exponent of DFA (detrended fluctuation analysis) of the brain waves during surgeries was used to measure the depth of anesthesia. We studied 12 ASA I or II adult patients. Patients with history of dementia and neurological disorder are excluded. EEG data, obtained from 9 patients, was used to experiment. The data was obtained for 10 minutes one day before the surgery and from the stage of injecting the anesthesia in the surgery room, up to the stage of anesthesia suspension and the recovery of the patient, and the data was obtained for 10 minutes one day after the surgery. We analyzed with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a scaling analysis method that quantifies a slope of the result of DFA to represent the correlation properties of a time series. The scaling exponent, the result of DFA, provides a quantitative measure of correlation from the EEG. Among the scaling exponent alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3, we know that, alpha 1 and alpha 3 were well appeared to discriminate the depth of anesthesia. And these parameters as useful indicators of depth of anesthesia may be used are expected.

Design: Cross-sectional study involving validated sleep questionnaires, neuropsychological scales, and polysomnographic recordings. Setting: Sleep laboratory in academic center. Participants: Sixteen subjects with developmental dyslexia (mean age 10.8 years) and 11 normally reading children (mean age 10.1 years). All the subjects underwent overnight polysomnographic recording; EEG power spectra were computed from the Cz derivation and spindle density was calculated during sleep stages N2. Intervention: N/A Measurements and Results: Dyslexic children showed an increase in power of frequency bands between 0.5-3 Hz and 11-12 Hz in stage N2 and between 0.5-1 Hz in stage N3; they also showed significantly increased spindle density during N2. The power of the sigma band in N2 was positively correlated with the Word reading and MT reading tests; similarly, spindle density was significantly correlated with the Word reading test. The increased spindle activity and EEG sigma power in dyslexic subjects were found to be correlated with the degree of dyslexic impairment. Conclusions: The correlation found between sleep spindle activity and reading abilities in developmental dyslexia supports the hypothesis of a role for NREM sleep and spindles in sleep-related neurocognitive processing.

Inhibition of NMDARs in the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus produces delta frequency bursting	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						resting potential; nucleus reticularis; thalamus; NMDA receptor; burst; delta oscillation; TCD	RAT-BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; DOPAMINE HYPOTHESIS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AMBIENT GLUTAMATE; TONIC ACTIVATION; CA2+ CHANNELS; IN-VITRO; EXPRESSION	Injection of NMDAR antagonist into the thalamus can produce delta frequency EEG oscillations in the thalamocortical system. It is surprising that an antagonist of an excitatory neurotransmitter should trigger such activity, and the mechanism is unknown. One hypothesis is that the antagonist blocks excitation of GABAergic cells, thus producing disinhibition. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of NMDAR antagonist (APV) on cells of the nucleus reticularis (nRT) in rat brain slices, a thalamic nucleus that can serve as a pacemaker for thalamocortical delta oscillations and that is composed entirely of GABAergic neurons. We found, unexpectedly, that nRT cells are hyperpolarized by APV. This occurs because these cells have an unusual form of NMDAR (probably NR2C) that contributes inward current at resting potential in response to ambient glutamate. The hyperpolarization produced by APV is sufficient to deinactivate T-type calcium channels, and these trigger rhythmic bursting at delta frequency. The APV-induced delta frequency bursting is abolished by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, indicating that dopamine and NMDAR antagonist work synergistically to stimulate delta frequency bursting. Our results have significant implications concerning the electrophysiological basis of schizophrenia and bring together the NMDAR hypofunction, dopamine, and GABA theories of the disease. Our results suggest that NMDAR hypofunction and dopamine work synergistically on the GABAergic cells of the nRT to generate the delta frequency EEG oscillations, a thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) in the awake state that is an established abnormality in schizophrenia.

The current work further investigated the role of non-phase locked activity in dissociation of the neural processes of environmental and personal risks. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults when they identified risky and safe environmental or personal events depicted in words or phrases. Event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in association with risky and safe environmental and personal events were calculated using Morlet's wavelet analysis. We found that, relative to the identification of safe environmental events, the identification of risky environmental events induced increased theta band power at 260-380 ms over the frontal cortex and increased alpha band power after 700 ms with a wide scalp distribution. Moreover, theta band powers associated with the identification of risky environmental events correlated positively with subjective ratings of the risk degree of environmental events. In contrast, the identification of risky personal events was linked to decreased alpha band power at 740-900 ms with a wide scalp distribution compared with the identification of safe personal events. Our findings indicate that theta and alpha band neural oscillations are involved in differentiation between environmental and personal risks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sleep Slow Oscillations (SSOs) events are their EEG correlates. Each event has an origin site and propagates sweeping the scalp. While recent findings suggest a SSO key role in memory consolidation processes, the structure and the propagation of individual SSO events, as well as their modulation by sleep stages and cortical areas have not been well characterized so far. Methodology/Principal Findings: We detected SSO events in EEG recordings and we defined and measured a set of features corresponding to both wave shapes and event propagations. We found that a typical SSO shape has a transition to down state, which is steeper than the following transition from down to up state. We show that during SWS SSOs are larger and more locally synchronized, but less likely to propagate across the cortex, compared to NREM stage 2. Also, the detection number of SSOs as well as their amplitudes and slopes, are greatest in the frontal regions. Although derived from a small sample, this characterization provides a preliminary reference about SSO activity in healthy subjects for 32-channel sleep recordings. Conclusions/Significance: This work gives a quantitative picture of spontaneous SSO activity during NREM sleep: we unveil how SSO features are modulated by sleep stage, site of origin and detection location of the waves. Our measures on SSOs shape indicate that, as in animal models, onsets of silent states are more synchronized than those of neural firing. The differences between sleep stages could be related to the reduction of arousal system activity and to the breakdown of functional connectivity. The frontal SSO prevalence could be related to a greater homeostatic need of the heteromodal association cortices.

We want to determine whether all observer's main current occupation is Visual or not by investigating fixation patterns and EEG. Subjects were presented with auditory and Visual stimuli. In some conditions, they focused oil the auditory information whereas in others they searched or judged the visual stimuli. Observers made more fixations that are less cluttered in the visual compared to the auditory tasks, and they were less variable in their average fixation location. Fixated features revealed which target the observers were looking for. Gaze was not attracted more by salient features when performing the auditory task. 8-12 Hz EEG oscillations recorded over the parieto-occipital regions were stronger during the auditory task than during visual search. Our results are directly relevant for monitoring surveillance workers.

The features of the presented visual stimulus determined the type of cognitive task that should be solved. Methods: For each experimental task and everybody's subject FFT Analysis module calculated the total power histograms from a fixed frequency band (3-20 Hz or 8-13 Hz) for each 3-second EEG sample with 50% overlay and all electrodes. From the histograms the software derived two FFT single values - The average Total Power (TP) and Frequency at Maximum Power (FMP). Results: It has been shown that during the solution of cognitive tasks the marked changes of ongoing EEG activity appeared. The short lasting and localized amplitude decrease in rhythmic activity (ERD) and the change of EEG frequency were among the most frequent. The ERD extent was determined by an informational content of processed visual stimuli and by the site of scalp-recording electrode. A higher mental load related to the solution of cognitive tasks shifted the average FM to lower frequencies. Conclusion: The suitability of an analysis of ongoing EEG activity to uncover differences in people's brain activation patterns when engaged in performing cognitively demanding tasks was proved.

Theta oscillation is implicated in navigation and brain synchronization. In this study, EEG coherence was analyzed during 3 tasks: subjects (I) mentally simulated jogging along the walls of a gym and pressed a button when they imagined arriving at a corner (jogging imagery task), (2) thought of and memorized one digit after pressing a button 5 times and recalled the digits sequentially after pressing the button again (digit imagery task), and (3) pressed a button (button pressing task). The results indicated that theta-wave (4-8 Hz) power was significantly higher in the frontal and parietal regions during the digit and jogging imagery tasks. Coherence at the theta band showed almost no differences between the button pressing and digit imagery tasks. Coherence between the distant regions, especially between the frontal and parieto-occipital regions and between interhemispheric regions, was significantly higher during the jogging imagery task. Increase in theta power during the jogging imagery task reflects working memory load to manipulate internal information. Theta oscillation appears to play an important role in large-scale synchronization to form the functional neuronal networks required for mental navigation.

There has been considerable debate regarding the nature, triggers, and timing of automatisms in absence seizures. Objectives: To examine the frequency and nature of automatisms in new-onset absence seizures and assess the influence of the state of arousal, provocation, age, and epilepsy syndrome on the presence and type of automatisms. Design: Analysis of absence seizures through video electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Setting: British Columbia's Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Patients: Seventy consecutive children with new-onset untreated absence seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsy recruited between January 1, 1992, and June 30, 1997 Main Outcome Measures: Each seizure was analyzed for the presence and characteristics of automatisms. The influence of the following variables on the presence of automatisms was statistically analyzed: state of arousal (awake, drowsy, asleep), provocation (hyperventilation, photic stimulation), age, and epilepsy syndrome. Results: Automatisms occurred in 163 of 405 seizures (40%) in 53 of 70 children (76%). Automatisms were more likely in longer seizures and hyperventilation. Only 23% of spontaneous awake seizures had automatisms. Automatisms were similar for an individual child; however, automatisms were not present in all their seizures. Age, epilepsy syndrome, or state of alertness had no effect on the presence of automatisms. Conclusions: Automatisms are frequently seen during childhood absence seizures. The high frequency of automatisms during EEG recordings is predominantly due to the effect of hyperventilation. Their preponderance during longer seizures may relate to opportunity for automatisms to occur. The characteristic pattern of automatisms suggests a reactive phenomenon to internal and external stimuli.

These changes were restricted to the theta frequency range only and are related to location, frequency bands and drug effects. In our previous work we observed that visual event related oscillations elicited after the visual stimuli with a higher cognitive load, i.e. an oddball target, display lower amplitudes: between controls and AD subjects in delta frequency band without a drug effect, over the left and mid-central region. These differences between the visual evoked oscillations and the visual event related oscillations imply that there are at least two different cognitive circuits that are activated upon visual stimuli in AD patients.

Characterisation of cortical activity in response to deep brain stimulation of ventral-lateral nucleus: Modelling and experiment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Epilepsy; Deep brain stimulation; Ventral-lateral thalamic nucleus; Motor cortex; Mean-field model; Waterfall diagram; Frequency analysis	CENTROMEDIAN THALAMIC NUCLEUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; FIELD-THEORY; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY	Motivated by its success as a therapeutic treatment in other neurological disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is currently being trialled in a number of patients with drug unresponsive epilepsies. However, the mechanisms by which DBS interferes with neuronal activity linked to the disorder are not well understood. Furthermore, there is a need to identify optimized values of parameters (for example in amplitude/frequency space) of the stimulation protocol with which one aims to achieve the desired outcome. In this paper we characterise the system response to stimulation, to gain an understanding of the role different brain regions play in generating the output observed in EEG. We perform a number of experiments in healthy rats, where the ventral-lateral thalamic nucleus is stimulated using a train of square-waves with different frequency and amplitudes. The response to stimulation in the motor cortex is recorded and the drive-response relationship over frequency/amplitude space is considered. Subsequently, we compare the experimental data with simulations of a mean-field model, finding good agreement between the output of the model and the experimental data - both in the time and frequency domains - when considering a transition to oscillatory activity in the cortex as the frequency of stimulation is increased. Overall, our study suggests that mean-field models can appropriately characterise the stimulus-response relationship of DBS in healthy animals. In this way, it constitutes a first step towards the goal of developing a closed-loop feedback control protocol for suppressing epileptic activity, by adaptively adjusting the stimulation protocol in response to EEG activity.

These evoked responses can be used to assess the hearing capabilities of a subject in an objective, automatic fashion. Usually, the detection protocol is accomplished by frequency-domain techniques, such as magnitude-squared coherence, whose estimation is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of several data segments. In practice, the FFT-based spectrum may spread out the energy of a given frequency to its side bins and this escape of energy in the spectrum is called spectral leakage. The distortion of the spectrum due to leakage may severely compromise statistical significance of objective detection. This work presents an offline, a posteriori method for spectral leakage minimization in the frequency-domain analysis of ASSRs using coherent sampling criterion and interpolation in time. The technique was applied to the local field potentials of 10 Wistar rats and the results, together with those from simulated data, indicate that a leakage-free analysis of ASSRs is possible for any dataset if the methods showed in this paper were followed.

We investigated whether oscillatory brain responses to globally or locally directed cue stimuli predict behavioral performance in subsequent target processing. Induced alpha band (8-12 Hz) amplitudes in the pre-stimulus interval were measured separately for the global and the local level, where individual trials were assigned to one of three groups according to the response speed towards incongruent stimuli. Fast responses to local features were associated with high alpha amplitudes in the right centro-parietal cortex, whereas fast responses to global forms were associated with high alpha in left centro-parietal cortex. For trials with slower responses, the pattern of hemispheric differences was diminished or even reversed. It is interpreted that the left and the right parietal cortex exert top-down control over hierarchical processing by inhibiting stimulus representations in one hemisphere.

Because the visual stimulus itself is unchanged, this variability in conscious awareness is likely related to changes in the brain. Here we show that the phase of EEG alpha rhythm measured over posterior brain regions can reliably predict both subsequent visual detection and stimulus-elicited cortical activation levels in a metacontrast masking paradigm. When a visual target presentation coincides with the trough of an alpha wave, cortical activation is suppressed as early as 100 ms after stimulus onset, and observers are less likely to detect the target. Thus, during one alpha cycle lasting 100 ms, the human brain goes through a rapid oscillation in excitability, which directly influences the probability that an environmental stimulus will reach conscious awareness. Moreover, ERPs to the appearance of a fixation cross before the target predict its detection, further suggesting that cortical excitability level may mediate target detection. A novel theory of cortical inhibition is proposed in which increased alpha power represents a "pulsed inhibition" of cortical activity that affects visual awareness.

In rats, the extent of HFOs (>200 Hz) is correlated with seizure frequency. We studied whether the same applies to patients with focal epilepsy. Thirty-nine patients with intracerebral EEG sampled at 2000 Hz were studied for interictal ripples (80-250 Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) and spikes. Seizure frequency before implantation was compared to numbers of channels with HFOs (>1 /min). Analyses were repeated for HFO rates of >5, >10 and >20. Separate analyses were done for 25 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy only and for a selection of similar unilateral temporal channels in 12 patients. No linear correlation or trend was found relating the number of channels with HFOs and seizure frequency. There was a linear positive correlation between the number of channels with more than 20 FRs/min and seizure frequency. The hypothesis that the more tissue generating HFOs, the higher the seizure frequency, was not confirmed, though there might be a correlation for high FR rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It was hypothesized that individuals with high BAS sensitivity would experience higher emotional arousal in the reward expectancy situation and lower in the punishment expectancy situation than individuals with low BAS activity. The level of emotional arousal indicated by theta spectral power, and general cortical excitability indicated by high frequency oscillations (HFO), were measured in a sample of young people who filled out Carver and White's Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Approach System (BIS/BAS) scales. Frontal theta and HFO increased in high BAS scorers during expectation of reward and decreased during expectation of punishment. In low BAS scorers spectral powers of theta and HFO increased, contrary to those for the punishment cue, and decreased for reward cue. Theta-gamma coupling increased in high Drive scorers (those above the median) in reward and in low Drive scorers (those who appeared to be below the median split on this scale) in punishment situation.

Error detection and correction are essential components of motor skill learning. These processes have been well characterized in cognitive psychology using electroencephalography (EEG) to record an event-related potential (ERP) called error-related negativity (ERN). However, it is unclear whether this ERP component is sensitive to the magnitude of the error made in a sensorimotor adaptation task. In the present study, we tested the function of error-related activity in a visuomotor adaptation task. To examine whether error size is reflected in the ERP, two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to either a small (30 degrees) or large (45 degrees) rotation of the visual feedback display. Each participant's trials were sorted into large and small error trials using a median split to examine potential error magnitude waveform differences. We also examined these trial types at the early and late stages of adaptation. There were no group differences for the behavioral or neural measures; however, waveforms from large error trials were significantly different from small error trials. The waveforms also changed as a function of practice as early adaptation waveforms were larger than late adaptation waveforms. The observed ERP component reflected differences in error magnitude with the amount of activity corresponding to the size of the error. Movement monitoring potentials likely affected the frequency and time course of the waveform so that it did not resemble the typical ERN; however, error-related activity was still distinguishable. The present findings are discussed in terms of current theories of the ERN as well as skill acquisition.

Particularly, the method extracts features using the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution combined with the McAulay-Quatieri sinusoidal model and identifies abnormal neural discharges. We propose a new feature based on the length of the track that, combined with energy and frequency features, allows to isolate a continuous energy trace from another oscillations when an epileptic seizure is beginning. We evaluate our approach using data consisting of 16 different seizures from 6 epileptic patients. The results show that our extraction method is a suitable approach for automatic seizure detection, and opens the possibility of formulating new criteria to detect and analyze abnormal EEGs.

When alternating between the two conditions, electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have reported the modulation of alpha band (8-12 Hz) oscillation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found modulation of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. The neuronal correlates of the two modulations are not well understood. In the present study, we conducted an eyes-open-eyes-closed human experiment with simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. We investigated the spatial and temporal correlations between the alpha modulation and BOLD response. Besides the neural network generating the eyes-open-eyes-closed-task-induced modulation, we further examined other neural networks involved in the task. Their spatial and temporal relationship with the alpha modulation was investigated.

Two classes of stimuli were presented to subjects: (1) a field of randomly positioned and oriented Gabor patches (no contour) or (2) the same field of Gabor patches in which a subset of the Gabor patches were oriented in such a way as to give rise to the percept of an ellipse (contour). To measure the electroencephalograph (EEG) responses to the contour without awareness, trials during which a contour was present but not perceived were compared to trials where no contour was present and its absence was correctly indicated. At beta frequencies, the presence of the contour reduced the evoked potential (EP) power approximately 130-230 ms post-stimulus. Coherence in the theta band were also reduced when a contour was present but not perceived. Thus, modulations of the EP take place when a contour is presented even without the subjects' awareness. To explore the correlates of awareness, trials during which the subject correctly indicated the presence of a contour were compared to trials in which the object was not detected. Consistent across subjects, awareness caused an increase in the EP power in the beta range around 130-230 ms post-stimulus. These results suggest that the neural response to an object and awareness of that object are dissociable in EEG recordings. Published by Elsevier B.V.

There are some studies in Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to analyze the functional connectivity between cortical areas with the oscillations feature of neuronal activity. However, it is also important to observe the functional connectivity through temporal correlation between cortical areas. We proposed a beamformer-based approach which exploits a maximum correlation criterion to maximize the significance level of correlation between brain activities. This criterion leads to a closed-form solution of the dipole orientation. Experiments with simulation data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, necessity, and accuracy of the proposed method.

Besides linear methods introduced in the field of EEG analysis fifty years ago, a number of studies have been dedicated to the development of nonlinear methods, mostly because of the nonlinear nature of mechanisms at the origin of EEG signals. Recent studies showed the potential value of methods commonly used in nonlinear physics (see Chap. 15). Three families of methods (linear and nonlinear regression, phase synchronization, and generalized synchronization) are reviewed. Their performances are evaluated on the basis of a simulation model in which a coupling parameter can be tuned between populations of neurons generating bivariate EEG time-series. This evaluation is performed according to quantitative criteria. The main findings of this evaluation are the following. First, some of the methods are insensitive to the coupling parameter. Second, results were found to be dependent on signal properties. In particular, the broadening of the frequency band is a parameter that strongly influences the performances. Third, and generally speaking, there is no 'universal' method for measuring statistical couplings among signals. Indeed, none of the studied methods performs better than the other ones for the two studied situations (background and epileptic activity). Finally, linear and nonlinear regression methods were found to be sensitive to the coupling parameter in all situations and showed either average or good performances. This latter point leads the authors to conclude that these "robust" methods should be applied before using more sophisticated methods.

However. this approach has several shortcomings including its instability to model multiple and deep located dipole sources and the interference of background noise may hamper the Sensitivity, stability, and precision of the estimated dipoles. This article validates different dipole estimation techniques to find the most optimal combination of different analysis principles using both Simulations and recordings. Electroencephalogram data were simulated with six known Source locations. First, a dataset was simulated With Sources chosen to mimic somatosensory-evoked potentials to electrical stimuli. Additionally, 20 further datasets Were simulated each containing six randomly located and oriented Sources. The simulated sources included superficial, deep, and simultaneously active Sources. Furthermore, somatosensory-evoked potentials to median nerve stimuli were recorded from one subject. On both simulated and recorded evoked potential data, three different methods of signal decomposition were compared: independent component analysis (ICA), second-order blind identification (SOBI), and multichannel matching pursuit (NIMP). For inverse modeling of the brain Sources. the DIPFIT function of the EEGLAB software was used on raw and decomposed data. MMP was able to separate all simulated components that corresponded to superficial, deep, and simultaneously active Sources. ICA and SOBI were only able to find components that Corresponded to superficial Sources. For the 20 randomized simulations, the results from the evoked potential simulation were reproduced. Inverse modeling oil NIMP components (atoms) was better than oil ICA or SOBI components (P < 0.001) DIPFIT on MMP atoms localized 99.2% of the simulated dipoles in correct areas with their correct time/frequency distribution. DIPFIT on ICA and SOBI components localized 35%, and 39.6%, respectively of the simulated dipoles in correct areas. As for the real-evoked potentials recorded in one subject, DIPFIT oil MMP atoms allowed LIS to build a dipole model closer to the Current physiological knowledge than dipole modeling of ICA and SOBI components. The results show that using MMP before inverse modeling is a reliable way to noninvasively estimate cortical activation.

We examine the relationship between quantitative EEG measures and metabolic imaging in epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG (icEEG) analysis for seizure localization. Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and neocortical epilepsy (NE) were studied. Metabolic imaging was performed with MR spectroscopic imaging using N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cr). All data were acquired from the mesial temporal lobe such that a direct comparison of the same anatomical regions between the two groups could be performed. While no difference was seen in the total power recorded from the mesial temporal lobe, the MTLE group had significantly greater power in the high frequency bands. There was a significant positive exponential relationship between total icEEG power with NAA/Cr in MTLE, R = +0.84 and p < 0.001, which was not seen in NE. There was also a significant negative relationship between fractional gamma power with NAA/Cr in MTLE, R = -0.66 and p < 0.02, also not seen in NE. These data argue that within the seizure onset zone, the tight correlation between total power and NAA/Cr suggests that total electrical output is powered by available mitochondrial function. These data are also consistent with the hypothesis that high frequency activity is an abnormal manifestation of tissue injury. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pan, J. W.; Spencer, D.

To help achieve a better understanding of these mechanisms, we studied the extracellular electrically evoked responses in the hippocampi of mice during rapid kindling. Kindling protocol was achieved by stimulating the dorsal right hippocampus six times daily for four days using bipolar electrodes to produce sub-convulsive electrical discharges. Motor responses and analyzed electroencephalographic recordings showed progression from partial complex seizures to generalized seizures associated with different consecutive patterns within the afterdischarges. A spike-wave pattern appeared immediately after stimulation in combination with a poly-spike complex superimposed over the wave (AD1). AD1 was followed by a poly-spike complex (AD2), which was followed by a progressive modification of repetitive spikes (AD3). An ictal depression event was observed at the end of each AD3. Theta oscillations were observed at stage 1-2 of kindling, while beta/gamma oscillations appeared within AD2, associated with stage 4-5 from Racine's score. Benzodiazepine, a GABA (A) agonist (Diazepam) administered at non-sedative doses and only on days 3 and 4 of kindling, limited beta and gamma frequency bands and the progression of seizure severity, suggesting that the failure of GABA (A) agonism mediates the propagation or generalization of seizures. We conclude that different phases of afterdischarge occur during kindling and that high frequencies mediate generalization of seizures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mental fatigue was induced by 2 h of continuous performance; after which subjects were motivated by using social comparison and monetary reward as motivating factors to perform well for an additional 20 min. EEG coherence was used as a measure of synchronization of brain activity. Electrodes of interest were identified using a data-driven pre-processing method (ten Caat, M., Lorist, M.M., Bezdan, E, Roerdink, J.B.T.M., Maurits, N.M., 2008a. High-density EEG coherence analysis using functional units applied to mental fatigue. J. Neurosci. Meth. 171, 271-278; ten Caat, M., Maurits, N.M. and Roerdink, J.B.T.M., 2008b. Data-driven visualization and group analysis of multichannel EEG coherence with functional units. IEEE T. Vis. Comp. Gr. 14, 756-771). Performance on repetition trials was faster and more accurate than on switch trials. EEG data revealed more pronounced, frequency specific fronto-parietal network activation in switch trials, while power density was higher in repetition trials. The effects of mental fatigue on power and coherence were widespread, and not limited to specific frequency bands. Moreover, these effects were independent of specific task manipulations. This increase in neuronal activity and stronger synchronization between neural networks did not result in more efficient performance; response speed decreased and the number of errors increased in fatigued subjects. A modulation of the dopamine system is proposed as a common mechanism underlying the observed the fatigue effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) study	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; Spike; Delayed effect of the spike; EEG; LORETA	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; REACTION-TIME; SPIKES; EPILEPSY; ABNORMALITIES; PERCEPTION	Collating the findings regarding the role of focal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on CNS functions raises the possibility that IEDs might have negative impact that outlasts the duration of the spike-and-wave complexes. The aim of this study was the electrophysiological demonstration of the "delayed effect" of the IEDs. 19-channel, linked-ears referenced, digital waking EEG records of 11 children (aged 6-14 years, eight with idiopathic, three with cryptogenic focal epilepsy, showing a single spike focus) were retrospectively selected from our database. A minimum of 20 (preferably, 30), 2-s epochs containing a single focal spike-and-wave complex were selected (Spike epochs). Thereafter, Postspike-1 (Ps1), Postspike-2 (Ps2) and Postspike-3 (Ps3) epochs were selected, representing the first and second seconds (Ps1), the third and fourth seconds (Ps2) and the fifth and sixth seconds (Ps3) after the Spike epoch, respectively. Interspike epochs (is) were selected at a distance at least 10s after the Spike epoch. Individual analysis: the frequency of interest (FOI = the individual frequency of the wave component of the IEDs), and the region of interest (ROI = the site of the IEDs) were identified by reading the raw EEG waveform and the instant power spectrum. Very narrow band LORETA (tow resolution electromagnetic tomography) analysis at the FOI and ROI was carried out. Age-adjusted, Z-transformed LORETA "activity" (=current source density, ampers/meters squared) was compared in the Spike, Ps1, Ps2, Ps3 and Is epochs. Findings: the greatest (uppermost pathological) Z-scores and the greatest spatial extension of the LORETA-abnormality were always found in the Spike epochs, followed by the gradual decrease of activity in terms of severity and spatial extension in the Ps1, Ps2, Ps3 epochs. The lowest (baseline) level and extension of the abnormality was found in the Is epochs. Group analysis: average values of activity across the patients were computed for the temporal decrease of the abnormality. Findings: a clear tendency for the decrease of abnormality was demonstrated. Conclusion: the "delayed effect" of the IEDs was demonstrated electrophysiologically and quantified. The method may be utilized in the individual assessment of the effect of IEDs on cortical activity, the degree and temporo-spatial extension of the abnormality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to study whether the post-imagery beta rebound is a suitable feature for a simple "brain switch". Such a brain switch is a specifically designed brain-computer interface (BCI) with the aim to detect only one predefined brain state (e.g. EEG pattern) in ongoing brain activity. Method: One EEG (Laplacian) recorded at the vertex during cue-based brisk foot motor imagery was analysed in 5 healthy subjects. The peri-imagery ERD and the post-imagery beta rebound (ERS) were analysed in detail between 6 and 40 Hz and classified with two support vector machines. Results: The ERD was detected in ongoing EEG (simulation of asynchronous BCI) with a true positive rate (TPR) of 28.4% +/- 13.5 and the beta rebound with a TPR of 59.2% +/- 20.3. In single runs with 30 cues each, the TPR for beta rebound detection was 78.6% +/- 12.8. The false positive rate was always kept below 10%. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the beta rebound at Cz during foot motor imagery is a relatively stable and reproducible phenomenon detectable in single EEG trials. Significance: Our results indicate that the beta rebound is a suitable feature to realize a "brain switch" with one single EEG (Laplacian) channel only.

The Electrocorticogram Signal Can Be Modulated With Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus in the Hemiparkinsonian Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; FIELD POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	Lehmkuhle MJ, Bhangoo SS, Kipke DR. The electrocorticogram signal can be modulated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in the hemiparkinsonian rat. J Neurophysiol 102: 1811-1820, 2009. First published July 22, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.90844.2008. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- lesioned parkinsonian rat have shown an increase in the power of cortical beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillations ipsilateral to the lesion. The power of these oscillations is decreased with dopamine agonist administration. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of an electrode implanted in the subthalamic nucleus alters the power of cortical beta and gamma oscillations in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals. These alterations are dependent on stimulation frequency, charge, and amplitude/pulse width. Oscillations were significantly reduced during 200- and 350-Hz stimulation. A minimum charge of 4 nC was required to elicit a reduction in oscillation power. A number of amplitude and pulse width combinations that reached 4 nC were tested; it was found that only the combinations of 33 mu A/120 mu s and 65 mu A/60 mu s significantly reduced cortical oscillations. The reduction in beta/gamma oscillation power due to deep brain stimulation (DBS) was consistent with a significant reduction in the animals' rotational behavior, a typical symptom of parkinsonism in the rat. A significant shift from high beta to low gamma was observed in the peak frequencies of ECoG recordings while animals were at rest versus walking on a treadmill. However, DBS exhibited no differential effect on oscillations between these two states. EEG recordings from rodent models of DBS may provide surrogate information about the neural signatures of Parkinson's disease relative to the efficacy of DBS.	[Lehmkuhle, M. J.; Kipke, D.

It is known that most BCI based application involves non-invasive EEG signals in combination with machine learning algorithms for control of devices. Although there has been some real- time implementation of BCI including cursor movements controlled by a person's thoughts, they have not been done as a portable device, but rather as a laboratory experiment controlled using multi- core processors and computers. This paper focuses on real- time implementation of BCI for motor imagery tasks using a floating point DSP processor (TMS320C6713DSK). The proposed work involves FIR based preprocessing Filter to remove extraneous noise including Electrooculogram (EOG) and Electromyographic (EMG) signals followed by feature extraction using time-frequency domain features. The implications of this kind of a development in Brain- Computer Interface would be tremendous since the whole system can be made into a portable device or a System on a Chip (SoC).

Nucleus Accumbens Deep Brain Stimulation Produces Region-Specific Alterations in Local Field Potential Oscillations and Evoked Responses In Vivo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE-DISORDER; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; HZ OSCILLATION	Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) region is an effective therapeutic avenue for several psychiatric disorders that are not responsive to traditional treatment strategies. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which DBS achieves therapeutic effects remain unclear. We showed previously that high-frequency (HF) NAC DBS suppressed pyramidal cell firing and enhanced slow local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) via antidromic activation of corticostriatal recurrent inhibition. Using simultaneous multisite LFP recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats, we now show that NAC DBS delivered for 90 min at high or low frequency (LF) selectively affects spontaneous and evoked LFP oscillatory power and coherence within and between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral OFC, mediodorsal thalamus (MD), and NAC. Compared with LF or sham DBS, HFDBS enhanced spontaneous slow oscillations and potentiated evoked LFP responses only in OFC. HF DBS also produced widespread increases in spontaneous beta and gammapower and enhanced coherent beta activity between MD and all other regions. In contrast, LFDBS elevated theta power in MD and NAC. Analysis of acute NAC-induced oscillations showed that HF DBS increased and LF DBS decreased induced relative gamma coherence compared with sham DBS. These data suggest that HF (therapeutic) and LF (possibly deleterious) NAC DBS produce distinct region-specific and frequency band-specific changes in LFP oscillations. NAC DBS may achieve therapeutic effects by enhancing rhythmicity and synchronous inhibition within and between afferent structures, thereby normalizing function of a neural circuit that shows aberrant activity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.

To elucidate whether the impairment of the PRF is a general phenomenon during status epilepticus, the focal-cortical 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) application was compared with other epilepsy models. The presence of "dark" neurons in the PRF was investigated by the sensitive silver method of Gallyas in rats sacrificed at 3 h after focal 4-AP crystal or systemic 4-AP, pilocarpine, or kainic acid application. The behavioral signs of the developing epileptic seizures were scored in all rats. The EEG activity was recorded in eight rats. Results: Regardless of the initiating drug or method of administration, "dark" neurons were consistently found in the PRF of animals entered the later phases of status epilepticus. EEG recordings demonstrated the presence of slow oscillations (1.5-2.5 Hz) simultaneously with the appearance of giant "dark" neurons in the PRF. Conclusion: We argue that the observed slow oscillation corresponds to the late periodic epileptiform discharge phase of status epilepticus, and that the PRF may be involved in the progression of status epilepticus.

EPILEPSIA			English	Review						Epilepsy; High-frequency oscillations; Fast ripples; Epileptogenesis; Epileptogenicity	HUMAN EPILEPTIC HIPPOCAMPUS; HZ ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FIRING PATTERNS; FAST RIPPLES; BEHAVING RAT; IN-VIVO; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTRACEREBRAL EEG	High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the 80-200 Hz range can be recorded from normal hippocampus and parahippocampal structures of humans and animals. They are believed to reflect inhibitory field potentials, which facilitate information transfer by synchronizing neuronal activity over long distances. HFOs in the range of 250-600 Hz (fast ripples, FRs) are pathologic and are readily recorded from hippocampus and parahippocampal structures of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as rodent models of this disorder. These oscillations, and similar HFOs recorded from neocortex of patients, appear to identify brain tissue capable of spontaneous ictogenesis and are believed to reflect the neuronal substrates of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. The distinction between normal and pathologic HFOs (pHFOs), however, cannot be made on the basis of frequency alone, as oscillations in the FR frequency range can be recorded from some areas of normal neocortex, whereas oscillations in the ripple frequency range are present in epileptic dentate gyrus where normal ripples never occur and, therefore, appear to be pathologic. The suggestion that FRs may be harmonics of normal ripples is unlikely, because of their spatially distinct generators, and evidence that FRs reflect synchronized firing of abnormally bursting neurons rather than inhibitory field potentials. These synchronous population spikes, however, can fire at ripple frequencies, and their harmonics appear to give rise to FRs. Investigations into the fundamental neuronal processes responsible for pHFOs could provide insights into basic mechanisms of epilepsy. The potential for pHFOs to act as biomarkers for epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity is also discussed.

Methods: Twenty children (8-12 years) and twenty students (21-26 years) were studied. The synchronization likelihood was used to evaluate the interregional synchronization of different EEG frequency bands in children and adults, at rest and during math. Then, graphs were constructed and characterized in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall integration (path length) and the "optimal" organization of the connectivity i.e., the small world network (SWN). Results: The main findings were: (i) Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent in adults. (ii) Decrease of the optimal SWN organization of the alpha2 band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both situations in adults. Conclusion: There are interesting findings related to the two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization. In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher efficiency, reduced connectivity is expressed by lower synchronization and lower mean values of the graph parameters in adults.

Antiepileptic drug treatment necessarily confounds analyses of progressive changes in human patients with acquired epilepsy. Here, we describe experiments testing the hypothesis that development of acquired epilepsy begins as a continuous process of increased seizure frequency (i.e., proportional to probability of a spontaneous seizure) that ultimately plateaus. Using nearly continuous surface cortical and bilateral hippocampal recordings with radiotelemetry and semiautomated seizure detection, the frequency of electrographically recorded seizures (both convulsive and nonconvulsive) was analyzed quantitatively for similar to 100 d after kainate-induced status epilepticus in adult rats. The frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures was not a step function of time (as implied by the "latent period"); rather, seizure frequency increased as a sigmoid function of time. The distribution of interseizure intervals was nonrandom, suggesting that seizure clusters (i.e., short interseizure intervals) obscured the early stages of progression, and may have contributed to the increase in seizure frequency. These data suggest that (1) the latent period is the first of many long interseizure intervals and a poor measure of the time frame of epileptogenesis, (2) epileptogenesis is a continuous process that extends much beyond the first spontaneous recurrent seizure, (3) uneven seizure clustering contributes to the variability in occurrence of epileptic seizures, and (4) the window for antiepileptogenic therapies aimed at suppressing acquired epilepsy probably extends well past the first clinical seizure.

In this paper, three families of methods (linear and nonlinear regression, phase synchronization, and generalized synchronization) are reviewed. Their performances were evaluated according to a model-based methodology in which a priori knowledge about the underlying relationship between systems that generate output signals is available. This approach allowed us to relate the interdependence measures computed by connectivity methods to the actual values of the coupling parameter explicitly represented in various models of signal generation. Results showed that: (i) some of the methods were insensitive to the coupling parameter; (ii) results were dependent on signal properties (broad band versus narrow band); (iii) there was no "ideal" method, i.e., none of the methods performed better than the other ones in all studied situations. Nevertheless, regression methods showed sensitivity to the coupling parameter in all tested models with average or good performances. Therefore, it is advised to first apply these "robust" methods in order to characterize brain connectivity before using more sophisticated methods that require specific assumptions about the underlying model of relationship. In all cases, it is recommended to compare the results obtained from different connectivity methods to get more reliable interpretation of measured quantities with respect to underlying coupling. In addition, time-frequency methods are also recommended when coupling in specific frequency sub-bands ("frequency-locking") is likely to occur as in epilepsy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

While it is widely accepted that neuroscientific data do contribute to theories on cognition in some way, their specific value is most often not explicitly described. One central issue is the validity of the inference from neuroscientific data to underlying cognitive processes, which depends on the characteristic properties of the respective neuroscientific method. In the first part of this review, we discuss the conditions under which data from functional MRI (fMRI), surface EEG, and intracranial EEG recordings may be interpreted with respect to associated cognitive processes. We will show that due to the different signal characteristics in each domain, cognitive processes at different levels can be captured. In the second part, we address the specific contribution made by neuroscientific data to the understanding of cognition. We show that neuroscientific findings may move beyond psychological theories based on purely behavioral data in several respects, which again depend on the imaging modality. Taken together, we suggest that neuroscientific data contribute to the understanding of cognition by adding specific biological constraints and by extending the explanatory potential of psychological theories.

Methods: A mental arithmetic task was used in which addition and working memory effort was required. EEG spectra with an emphasis on the theta band, error rate and reaction time were analyzed in 5 (control, task, placebo-task, low-dose task [0.2 g/kg alcohol], high-dose task [0.4 g/kg alcohol]) conditions. Blood alcohol concentrations were measured. Results: Reaction time was shortest in the placebo condition. No significant alcohol effect was seen for error rate. Task-related significant theta power increase was observed especially in the frontal area and in the left hemisphere which was reversed, although not in a significant way, by alcohol. Conclusion: No detrimental alcohol effect was seen on behavioral indices of task performance. However, the ethanol-induced moderate reduction of the task-related frontally dominant theta increase, probably corresponding to working memory demand, is a modest but clear electrophysiological sign of alcohol effect in this low-dose range.

Detecting seizure origin using basic, multiscale population dynamic measures: Preliminary findings	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Focal epilepsy; Neocortex; Seizure onset detection; Seizure localization	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EEG; ONSET; PATTERNS; NETWORK; PROPAGATION; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; BRAIN	Many types of electrographic seizures are readily identifiable by direct visual examination of electroencephalographic or electrocorticographic recordings. This process can, however, be painstakingly slow, and much effort has been expended to automate the process using various dynamic properties of epileptiform waveforms. As methods have become more subtle and powerful they have been used for seizure Subclassification, seizure prediction, and seizure onset identification and localization. Here we concentrate on the last, with reference to seizures of neocortical origin. We briefly review some of the methods used and introduce preliminary results from a very simple dynamic model based on key electrophysiological properties found in some seizure types: Occurrence of very fast oscillations (sometimes called ripples), excess gamma frequency oscillations. electroencephalographic/electrocorticographic flattening, and changes in global synchrony. We show how this multiscale analysis may reveal features unique to seizure onset and speculate on the underlying cellular and network phenomena responsible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Significant effects related to the sentence correctness were found only within gamma frequency range (similar to 30-100 Hz), with well-formed sentences showing higher gamma levels than sentences containing the violation. Lower gamma band (similar to 30-45 Hz) marked semantic violation at the level of the target word and did not show specific scalp topography. Instead, in addition to the same violation effect, analyses of the two upper gamma bands (upper-1 gamma: similar to 55-75 Hz; upper-2 gamma: similar to 75-100 Hz) revealed, for the word following the target, significant greater gamma levels for correct vs. incorrect sentences specifically over anterior right sites. The functional significance of gamma band and its contribution to psycholinguistic field are discussed, by highlighting its use as an additional tool, with respect to evoked potentials, for investigating linguistic network dynamics associated to sentence processing.

This approach is used, for example, in physics, in geology, and also when one tunes a musical instrument. In the present study, we employ transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to directly perturb a set of selected corticothalamic modules (Brodmann areas 19, 7, and 6) and high-density electroencephalogram to measure their natural frequency. TMS consistently evoked dominant alpha-band oscillations (8-12 Hz) in the occipital cortex, beta-band oscillations (13-20 Hz) in the parietal cortex, and fast beta/gamma-band oscillations (21-50 Hz) in the frontal cortex. Each cortical area tended to preserve its own natural frequency also when indirectly engaged by TMS through brain connections and when stimulated at different intensities, indicating that the observed oscillations reflect local physiological mechanisms. These findings were reproducible across individuals and represent the first direct characterization of the coarse electrophysiological properties of three associative areas of the human cerebral cortex. Most importantly, they indicate that, in healthy subjects, each corticothalamic module is normally tuned to oscillate at a characteristic rate. The natural frequency can be directly measured in virtually any area of the cerebral cortex and may represent a straightforward and flexible way to probe the state of human thalamocortical circuits at the patient's bedside.

Monitoring effects of acute hypoxia on brain cortical activity by using electromagnetic tomography	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Hypoxia; Prefrontal cortex; Beta EEG; sLORETA	HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; HIGH-ALTITUDE; EEG CHANGES; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES	The influences of inadequate brain oxygen supply on cognitive and sensorimotor performance are well documented. However, hemodynamic neuroimaging of brain processes under hypoxic conditions has been limited by the organisational constraints of the methodological framework. This study proposes that standardised low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) is a suitable and feasible tool for localising brain cortical processes under hypoxic conditions. Electroencephalograms (EEG) from 21 subjects were recorded prior to, and following 40 min of, exposure to normoxic (21 kPa PIO2) or hypoxic (12.7 kPa PIO2) conditions, Changes in brain cortical activity were localised using sLORETA. Subjects showed an increase in beta-1 activity following hypoxic exposure. This increase in activity was localised in the right superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 10). The results are discussed in terms of the relationship between the activation of prefrontal areas under hypoxic conditions and performance deficits. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that sLORETA can be a valuable and reliable alternative for brain imaging when hemodynamic approaches, such as PET or fMRI, are not feasible.

A novel synchronization measure for epileptic seizure detection based on Fourier series expansions	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Fourier series; epileptic seizure detection; synchronization measure; phase locking value	SCALP EEG; PREDICTION; ONSET	In this paper, we propose a novel signal synchronization measure termed phase-synchronization-index (PSI). The PSI can be utilized for the detection of epileptic seizures from EEG recordings. It exploits the fact that synchronous discharges during a seizure often manifest themselves in synchronous, periodic wave-forms in EEG signals recorded from electrodes close to the seizure onset and propagation zone. Using Fourier series expansions the PSI identifies dominant periodic signal components in signal pairs and calculates inner products of Fourier coefficient vectors. The incorporation of harmonic components of the synchronous oscillations yields advantages over comparable measures like phase locking value (PLV). Moreover, the PSI automatically identifies the most dominant frequency in the data, such that it does not rely on a predetermined fixed frequency range. In our experimental comparison of the PSI and the PLV we found clear advantages of the PSI for the detection of early seizure phenomena. In particular the increase of the PSI at seizure onset is more pronounced and the variance of the measure during pre-ictal time periods is lower than for the PLV.

Differential alpha coherence hemispheric patterns in men and women during pleasant and unpleasant musical emotions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG coherence; Alpha band; Emotion; Music; Sex differences; Men; Women	CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; LATERALIZATION; MEMORY; EEG	Potential sex differences in EEG coherent activity during pleasant and unpleasant musical emotions were investigated. Musical excerpts by Mahler, Bach, and Prodromides were played to seven men and seven women and their subjective emotions were evaluated in relation to alpha band intracortical coherence. Different brain links in specific frequencies were associated to pleasant and unpleasant emotions. Pleasant emotions (Mahler, Bach) increased upper alpha couplings linking left anterior and posterior regions. Unpleasant emotions (Prodromides) were sustained by posterior midline coherence exclusively in the right hemisphere in men and bilateral in women. Combined music induced bilateral oscillations among posterior sensory and predominantly left association areas in women. Consistent with their greater positive attributions to music, the coherent network is larger in women, both for musical emotion and for unspecific musical effects. Musical emotion entails specific coupling among cortical regions and involves coherent upper alpha activity between posterior association areas and frontal regions probably mediating emotional and perceptual integration. Linked regions by combined music suggest more working memory contribution in women and attention in men. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nature of this theta activity is still unclear, that is, whether it is related to error detection, conflict between responses or reinforcement learning processes. We examined slow (e.g., theta) and fast (e.g., gamma) brain rhythms related to rule violation. A time-frequency decomposition analysis on a wide range of frequencies band (0-95 Hz) indicated that the theta activity relates to evaluation processes, regardless of motor/action processes. Similarities between the theta activities found in rule-violation tasks and in tasks eliciting ERN/FRN suggest that this theta activity reflects the operation of general evaluation mechanisms. Moreover, significant effects were found also in fast brain rhythms. These effects might be related to the synchronization between different types of cognitive processes involving the fulfillment of a task (e.g., working memory, visual perception, mathematical calculation, etc.).

They are homeostatically regulated, they are thought to be linked to learning and plasticity processes and, at the same time, they are associated with marked changes in cortical information processing. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density (hd) EEG we can measure slow waves, induce and measure plastic changes in the cerebral cortex and directly assess corticocortical information transmission. In this manuscript we review the results of recent experiments in which TMS with hd-EEG is used to demonstrate (i) a causal link between cortical plastic changes and sleep slow waves and (ii) a causal link between slow waves and the decreased ability of thalamocortical circuits to integrate information and to generate conscious experience during NREM sleep. The data presented here suggest a unifying mechanism linking slow waves, plasticity and cortical information integration; moreover, they suggest that TMS can be used as a nonpharmacological means to controllably induce slow waves in the human cerebral cortex.

Twenty-one patients with medically intractable epilepsy participated in the study. The EEG signal was recorded using platinum electrodes implanted in several cortical and subcortical sites. Averaged 2 s EEG records were analyzed. Task-specific EEG changes were found in each patient, ERPs were derived from 92 electrodes used (96 % of possible cases). In the majority of analysed cases, ERPs were composed of several distinct components, and their duration was mostly longer than 1 s. The mean onset of the first ERP component was 158 +/- 132 ms after the stimulus (median 112 ms, minimum value 42 ms, maximum value 755 ms), and large variability of these onset times was found in all the investigated structures. Possible coherence between neural activities of remote brain sites was investigated by calculating running correlations between pairs of decomposed EEG records (alpha, beta 1, beta 2 frequency bands were used, total number of correlated pairs was 662 in each frequency band). The record pairs exhibiting highly correlated time segments represented 23 % of all the investigated pairs in alpha band, 7 % in beta 1 band, and 59 % in beta 2 band. In investigated 2 s record windows, such segments were distributed evenly, i.e. they were also found before the stimulus onset. In conclusion, the results have implicated the idea that a lot of recorded ERPs was more or less by-products of chance in spreading a signal within the neuronal network, and that their functional relevance was somewhat linked with the phenomenon of activity synchronization.

Cortical activity patterns in ADHD during arousal, activation and sustained attention	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Alpha power; EEG; CPT; Beta power	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; COGNITIVE-ENERGETIC MODEL; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EEG DIFFERENCES; QUANTITATIVE EEG; CHILDREN; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY	Objective: The goal of the present study is to test whether there are Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-related differences in brain electrical activity patterns across arousal, activation and vigilance states. Method: The sample consists of 80 adults (38 with ADHD and 42 non-ADHD controls) who were recruited for a family study on the genetics of ADHD. Patterns of cortical activity were measured using electro-encephalography (EEG) during baseline and sustained attention conditions and compared according to ADHD diagnostic status. Cortical activity was examined separately for the first, middle, and last 5-min of the sustained attention task to assess whether patterns differed over time and according to ADHD status. Results: In frontal and parietal regions, patterns of activation in the alpha (8-10 Hz) range differed according to ADHD status, indicating increased cortical arousal among ADHD subjects. Beta power (13-14 and 17-18 Hz) also differed between ADHD and controls, indicating increased cortical activation is associated with ADHD. Behavioral performance on the sustained attention task did not differ significantly by diagnosis. EEG correlates of cognitive performance differed significantly ADHD diagnosis and were primarily in frontal regions. Brain activation patterns recorded during the sustained attention task suggest that the ADHD group exhibited significantly increased cortical activation at the end of the task when compared to controls. Conclusions: Adults with ADHD may have different neural organization primarily in frontal regions which results in the need for continually high levels of cortical activation to maintain sustained attention.

Twenty normal adult subjects received sucrose, spearmint oil gum-base alone, and three combinations of these stimuli. EEG recordings were obtained while the subjects rested quietly with their eyes closed, as the following procedure: section I. 1 Minute at rest: section II, first 5-minute recording (control record): session 111, each Stimulus affecting for 3 minutes; session IV, 1 minute at rest: session V, 5-minute recording (poststimulus record). The EEG activity vas filtered with a 0.5 Hz high pass and a 30 Hz low pass filter. The final data (epoch) for analysis were selected from all data by our epoch inducing system. and D2 was calculated using a novel analytical program. D2 was found to increase after subjects inhaled spearmint. In contrast, D2 decreased after subject's chewed gum-base and after the combination stimuli with chewing. Furthermore, the D2 change observed after each stimulus was similar to the observed D2 changes in the theta band. These findings Suggest that D2 expressed the change in EEG as a brain response after each Stimulus. It was also demonstrated that the change of EEG complexity as a brain response to stimulation is related to theta rhythm that might be able to produce at the cortical limbic area. We confirmed that the change observed in the complexity in response to which the chewing stimulus relates ill Our present Study is the model that best fits that theory of the change Oil complexity Suggested by Stam CJ.

Changes of nonlinear and linear EEG-complexity in the theta band, heart rate and electrodermal activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Congress of Psychophysiology the Olympics of the Brain	SEP 08-13, 2008	St Petersburg, RUSSIA	Int Org Psychophysiol		Low alcohol dose; Mental arithmetic; EEG-complexity; Autonomic measures	STRESS-RESPONSE; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FEATURES; DEFICITS; ALPHA; POWER	Objective and hypothesis: Nonlinear and linear methods of EEG-complexity analysis and autonomic measures were used to characterize processes accompanying performance in a mental arithmetic task challenged by low ("social") alcohol doses. It was expected that alcohol in such doses will dampen changes of task-related EEG-synchronization in the theta band, and those of heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Methods: In the mental arithmetic task addition and working memory, effort was required. The EEG, ECG and EDA were recorded in 5 conditions: task, placebo-task, low dose-task (0.2 g/kg alcohol), high dose-task (0.4 g/kg alcohol). Omega-complexity and synchronization likelihood (SL) were computed of the theta band of the EEG. Results: Task-related decrease of the Omega-complexity and increase of the SL was found in the theta frequency band. Following alcohol consumption, these changes did not develop as seen especially for SL in the anterior area, although the significant effects were elicited by task performance. Conspicuous task-evoked increases were observed for ECG and EDA which were even more enhanced by alcohol. Conclusions: Task-induced significant changes of the Omega-complexity and that of SL indicate increased synchrony in the theta band, probably corresponding to working memory effort. Both of these measures proved to be sensitive for the effect of low alcohol dose although these alcohol-elicited changes were not statistically significant. Task-induced heart rate and EDA increases were further intensified by alcohol probably indicating its activating effect on these autonomic measures in the dose range studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Detection of Evoked Responses in EEG using Computational Intelligence Tools	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Somatosensory Evoked Potential; Coherence; stimulus frequency	MULTIPLE COHERENCE; STIMULATION	The cerebral Evoked Potential (EP) signals are commonplace in many fields of neuroscience. They are the electrical outcome of brain's reception in response to an external stimulus. However, the analysis of the EPs embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) is normally performed by visual inspection which usually leads to a subjective interpretation of the results. Therefore, objective and quantitative techniques based only on statistical criteria are required. This paper uses the Magnitude-Square Multiple Coherence (MSMC), which belongs to the Objective Response Detection (ORD) class, together with neural and neuro-fuzzy networks in order to improve EEG investigation. The alpha rhythm is defined as the rhythm ranging from 8 to 13 Hz that occurs over the posterior regions of the head during wakefulness. This rhythm generally exhibits higher voltage over the occipital areas. Some findings suggest a functional significance of such a rhythm, since it can be induced (i.e. initiated by but not time-locked to a stimulus) or evoked by an external stimulation. Although it can be entrained by external stimulation, such a cerebral activity does not seem to be previously taken into account in EP detection. To do so, a neural network approach is used to identify the detection rate in EEGs of 15 normal young subjects during photic stimulation collected in posterior regions of the scalp. The neural networks are designed to have the spectral information of two, four or six EEG derivations as input and the detection rate obtained from MSMC as output. The best results are obtained with two inputs, without alpha rhythm band information and by using neural networks (correlation coefficients around 0.98). As a conclusion this work shows that a mixed approach using ORD techniques and neural networks can be successfully used to obtain automatic detection of EPs..	[Souza, A. P.; Miranda de Sa, A. M. F.

Brain correlates underlying creative thinking: EEG alpha activity in professional vs. novice dancers	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Alpha; Creativity; Dancing	CORTICAL INTEGRATION; VERBAL CREATIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; BAND; NEUROSCIENCE; MAINTENANCE; ORIGINALITY; CORTEX	Neuroscientific research on creativity has revealed valuable insights into possible brain correlates underlying this complex mental ability domain. However, most of the studies investigated brain activity during the performance of comparatively simple (verbal) type of tasks and the majority of studies focused on samples of the normal population. In this study we investigate EEG activity in professional dancers (n = 15) who have attained a high level of expertise in this domain. This group was compared with a group of novices (n = 17) who have only basic experience in dancing and completed no comprehensive training in this field. The EEG was recorded during performance of two different dancing imagery tasks which differed with respect to creative demands. In the first task participants were instructed to mentally perform a dance which should be as unique and original as possible (improvisation dance). In the waltz task they were asked to imagine dancing the waltz, a standard dance which involves a sequence of monotonous steps (lower creative demands). In addition, brain activity was also measured during performance of the Alternative Uses test. We observed evidence that during the generation of alternative uses professional dancers show stronger alpha synchronization in posterior parietal brain regions than novice dancers. During improvisation dance, professional dancers exhibited more right-hemispheric alpha synchronization than the group of novices did, while during imagining dancing the waltz no significant group differences emerged. The findings complement and extend existing findings on the relationship between EEG alpha activity and creative thinking. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

First, we define the DMN concept with regard to its neuroanatomy, its functional organisation through low frequency neuronal oscillations, its relation to other recently discovered low frequency resting state networks, and the cognitive functions it is thought to serve. Second, we introduce methodological and analytical issues and challenges. Third, we describe putative mechanisms proposed to link DMN abnormalities and mental disorders. These include interference by network activity during task performance, altered patterns of antagonism between task specific and non-specific elements, altered connectively and integrity of the DMN, and altered psychological functions served by the network DMN. Fourth, we review the empirical literature systematically. We relate DMN dysfunction to dementia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, anxiety and depression, autism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drawing out common and unique elements of the disorders. Finally, we provide an integrative overview and highlight important challenges and tasks for future research. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interrelations between Peculiarities of the Motivational Sphere of a Personality and Characteristics of the Current EEG	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG frequency composition; spectral power; need for achievement; motivation to achieve success; questionnaire by Mehrabian; questionnaire by Orlov	INCENTIVE MOTIVATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; DOPAMINE; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; RHYTHM	In a group of 70 adult subjects of both sexes, we estimated the levels of the need for achievement and its motivation (interpreted as generalized characteristics of the state of the motivational sphere of a personality and diagnosed using questionnaires of Orlov and Mehrabian) and examined the correlations of these estimates with spectral powers (SPs) of the frequency components (rhythms) of the current background EEG (D3 and D4 leads according to the 10-20 system). Despite the fact that naturally high interindividual variability exists, high estimates of the need for achievement correlated with medium values of the SPs of most EEG frequency components (delta, theta, alpha, and beta(1) rhythms), low SPs of the beta(2) and gamma rhythms, and higher values of the coefficient of reactivity (CR) of the alpha rhythm. A high level of the need for achievement corresponded to higher SPs of the theta and gamma rhythms and high CR of the alpha rhythm, a medium SP of this EEG component, and lower SPs of the delta and beta rhythms. The coefficient of interhemisphere asymmetry of the alpha rhythm was the highest at low values of the studied psychological indices. Interrelations that we found in our study can be explained as follows: both the characteristics of the need for achievement and motivation typical of a certain personality and the amplitude parameters of the EEG rhythms observed in this individual depend significantly on genetically determined factors (in particular, on neurochemical ones). These peculiarities of neurodynamic constitution of the individual are, to a considerable extent, due to the specificity of organization and functioning of a few neurotransmitter (aminergic, in particular) and neurohumoral systems.

This study describes the dynamics of a recent physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system, and shows how it accounts for many key electrophysiological correlates of PD. Its detailed functional connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect pathways through two populations of striatal neurons, a hyperdirect pathway involving a corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN), a stronger projection from striatum to GPe, and weaker cortical interactions. Here it is shown that oscillations around 5 and 20Hz can arise with a strong indirect pathway, which also causes increased synchronization throughout the basal ganglia. Furthermore, increased theta power with progressive nigrostriatal degeneration is correlated with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, in agreement with empirical results. Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with phase relationships that coincide with those found experimentally. Alterations in the responses of basal ganglia to transient stimuli accord with experimental observations. Reduced cortical gains due to both nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower changes in cortical activity and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections in parkinsonian patients. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary to obtain these results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[van Albada, S. J.; Gray, R. T.; Drysdale, P.

Using the high temporal resolution of EEG, we investigated the relationship between prestimulus neuronal oscillations and the perceptibility of two competing somatosensory stimuli embedded in a backward masking paradigm. We identified two prestimulus EEG signatures predictive for a suprathreshold yet weak target stimulus to become perceptually resistant against masking by a stronger distractor stimulus: (i) over left frontal cortex a desynchronization of the regional beta rhythm (similar to 20 Hz) 500 msec prior to a perceived target, and (ii) a subsequent additional attenuation of both mu (similar to 10 Hz) and beta "idling'' rhythms over those pericentral sensorimotor cortices which are going to process the upcoming target stimulus. Furthermore, across subjects the probability for target perception strongly correlates with the individual absolute level of pre-target amplitudes in these frequency bands and locations. These signatures significantly differed from the EEG characteristics preceding detected and undetected single stimuli. We suggest that the early activation of left frontal areas involved in top-down attentional control is critical for preventing backward masking and leads the preparation of primary sensory cortices: The ensuing prestimulus suppression of sensory idling rhythms warrants an intensified poststimulus processing, and thus, effectively promotes conscious perception of suprathreshold target stimuli embedded into an ecologically relevant condition featuring competing environmental stimuli.

Spatial characterization of interictal high frequency oscillations in epileptic neocortex	BRAIN			English	Article						multichannel extracellular recording; epilepsy; intracranial EEG; interictal epileptiform activity; fast ripples; high frequency oscillations	FAST RIPPLES; ELECTRODE ARRAY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; GAP-JUNCTIONS; 80-500 HZ; IN-VIVO; HIPPOCAMPUS; CORTEX; BRAIN; PROPAGATION	Interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs), in particular those with frequency components in excess of 200 Hz, have been proposed as important biomarkers of epileptic cortex as well as the genesis of seizures. We investigated the spatial extent, classification and distribution of HFOs using a dense 4 x 4 mm(2) two dimensional microelectrode array implanted in the neocortex of four patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. The majority (97%) of oscillations detected included fast ripples and were concentrated in relatively few recording sites. While most HFOs were limited to single channels, similar to 10% occurred on a larger spatial scale with simultaneous but morphologically distinct detections in multiple channels. Eighty per cent of these large-scale events were associated with interictal epileptiform discharges. We propose that large-scale HFOs, rather than the more frequent highly focal events, are the substrates of the HFOs detected by clinical depth electrodes. This feature was prominent in three patients but rarely seen in only one patient recorded outside epileptogenic cortex. Additionally, we found that HFOs were commonly associated with widespread interictal epileptiform discharges but not with locally generated 'microdischarges'. Our observations raise the possibility that, rather than being initiators of epileptiform activity, fast ripples may be markers of a secondary local response.	[Schevon, Catherine A.; Emerson, R.

Multiple measures were recorded, such as psychophysiological (skin conductance response, heart rate, and electromyography) and frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and gamma), during viewing IAPS figures, that varied in terms of pleasantness (appetitive vs. aversive) and arousing power (high vs. low intensity). Both BIS and BAS measures were significant in modulating behavioural, autonomic and brain oscillations responses. Withdrawal (BIS system) and appetitive (BAS system) behaviour showed opposite patterns of responses by the subjects. Also, frontal cortical site response was more significant than other sites. Nevertheless, no specific lateralization effect was found as a function of BIS/BAS dichotomy. Moreover, autonomic variables and frequency band modulations were found to be effected by valence and arousal rating per se, with an increased response for high arousing and negative or positive stimuli in comparison with low arousing and neutral stimuli. The effects of subjective evaluation and individual differences were discussed at light of coping activity model of emotion comprehension. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The event-related potentials (ERP) of normal subjects and excessive Internet users were acquired using the oddball paradigm experiment. We applied the wavelet transformed and event-related spectral perturbation to ERP in order to extract the time-frequency values. The F-test statistics of time-frequency values were then decomposed into two components by NMF. Excessive Internet use resulted in a significant decrease in the P300 amplitudes (P < 0.05) and a significant increase in the P300 latency ( P < 0.05) in all electrodes. The major effect of excessive Internet use on gamma oscillation occurred at similar to 300 ms after stimuli at 40-50 Hz on the parietal central region. Thus, these data suggest that excessive Internet use affects information coding and integration in the brain. (C) 2009 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Electrophysiological correlates of flicker-induced color hallucinations	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						EEG; Alpha band; Gamma band; Hallucinatory color; Flicker	EEG-ALPHA; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SUBJECTIVE COLORS; VISUAL ILLUSIONS; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; HUMANS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION	In a recent study, Becker and Elliott [Becker, C., & Elliott, M. A. (2006). Flicker induced color and form: Interdependencies and relation to stimulation frequency and phase. Consciousness & Cognition, 15(1), 175-196] described the appearance of subjective experiences of color and form induced by stimulation with intermittent light. While there have been electroencephalographic studies of similar hallucinatory forms, brain activity accompanying the appearance of hallucinatory colors was never measured. Using a priming procedure where observers were required to indicate the presence of one of eight target colors we compared electrophysiological correlates of hallucinatory color with brain states associated with other visual phenomena. Different target colors were accompanied by different patterns of EEG activation. However. in general, we found that the appearance of hallucinatory colors is preceded by a power decrease in the lower alpha band alongside an increase in gamma band frequencies. We argue that decreasing activity in the lower alpha band acts as a gating mechanism, inducing a switch in perception between different colors. The increasing gamma activation may correlate with the formation of a coherent conscious percept. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Measurement of high frequency EEG signals with very low noise amplifiers: Brain oscillations above 600 Hz measured non-invasively	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			hf-EEG; evoked potentials; amplifier noise; 600 Hz; 1000 Hz		Somatosensory evoked electroencephalogram responses contain high frequency 600 Hz bursts with sub-microvolt amplitudes, which only can be identified by averaging of some 1000 epochs and band pass filtering above 400 Hz. We have investigated the frequency content of this response using a very low noise amplifier and found an extremely weak 1000 Hz component superimposed to the 600 Hz burst, detectable with a signal to noise ratio(S/N ratio) of about 10. Previously high frequency electroencephalographic responses around 1000 Hz have been observed only by using implanted deep brain electrodes. We also have examined how the S/N ratio is affected by intrinsic noise of the experiment, which comprises biologically generated, amplifier and thermal noise of electrode-to-skin resistance. We estimate that the percentage of amplifier noise power ranges from 20 to 60% of the total noise depending on the band pass filtering (450-800, 800-1400 Hz). Above 1000 Hz any biologically generated signal is practically negligible if the volunteer is in a relaxed posture. We conclude that the unavoidable electrode-skin resistance determines the lowest noise level achievable in the recording of high-frequency electroencephalogram (hf-EEG).	[Scheer, H.

Left auditory cortex gamma synchronization and auditory hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; HESCHL GYRUS; DYSFUNCTION; RECEPTOR	Background: Oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities may reflect neural circuit dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. Previously we have found positive correlations between the phase synchronization of beta and gamma oscillations and hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that the propensity for hallucinations is associated with an increased tendency for neural circuits in sensory cortex to enter states of oscillatory synchrony. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) generated in the left primary auditory cortex is positively correlated with auditory hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia. We also examined whether the 40 Hz ASSR deficit in schizophrenia was associated with cross-frequency interactions. Sixteen healthy control subjects (HC) and 18 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) listened to 40 Hz binaural click trains. The EEG was recorded from 60 electrodes and average-referenced offline. A 5-dipole model was fit from the HC grand average ASSR, with 2 pairs of superior temporal dipoles and a deep midline dipole. Time-frequency decomposition was performed on the scalp EEG and source data. Results: Phase locking factor (PLF) and evoked power were reduced in SZ at fronto-central electrodes, replicating prior findings. PLF was reduced in SZ for non-homologous right and left hemisphere sources. Left hemisphere source PLF in SZ was positively correlated with auditory hallucination symptoms, and was modulated by delta phase. Furthermore, the correlations between source evoked power and PLF found in HC was reduced in SZ for the LH sources. Conclusion: These findings suggest that differential neural circuit abnormalities may be present in the left and right auditory cortices in schizophrenia. In addition, they provide further support for the hypothesis that hallucinations are related to cortical hyperexcitability, which is manifested by an increased propensity for high-frequency synchronization in modality-specific cortical areas.

Cortical locations of maximal spindle activity: magnetoencephalography (MEG) study	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; MR-FOCUSS; sleep spindle; source localization	SLEEP SPINDLES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; EEG; OSCILLATION; RHYTHMS; HUMANS; CORTEX; BRAIN; YOUNG	The aim of this study was to determine the main cortical regions related to maximal spindle activity of sleep stage 2 in healthy individual subjects during a brief morning nap using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eight volunteers (mean age: 26.1 +/- 8.7, six women) all right handed, free of any medical psychiatric or sleep disorders were studied. Whole-head 148-channel MEG and a conventional polysomnography montage (EEG; C3, C4, O1 and O2 scalp electrodes and EOG, EMG and ECG electrodes) were used for data collection. Sleep MEG/EEG spindles were visually identified during 15 min of stage 2 sleep for each participant. The distribution of brain activity corresponding to each spindle was calculated using a combination of independent component analysis and a current source density technique superimposed upon individual MRIs. The absolute maximum of spindle activation was localized to frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. However, the most common cortical regions for maximal source spindle activity were precentral and/or postcentral areas across all individuals. The present study suggests that maximal spindle activity localized to these two regions may represent a single event for two types of spindle frequency: slow (at 12 Hz) and fast (at 14 Hz) within global thalamocortical coherence.

J	Karkare, S; Saha, G; Bhattacharya, J				Karkare, Siddharth; Saha, Goutam; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Investigating long-range correlation properties in EEG during complex cognitive tasks	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article							DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; CHAOTIC DYNAMICS; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; TIME; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; UNIVERSALITY; PERCEPTION	Previous work shows the presence of scale invariance and long-range correlations in ongoing and spontaneous activity of large scale brain responses (i.e. EEG), and such scaling behavior can also be modulated by simple sensory Stimulus. However, little is known whether such alteration but not destruction in scaling properties also occurs during complex cognitive processing and if neuroplasticity plays any role in mediating such changes. In this study, we addressed these issues by investigating scaling properties of multivariate EEG signals obtained from two broad groups - artists and non-artists - while they performed complex tasks of perception and mental imagery of visual art objects. We found that brain regions showing increased correlation properties from rest were similar for both tasks, suggesting that brain networks responsible for visual perception are reactivated for mental imagery. Further, we observed that the two groups could be differentiated by scaling exponents and an artificial neural network based classifier achieved a classification efficiency of over 80%. These results altogether Suggest that specific complex cognitive task demands and task-specific expertise can modify the temporal scale-free dynamics of brain responses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Avian sleep homeostasis: Convergent evolution of complex brains, cognition and sleep functions in mammals and birds	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Slow-wave sleep; REM sleep; Homeostasis; Pallium; Slow oscillation; Cognition; Connectivity; Dorsal ventricular ridge; Hyperpallium; Nidopallium; Mesopallium; Dorsal cortex	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; BASE-LINE CONDITIONS; ELECTROGRAPHIC SHARP WAVES; EEG POWER SPECTRA; PIGEON COLUMBA; PALLIOPALLIAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; MIGRATORY RESTLESSNESS; AUDITORY FOREBRAIN; CHELONIAN REPTILES	Birds are the only taxonomic group other than mammals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.

Gamma-band activity reflects multisensory matching in working memory	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Multisensory; Crossmodal; Working memory; Gamma; EEG	ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; RESPONSES; TASK; EEG; MODULATION; OBJECTS	In real-world situations, the integration of sensory information in working memory (WM) is an important mechanism for the recognition of objects. Studies in single sensory modalities show that object recognition is facilitated if bottom-up inputs match a template held in WM, and that this effect may be linked to enhanced synchronization of neurons in the gamma-band (>30 Hz). Natural objects, however, frequently provide inputs to multiple sensory modalities. In this EEG study, we examined the integration of semantically matching or non-matching visual and auditory inputs using a delayed visual-to-auditory object-matching paradigm. In the event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by auditory inputs, effects of semantic matching were observed after 120-170 ms at frontal and posterior regions, indicating WM-specific processing across modalities, and after 250-400 ms over medial-central regions, possibly reflecting the contextual integration of sensory inputs. Additionally, total gamma-band activity (GBA) with medial-central topography after 120-180 ms was larger for matching compared to non-matching trials. This demonstrates that multisensory matching in WM is reflected by GBA and that dynamic coupling of neural populations in this frequency range might be a crucial mechanism for integrative multisensory processes.

However, pregabalin is structurally and pharmacologically different from other classes of known anxiolytic drugs, and the mechanisms that alter brain activity to produce anxiolytic-like actions are not well understood. In an effort to determine more about the cellular mechanisms of pregabalin, we studied its effects on hippocampal theta activity of urethane-anesthetized rats that was elicited by electrical stimulation of the nucleus pontis oralis (nPO) in the brainstem. We found that systemic administration of pregabalin significantly reduced the frequency of stimulation-induced hippocampal theta activity similarly to the effects of diazepam. In addition, pregabalin (but not diazepam) significantly altered the stimulus intensity/frequency relationship, and increased slow delta oscillation (< 3.0 Hz) in spontaneous hippocampal EEG in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that pregabalin may alter evoked theta frequency activity in the hippocampus by reducing neurotransmitter-mediated activation of either the septal nucleus or the hippocampus, and that its actions are unlikely to be mediated by direct activation of GABA neurotransmitter systems. These observations provide further insight to the action of pregabalin, and support the utilization of stimulation-induced theta model in discovery of novel anxiolytic drugs. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Granger-Geweke Causality Modeling With Application to Interictal Spike Propagation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						epilepsy; Granger causality; connectivity	MULTIVARIATE AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS/; DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; NONLINEAR CAUSALITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN; FMRI; EEG	A persistent problem in developing plausible neurophysiological models of perception, cognition, and action is the difficulty of characterizing the interactions between different neural systems. Previous studies have approached this problem by estimating causal influences across brain areas activated during cognitive processing using structural equation modeling (SEM) and, more recently, with Granger-Geweke causality. While SEM is complicated by the need for a priori directional connectivity information, the temporal resolution of dynamic Granger-Geweke estimates is limited because the Underlying autoregressive (AR) models assume stationarity over the period of analysis. We have developed a novel optimal method for obtaining data-driven directional causality estimates with high temporal resolution in both time and frequency domains. This is achieved by simultaneously optimizing the length of the analysis window and the chosen AR model order using the SURE criterion. Dynamic Granger-Geweke causality in time and frequency domains is Subsequently calculated within a moving analysis window. We tested our algorithm by calculating the Granger-Geweke causality of epileptic spike propagation from the right frontal lobe to the left frontal lobe. The results quantitatively Suggested that the epileptic activity at the left frontal lobe was propagated from the right frontal lobe, in agreement with the clinical diagnosis. Our novel computational tool can be used to help elucidate complex directional interactions in the human brain. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1877-1886, 2009. (C) 2009 Wilev-Liss, Inc.

In animals injected with saline ("control") and L-glutamate ("glutamate"), field potentials (EEG) of the hippocampus and the MSR were recorded before the injections and during epileptogenesis. The delivery of L-glutamate to the MSR induced an increase in theta activity both in the MSR and the hippocampus. During kindling, the seizure behaviour and secondary epileptiform discharges were observed earlier in the glutamate group than in control animals. In the process of epileptogenesis, theta oscillations almost disappeared in all animals, but in the glutamate group this happened much earlier. The correlation between hippocampal and septal EEGs dramatically decreased in the animals with glutamate injections, and in the controls the decrease was not significant. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy.	[Astasheva, E.

The study included 39 children (17 with dyslexia plus 22 controls) assessed via frontal, central, parietal, and temporal electrodes. As an extension of previous P300 event-related potential studies, we analysed variations in the power values of 40-Hz oscillations (gamma-band oscillations involved in cognitive processing) during a specific time window in response to the auditory 'oddball' paradigm that entail target (random 2 kHz) and standard (frequent 1 kHz) stimuli. Dyslexic children differed significantly from controls (P < 0.001) in the mean power of the wavelet-transformed 40-Hz oscillation in a time interval starting at 25 ms after stimulus onset up to 50 ms. This means defective processing of sounds. Within groups, standard and target tones elicited significantly different power values (P < 0.001). Correlations of values between standard and target responses at each electrode position were not significant within either group, although dyslexics showed a lower correlation than controls. Significant differences in the mean power of these oscillations detected at very early stages of auditory processing in dyslexic children and the wide range of mean values reveal impairment in processing non-verbal sounds in dyslexia. Our results also support recent findings using behavioural and electrophysiological methods suggesting that dyslexia is a general auditory deficit instead of a speech-specific deficit.

However, the physiological patterns of cortical activity that activate NMDA receptors in vivo remain largely unknown. We performed full-band recordings from the barrel cortex of neonatal rats in vivo and found that the dominant pattern of the early activity, network driven spindle bursts, are associated with large amplitude NMDA receptor-dependent delta waves. The major sink of delta waves was in the dense cortical plate, which coincided with the sinks of sensory-evoked responses as well as fast spindle-burst oscillations. Pharmacological analysis revealed major contributions from NMDA and alpha-aminopropionate (AMPA) type of glutamate receptors in the generation of delta waves, whereas fast oscillations primarily involved only AMPA receptors. Our results suggest that the 2 component spindle burst is generated by rhythmic, presumably thalamocortical, synaptic input which entrains an AMPA receptor-mediated fast oscillation and who's summation generates an NMDA and AMPA receptor mediated delta wave. The massive summation of thalamocortical activity during the spindle bursts thus provides a long time window for co-incident activation of cortical neurons by the thalamocortical cells which may contribute to the formation of thalamocortical synapses in the barrel cortex during the critical period of developmental plasticity.

J	Perry, A; Bentin, S				Perry, Anat; Bentin, Shlomo			Mirror activity in the human brain while observing hand movements: A comparison between EEG desynchronization in the mu-range and previous fMRI results	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mu rhythm; Alpha; EEG	FUNCTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY; ACTION RECOGNITION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; NEURONS; ACTIVATION; IMITATION; OTHERS; REPRESENTATIONS; MODULATION	Mu (mu) rhythms are EEG oscillations between 8-13 Hz distinguished from alpha by having more anterior distribution and being desynchronized by motor rather than visual activity. Evidence accumulating during the last decade suggests that the de synchronization of mu rhythms (mu suppression) might be also a manifestation of a human Mirror Neuron System (MNS). To further explore this hypothesis we used a paradigm that, in a previous fMRI study, successfully activated this putative MNS in humans. our direct goal was to provide further support for a link between modulation of mu rhythms and the MNS, by finding parallels between the reported patterns of fMRI activations and patterns of mu suppression. The EEG power in the mu range has been recorded while participants passively observed either a left or a right hand, reaching to and grasping objects, and compared it with that recorded while participants observed the movement of a ball, and while observing static grasping scenes or still objects. Mirroring fMRI results (Shmuelof, L., Zohary, E., 2005. Dissociation between ventral and dorsal fMRI activation during object and action recognition. Neuron 47, 457-470), mu suppression was larger in the hemisphere contra-lateral to the moving hand and larger when the hands grasped different objects in different ways than when the movement was repetitive. No suppression was found while participants observed still objects but mu suppression was also found while seeing static grasping postures. These data are discussed in light of similar parallels between modulations of alpha waves and fMRI while recording EEG in the magnet. The present data support a link between mu suppression and a human MNS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Corticomuscular synchronization has been shown to occur in beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma range (30-45 Hz) during isometric compensation of static and dynamic (periodically modulated) low-level forces, respectively. However, it is still unknown to what extent these synchronization processes in beta and gamma range are modified with increasing modulated force. We addressed this question by investigating the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) from the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) as well as the cortical and muscular spectral power during a visuomotor task where different levels of a dynamic (modulated) force were used. Seven healthy right-handed female subjects compensated dynamic forces at 8, 16, and 24% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) isometrically with their right index finger. Under the three conditions investigated, we found a broad-band CMC comprising both beta and gamma range and peaking at similar to 22 Hz within the beta band. This broad-band coherence increased linearly with higher force level. A separate analysis of the gamma range CMC did not show significant modulation of the CMC by the force levels. EEG and EMG spectral power did not show any significant difference among the three force conditions. Our results favor the view that the function of beta range CMC is not specific for low-level static forces only. The sensorimotor system may resort to stronger and also broader beta-range CMC to generate stable corticospinal interaction during increased force level, as well as when compensating for dynamic modulated forces. This finding re-enforces the importance of the beta-range EEG-EMG coherence in sensorimotor integration.

The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals analyzed with this method provide only information based on the frequency range, for short periods. In some cases, for long periods it can be useful to know whether EEG signals coincide or have a relative phase between them or with other biological signals. Some studies have evidenced that sex hormones and EEG signals show oscillations in their frequencies across a period of 28 days; so it seems of relevance to seek after possible patterns relating EEG signals and endogenous sex hormones, assumed as long time-periodic functions to determine their typical periods, frequencies and relative phases. Methods: In this work we propose a method that can be used to analyze brain signals and hormonal levels and obtain frequencies and relative phases among them. This method involves the application of a discrete Fourier Transform on previously reported datasets of absolute power of brain signals delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2 and the endogenous estrogen and progesterone levels along 28 days. Results: Applying the proposed method to exemplary datasets and comparing each brain signal with both sex hormones signals, we found a characteristic profile of coincident periods and typical relative phases. For the corresponding coincident periods the progesterone seems to be essentially in phase with theta, alpha1, alpha2 and beta1, while delta and beta2 go oppositely. For the relevant coincident periods, the estrogen goes in phase with delta and theta and goes oppositely with alpha2. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the procedure applied here provides a method to analyze typical frequencies, or periods and phases between signals with the same period. It generates specific patterns for brain signals and hormones and relations among them.

Can we observe collective neuronal activity from macroscopic aggregate signals?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/MEG theory; Synchronization; Coupled systems; Macroscopic aggregate; State space reconstruction; Observability; Singular spectrum analysis	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; SMALL-WORLD; GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION; LABILE BRAIN; DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	The fundamental problem faced by noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as EEG/MEG(1) is to elucidate functionally important aspects of the microscopic neuronal network dynamics from macroscopic aggregate measurements. Due to the mixing of the activities of large neuronal populations in the observed macroscopic aggregate, recovering the underlying network that generates the signal in the absence of any additional information represents a considerable challenge. Recent MEG studies have shown that macroscopic measurements contain sufficient information to allow the differentiation between patterns of activity, which are likely to represent different stimulus-specific collective modes in the underlying network (Hadjipapas, A., Adjamian, P., Swettenham, J. B., Holliday, I. E., Barnes, G. R., 2007. Stimuli of varying spatial scale induce gamma activity with distinct temporal characteristics in human visual cortex. NeuroImage 35, 518-530). The next question arising in this context is whether aspects of collective network activity can be recovered from a macroscopic aggregate signal. We propose that this issue is most appropriately addressed if MEG/EEG signals are to be viewed as macroscopic aggregates arising from networks of coupled systems as opposed to aggregates across a mass of largely independent neural systems. We show that collective modes arising in a network of simulated coupled systems can be indeed recovered from the macroscopic aggregate. Moreover, we show that nonlinear state space methods yield a good approximation of the number of effective degrees of freedom in the network. Importantly, information about hidden variables, which do not directly contribute to the aggregate signal, can also be recovered. Finally, this theoretical framework can be applied to experimental MEG/EEG data in the future, enabling the inference of state dependent changes in the degree of local synchrony in the underlying network.

The prodigious demands for the energy that is required to drive the dendritic currents are met by hemodynamic and metabolic responses that are visualized with fMRI and PET techniques. The high current densities in parallel dendritic shafts and the broad distributions of the loop currents outside the dendrites generate both the scalp EEG and the magnetic fields seen in the MEG. The measurements of image intensities and potential fields provide state variables for modeling. The relationships between the intensities of current density and the electric, magnetic, and hemodynamic state variables are complex and far from proportionate. The state variables are complementary, because the information they convey comes from differing albeit overlapping neural populations, so that efforts to cross-validate localization of neural activity relating to specified cognitive behaviors have not always been successful. We propose an alternative way to use the three methods in combination through studies of hemisphere-wide, high-resolution spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity recorded non-invasively and analyzed with multivariate statistics. Success in this proposed endeavor requires specification of what patterns to look for. At the present level of understanding, an appropriate pattern is any significant departure from random noise in the spectral, temporal and spatial domains that can be scaled into the coarse-graining of time by fMRI/BOLD and the coarse-graining of space by EEG and MEG. Here the requisite patterns are predicted to be large-scale spatial amplitude modulation (AM) of synchronized neuronal signals in the beta and gamma ranges that are coordinated but not correlated with fMRI intensities.

Tiagabine Increases [C-11] flumazenil Binding in Cortical Brain Regions in Healthy Control Subjects	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GABA; PET; [C-11]flumazenil; GABA shift; gamma-band; oscillations	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; C-11-FLUMAZENIL BINDING; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; RO 15-1788; MODULATION; GABA	Accumulating evidence indicates that synchronization of cortical neuronal activity at gamma-band frequencies is important for various types of perceptual and cognitive processes and that GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission is required for the induction of these network oscillations. In turn, the abnormalities in GABA transmission postulated to play a role in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia might contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this illness. We measured the ability to increase GABA in eight healthy subjects by comparing the binding of [C-11] flumazenil, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer specific for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site, at baseline and in the presence of an acute elevation in GABA levels through the blockade of the GABA membrane transporter (GAT1). Preclinical work suggests that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands (termed 'GABA shift'). Theoretically, such an increase in the affinity of GABA-A receptors should be detected as an increase in the binding of a GABA-A BDZ-receptor site-specific PET radioligand. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in mean (+/- SD) [C-11] flumazenil-binding potential (BPND) over baseline in brain regions representing the major functional domains of the cerebral cortex: association cortex + 15.2 +/- 20.2% (p = 0.05), sensory cortex + 13.5 +/- 15.5% (p = 0.03) and limbic (medial temporal lobe, MTL) + 16.4 +/- 20.2% (p 0.03). The increase in [C-11]flumazenil-BPND was not accounted for by differences in the plasma-free fraction (f(P); paired t-test p = 0.24) or changes in the nonspecific binding (pons V-T, p = 0.73). Moreover, the ability to increase GABA strongly predicted (r = 0.85, p = 0.015) the ability to entrain cortical networks, measured through EEG gamma synchrony during a cognitive control task in these same subjects. Although additional studies are necessary to further validate this technique, these data provide preliminary evidence of the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute fluctuations in extracellular GABA levels and provide the first in vivo documentation of a relationship between GABA neurotransmission and EEG gamma-band power in humans.

Brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs are regulatory RNAs that control translation initiation. We now report that neuronal BC1 RNA plays an instrumental role in the protein-synthesis-dependent implementation of neuronal excitation-repression equilibria. BC1 repression counter-regulates translational stimulation resulting from synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Absence of BC1 RNA precipitates plasticity dysregulation in the form of neuronal hyperexcitability, elicited by group I mGluR-stimulated translation and signaled through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Dysregulation of group I mGluR function in the absence of BC1 RNA gives rise to abnormal brain function. Cortical EEG recordings from freely moving BC1(-/-) animals show that group I mGluR-mediated oscillations in the gamma frequency range are significantly elevated. When subjected to sensory stimulation, these animals display an acute group I mGluR-dependent propensity for convulsive seizures. Inadequate RNA control in neurons is thus causally linked to heightened group I mGluR-stimulated translation, neuronal hyperexcitability, heightened gamma band oscillations, and epileptogenesis. These data highlight the significance of small RNA control in neuronal plasticity.	[Zhong, Jun; Chuang, Shih-Chieh; Bianchi, Riccardo; Zhao, Wangfa; Lee, Heekyung; Fenton, Andre A.; Wong, Robert K.

Network inference with confidence from multivariate time series	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MEASURING SYNCHRONIZATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LOW-FREQUENCY; BRAIN; EEG; TOPOLOGY; MODEL; CONNECTIVITY	Networks-collections of interacting elements or nodes-abound in the natural and manmade worlds. For many networks, complex spatiotemporal dynamics stem from patterns of physical interactions unknown to us. To infer these interactions, it is common to include edges between those nodes whose time series exhibit sufficient functional connectivity, typically defined as a measure of coupling exceeding a predetermined threshold. However, when uncertainty exists in the original network measurements, uncertainty in the inferred network is likely, and hence a statistical propagation of error is needed. In this manuscript, we describe a principled and systematic procedure for the inference of functional connectivity networks from multivariate time series data. Our procedure yields as output both the inferred network and a quantification of uncertainty of the most fundamental interest: uncertainty in the number of edges. To illustrate this approach, we apply a measure of linear coupling to simulated data and electrocorticogram data recorded from a human subject during an epileptic seizure. We demonstrate that the procedure is accurate and robust in both the determination of edges and the reporting of uncertainty associated with that determination.

The involvement of cognitive processing in a perceptual-motor process examined with EEG time-frequency analysis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related desynchronization; Event-related synchronization; Visuomotor process; Prehensile movement	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; VENTRAL VISUAL STREAM; PARIETAL CORTEX; PICTORIAL ILLUSION; ONLINE CONTROL; CLOSED-LOOP; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; PREHENSION; DYNAMICS	Objective: For motor activities, visual information is crucial for organizing a movement with respect to a given Situation. The present study investigates how cognitive information processing is associated with this visuomotor process. Methods: Brain dynamics in executing two perceptual-motor tasks were examined in terms of event-related synchronization (ERS) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG. Those tasks were (1) reaching toward and grasping a visual object with a pinch grip, and (2) matching the pinch grip size with respect to the perceived object size. Results: According to the aperture size in the task execution, both the tasks were affected by the perceived object size inducing the Ebbinghaus illusion. The alpha-ERD patterns were associated with the movement execution and appeared to be identical in both the tasks, whilst the gamma-ERS appeared only for the grasping motion. Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive processing was involved not only in the matching task but also in the grasping task. These ERD/ERS patterns are thought to reflect the similarity and difference in the perceptual-motor Processes between the two tasks. Significance: The analysis of ERD/ERS can provide insight on the qualitative feature in a visuomotor process associated with the involvement of cognitive processing.

The impact of attention on these gating measures is still not fully resolved. In the current study, the impact of attention on sensory gating was studied by scalp and intracranial recordings. The study sample consisted of epilepsy and tumor patients undergoing presurgical evaluation by means of implanted electrodes. In the unattend condition, patients had no overt task. In the active condition, patients had to count simultaneously trials with paired clicks, as well as interspersed trials with single clicks. The ERPs in the active condition were characterized by an underlying negativity both for scalp and neocortical recordings, reaching their maximum at the N100 latency of the 2nd stimulus. A time-frequency analysis revealed that this attention effect comprised only low frequency signals (<3 Hz). In line with that, P50 amplitude and P50 gating were unaffected by attention when data were filtered from 10 to 50 Hz. In addition, attention effects were revealed for intrahippocampal ERP components and for induced high frequency neocortical gamma band activity. Findings indicate that N100 and P200 gating measures can potentially be affected by attention and have to be interpreted carefully when studying clinical populations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

EEGs were recorded from the 19 scalp loci of the international 10-20 system in 11 AD patients and 11 age-matched controls. Our results showed two scaling regions in all subjects' channels, with a clear bend when their corresponding slopes (alpha(1) and alpha(2)) were distinctly different. With the exception of electrode T4, the alpha(1) values were lower in control subjects than in AD patients, with significant differences at TS, P3, P4 and O1 (p < 0.01, Student's t-test). On the other hand, alpha(2) values were higher in control subjects than in AD patients, with significant differences only at F4. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of alpha(2) to discriminate AD patients from control subjects at these electrodes using ROC plots. We obtained a maximum accuracy of 81.82% at O1 with alpha(1) and at F4 with alpha(2). These findings suggest that the scaling behaviour of the EEG is sensitive to AD and that the DMA method could help to increase our insight into brain dysfunction in AD.

Derivation and analysis of an ordinary differential equation mean-field model for studying clinically recorded epilepsy dynamics	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article						brain models; differential equations; electroencephalography; medical disorders; neurophysiology	WAVE OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES	In this paper we describe how an ordinary differential equation model of corticothalamic interactions may be obtained from a more general system of delay differential equations. We demonstrate that transitions to epileptic dynamics via changes in system parameters are qualitatively the same as in the original model with delay, as well as demonstrating that the onset of epileptic activity may arise due to regions of bistability. Hence, the model presents in one unique framework, two competing theories for the genesis of epileptiform activity. Similarities between model transitions and clinical data are presented and we argue that statistics obtained from, and a parameter estimation of this model may be a potential means of classifying and predicting the onset and offset of seizure activity.

To ease the workload on the feature extractor and enhance separability between different brain states, numerous parameters, such as separable frequency bands, data acquisition channels and time point of maximum separability are chosen explicit to each subject. Recent research has shown that using subject specific parameters for the extraction of invariant characteristics specific to each brain state can significantly improve the performance and accuracy of a brain-computer interface (BCI). This paper focuses on developing a fast autonomous user-specific tuned BCI system using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to search for optimal parameter combination based on the analysis of the correlation between different classes i.e., the R-Squared (R-2) correlation coefficient rather than assessing overall systems performance via performance measure such as classification accuracy. Experimental results utilizing eight subjects are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for fast & efficient user-specific tuned BCI system.

As part of a longitudinal study of brain maturation and cognitive development during adolescence, we employed dense-array EEG and spatiotemporal source analysis to characterize maturational changes in the timing of brain responses to temporal variations in sound. We found significant changes in the brain responses compared longitudinally at two time points in early adolescence, namely 10 years (65 subjects) and 11.5 years (60 of the 65 subjects), as well as large differences between adults, studied with the same protocol (Poulsen, Picton & Paus, 2007), and the children at 10 and 11.5 years of age. The transient auditory evoked potential to tone onset showed decreases in the latency of vertex and T-complex components, and a highly significant increase in the amplitude of the N1 wave with increasing age. The auditory steady state response to a 40-Hz frequency-modulated tone increased in amplitude with increasing age. The peak frequency of the envelope-following response to sweeps of amplitude-modulated white noise also increased significantly with increasing age. These results indicate persistent maturation of the cortical mechanisms for auditory processing from childhood into middle adulthood.

In the basal ganglia, including dorsal striatum, dysfunctional LFP states are associated with Parkinson's disease, while in healthy subjects, dorsal striatal LFPs have been linked to decision-making processes. However, LFPs in ventral striatum have been less studied. We report that in rats running a spatial decision task, prominent gamma-50 (45-55 Hz) and gamma-80 (70-85 Hz) oscillations in ventral striatum had distinct relationships to behavior, task events, and spiking activity. Gamma-50 power increased sharply following reward delivery and before movement initiation, while in contrast, gamma-80 power ramped up gradually to reward locations. Gamma-50 power was low and contained little structure during early learning, but rapidly developed a stable pattern, while gamma-80 power was initially high before returning to a stable level within a similar timeframe. Putative fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) showed phase, firing rate, and coherence relationships with gamma-50 and gamma-80, indicating that the observed LFP patterns are locally relevant. Furthermore, in a number of FSIs such relationships were specific to gamma-50 or gamma-80, suggesting that partially distinct FSI populations mediate the effects of gamma-50 and gamma-80.

Cortical Mechanisms of Memory Formation and Readout	IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 14-19, 2009	Atlanta, GA	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; RANDOM NOISE; ORIGIN; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Most researchers regard the 'spontaneous' background activity seen in EEG (scalp electroencephalogram) and ECoG (intracranial electrocorticogram) as noise, to which signals are added by stimuli or by intention to act. Indeed they are noise, but they are not random, and the signals are not added. They emerge by rapid, large-scale reorganization of background activity in the process of perception. Here I show that the background activity of the brain conforms to a modified form of scale-free brown noise - black noise - that is sustained by mutual excitation. Distributed inhibitory feedback operates on the noise as a band pass filter, giving Rayleigh noise in every pass band. The beats trigger the formation of non-random spatiotemporal structures by enabling repetitive phase transitions, through which the microscopic activity patterns of neural populations abruptly re-form upon selection by stimuli into spatial brain wave patterns revealing Rice distributions. The reorganization under sensory guidance constitutes recall of memories stored in synaptic distributions, leading to recognition through transient states of globally patterned brain activity.

Methods: We recorded EEG from 17 children (10-12 years), 16 younger adults (20-26 years), and 17 older adults (70-76 years) during a simple choice-reaction task requiring discrimination of squares and circles of different sizes. We examined age-group differences in the effect of stimulus size on early ERP components, evoked gamma-band power, and inter-trial phase-stability in the gamma band as assessed by the phase-locking index (PLI). Results: In the absence of age differences in discrimination accuracy, we observed reliable age differences in patterns of ERP, evoked gamma power, and PLI. PI and NI peak amplitudes were larger and the peak latencies longer in children than in adults. Children also showed lower levels of evoked power and PLI than adults. Older adults showed smaller increments in evoked power with increasing stimulus size than younger adults, but similar amounts of phase locking for small-and medium-sized stimuli as younger adults. Conclusions: The relative importance of different coding mechanisms in early visual areas changes from childhood to old age. Due to synaptic overproduction and immature myelination, the visual system of children is less entrained by incoming information, resulting in less synchronized neuronal responses. Adults primarily rely on sparse representations formed through experience-dependent temporally synchronized neuronal interactions. In old age, senescent decline in neuronal density and neurotransmitter availability further increase the reliance on temporally synchronized processing. Significance: Findings from this study defy the notion that sensory aging consists in a reversal of sensory development in childhood, and point to a high degree of age specificity in mechanisms of visual coding.

A high-creative group enrolled 16 subjects asked to generate original words associates to the triads of verbal stimuli and 14 subjects who were asked to compose a sentence using triads of nouns from remote semantic categories. Low-creative groups included 22 and 13 individuals, respectively. In low-frequency band, highly creative subjects showed a higher level of alpha power than low creative individuals. In the high-frequency band, task-related alpha2 power desynchronization was different in these groups: high-creative individuals had higher power score than low-creative mostly in the anterior and parietal cortical areas. These data and a factor structure of alpha rhythm indices may be evidence of different strategies of information selection in highly and low creative persons.	[Razumnikova, O. M.; Tarasova, I.

Methods: Whole head 151-channel MEG recordings were obtained in 21 controls and 20 patients with PD during a 10-min olfactory Stimulus paradigm, consisting of 10 alternating rest-stimulus cycles (30 s each), using phenylethyl alcohol administered by means of a Burghart olfactometer. Relative spectral power and synchronization likelihood (SL; an unbiased measure Of functional connectivity) were calculated for delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Results: In controls, olfactory stimulation produced an increase in theta power and a decrease in beta power. In patients with PD, there was a decrease in alpha1 power. No significant interaction between group and condition was found for spectral power. SL analysis revealed a significantly different response to olfactory stimulation in patients with PD compared to controls. In controls, the odor Stimulus induced a decrease in local beta band SL. The response in patients with PD involved a decrease in intrahemispheric alpha2 band SL. Conclusion: This is the first Study to show that time-series analysis of MEG data, including spectral power and SL, can be used to detect odor-induced changes in brain activity. In addition, differences in odor-induced brain activity were found between patients with PD and controls using analysis of SL, but not of spectral power. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3020-3030, 2009.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization Vs. FastICA on Mismatch Negativity of Children	IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 14-19, 2009	Atlanta, GA	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS	In this presentation two event-related potentials, mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a, are extracted from EEG by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) simultaneously. Typically MMN recordings show a mixture of MMN, P3a, and responses to repeated standard stimuli. NMF may release the source independence assumption and data length limitations required by Fast independent component analysis (FastICA). Thus, in theory NMF could reach better separation of the responses. In the current experiment MMN was elicited by auditory duration deviations in 102 children. NMF was performed on the time-frequency representation of the raw data to estimate sources. Support to Absence Ratio (SAR) of the MMN component was utilized to evaluate the performance of NMF and FastICA. To the raw data, FastICA-MMN component, and NMF-MMN component, SARs were 31, 34 and 49dB respectively. NMF outperformed FastICA by 15dB. This study also demonstrates that children with reading disability have larger P3a than control children under NMF.

Brain Oscillatory Substrates of Visual Short-Term Memory Capacity	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MEASURES; CORTEX	The amount of information that can be stored in visual short-term memory is strictly limited to about four items [1]. Therefore, memory capacity relies not only on the successful retention of relevant information but also on efficient suppression of distracting information, visual attention, and executive functions [2-5]. However, completely separable neural signatures for these memory capacity-limiting factors remain to be identified. Because of its functional diversity [6-9], oscillatory brain activity may off er a utile solution. In the present study, we show that capacity-determining mechanisms, namely retention of relevant information and suppression of distracting information, are based on neural substrates independent of each other: the successful maintenance of relevant material in short-term memory is associated with cross-frequency phase synchronization between theta (rhythmical neural activity around 5 Hz) and gamma (>50 Hz) oscillations at posterior parietal recording sites. On the other hand, electroencephalographic alpha activity (around 10 Hz) predicts memory capacity based on efficient suppression of irrelevant information in short-term memory. Moreover, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at alpha frequency can modulate short-term memory capacity by influencing the ability to suppress distracting information. Taken together, the current study provides evidence for a double dissociation of brain oscillatory correlates of visual short-term memory capacity.

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Theta Oscillations in Hippocampal-Entorhinal Slices	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						voltage sensitive dye imaging; in vitro; rat	CARBACHOL-INDUCED THETA; INDUCED EEG-THETA; IN-VITRO; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SPATIAL REPRESENTATION; RECIPROCAL CONNECTIONS; SEPTOTEMPORAL AXIS; PATH-INTEGRATION; FIELD POTENTIALS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS	Theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are associated with learning and memory and are found in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC). The spatio-temporal organization of rhythmic activity in the hippocampal-EC complex was investigated in vitro. The voltage sensitive absorption dye NK3630 was used to record the changes in aggregated membrane voltage simultaneously from the neuronal networks involved. Oscillatory activity at 7.0 Hz (range, 5.8-8.2) was induced in the slice with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (75-100 mu M) in the presence of bicuculline (5 mu M). Time relations between all recording sites were analyzed using cross-correlation functions which revealed systematic phase shifts in the theta oscillation recorded from the different entorhinal and hippocampal subregions. These phase shifts could be interpreted as propagation delays. The oscillation propagates over the slice in a characteristic spatio-temporal sequence, where the entorhinal cortex leads, followed by the subiculum and then the dentate gyrus (DG), to finally reach the CA3 and the CA1 area. The delay from dentate gyrus to the CA3 area was 12.4 +/- 1.1 ms (mean +/- s.e.m.) and from the CA3 to the CA1 region it was 10.9 +/- 1.9 ms. The propagation delays between the hippocampal subregions resemble the latencies of electrically evoked responses in the same subregions. Removing the entorhinal cortex from the slice changed the spatiotemporal pattern into a more clustered pattern with higher local synchrony. We conclude that in the slice, carbachol-induced theta oscillations are initiated in the entorhinal cortex. The EC could serve to control the information flow through the neuronal network in the subregions of the hippocampus by synchronizing and/or entraining their responses to external inputs.

As a seperate issue, the effect of EM noise during operation which influence the patient, anesthesia and surgery teams was also targeted. The results indicate (16 operation sessions) the presence of between 49.85-79.94 dB, (mean 63.10 +/- 5.37) ongoing acoustical noise throughout the surgery. Among the different EM noises sources, electrocautery was found to be the highest one that effected the electrophysiological recording (248.0 mGauss). During the operation of this device, the EM effect resulted in some 400 times larger amplitude scale magnitude than the normal range, contaminating the recordings. Vacuum pumps (52.0 mGauss), surgical lamps (0.1 mGauss), monitors (1.0 mGauss) each displayed a different degree of EM noise. The vacuum pump and the movement related artefacts caused large scale slow oscillations. The abovementioned noise sources have been investigated in relation to electrophysiological quality as well as operation room health conditions. By means of assuring a certain quality for the performance of these very sensitive EEG like devices (BIS etc.), it would be possible to assess the functioning of the nervous system through high resolution data recordings. The overall results can serve to highlight the brain functioning and to establish a platform as research model to clinical studies.

Beta 2-Band Synchronization during a Visual Oddball Task	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Intra-cerebral EEG recording in humans; Visual oddball task; Beta 2 synchronization; Binding in cognition	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MODULATION; CORTEX; COHERENT; MECHANISM; BINDING; HUMANS; MOTOR	The study investigated whether specific changes in phase synchrony in the beta 2 frequency band of EEG (25-35 Hz) occurred during a recognition task. The level of synchrony was examined between one hundred and eighty loci in the frontal and temporal lobes of eight epileptic patients with intracerebral electrodes; the EEG records were obtained during a visual oddball task. In each pair of records, the correlation curves were created from the sequence of correlation coefficients calculated. These curves consisted of irregular oscillations between the maximal and minimal r-values. Transient highly synchronized activity was observed during the whole time course of the experiment in all record pairs investigated and a significant relationship was found between the number of such episodes and the mean correlation coefficient (Spearman R 0.84; N 3240; p<0.001). On averaged curves, which were calculated using stimulus onsets as the trigger of averaging, a significant increase of the mean correlation coefficient in the post-stimulus epoch was found (p<0.01 after both target and non-target stimuli; t-test for dependent samples). As the cognitive demand significantly increases after stimulus presentation, the results are considered to be the first evidence from intracranial recording of increased synchronization in the beta 2 frequency band related to the cognitive activity.

A Comparison of Two Synchronization Measures for Neural Data	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		signal synchronization; periodic synchronization index; phase locking value	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCKING	In this paper we analyze the capability of two different signal synchronization measures to detect synchronized periodic signal components. We compare the periodic synchronization index (PSI), which was first introduced for the detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals, with the widely known phase locking value (PLV). The PSI automatically detects the dominant periodic signal components utilizing Fourier series expansions and measures the synchronization between equivalent components in two signals. The PLV averages the difference between the analytic phases of two signals. Applying these two measures to synthetic data and EEG recordings we found clear advantages of the PSI over the PLV. Experiments with synthetic data and high signal to noise ratio (SNR) revealed no significant difference between the PSI and the PLV in their ability to detect small frequency deviations. However, in the presence of noise the detection performance of the PLV drops significantly. In particular, we found that the PLV relies on an SNR of nearly 3dB. In contrast, the performance with the PSI remained almost unchanged for SNR down to -4dB. This noise robustness of the PSI is due to the incorporation of harmonic oscillations resulting in an improved estimation of periodic signal components. When applied to the detection of early seizure phenomena in EEG data we found that the increase of the PSI at seizure onset is more pronounced and the variance of the measure during pre-ictal time periods is lower than for the PLV.

ADAPTIVE CHANGES OF RHYTHMIC EEG OSCILLATIONS IN SPACE: IMPLICATIONS FOR BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE APPLICATIONS	BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACES FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS: ENHANCING ASTRONAUT CAPABILITIES	International Review of Neurobiology		English	Review; Book Chapter							SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; GAMMA BAND RESPONSES; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; COMPUTER INTERFACE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMANS; MOVEMENT	The dramatic development of brain, machine interfaces has enhanced the use of human brain signals conveying mental action for controlling external actuators. This chapter will outline current evidences that the rhythmic electroencephalographic activity of the brain is sensitive to microgravity environment. Experiments performed in the International Space Station have shown significant changes in the power of the astronauts' alpha and mu oscillations in resting condition, and other adaptive modifications in the beta and gamma frequency range during the immersion in virtual navigation. In this context, the dynamic aspects of the resting or default condition of the awaken brain, the influence of the "top-down" dynamics, and the possibility to use a more constrained configuration by a new somatosensory-evoked potential (gating approach) are discussed in the sense of future uses of brain computing interface in space mission. Although, the state of the art of the noninvasive BCI approach clearly demonstrates their ability and the great expectance in the field of rehabilitation for the restoration of defective communication between the brain and external world, their future application in space mission urgently needs a better understanding of brain neurophysiology, in particular in aspects related to neural network rhythmicity in microgravity	[Cheron, G.; Cebolla, A.

As the subject was watching a silent movie, standard tones (1000-Hz frequency, 100-ms duration) and their duration deviants (50-ms duration, probability of 15%) were randomly delivered binaurally. In addition to localizing the magnetic counterpart of mismatch negativity (MMNm) with equivalent current dipole modeling, we also measured the phase-locking value (PLV) and power change of the oscillatory responses to standard and deviant stimuli by employing the Morlet wavelet-based analysis. The MMNm signals peaking at 150-200 ms after the onset of deviant were localized in bilateral temporal regions with larger amplitudes in the right hemisphere. Then 50 ms after the onset of either standard or deviant stimuli, we observed an increase of PLV and power of theta and alpha oscillations in bilateral temporal regions. PLVs of theta and alpha activities to deviant stimuli were significantly larger in the right than left hemisphere (P < 0.001). Compared with standard stimuli, deviants elicited a larger theta PLV (P < 0.001) at 150-300 ms and a larger theta power change (P < 0.05) at 50-300 ms for the responses in the right temporal region. In addition, a prominent theta phase-locking of deviant-elicited responses was found in the right frontal area at 110-250 ms (P < 0.01). Our current data suggest that a pronounced phase and power modulation on sound-elicited theta oscillations might characterize the change detection processing in the temporo-frontal network as reflected by the mismatch negativity.

J	Lemm, S; Muller, KR; Curio, G				Lemm, Steven; Mueller, Klaus-Robert; Curio, Gabriel			A Generalized Framework for Quantifying the Dynamics of EEG Event-Related Desynchronization	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; ALPHA BAND; RHYTHM; STIMULATION; PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; MOVEMENT	Brains were built by evolution to react swiftly to environmental challenges. Thus, sensory stimuli must be processed ad hoc, i.e., independent-to a large extent-from the momentary brain state incidentally prevailing during stimulus occurrence. Accordingly, computational neuroscience strives to model the robust processing of stimuli in the presence of dynamical cortical states. A pivotal feature of ongoing brain activity is the regional predominance of EEG eigenrhythms, such as the occipital alpha or the pericentral mu rhythm, both peaking spectrally at 10 Hz. Here, we establish a novel generalized concept to measure event-related desynchronization (ERD), which allows one to model neural oscillatory dynamics also in the presence of dynamical cortical states. Specifically, we demonstrate that a somatosensory stimulus causes a stereotypic sequence of first an ERD and then an ensuing amplitude overshoot (event-related synchronization), which at a dynamical cortical state becomes evident only if the natural relaxation dynamics of unperturbed EEG rhythms is utilized as reference dynamics. Moreover, this computational approach also encompasses the more general notion of a "onditional ERD," through which candidate explanatory variables can be scrutinized with regard to their possible impact on a particular oscillatory dynamics under study. Thus, the generalized ERD represents a powerful novel analysis tool for extending our understanding of inter-trial variability of evoked responses and therefore the robust processing of environmental stimuli.

The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 54 autistic subjects and 241 control subjects ranging in age from 2.6 years to 11 years. Complex demodulation was used to compute instantaneous phase differences between all pairs of electrodes and the 1st and 2nd derivatives were used to measure phase reset by phase shift duration and phase lock duration. In both short (6 cm) and long (21-24 cm) inter-electrode distances phase shift duration in ASD subjects was significantly shorter in all frequency bands but especially in the alpha-1 frequency band (8-10 Hz) (p < .0001). Phase lock duration was significantly longer in the alpha-2 frequency band (10-12 Hz) in ASD subjects (p < .0001). An anatomical gradient was present with the occipital-parietal regions the most significant. The findings in this study support the hypothesis that neural resource recruitment occurs in the lower frequency bands and especially the alpha-1 frequency band while neural resource allocation occurs in the alpha-2 frequency band. The results are consistent with a general GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter deficiency resulting in reduced number and/or strength of thalamo-cortical connections in autistic subjects.

CORTICAL PHASE TRANSITIONS: PROPERTIES DEMONSTRATED IN CONTINUUM SIMULATIONS AT MESOSCOPIC AND MACROSCOPIC SCALES	NEW MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article						Gamma activity; synchronous oscillation; cortical self-regulation; EEG; phase cones; null spikes		Continuum simulations of cortical dynamics permit consistent simulations to be performed at different spatial scales, using scale-adjusted parameter values. Properties of the simulations described here accord with Freeman's experimental and theoretical findings on gamma synchrony, phase transition, phase cones, and null spikes. State equations include effects of retrograde action potential propagation into dendritic trees, and kinetics of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. Realistic field potentials and pulse rates, gamma resonance and oscillation, and 1/f(2) background activity are obtained. Zero-lag synchrony and traveling waves occur as complementary aspects of cortical transmission, and lead/lag relations between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations vary systematically around transition to autonomous gamma oscillation. Autonomous gamma is initiated by focal excitation of excitatory cells and suppressed by laterally spreading trans-cortical excitation. By implication, patches of cortex excited to gamma oscillation can mutually synchronize into larger fields, self-organized into sequences by mutual negative feedback relations, while the sequence of synchronous fields is regulated both by cortical/subcortical interactions and by traveling waves in the cortex - the latter observable as phase cones. At a critical level of cortical excitation, just before transition to autonomous gamma, patches of cortex exhibit selective sensitivity to action potential pulse trains modulated in the gamma band, while autonomous gamma releases pulse trains modulated in the same band, implying coupling of input and output modes. Transition between input and output modes may be heralded by phase slips and null spikes. Synaptic segregation by retrograde action potential propagation implies state-specific synaptic information storage.	[Wright, J.

EVENT-RELATED DELTA AND THETA SYNCHRONIZATION DURING EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT EMOTION PROCESSING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; emotion; theta oscillations; implicit processing; explicit processing; sLORETA	BEHAVIORAL-APPROACH; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; AMYGDALA; EEG; STIMULATION; BAND	Emotion information processing may occur in two modes which are differently represented in conscious awareness. Fast online processing involves coarse-grained analysis of salient features, and is not represented in conscious awareness; offline processing takes hundreds of milliseconds to generate fine-grained analysis, and is represented in conscious awareness. These processing modes may be studied using event-related electroencephalogram theta and delta synchronization as a marker of emotion processing. Two experiments were conducted, which differed on the mode of emotional information presentation. In the explicit mode subjects were explicitly instructed to evaluate the emotional content of presented stimuli; in the implicit mode they performed a gender discrimination task. Firstly, we show that in both experiments theta and delta synchronization is stronger upon presentation of "emotional" than "neutral" stimuli, and in subjects who are more sensitive, or experience higher emotional involvement than in less sensitive or detached subjects. Secondly, we show that in the implicit mode theta and delta synchronization is more pronounced in an early (before 250 ms post-stimulus) processing stage, whereas in the explicit mode it is more pronounced in a later processing stage. Source localization analysis showed that implicit processing of angry and happy (relative to neutral) faces is associated with higher early (before 250 ms) theta synchronization in the right parietal cortex and the right insula, respectively. Explicit processing of angry and happy faces is associated with higher late (after 250 ms) theta synchronization in the left temporal lobe and bilateral prefrontal cortex, respectively.

Numerous methods have been developed to reduce powerline interference. However, most of these techniques not only reduce the interference but also attenuate the 60 Hz power of the biomedical signals themselves. In the present study, we applied the S-transform, which provides an absolute phase of each frequency in a multi-resolution time-frequency analysis, to reduce 60 Hz interference. According to results from an electrocardiogram (ECG) to which a simulated 60 Hz noise was added, the S-transform de-noising process restored a power spectrum identical to that of the original ECG coincident with a significant reduction in the 60 Hz interference. Moreover, the S-transform de-noised the signal in an intensity-independent manner when reducing the 60 Hz interference. In both a real ECG signal from the MIT database and natural brain activity contaminated with 60 Hz interference, the S-transform also displayed superior merit to a notch filter in the aspect of reducing noise and preserving the signal. Based on these data, a novel application of the S-transform for removing powerline interference is established.

A relevant wavelet-based approach in the analysis of biomedical signals exploits the capability of wavelet transform to separate the signal energy among different frequency bands (i.e., different scales), realizing a good compromise between temporal and frequency resolution. The rationale of this paper is twofold: (i) to present a mathematical formalization of energy calculation from wavelet coefficients, in order to obtain uniformly time distributed atoms of energy across all the scales; (ii) to show two different applications of the wavelet-based energetic approach to biomedical signals. One application concerns the study of epileptic brain electrical activity, with the aim of identifying typical patterns of energy redistribution during the seizure. Results obtained from this method provide interesting indications on the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the seizure. The other application concerns the electro-oculographic tracings, with the purpose of realizing an automatic detector of a particular type of eye movements (slow eye movements), important to identify sleep phases. The algorithm is able to identify this eye movement pattern efficiently, characterizing it in rigorous energetic terms. The energetic approach built within the framework of the multiresolution decomposition appears as a powerful and versatile tool for the investigation and characterization of transient events in biomedical signals.

Effects of Bemitil on Electrical Activity of the Aminergic Systems and Cerebral Cortex in Awake Cats	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						locus coeruleus; raphe nucleus; noradrenergic neurons; serotonergic neurons; impulse activity; EEG; bemitil		Under conditions of chronic experiments on awake cats, we studied changes in the impulse activity generated by brainstem monoaminergic neurons and also in the background field electrical activity of the neocortex induced by peroral administration of 150 mg/kg bemitil. In supposedly serotonergic neurons of the n. raphe, upon the action of this agent, the frequency of spike generation underwent two-phase modifications. Five to 20 min after administration of bemitil, a decrease (insignificant) in the frequency was followed by an increase (on the 35th min, the frequency began to significantly exceed the initial values, P < 0.05). Beginning from the 5th min of the exposure, discharges of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus were unidirectionally and significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed. With parallel EEG recording, we observed changes in the spectral powers (SPs) of separate rhythms; the SPs of alpha and delta oscillations increased, while the power of the theta rhythm dropped. We compared the effects of bemitil administered in different doses (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg). Possible mechanisms underlying the effect of bemitil on the functioning of cerebral mechanisms are discussed.	[Kolotilova, O. I.; Korenyuk, I.

We give an overview of different approaches and focus on a particular BMI approach: the movement of an artificial effector (e.g. arm prosthesis to the right) by those motor cortical signals that control the equivalent movement of a corresponding body part (e.g. arm movement to the right). This approach has been successfully applied in monkeys and humans by accurately extracting parameters of movements from the spiking activity of multiple single-units. Here, we review recent findings showing that analog neuronal population signals, ranging from intracortical local field potentials over epicortical ECoG to non-invasive EEG and MEG, can also be used to decode movement direction and continuous movement trajectories. Therefore, these signals might provide additional or alternative control for this BMI approach, with possible advantages due to reduced invasiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we examined the right-left hemispheric difference in slow-wave timings in urethane-anesthetized mice. We found that interhemispheric cross-correlograms of local field potentials (LFPs) peaked asymmetrically. Double in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings also revealed the interhemispheric temporal disparity of slow wave-relevant synaptic barrages. The data suggest the hemispheric laterality in the slow wave origin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

Prior intention can locally tune inhibitory processes in the primary motor cortex: direct evidence from combined TMS-EEG	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						combined TMS-EEG; intention; motor cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SILENT PERIOD; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION	Human subjects are able to prepare cognitively to resist an involuntary movement evoked by a suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) by anticipatory selective modulation of corticospinal excitability. Uncovering how the sensorimotor cortical network is involved in this process could reveal directly how a prior intention can tune the intrinsic dynamics of M1 before any peripheral intervention. Here, we used combined TMS-EEG to study the cortical integrative processes that are engaged both in the preparation to react to TMS (Resist vs. Assist) and in the subsequent response to it. During the preparatory period, the contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude was found to be smaller over central electrodes (FC1, C1, Cz) when preparing to resist compared with preparing to assist the evoked movement whereas alpha-oscillation power was similar in the two conditions. Following TMS, the amplitude of the TMS evoked-N100 component was higher in the Resist than in the Assist condition for some central electrodes (FCz, C1, Cz, CP1, CP3). Moreover, for six out of eight subjects, a single-trial-based analysis revealed a negative correlation between CNV amplitude and N100 amplitude. In conclusion, prior intention can tune the excitability of M1. When subjects prepare to resist a TMS-evoked movement, the anticipatory processes cause a decreased cortical excitability by locally increasing the inhibitory processes.

A common means of assessing lateralized brain function in clinical populations has been to examine the relative proportion of EEG alpha activity (8-12 Hz) in each hemisphere (i.e., alpha asymmetry). Increased rightward alpha asymmetry has been associated with ADHD-like traits such as reduced reward responsiveness, a lack of inhibition toward aversive experience, and increased approach behaviors, and previous work has indicated increased rightward alpha asymmetry in children with ADHD. The current study explores whether increased rightward alpha asymmetry is also evident in adults with ADHD. Method: We assessed low (8-10 Hz) and high (10-12 Hz) alpha asymmetry in adults with ADHD (n = 29) versus controls (n = 62) during baseline and cognitive activation conditions for nine homologous electrode pairs along the anterior-posterior axis. Result: Seven results emerged (p < .05) showing increased rightward alpha asymmetry in adults with ADHD. This occurred in three specific electrode pairs across two testing conditions, and five of six results occurred in the lower alpha band. Finally, post hoc analysis indicated that increased rightward alpha asymmetry was generally associated with greater numbers of ADHD symptoms-with a possible parietal association for inattentive and a fronto-temporal association for hyperactivity symptoms. Conclusions: Increased rightward alpha asymmetry previously observed in children with ADHD appears to be a developmentally persistent feature of ADHD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MECHANISMS UNDERLYING STATE DEPENDENT SURFACE-EVOKED RESPONSE PATTERNS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory; rat; quiet sleep; slow-wave sleep; delta	NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; SLEEP STATES; POTENTIALS; RAT; WAKING; VARIABILITY; CAT; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; MODULATION	Cortical evoked response potentials (ERPs) display a rich set of waveforms that are both context and state dependent. However, the mechanisms that underlie state dependent ERP patterns are unclear. Determining those mechanisms through analysis of single trial ERP waveform signatures may provide insight into the regulation of cortical column state and the roles that sleep plays in cortical function. We implanted rats with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes to record ERPs and to assess sleep/wake states continuously during 1-2 s random auditory clicks. Individual cortical auditory ERPs were sorted into one of eight behavioral states, and fell into three categories based on amplitude and latency characteristics. ERPs within waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were predominantly low amplitude and short latency. Approximately 50% of ERPs during light quiet sleep (quiet sleep 1 and quiet sleep 2) exhibited low amplitude, short latency responses, and the remaining ERPs had high amplitude, long latency responses. This distribution was characteristic of EEG fluctuations during low frequency delta waves. Significantly more individual ERPs showed very low amplitudes during deep quiet sleep (quiet sleep 3 and quiet sleep 4), resulting in a lower average ERP. These results support the hypothesis that evoked response amplitudes and waveform patterns follow specific EEG patterns. Since evoked response characteristics distribute differently across states, they could aid our understanding of sleep mechanisms through state-related and local neural signaling. (C) 2009 IBRO.

We develop a quantitative model that treats the generation of these fields in an analogous way to that of electronic shot noise, and use this model to specifically address the cause of this 1/f(2) Brownian noise. The model gives way to two analytically tractable solutions, both displaying Brownian noise: 1) uncorrelated cells that display sharp initial activity, whose extracellular fields slowly decay in time and 2) rapidly firing, temporally correlated cells that generate UP-DOWN states.

J	Andersen, SB; Moore, RA; Venables, L; Corr, PJ				Andersen, Soren Bo; Moore, Roger Anthony; Venables, Louise; Corr, Philip Joseph			Electrophysiological correlates of anxious rumination	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Theta; Coherence; Power; Rumination; Septo-hippocampal system; Rumination; Anxiety	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; EEG ALPHA; PERSONALITY; OSCILLATIONS; TRAIT; CONSCIOUSNESS; SENSITIVITY	EEG coherence and EEG power response were recorded as 63 participants engaged in one of three experimental conditions: 'personal rumination', 'nominal rumination', and 'baseline counting'. The rumination conditions were separated by a neutral (counting) task to eliminate neural carry-over effects. For personal rumination, participants spent 2 min ruminating about something in their life about which they were in two minds (i.e., in a state of personal conflict). For nominal rumination, they were presented with a conflict scenario (concerning buying a car) and instructed to ruminate about that for 2 min. The baseline counting task simply involved counting forwards from 1 at a speed comfortable to the individual. Participants completed various questionnaires to measure mood and also traits of personality (including trait anxiety). EEG data were analysed in the following wavebands: 4-6 Hz, 6-8 Hz, 8-10 Hz, 10-12 Hz, 12-20 Hz and 20-30 Hz. Results revealed that the scalp-wide EEG theta (4-6 Hz and 6-8 Hz) coherence associated with personal rumination was significantly greater than that associated with nominal rumination and baseline counting. Similarly, the scalp-wide 6-8 Hz and parietal-occipital 4-6 Hz power associated with personal rumination were significantly greater than power associated with the nominal rumination and power for baseline counting. For alpha, the 10-12 Hz scalp-wide EEG coherence associated with personal rumination was significantly greater than that associated with baseline counting. Otherwise, the scalp-wide 10-12 Hz power related to both nominal rumination and personal rumination were significantly greater than in response to baseline counting. For 20-30 Hz scalp-wide EEG power, data in response to the nominal rumination condition were significantly increased compared to data associated with the baseline counting condition. In terms of questionnaire data, tense arousal, anger/frustration, hedonic tone and energetic arousal were all influenced by rumination. This was largely in line with expectation. Also, mood state was influenced by neuroticism and state anxiety. Our EEG results are consistent with Gray and McNaughton's [Gray, J.A., McNaughton, N., 2000. The neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Anquiry into the Functions of the Septo-Hippocampal System. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford.] account of recursive processing between the septo-hippocampal system and neocortex during goal-conflict resolution inherent in rumination. Evidence of posterior cingulate involvement in this processing was also discussed. Recommendations for future research, aimed at further evaluating the role of the SHS and the posterior cingulated, were outlined. Effects found in alpha were linked to increased vigilance whilst effects in beta were linked to cognitive and emotional aspects of the task. We conclude that these data provide new information of the neural processes associated with the psychological state of anxious rumination and, thus, hold implications for understanding normal and pathological anxiety.

Synchrony of the Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex Network During Isoflurane Anaesthesia	BASAL GANGLIA IX	Advances in Behavioral Biology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th Triennial Meeting of the International-Basal-Ganglia-Society	SEP 02-06, 2007	Egmond aan Zee, NETHERLANDS	Int Basal Ganglia Soc			MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS; SPONTANEOUS FIRING PATTERNS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; CORTICAL NERVE-TERMINALS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; ACTIVITY IN-VIVO; VOLATILE ANESTHETICS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	In the anaesthetized rat, the membrane potential of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) fluctuates between two states of polarization: the up- and down-states. The PFC network strongly governs activity in its target areas such as various basal ganglia structures. The influence of anaesthesia on network dynamics in the prelimbic cortex will therefore have direct consequences for the activity profile of the output structures. In order to investigate the effects of isoflurane anaesthesia on network activity of the PFC, rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane of which the concentration was varied between 1.25 and 2.25%. Local EEG and single-unit activity were recorded simultaneously. At baseline levels (1.75%), isoflurane anaesthesia induced up-state transitions in the prelimbic cortex visible in the local EEG signal. The up-state deflections in the EEG were determined as reflections of clustered firing of individual prelimbic neurons. 2.25% isoflurane strongly reduced the up-state frequency whereas 1.25% isoflurane allowed the network to shift to a continuous activity mode. These results show that neuronal activity in the medal PFC and therefore its target structures is highly dependent on the level of isoflurane anaesthesia. Considering the similarity between the synaptic targets of isoflurane by which surgical anaesthesia is maintained and the mechanisms involved in initiation, maintenance and cessation of up-states, the up- and down-state fluctuations are a direct result of anaesthesia.

The distributed nature of cognition implies that distinct brain areas must somehow coordinate their activity: cognition, whether in the form of perception or motor actions, results from the integrated spatiotemporal coordinated activity of cell populations in the nervous system, including both glial and neuronal elements. Because the system's collective behavior is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce from its individual components, the determination of brain-coordinated activity at adequate levels of description becomes fundamental to the understanding of nervous system function and its relation to behavior. Some questions arise: what variables are best suited to measure these correlations in activity? What order parameters should be used to characterize coordinated activity among cellular populations and how do these activity patterns relate to behavioral responses? What level of description should be used? This chapter summarizes some physiological and methodological considerations to aid the science practitioner in the study of correlated activity patterns in nervous systems.

Concurrently, scientific interests in exploring whether acupuncture is therapeutically effective are raised alongside those about the means by which it may operate. Modern neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography provide a means to safely monitor brain activity in humans. In this review, we have summarized evidence derived from the neuroimaging studies and tried to elucidate the neurophysiological correlates of acupuncture. Previous investigations on the neural responses to acupuncture mainly focus on its acute effects and explore the correlation between the specific acupoints and cortical activations only in the spatial domain. However, abundant clinical reports and psychophysical analysis suggest the kinetics of acupuncture is longer acting as a function of time. Consequentially, an accurate interpretation of acupuncture actions depends on how effectively we can characterize the nature of temporal variations underlying neural activities, rather than simply detect the occurrence of such changes. This emerging picture indicates that both designing paradigms and statistical models involved in acupuncture studies should be applied with great care.

Neural Representations of Individual Stimuli in Humans Revealed by Gamma-Band Electrocorticographic Activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; CAT; INFORMATION; HIPPOCAMPAL	A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how the human brain represents perceptual and conceptual information. Traditionally, researchers probed this issue by identifying single neurons that increased their firing rate when an animal encountered certain stimuli. Here we provide evidence of a complementary scheme in which gamma-band (25-128 Hz) electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity a phenomenon involving large groups of neurons-encodes the active cognitive representation. We analyzed intracranial brain recordings from neurosurgical patients while they studied lists of visually presented letters and found that the amplitude of gamma-band activity encoded the identity of the current letter. These letter-specific patterns occurred during periods of overall increased gamma amplitude and were linked to the phase of simultaneous theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. In occipital cortex, these patterns sometimes reflected the shape of the viewed letter, but, in other brain regions, this phenomenon was not related to letter form. Our findings show that gamma-band activity encodes a range of perceptual and conceptual information, suggesting that ECoG recordings can reveal neural correlates of specific human cognitive representations.

Here we provide evidence that neurophysiological oscillatory long-range synchrony is a mechanism of post-error adaptation that occurs even without conscious awareness of the error. During a visually signaled Go/No-Go task in which half of the No-Go cues were masked and thus not consciously perceived, response errors enhanced tonic (i.e., over 1-2 s) oscillatory synchrony between MFC and occipital cortex (OCC) leading up to and during the subsequent trial. Spectral Granger causality analyses demonstrated that MFC -> OCC directional synchrony was enhanced during trials following both conscious and unconscious errors, whereas transient stimulus-induced occipital -> MFC directional synchrony was independent of errors in the previous trial. Further, the strength of pre-trial MFC-occipital synchrony predicted individual differences in task performance. Together, these findings suggest that synchronous neurophysiological oscillations are a plausible mechanism of MFC-driven cognitive control that is independent of conscious awareness.

Oscillations in Cardiovascular Function During Acute Hypoxia in the Newborn Piglet Are Associated With Less Neurological Damage and Occur More Frequently in Females	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE; ASPHYXIA; BRAIN; INJURY; FLOW	The function of the cardiovascular system during hypoxia is an important determinant of neurologic outcome. Oscillations in blood pressure, particularly type-3 waves with a duration of 10 to 160 s, have been shown to occur in the presence of hypoxia in the neonatal rat. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and occurrence of type-3 waves in the neonatal piglet and any relationship to neurologic damage after acute global hypoxia. Hypoxia/hypercarbia was induced in 32 anesthetized piglets by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.1 and the ventilation rate from 30 to 10 breaths per minute for 45 min. The degree of neurologic damage was assessed using both physiologic (EEG amplitude and cerebral impedance at 6 It posthypoxia) and structural (microtubule associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry) markers. Type-3 waves in cardiovascular function occurred in 56% of animals. An oscillating pattern was significantly associated with less neurologic damage (p = 0.01) and a lower duration of hypotension during hypoxia (p = 0.02), and occurred more frequently in females (p = 0.024).

The distributed nature of cognition implies that distinct brain areas must somehow coordinate their activity: cognition, whether in the form of perception or motor actions, results from the integrated spatiotemporal coordinated activity of cell populations in the nervous system, including both glial and neuronal elements. Because the system's collective behavior is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce from its individual components, the determination of brain-coordinated activity at adequate levels of description becomes fundamental to the understanding of nervous system function and its relation to behavior. Some questions arise: what variables are best suited to measure these correlations in activity? What order parameters should be used to characterize coordinated activity among cellular populations and how do these activity patterns relate to behavioral responses? What level of description should be used? This chapter summarizes some physiological and methodological considerations to aid the science practitioner in the study of correlated activity patterns in nervous systems.

J	Knyazev, GG				Knyazev, Gennady G.			Is cortical distribution of spectral power a stable individual characteristic?

There are findings, however, which show that individual-specific patterns of cortical spectral power distribution could be amazingly stable, at least in some experimental conditions. In this study two different experimental datasets were used to analyze stability and variability of individual pattern of cortical spectral power distribution across time, experimental conditions, and frequency bands. First experiment consisted of presentation of pictures of emotional facial expressions. Second experiment was an auditory stop-signal task. In both experiments a number of psychometric measures were obtained from each participant. It has been shown that in spite of high short-term variability, individual-specific patterns of cortical spectral power distribution are remarkably stable across frequency bands, long periods of time, and experimental conditions. These patterns are related to state and trait participant's characteristics. The antero-posterior spectral power gradient emerged as the most prominent feature associated with important personality dimensions. Relatively higher oscillatory activity in the frontal cortical region relates to female gender and Behavioral Inhibition tendencies. Relatively higher activity at posterior sites is associated with Extraversion. Significant differences in event-related spectral perturbations upon presentation of emotionally loaded stimuli were found between high and low antero-posterior gradient participants. These data show that cortical distribution of oscillatory activity may be seen as a relatively stable individual characteristic. Enhanced or diminished oscillatory activity of some cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, may play an important role in organization of human behavior. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains Unknown whether FTSD also affects the inhibition (INH) of long-term overlearned motor programs. Consequently, we investigated in a Go/NoGo paradigm the neural correlates associated with the activation (ACT) and inhibition of long-term overlearned motor memory traces in pianists with musician's dystonia (MD), a form of FTSD, during a relevant motor task Under constraint timing conditions with multichannel EEG. In NoGo trials, the movement related cortical potentials showed a positive shift after the NoGo signal related to inhibition and was significantly smaller over sensorimotor areas in musicians With MD. Further, we observed an increase at 850-900 ms in the power of beta oscillations which was significantly weaker for the patient group. The role of the inter-electrode phase coupling in the sensorimotor integration of inhibitory processes turned out to be the most relevant physiological market: the global phase synchronization during INH exhibited an increase between 230 and 330 ms and 7-8 Hz, increase which was significantly smaller for pianists with MD. This effect was due to a weaker phase synchronization between the supplementary motor cortext and left premotor and sensorimotor electrodes in patients. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis of a deficient phase coupling between the neuronal assemblies required to inhibit motor memory traces in patients with MD. EMG recorded from the right flexor pollicis longus muscle confirmed that patients with MD had a disrupted INH in NoGo trials. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2689-2700, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss Inc.

In light of this we investigated the effects of thalamic lesions on SWDs and sleep spindles in the WAG/Rij rat, a genetic model of absence epilepsy. EEG was recorded from neocortex and thalamus in freely moving rats, both before and after unilateral thalamic ibotenic acid lesions. Complete unilateral destruction of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) combined with extensive destruction of the thalamocortical relay (TCR) nuclei, resulted in the bilateral abolishment of SWDs and ipsilateral abolishment of sleep spindles. A suppression of both types of thalamocortical oscillations was found when complete or extensive damage to the RTN was combined with minor to moderate damage to the TCR nuclei. Lesions that left the rostral pole of the RTN and part of the TCR nuclei intact, resulted in an ipsilateral suppression of sleep spindles, but a large increase of bilateral SWDs. These findings demonstrate that the thalamus in general and the RTN in particular are a prerequisite for both the typical bilateral 7-11 Hz SWDs and natural Occurring sleep spindles in the WAG/Rij rat, but Suggest that different intrathalamic subcircuits are involved in the two types of thalamocortical oscillations. Whereas the whole RTN appears to be critical for the generation of sleep spindles, the rostral pole of the RTN seems to be the most likely part that generates SWDs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Invasive intracranial recordings have suggested that high-frequency oscillation is involved in epileptogenesis and is highly localized to epileptogenic zones. The aim of the present study is to characterize the frequency and spatial patterns of high-frequency brain signals in childhood epilepsy using a non-invasive technology. Methods. Thirty children with clinically diagnosed epilepsy were studied using a whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. MEG data were digitized at 4 000 Hz. The frequency and spatial characteristics of high-frequency neuromagnetic signals were analyzed using continuous wavelet transform and beamformer. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained for each patient to localize magnetic sources. Results. Twenty-six patients showed high-frequency (100-1 000 Hz) components (26/30, 86%). Nineteen patients showed more than one high-frequency component (19/30, 63%). The frequency range of high-frequency components varied across patients. The highest frequency band was identified around 910 Hz. The loci of high-frequency epileptic activities were concordant with the lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging for 21 patients (21/30, 70%). The MEG source localizations of high-frequency components were found to be concordant with intracranial recordings for nine of the eleven patients who underwent epilepsy surgery (9/11, 82%). Conclusion. The results have demonstrated that childhood epilepsy was associated with high-frequency epileptic activity in a wide frequency range. The concordance of MEG source localization, MRI and intracranial recordings suggests that measurement of high-frequency neuromagnetic signals might provide	[Xiang, Jing; Fujiwara, Hisako; Lee, Ki; DeGrauw, Ton; Rose, Douglas] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neurol, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Xiang, Jing; Liu, Yang; Wang, Yingying; Kirtman, Elijah G.; Kotecha, Rupesh; Chen, Yangmei; Huo, Xiaolin; Fujiwara, Hisako; Hemasilpin, Nat; Rose, Douglas] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, MEG Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Hemasilpin, Nat; Mangano, Francesco T.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neurosurg, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Leach, James; Jones, Blaise] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA		Xiang, J (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neurol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA.

From local inhibition to long-range integration: A functional dissociation of alpha-band synchronization across cortical scales in visuospatial attention	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Neural synchrony; Alpha-band; Oscillatory dynamics; Inhibition; Functional integration; Selective attention	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; EEG; VOLUNTARY; AMPLITUDE; PARIETAL	When attention is allocated to one visual hemifield, increased alpha power is observed in ipsilateral visual cortex. This has been attributed to synchronization of alpha-band oscillations within cortical regions which reflects inhibitory processing. Recent results, however, indicate that synchronization of alpha oscillations between cortical regions is relevant for transient functional coupling. Such coupling is thought to be involved in orienting attention to a specific region of the visual field. We thus hypothesized that alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and higher-level visual brain regions would be increased in the hemisphere contralateral to an attended location. To test this hypothesis we calculated phase synchronization between attention-related EEG source activations occurring between predictive directional cues and expected visual targets. Alpha amplitude (understood as an index of local synchronization) within low-level visual cortex was increased ipsilateral to attended locations and decreased contralateral to attended locations, consistent with alpha-band scalp topography and previous research relating local alpha power to active inhibition. Increased long-range alpha-band synchronization between low-level visual cortex and parietal cortex, however, was observed contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, whereas decreased synchronization (phase scattering) was observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These results identify a potential mechanism for the enhanced processing of stimuli appearing at attended locations, as long-range synchronization is thought to increase the fidelity and effectiveness of communication between brain areas. Our observation of inhibitory amplitude changes, interpreted as increased local-area synchronization, and facilitatory long-range synchronization demonstrates a functional dissociation for alpha-band synchronization across cortical scales.

The measurements were performed with thirteen blind subjects (15.07 age +/- 1.65, 10 male) and thirteen healthy subjects (15.92 age +/- 2.90, 8 male). One type of tactile stimuli were applied to middle finger and index finger of the right hand. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64 channels, 3 of which (C(z), C(3), C(4)) were primarily analyzed Peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes and durations of delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) were measured in 1000 ms following stimuli. For the statistical analysis Wilcoxon test was used. In this present study, increases in delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) responses for non-painful tactile stimuli in blind subjects were compared with the control group. In each electrode area (C(z), C(3), C(4)) the amplitude measurements of the blind group found higher than the control group and the difference found statistically significant in C(4) electrode area (p < 0.05). The durations in each electrode area (C(z), C(3), C(4)) for the blind group found statistically longer than the control group (for each one p < 0.05).

Event-Related Synchronization/Desynchronization of Cortical Theta- and Alpha-Electrical Activity and Cognitive Set to Emotionally Negative Face Expression	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						alpha- and theta-band induced synchronization/desynchronization; facial expression recognition; cognitive set; top-down influences; cortico-hippocampal system; fronto-thalamic system; tonic and phasic forms of cortex activation	EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS	Alpha- and theta-band EEG synchronization/desynchronization, induced by the presentation of emotionally negative stimulus (angry faces), was studied in 35 healthy adults. In subjects with a plastic set induced theta-synchronization was greater, and its latency was shorter, than in subjects with a rigid set. This difference is particularly apparent in temporal and parieto-occipital brain regions. A sufficiently high level of theta-synchronization is essential for a quick set-shifting. This synchronization reflects the activity of cortico-hippocampal feedback system and its participation in the perception of emotional faces. In subjects with a plastic set this process induces alpha-synchronization, and in subjects with a rigid set - desynchronization. W. Klimesh (2007) suggests, that induced alpha-synchronization reflects processes of inhibition in cognitive activity. This inhibition plays an important role in the set-shifting. The role of tonic and phasic forms of cortex activation, produced by cortico-hippocampal and fronto-thalamic systems, in the shifting of a cognitive set to facial face expression is discussed.

The Effects of L-theanine on Alpha-Band Oscillatory Brain Activity During a Visuo-Spatial Attention Task	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Alpha; L-Theanine; EEG; Tea; Oscillations; High-density electrical mapping	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ANTICIPATORY ATTENTION; HUMAN EEG; POWER; TEA; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; CORTEX	Background/Objectives Ingestion of the non-proteinic amino acid L-theanine (c-glutamylethylamide) has been shown to influence oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) in humans during resting electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and also during cognitive task performance. We have previously shown that ingestion of a 250-mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced tonic (background) alpha power during a demanding intersensory (auditory-visual) attentional cueing task. Further, cue-related phasic changes in alpha power, indexing the shorter-term anticipatory biasing of attention between modalities, were stronger on L-theanine compared to placebo. This form of cue-contingent phasic alpha activity is also known to index attentional biasing within visual space. Specifically, when a relevant location is pre-cued, anticipatory alpha power increases contralateral to the location to be ignored. Here we investigate whether the effects of L-theanine on tonic and phasic alpha activity, found previously during intersensory attentional deployment, occur also during a visuospatial task. Subjects/Methods 168-channel EEG data were recorded from thirteen neurologically normal individuals while engaged in a highly demanding visuo-spatial attention task. Participants underwent testing on two separate days, ingesting either a 250-mg colorless and tasteless solution of L-theanine mixed with water, or a water-based solution placebo on each day in counterbalanced order. We compared the alpha-band activity when subjects ingested L-Theanine vs. Placebo. Results We found a significant reduction in tonic alpha for the L-theanine treatment compared to placebo, which was accompanied by a shift in scalp topography, indicative of treatment-related changes in the neural generators of oscillatory alpha activity. However, L-theanine did not measurably affect cue-related anticipatory alpha effects. Conclusions This pattern of results implies that L-theanine plays a more general role in attentional processing, facilitating longer-lasting processes responsible for sustaining attention across the timeframe of a difficult task, rather than affecting specific moment-to-moment phasic deployment processes.

SPWs are important for hippocampal-cortical communication and memory consolidation, and abnormal sharp wave-ripple complexes are closely related to epileptic seizures. Although the SPWs are known to arise from the CA3 circuit, the local mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. We hypothesize that endogenous adenosine is a local regulator of hippocampal SPWs. We tested this hypothesis in thick mouse hippocampal slices that encompass a relatively large hippocampal circuit and have a high propensity of generating spontaneous in vitro SPWs. We found that application of adenosine A1 receptor antagonists induced in vitro SPWs and that such induction was sensitive to blockade by NMDA receptor antagonists. By contrast, an increase in endogenous adenosine via pharmacological inhibition of adenosine transporters or adenosine degrading enzymes suppressed spontaneous in vitro SPWs. We thus suggest that the initiation and incidence of sharp wave-like population events are under tight control by the activity of endogenously stimulated A1 receptors. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Skin conductance response, heart rate, and electromyography, and alpha frequency band, were registered, during viewing IAPS figures. Both BIS and BAS measures were significant in modulating behavioral, autonomic and brain responses, with a clear dichotomy BAS-appetitive/positive BIS-withdrawal/negative sensitivity. Withdrawal (BIS) and appetitive (BAS) behavior showed opposite patterns of responses by the subjects within the frontal cortical site more than other sites. In addition, a specific frontal lateralization effect was found as a function of BIS (more right-side activation for negative cues) and BAS (more left-side activation for positive cues). Moreover, autonomic variables and frequency band were found to be effected by arousal rating per se, with an increased response to high arousal in comparison with low arousal and neutral stimuli. The effects of subjective evaluation and individual differences were discussed in the light of the coping activity of emotion comprehension. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two types of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats (normal and partial epilepsy) were obtained from the MIT-BIH database. Post-ictal heart rate oscillations were studied in a heterogeneous group of patients with partial epilepsy. The classification accuracies of modified mixture of experts (MME), which were trained on diverse features, were obtained. The eigenvector methods (Pisarenko, multiple signal classification - MUSIC, and Minimum-Norm) were selected to generate the power spectral density (PSD) estimates. The features from the eigenvector PSD estimates, wavelet coefficients and Lyapunov exponents of the ECG signals were computed and statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. The statistical features, which were used for obtaining the diverse features of the ECG signals, were then input into the implemented neural network models for training and testing purposes. The present study demonstrated that the MME trained on the diverse features achieved high accuracy rates (total classification accuracy of the MME is 99.44%). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The electric field is a sufficient physical determinant of the human magnetic sense	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Evoked potentials; nonlinearity; electroencephalogram; recurrence analysis; transduction	POTENTIALS; ORGANS; EEG	Purpose: The onset and offset of weak low-frequency magnetic fields triggered evoked potentials in human subjects that could be detected using nonlinear analysis, but not by means of time averaging. Because the magnetic fields and their induced electric fields were both present in the brain, their respective role in producing the effect on brain activity could not be ascertained. We inquired whether a biophysical coupling mechanism involving only the electric field could explain the occurrence of the brain potentials. Materials and methods: An external electric field capable of producing a brain electric field comparable to that induced by the magnetic stimuli was identified by finite-element analysis. The electroencephalogram from 23 subjects was measured from six scalp derivations in the presence and absence of the external electric field, and the presence of evoked potentials was assessed using nonlinear and linear analyses. Results: Evoked potentials were observed in all but one subject (p0.05 in each subject); the potentials had the same latency, duration, and distribution of magnitudes as seen in the earlier studies, and were detectable only by means of nonlinear analysis. Using a realistic physical model of an ion channel, we showed that transduction of an electric field could be explained by assuming that the field exerted a force on glycocalyx molecules attached to a channel gate. Conclusion: The evoked potentials described here, as well as those observed previously in response to magnetic stimuli, were probably triggered by the induced electric field.

Cortical processing of these sounds critically depends on behavioral demands. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms enabling this adaptive processing remain elusive. Here we examine the task-dependent reorganization of electroencephalographic responses to natural speech sounds ( vowels /a/, /i/, /u/) spoken by three speakers ( two female, one male) while listeners perform a one-back task on either vowel or speaker identity. We show that dynamic changes of sound-evoked responses and phase patterns of cortical oscillations in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) closely reflect the abstraction and analysis of the sounds along the task-relevant dimension. Vowel categorization leads to a significant temporal realignment of responses to the same vowel, e. g., /a/, independent of who pronounced this vowel, whereas speaker categorization leads to a significant temporal realignment of responses to the same speaker, e. g., speaker 1, independent of which vowel she/he pronounced. This transient and goal-dependent realignment of neuronal responses to physically different external events provides a robust cortical coding mechanism for forming and processing abstract representations of auditory ( speech) input.

A Randomized Open-Label Comparison of Lamotrigine and Valproate in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; lamotrigine; valproate	ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; SEIZURES; MONOTHERAPY; CARBAMAZEPINE; TOLERABILITY; ADOLESCENTS; POPULATION; EXPERIENCE; PROGNOSIS; CHILDREN	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine and valproate in patients with different types of generalized epilepsy characterized by myoclonic seizures as well as compare the efficacy of those two drugs. A pilot, randomized controlled trial analysis of 46 female patients (age 8-30 years) in a large university hospital. All patients underwent several interictal EEG including routine awake and sleep EEGs. Lamotrigine was started at the dose of 500 mg day(-1) and was progressively increased to a mean dose of 1500-2000 mg day(-1) in a time course of 8 weeks. The target maintenance dose for valproate was 800 mg day(-1) after starting valproate at the dose of 200 mg/12 h. The mean dose was reached within 4 weeks. Out of total 46 patients, 46 (100%) had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; 43 (93.48%) had tonic-clonic; 5 (11%) had myoclonic absences. In the valproate and lamotrigine groups, there was significant reduction, p < 0.001, p < 0.001) in myoclonic seizure and tonic-clonic seizure frequencies. There was no clinically significant, difference (p > 0.05) between the effect of those two drugs that means the lamotrigine and valproate have similar effect in reducing the myoclonic seizure and tonic-clonic seizure frequencies. There was statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) of those two drugs that means the lamotrigine and valproate also have significant effect in reducing the absences seizure frequency. The results suggest that lamotrigine monotherapy is a possible alternative for valproate among patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who experienced unaccepted side effects or inadequate seizure control with valproate monotherapy.

Using these methods, we analyzed the DTF-based causal information flow in nine seizures recorded from two patients undergoing presurgical monitoring for the treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. From the results, we observed a high degree of correlation between the regions with a high amount of information outflow (termed the outdegree) and the cortical areas identified clinically as the generators of the ictal activity. We furthermore observe a frequency-dependent correlation between the co-localization of these "activated regions" and the clinical foci. These findings suggest that application of network analysis tools to ictal activity could provide clinically useful information concerning these epileptogenic networks.

The comodulation measure of neuronal oscillations with general harmonic wavelet bicoherence and application to sleep analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuronal populations; General harmonic wavelet; Bicoherence; Phase coupling; Sleep	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC BICOHERENCE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES; SLOW OSCILLATION; EEG FREQUENCY; MEMORY; BRAIN; ANESTHESIA; DYNAMICS	Brain functions are related to neuronal networks of different sizes and distribution, and neuronal networks of different sizes oscillate at different frequencies. Thus the synchronization of neuronal networks is often reflected by cross-frequency interaction. The description of this cross-frequency interaction is therefore a crucial issue in understanding the modulation mechanisms between neuronal populations. A number of different kinds of interaction between frequencies have been reported. In this paper, we develop a general harmonic wavelet transform based bicoherence using a phase randomization method. This allows us to measure the comodulation of oscillations between different frequency bands in neuronal populations. The performance of the method is evaluated by a simulation study. The results show that the improved wavelet bicoherence method can detect a reliable phase coupling value, and also identify zero bicoherence for waves that are not phase-coupled. Spurious bicoherences can be effectively eliminated through the phase randomization method. Finally, this method is applied to electrocorticogram data recorded from rats during transitions between slow-wave sleep, rapid-eye movement sleep and waking. The phase coupling in rapid-eye movement sleep is statistically lower than that during slow-wave sleep, and slightly less than those in the wakeful state. The degree of phase coupling in rapid-eye movement sleep after slow-wave sleep is greater than in rapid-eye movement sleep prior to waking. This method could be applied to investigate the cross-frequency interactions in other physiological signals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: We recorded magnetic responses during an auditory oddball task in 12 normal subjects. Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM)-permutation analysis was used to visualize the multiple brain regions associated with event-related magnetic fields (ERFs), and event-related oscillations during target detection processing. Results: SAM-permutation results showed the topographical distribution of N1m over the bilateral primary auditory cortex. Post-stimulus delta (1.5-4 Hz) activity sources, likely related to the P300 slow-waveform, were distributed over the tight frontocentral and parietal regions. Source locations of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS) were identified over the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex. We visualized bilateral central-Rolandic suppresions for mu (8-15 Hz). beta (15-30 Hz), and low-gamma (30-60 Hz) activities, more dominant in the hemisphere contralateral to the moving hand (button-pressing in response to target stimuli). Conclusions: Prefrontal theta and alpha ERS, and frontocentral-parietal delta ERS are functionally-parietal engaged in auditory attention and memory updating process. Significance: Spatially filtered MEG is valuable for detection and source localization of task-related changes in the ongoing oscillatory activity during oddball tasks.

J	Garcell, JR; Medina, WR				Ricardo Garcell, Josefina; Rueda Medina, Walfred			Electroencephalogram and event related potentials in obsessive compulsive disorder	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; P300; frequency analysis	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MATTER ABNORMALITIES; EEG	The obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a diverse and multidimensional psychiatric syndrome, characterized by obsess ions and compulsions, where anxiety is considered to be a key clinical component. Imaging studies have shown brain abnormalities in patients with OCD involving mainly the frontotemporal circuits, the orbitofrontal and the anterior cingulate cortex. These techniques have a high spatial resolution to identify brain alterations in this disorder but have less time resolution and are more expensive than electrophysiological studies. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) are the most common electrophysiological techniques used in the research of OCD. The EEG represents the electrical activity of the brain as recorded by electrodes placed on the scalp. The ERPs are voltage fluctuations that are temporarily linked to the presence of a physical or mental event. The best-known type of EEG is the "traditional EEG" (analyzed by visual inspection), which is characterized by the presence and topographic distribution of four frequency bonds: delta (delta), theta (theta), alfa (alpha), and beta (beta). The delta and theta bands are identified as slow activities while the alpha and beta bands are known as fast activities. The slow activity has been referred to as the most common abnormality in OCID, specially in the theta band. Moreover, the Broad Band Spectral Parameters (BBSPs) have contributed, for more than two decades, to the study of psychiatric patients and their values con be presented in a compact form as a topographic map on the scalp (Brain Mapping in the frequency domain). The Absolute Power (AP) and the Relative Power (RP) are the most common BBSPs used. Is difficult to determine if AP is abnormal at certain age due to the fad that AP values vary with age. To solve it, it is suggested to transform AP's values, in every band, into Z values which indicate how close is the subject to the average values of normal individuals of the some age. Since abnormal increases and decreases have been described in the anterior brain regions by the slow bands (delta and theta) and the fast bands (alpha and beta), some authors have considered inconsistent the alterations that have been observed with the BBSPs. Nevertheless, in accordance with traditional EEG studies, other authors have confirmed the excess of theta activity in patients with OCD. Of special interest for the clinical practice is that some authors have demonstrated, using the BBSPs, the existence of two OCD patients subgroups, which were homogeneous from the clinical point of view: one group with an excess of theta in the RP values, specially in the frontal and fronto-temporal regions, and a significative increase of a RP values for the other group. Eighty per cent of the patients of the first subgroup did not improved with selective serotonine reuptake, inhibitors treatment, whereas 82.4% of the patients of the second group improved. These results were confirmed ten years later and the a RP excess, present in those patients who improved, decreased after three months of treatment. However, it must be reminded that the generator of abnormal brain electrical activity, could be originate in a distant place to the location shown by the scalp electrodes. LORETA and VARETA are two methods used to calculate the origin of the generators above mentioned. The first investigation using LORETA was published in 2005, and it was observed that compared to controls, the OCD group showed an excess of beta activity in the cingulate gyrus (mainly in the middle cingulate gyrus), as well as in the adjacent frontal, parietal and occipital regions. Two years later, in another EEG sources study, but using VARETA, has been found an excess of alpha activity with abnormal EEG sources located in the striatum and in the orbito-frontal and temporo-frontal regions, which decreased after successful treatment with paroxetine. Therefore, it is also heartening to confirm, through the study of generators of the EEG, a result of great clinical value previously proved with BBSPs. The ERPs are divided into two types: exogenous and endogenous. In this paper we shall refer to the endogenous or cognitive type which depends on the nature of the interaction between the subject and the stimulus, so it will vary with attention, relevance of the task and the processing required. The ERPs are small voltage fluctuations that are identified by their latency (time of appearance in milliseconds), its amplitude (voltage in microvolts) and its polarity (positive or negative voltage). Among the most characteristic ERPs components are the N200 and the P300. In most cases these components are elicited through a classical "oddball" paradigm, in which an infrequent stimulus ("target") is randomly interspersed within an ongoing train of a different repeating stimulus ("standard"). There are at least two subcomponents of the P300: a frontal/central maximum amplitude component, the P3a that appears after the occurrence of unexpected distracters, regardless of its relevance for the task and represents an orienting response. The other one is the P3b, which has been more studied, it has a central/parietal distribution and evaluates attention and working memory. The N200 component has been linked to the automatic and voluntary process of identification and categorization of the stimuli. In patients with OCD there have been described shorter latencies and larger amplitudes for the P3b and N200 components, suggesting hyperarousal of the cortex and overfocused attention. However, there have also been described shorter amplitudes and larger latencies for the P300 component in the frontal regions, which have been related to an impairment of working memory or attention. Some authors have observed an inverse correlation between the N200 amplitude and the severity of the symptoms as well as a positive correlation between this variable and the response to treatment with selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors, but others have pointed out that patients that respond to treatment have a lower N200 amplitude, a larger P300 amplitude and a N200 and P300 shorter latencies. As for the possible association between the ERPs and the disease's evolution time, there has been a positive correlation between the N200 amplitude and the chronicity of the disorder. It has also been found that the amplitude of the P300 component is positively associated with the severity of symptoms assessed by the Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale. Finally, it can be considered that, from a clinical point of view, patients with OCD have the feeling that "something is not right" or "of having committed an omission" when it has not been committed, and "get caught" on excessive verification responses when an error mistake has happened. That phenomenological consideration has been associated to an alteration of the action monitoring process, which represents one of the executive functions mediated by the frontal regions, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, which may be "hyperactive" OCD patients when they have the feeling of having made a mistake. The action monitoring process has been evaluated in patients with OCD through an ERP component called "Error-related Negativity" (ERN). The ERN is a negative wave around the 50-150 ms, which appears after the subject committed an error or thinks it has been done. In an ERN study it was found greater ERN amplitudes in the frontal regions in subjects with high obsessivity rates compared to subjects with low obsessivity ones, which is consistent with the hyperactivity hypothesis of the fronto-temporal system proposed for this disorder and is according to the theory that patients with OCD show an increase of the monitoring function when a mistake has been done. However, there are authors who have not found differences in the NRE between healthy subjects and patients with OCD under pharmacological treatment, but they have observed a significant negative association between the ERN amplitude and the severity of the disorder. Hajcak et al. 2008, noticed an amplitude ERN increase in a group of subjects with pediatric OCD compared with the control group, which is consistent with ERN adult studies. In addition, since the ERN was not associated with the symptom severity or the response to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, that is why this alteration of the ERN could be a trait-like marker. Based on the foregoing, these researchers suggested that the increase in the amplitude of the NRE could be considered as an endophenotype. The EEG and ERPs con do an important contribution, in conjunction with clinical and imaging studies, to the identification of the structures and circuits involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. In addition, there are several evidences to support the utility of these electrophysiological techniques as complementary studies in the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with OCD.

In the hippocampal CA3 network, NMDA receptors are abundant at the recurrent synapses but scarce at the mossy fiber synapses. We generated mutant mice in which NMDA receptors were abolished in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons by postnatal day 14. The histological and cytological organizations of the hippocampal CA3 region were indistinguishable between control and mutant mice. We found that mutant mice lacking NMDA receptors selectively in CA3 pyramidal neurons became more susceptible to kainate-induced seizures. Consistently, mutant mice showed characteristic large EEG spikes associated with multiple unit activities (MUA), suggesting enhanced synchronous firing of CA3 neurons. The electrophysiological balance between fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission was comparable between control and mutant pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region, while the NMDA receptor-slow AHP coupling was diminished in the mutant neurons. In the adult brain, inducible ablation of NMDA receptors in the hippocampal CA3 region by the viral expression vector for Cre recombinase also induced similar large EEG spikes. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of CA3 NMDA receptors enhanced the susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures. These results raise an intriguing possibility that hippocampal CA3 NMDA receptors may suppress the excitability of the recurrent network as a whole in vivo by restricting synchronous firing of CA3 neurons.

Rhythmic Oscillations in Quantitative EEG Measured During a Continuous Performance Task	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						EEG; Attention; Vigilance; Cyclic; Periodicity; CPT; PCA; FA; Performance; Right hemisphere	SUSTAINED ATTENTION TASK; VIGILANCE TASK; INTRINSIC ALERTNESS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SYSTEM; SPECTRUM; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; LOCALIZATION; DROWSINESS	The objective of the present investigation was to determine if cyclic variations in human performance recorded during a 30 min continuous performance task would parallel cyclic variations in right-hemisphere beta-wave activity. A fast fourier transformation was performed on the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) and the performance record of each participant (N = 62), producing an individual periodogram for each outcome measure. An average periodogram was then produced for both qEEG and performance by combining (averaging) the amplitudes associated with each periodicity in the 62 original periodograms. Periodicities ranging from 1.00 to 2.00 min and from 4.70 to 5.70 min with amplitudes greater than would be expected due to chance were retained (Smith et al. 2003). The results of the present investigation validate the existence of cyclic variations in human performance that have been identified previously (Smith et al. 2003) and extend those findings by implicating right-hemisphere mediated arousal in the process (Arruda et al. 1996, 1999, 2007). Significant cyclic variations in left-hemisphere beta-wave activity were not observed. Taken together, the findings of the present investigation support a model of sustained attention that predicts cyclic changes in human performance that are the result of cyclic changes in right-hemisphere arousal.

Defined as "general activation of mind'' (Kahnemann in Attention and effort. Prentice-Hall, New Jersey, 1973), or "general operation of consciousness'' (Thacher and John in Functional neuroscience: foundations of cognitive processing. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, 1977), arousal can be considered as a starting point of fundamental research on consciousness. Similar role could be assigned to attention, which can be defined by substituting the attributes "general'' with "focused''. Concerning the practical applications, the empirically established correlation between neuronal oscillations and arousal/attention levels is widely used in research and clinics, including neurofeedback, brain-computer communication, etc. However, the neurophysical mechanism underlying this correlation is still not clear enough. In this paper, after reviewing some present classical and quantum approaches, a transition probability concept of arousal based on field-dipole quantum interactions and information entropy is elaborated. The obtained analytical expressions and numerical values correspond to classical empirical results for arousal and attention, including the characteristic frequency dependence and intervals. Simultaneously, the fundamental (substrate) role of EEG spectrum has been enlightened, whereby the attention appears to be a bridge between arousal and the content of consciousness. Finally, some clinical implications, including the brain-rate parameter as an indicator of arousal and attention levels, are provided.

For example, rats use their whiskers in the dark and their eyes during the light, and this is manifested as a greater magnitude of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity in the somatosensory and visual cortex during sleep in the corresponding light and dark periods respectively. The parsimonious interpretation of such findings is that sleep is distributed across local brain regions and is use-dependent. The fundamental properties of sleep can also be experimentally defined locally at the level of small neural assemblies such as cortical columns. In this view, sleep is orchestrated, but not fundamentally driven, by central mechanisms. We explore two physiological markers of local, use-dependent sleep, namely, an electrical marker apparent as a change in the size and shape of an electrical evoked response, and a metabolic marker evident as an evoked change in blood volume and oxygenation delivered to activated tissue. Both markers, applied to cortical columns, provide a means to investigate physiological mechanisms for the distributed homeostatic regulation of sleep, and may yield new insights into the consequences of sleep loss and sleep pathologies on waking brain function.

Effects of Low Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on Gamma Frequency Oscillations and Event-Related Potentials During Processing of Illusory Figures in Autism	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Review						Autism; Minicolumns; Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Gamma frequencies	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; WEAK CENTRAL COHERENCE; DOUBLE BOUQUET CELL; MINICOLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BAND ACTIVITY; DOUBLE-BLIND; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION	Previous studies by our group suggest that the neuropathology of autism is characterized by a disturbance of cortical modularity. In this model a decrease in the peripheral neuropil space of affected minicolumns provides for an inhibitory deficit and a readjustment in their signal to noise bias during information processing. In this study we proposed using low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a way increasing the surround inhibition of minicolumns in autism. Thirteen patients (ADOS and ADI-R diagnized) and equal number of controls participated in the study. Repetitive TMS was delivered at 0.5 Hz, 2 times per week for 3 weeks. Outcome measures based on event-related potentials (ERP), induced gamma activity, and behavioral measures showed significant post-TMS improvement. The results suggest that rTMS offers a potential therapeutic intervention for autism.

EEG-correlates of trait anxiety in the stop-signal paradigm	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Stop-signal paradigm; Trait anxiety; EEG oscillations	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; IMPULSIVITY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MODEL	The relationship between trait anxiety and event-related EEG oscillatory reactions in the stop-signal paradigm was studied in 15 non-clinical subjects with average age of 26 years (13 men). In the paradigm, subjects responded to target stimuli by pressing one of the two choice buttons. In 30 out of 130 trials, target presentation was followed by a stop-signal, indicating that subjects had to refrain from a prepared motor response. The subject's level of anxiety was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Wide-band desynchronization (8-25 Hz) was found before button-press. It was sustained after the subjects pressed the button at 7-14 Hz frequency range. Also, synchronization at 15-25 Hz band occurred in 400-1400 ms after the button-press. Synchronization at lower frequencies (1-7 Hz) was also found during 0-700 ms after the stop-signal onset. Also, desynchronization at 8-20 Hz was found in 300-800 ITS after stop-signal onset. The group with higher anxiety showed desynchronization at 10-13 Hz in 0-800 ms after the button-press, whereas the group with lower anxiety showed synchronization at the same frequency range. In 0-600 ms after stop-signal onset, desynchronization at 8-13 Hz was observed in the group with higher anxiety, whereas the group with lower anxiety demonstrated synchronization or weak desynchronization. Our findings support the Eysenck et al. [M.W. Eysenck, N. Derakshan, R. Santos, M.G. Calvo, Anxiety and cognitive performance: attentional control theory, Emotion 7(2) (2007) 336-356] theory that subjects with higher anxiety have more attentional control over reaction and increased use of processing resources as compared with lower anxiety subjects.

Decoupling of the brain's default mode network during deep sleep	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; resting state; connectivity; consciousness	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; BOLD; CONSCIOUSNESS; FMRI; ARCHITECTURE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX	The recent discovery of a circuit of brain regions that is highly active in the absence of overt behavior has led to a quest for revealing the possible function of this so-called default-mode network (DMN). A very recent study, finding similarities in awake humans and anesthetized primates, has suggested that DMN activity might not simply reflect ongoing conscious mentation but rather a more general form of network dynamics typical of complex systems. Here, by performing functional MRI in humans, it is shown that a natural, sleep-induced reduction of consciousness is reflected in altered correlation between DMN network components, most notably a reduced involvement of frontal cortex. This suggests that DMN may play an important role in the sustenance of conscious awareness.

Nonlinear Phase-Phase Cross-Frequency Coupling Mediates Communication between Distant Sites in Human Neocortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synchronization; motor cortex; EEG; frequency; directional; human	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN SIGNALS; MEG DATA; MOTOR; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; LOCKING; SYSTEM; CORTEX; ALPHA	Human cognition is thought to be mediated by large-scale interactions between distant sites in the neocortex. Synchronization between different cortical areas has been suggested as one possible mechanism for corticocortical interaction. Here, we report robust, directional cross-frequency synchronization between distant sensorimotor sites in human neocortex during a movement task. In four subjects, electrocorticographic recordings from the cortical surface revealed a low-frequency rhythm (10-13 Hz) that combined with a higher frequency (77-82 Hz) in a ventral region of the premotor cortex to produce a third rhythm at the sum of these two frequencies in a distant motor site. Such cross-frequency coupling implies a nonlinear interaction between these cortical sites. These findings demonstrate that task-specific, phase-phase coupling can support communication between distant areas of the human neocortex.

In the current issue of Consciousness and Cognition, Lee et al. report that loss of consciousness, as produced by a bolus injection of the general anesthetic propofol to human volunteers, was accompanied by a decrease in wide-band EEG feedback connectivity from frontal cortex to parietal cortex, confirming a prediction from previous experimental studies. Interestingly, frontoparietal feedback connectivity did not fully recover after the anesthetic effect wore off and the subjects first opened their eyes in response to a verbal command. Possible interpretations of the results and their implications with respect to the neural correlates of consciousness and unconsciousness are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Participants searched for passengers and stores during virtual navigation in simulated towns. We compared oscillatory brain activity in response to store views that were targets or nontargets (during store search) or neutral (during passenger search). Even though store category was solely defined by task context (rather than by sensory cues), frontal electrophysiological activity in the low frequency bands (primarily in the theta [4-8 Hz] band) reliably distinguished between the target, nontarget, and neutral store views. These results implicate low-frequency oscillatory brain activity in frontal regions as an important variable in the study of the cognitive processes involved in object recognition, categorization, and other forms of high-level perception.

J	Urakami, Y				Urakami, Yuko			Relationships Between Sleep Spindles and Activities of the Cerebral Cortex After Hemispheric Stroke As Determined by Simultaneous EEG and MEG Recordings	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep spindles; Asymmetry; Focal cerebral lesion; EEG; MEG	FREQUENCY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COHERENCE; ASYMMETRY	This study aimed to determine the relationships between the amplitude and cortical-activating areas in each hemisphere for 14-Hz centro-parietal spindles to clarify the involvement of the cortex in the asymmetry of spindles after hemispheric stroke with putaminal or thalamic hemorrhage using simultaneous recording of the electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram. Spontaneous cortical activities during sleep stage 2 (spindles) were simultaneously recorded from 10 patients with putaminal or thalamic hemorrhage with a 60-channel electroencephalogram and a 306-channel whole-head magnetoencephalogram. Based on the frequencies and cortical distributions recorded with electroencephalogram, the 14-Hz centro-parietal and 12-Hz frontal spindles were differentiated, The cortical sources of the 14-Hz centro-parietal spindles were identified with magnetoencephalogram as equivalent current dipoles. Activation centered in four areas, the pre- and postcentral areas in posterior frontal cortex and parietal cortex of each hemisphere. However, these areas were not always activated simultaneously. Reduction of amplitude in the affected hemisphere after hemispheric stroke indicated reduction of areas of activation or activation strengths in the ipsilateral hemisphere. For some spindles, when reduction Of amplitude of above 50% occurred in the affected hemisphere compared with the nonaffected hemisphere, no activation Occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Reduction Of amplitude was related to the reduction of areas of cortical activation and activation strengths. Reduction of amplitude also occurred over the nonaffected hemisphere, and reduction of cortical activating area and activation occurred in the nonaffected hemisphere, suggesting that the cerebral hemispheres are involved in the eneration of spontaneous sleep spindles. The stronger ipsilateral effects of cerebral lesions oil spindle oscillations indicated reduction of amplitude of sleep spindles in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as well as reduction of cortical activation of spindle oscillations and Underlying corticothalamic projections. Simultaneous electroencephalogram) and magnetoencephalogram recordings can yield valuable findings concerning the functional asymmetry between hemispheres after hemispheric stroke from the relationships between the amplitude and patterns of cortical activation associated with spindles.

Among these areas the insular cortex has been shown to be involved in the expectation and processing of pain. Alpha power modulation has been associated with the experience of pain. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the threat of a painful stimulus affects alpha rhythm oscillation in the insular cortex and to find the time intervals during which the insular cortex is most active. We used a beamforming method in the frequency domain to estimate alpha power associated with source activity during psychologically different conditions, namely a sequence of nonpainful somatosensory stimuli (non-threatening condition) and a sequence of nonpainful stimuli randomly intermixed with painful stimuli (threatening condition). The results revealed that the anterior insula alone was involved during the threat of painful stimuli. Conversely, the posterior insula - as well as other brain areas such as SII - was involved in the processing of somatosensory stimuli regardless their painfulness. Additionally, the involvement of the anterior insula should not be accounted for by fear, arousal, habituation effect or by the occurrence of randomly interleaved different stimuli, but it is likely to be related mainly to expectancy mechanisms enhancing activity of specific neuronal populations.

Prelude to and Resolution of an Error: EEG Phase Synchrony Reveals Cognitive Control Dynamics during Action Monitoring	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						theta rhythm; oscillator; cognitive; connectivity; cingulate; human	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEGATIVITY; CONFLICT; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TASK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Error-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to work in conjunction with lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) as a part of an action-monitoring network, where errors signal the need for increased cognitive control. The neural mechanism by which this mPFC-lPFC interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current-source density- transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the mPFC was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between FCz (mPFC) and F5/6 (lPFC) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of mPFC-lPFC oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of mPFC power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.

Our objective was to explain specific shape features of interictal spikes in the hippocampus (observed in LFPs) in terms of cell-and network-related parameters of neuronal circuits that generate these events. We developed a neural network model based on "minimal" but biologically relevant neuron models interconnected through GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses that reproduce the main physiological features of the CA1 subfield. Simulated LFPs were obtained by solving the forward problem (dipole theory) from networks including a large number (similar to 3000) of cells. Insertion of appropriate parameters allowed the model to simulate events that closely resemble actual epileptic spikes. Moreover, the shape of the early fast component ("spike") and the late slow component ("negative wave") was linked to the relative contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. In addition, the model provides insights about the sensitivity of electrode localization with respect to recorded tissue volume and about the relationship between the LFP and the intracellular activity of principal cells and interneurons represented in the network.

In the present EEG study, we investigated the effects of perceptual grouping on the visual GBR in the perimetrically intact visual field of patients with homonymous hemianopia and compared them to healthy participants. All observers were presented either random arrays of Gabor elements or arrays with an embedded circular arrangement. For the hemianopic patients, the circle was presented in their intact hemifield only. For controls, the hemifield for the circle presentation was counterbalanced across subjects. The participants were instructed to detect the circle by pressing a corresponding button. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the calculation of oscillatory GBRs. The early evoked GBR exhibited a larger amplitude and shorter latency for the healthy group compared to hemianopic patients and was associated with behavioral measures. The late total GBR between 200 and 400 ms after stimulus onset was significantly increased for Gestalt-like patterns in healthy participants. This effect was not manifested in patients. The present findings indicate deficits in the early and late visual processing of Gestalt patterns even in the intact hemifield of hemianopic patients compared to healthy participants.

The process extracts information from microscopic sensory inputs and incorporates it into the mesoscopic memory store for retrieval in recognition. The process requires creation of spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. The construction is done through phase transitions in cortical populations that condense the background activity through spontaneous symmetry breaking. Large-scale interactions create fields of synaptically driven activity that is observed by measuring brain waves (electrocorticogram, ECoG) and evaluated by constructing a mesoscopic vectorial order parameter as follows. The negative feedback among excitatory and inhibitory neurons creates spatially and spectrally distributed gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) in the background activity. Band pass filtering reveals beats in ECoG log analytic power. In some beats that recur at theta rates (3-7 Hz), the order parameter transiently approaches zero, giving a null spike in which the microscopic activity is uniformly disordered (symmetric). A phase transition that is manifested in an analytic phase discontinuity breaks the symmetry. As the null spike terminates, the resurgent order parameter imposes mesoscopic order seen in spatial patterns of ECoG amplitude modulation (AM) that actualize and update the memory of a stimulus. Read-out is through a divergent/convergent projection that pet-forms on cortical output an irreversible spatiotemporal integral transformation. The ECoG reveals a conic phase gradient that accompanies an AM pattern. The phase cone manifests a vortex, which is initiated by the null spike, and which is inferred to help stabilize and prolong its accompanying AM pattern that might otherwise be rapidly degraded by the turbulent neural noise from which it emerges.

Induced Alpha-band Oscillations Reflect Ratio-dependent Number Discrimination in the Infant Brain	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; THETA-RHYTHM; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION; FACE; RESPONSES; STIMULI; INDEXES	Behavioral studies show that infants are capable of discriminating the number of objects or events in their environment, while also suggesting that number discrimination in infancy may be ratio-dependent. However, due to limitations of the dependent measures used with infant behavioral studies, the evidence for ratio dependence falls short of the vast psychophysical datasets that have established ratio dependence, and thus, adherence to Weber's Law in adults and non-human animals. We addressed this issue in two experiments that presented 7-month-old infants with familiar and novel numerosities while electroencephalogram measures of their brain activity were recorded. These data provide convergent evidence that the brains of 7-month-old infants detected numerical novelty. Alpha-band and theta-band oscillations both differed for novel and familiar numerical values. Most importantly, spectral power in the alpha band over midline and right posterior scalp sites was modulated by the ratio between the familiar and novel numerosities. Our findings provide neural evidence that numerical discrimination in infancy is ratio dependent and follows Weber's Law, thus indicating continuity of these cognitive processes over development. Results are also consistent with the idea that networks in the frontal and parietal cortices support ratio-dependent number discrimination in the first year of human life, consistent with what has been reported in neuroimaging studies in adults and older children.

Methods: Five letters appearing sequentially on a screen had to be memorized. The letters constituted a word in one condition and a pronounceable non-word in the other. Power changes of 248 channel MEG data were extracted in frequency sub-bands and a two-step filter and Search algorithm was used to select informative features that discriminated patients and controls. Results: The discrimination between patients and controls was greater in the word condition than in the non-word condition. Furthermore, in the word condition, the most discriminant patterns were extracted in delta (1-4 Hz), alpha (12-16 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) frequency bands. These features were located in the left dorso-frontal, occipital and left fronto-temporal, respectively. Conclusion: The analysis of the oscillatory patterns of MEG recordings in the working memory task provided a high level of correct classification of patients and controls. Significance: We show, using a newly developed algorithm, that the temporo-spatial patterns of brain oscillations can be used as biometric marker that discriminate schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

Universality indirectly implies a long-range correlation between constituent subsystems. As the distributed correlated processing is a hallmark of higher complex cognition, I investigated a measure of universality in human brain during perception and mental imagery of complex real-life visual object like visual art. Methodology/Principal Findings: A new method was presented to estimate the strength of hidden universal structure in a multivariate data set. In this study, I investigated this method in the electrical activities (electroencephalogram signals) of human brain during complex cognition. Two broad groups - artists and non-artists - were studied during the encoding (perception) and retrieval (mental imagery) phases of actual paintings. Universal structure was found to be stronger in visual imagery than in visual perception, and this difference was stronger in artists than in non-artists. Further, this effect was found to be largest in the theta band oscillations and over the prefrontal regions bilaterally. Conclusions/Significance: Phase transition like dynamics was observed in the electrical activities of human brain during complex cognitive processing, and closeness to phase transition was higher in mental imagery than in real perception. Further, the effect of long-term training on the universal scaling was also demonstrated.

J	Sheth, BR; Sandkuhler, S; Bhattacharya, J				Sheth, Bhavin R.; Sandkuehler, Simone; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Posterior Beta and Anterior Gamma Oscillations Predict Cognitive Insight	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MEMORY-SEARCH TASK; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; RESPONSES; CREATIVITY; HUMANS; CORTEX; TIME; AHA	Pioneering neuroimaging studies on insight have revealed neural correlates of the emotional "Aha!'' component of the insight process, but neural substrates of the cognitive component, such as problem restructuring (a key to transformative reasoning), remain a mystery. Here, multivariate electroencephalogram signals were recorded from human participants while they solved verbal puzzles that could create a small-scale experience of cognitive insight. Individuals responded as soon as they reached a solution and provided a rating of subjective insight. For unsolved puzzles, hints were provided after 60 to 90 sec. Spatio-temporal signatures of brain oscillations were analyzed using Morlet wavelet transform followed by exploratory parallel-factor analysis. A consistent reduction in beta power (15-25 Hz) was found over the parieto-occipital and centro-temporal electrode regions on all four conditions-(a) correct (vs. incorrect) solutions, (b) solutions without (vs. with) external hint, (c) successful (vs. unsuccessful) utilization of the external hint, and d) self-reported high (vs. low) insight. Gamma band (30-70 Hz) power was increased in right fronto-central and frontal electrode regions for conditions (a) and (c). The effects occurred several (up to 8) seconds before the behavioral response. Our findings indicate that insight is represented by distinct spectral, spatial, and temporal patterns of neural activity related to presolution cognitive processes that are intrinsic to the problem itself but not exclusively to one's subjective assessment of insight.

The ANAPP method models the EEG signals as a combination of five a priori "spontaneous cortical oscillations" whose amplitudes and phases are established using an adaptive algorithm. While in a series of previous researches [1], [2] the amplitude features of the model were extensively used, in this research the opportunity of using supplementary the phase information within the BCI system is analyzed. In addition, in this paper, the number and the type of the input features that feed the classification system are optimized using a GA algorithm. The final goals are to obtain both a faster BCI system and better classification results.

Previously, the responses of single units from mechanoreceptive afferents and cortical neurons have been studied. There is a thorough psychophysical literature on judgements of the presence, magnitude, and frequency of vibrotactile stimuli [1-3]. However, non-invasive recording of evoked responses on the scalp have solely been determined for electrical stimuli. In this study, psychophysical detection thresholds of adult subjects were measured at various mechanical frequencies. These values were found to be consistent with the literature. To measure the frequency following brain responses, stimulus intensities were determined based on psychophysical sensation levels. Data recorded from the somatosensory cortex area via electrodes placed on scalp, were analysed with wavelet transform. The results show that, as the mechanical stimulus intensity was increased the background activity was suppressed and the frequency-following activity during stimulus period increased.

What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells, and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly, we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here, we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness, periods of population activity (ON) are short, frequent, and associated with synchronous firing, while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep, firing rates and synchrony decrease, while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus, the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep.

Early electrophysiological manifestations of psycholinguistic processes revealed by event-related regression analysis of the EEG	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Written word recognition; Multiple linear regression; ERRC; Neighbourhood size; Word length; Orthographic typicality	ORTHOGRAPHIC NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE; LINEAR INVERSE PROBLEMS; READ-OUT MODEL; LEXICAL ACCESS; SEMANTIC CATEGORIZATION; DISCRETE-DATA; HUMAN BRAIN; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY; LENGTH	We applied multiple linear regression analysis to event-related electrophysiological responses to words and pseudowords in a visual lexical decision task, yielding event-related regression coefficients (ERRCs) instead of the traditional event-related potential (ERP) measure. Our main goal was to disentangle the earliest ERP effects of the length of letter strings ("word length") and orthographic neighbourhood size (Coltheart's "N"). With respect to N, existing evidence is still ambiguous with respect to whether effects of N reflect early access to lexico-semantic information, or whether they occur at later decision or verification stages. In the present study, we found distinct neurophysiological manifestations of both N and word length around 100 ms after word onset. Importantly, the effect of N distinguished between words and pseudowords, while the effect of word length did not. Minimum norm source estimation revealed the most dominant sources for word length in bilateral posterior brain areas for both words and pseudowords. For N, these sources were more left-lateralised and consistent with perisylvian brain areas, with activation peaks in temporal areas being more anterior for words compared to pseudowords. Our results support evidence for an effect of N at early and elementary stages of word recognition. We discuss the implications of these results for the time line of word recognition processes, and emphasise the value of ERRCs in combination with source analysis in psycholinguistic and cognitive brain research.

Nuclei Accumbens Phase Synchrony Predicts Decision-Making Reversals Following Negative Feedback	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; RAT STRIATUM; HIPPOCAMPAL; REWARD; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; FREQUENCY; AMYGDALA; NEURONS	The nucleus accumbens plays a key role in reinforcement-guided behaviors. Here, we report that electrophysiological oscillatory phase synchrony between the two nuclei accumbens may play a crucial role in using negative feedback to guide decision making. We recorded local field potentials from the human nucleus accumbens and the medial frontal cortex (via surface EEG) from patients who had deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted. Patients performed a reversal learning task in which they decided whether to alter their decision strategy following monetary losses. Strategy switches following losses were preceded by enhanced theta (4-8 Hz) phase synchrony between the nuclei accumbens, and a break-down of gamma (20-80 Hz)-alpha (8-12 Hz) coupling. Furthermore, the strength of the intersite phase synchrony predicted response time adjustments in the subsequent trial. These findings suggest that a neural network including the nucleus accumbens bilaterally becomes functionally connected via theta phase synchrony to signal the need to adjust behavior.

A nursing challenge in the epilepsy monitoring unit	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Seizures; Epilepsy; Cigarette; Smoking; Monitoring	CESSATION	Cigarette smoking is common in patients with intractable epilepsy. As a preliminary assessment of epilepsy and smoking, we evaluated the impact of breaks for smoking on the investigation of epilepsy patients admitted to our epilepsy monitoring unit. Absences from the epilepsy unit at the London Health Sciences Center were monitored for 6 months by nursing personnel. During these absences, events that Occurred were registered as well. This is possible using portable EEG recorders (XLTEK) that patients carry with them all the time. A disadvantage is that video recording is not available if the patient has a seizure outside the unit. Information was entered consecutively in a datasheet. Diagnosis, duration of hospital stay, frequency of breaks, and time outside the unit were recorded. Descriptive and statistical analysis was performed. Two thousand two hundred and ninety trips were recorded. Mean duration of stay was 10 days for smokers and 8.5 for non-smokers. Non-smokers had a total of 439 seizures of which 6 (1.4%) were not recorded, while the smokers had 213, of which 11 (5.2%) were not recorded. Five events did not have electroencephalographic correlation, raising a suspicion of non-epileptic events (pseudoseizures). Despite the low number of events missed, precious information may be lost during smoking trips by patients admitted to the epilepsy unit. Ways to avoid such trips should be implemented in epilepsy monitoring units allowing smoking breaks for patients. (C) 2008 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether sleep functional brain networks are abnormally organized during a major depressive episode (MDE). We characterized spatial patterns of functional connectivity by computing the "synchronization likelihood" (SL) of 1.9 sleep EEG channels in 11 acutely depressed patients [42 (20-51.) years] and 14 healthy controls [32.9 (27-42) years]. To test whether disrupting an optimal pattern ["small-world network" (SWN)] of functional brain connectivity underlies MDE, graph theoretical measures were then applied to the resulting synchronization matrices, and a clustering coefficient (C, measure of local connectedness) and a shortest path length (L, measure of overall network integration) were determined. In the depressed group, the mean SL was lower in the delta, theta and sigma frequency bands. Acutely depressed patients showed a significantly lower path length in the theta and delta frequency bands, whereas the cluster coefficient showed no significant changes. The present study provides further support that sleep functional brain networks exhibit "small-world" properties. Sleep neuronal functional networks in depressed patients are characterized by a functional reorganization with a lower mean level of global synchronization and loss of SWN characteristics. These results argue for considering an MDE as a problem of neuronal network organization and a problem of information processing. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2207-2219, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Rosales-Lagarde, A; del Rio-Portilla, IY; Guevara, MA; Corsi-Cabrera, M				Rosales-Lagarde, Alejandra; del Rio-Portilla, Irma Yolanda; Angel Guevara, Miguel; Corsi-Cabrera, Maria			Sudden drop of muscle tone at the onset of REM sleep in humans	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						REM sleep onset; atonia; EMG spectral power; NREM-REM sleep transition	QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; EMG ACTIVITY; EEG	Relatively low tonic electromyogrophic activity of the mental is or sub-mentalis muscles constitutes one of the three electrophysiological signs for identifying rapid eye movement sleep (REM), described in the standardized manual for scoring sleep stages in human subjects. The other two signs, low voltage mixed frequency EEG activity and episodic rapid eye movements are inadequate for delimiting the start of REM sleep, because EEG activity resembles that of stage I and rapid eye movements are not constantly present. The term,relatively low-tonic EMG and not "low tonic EMG" is used according to the standardized manual because tonic EMG shows considerable variation from subject to subject and from session to session, and more important because low EMG values may be reached during other sleep stages. Therefore, REM sleep scoring is based on "relatively low" tonic EMG. Despite the relevance of the loss of muscular tone for scoring the start of REM sleep and for sleep disorders-such as narcolepsy and REM sleep behavioral disorder, where loss of muscle tone or the lack of it is implicated-, very few quantitative studies of EMG activity during REM sleep in humans have been performed. Amplitude analysis of mentalis and orbicularis oris muscles and spectral power analysis of suprahyoid, masseter and temporalis muscles have demonstrated that EMG activity is lower during REM than during NREM sleep. The mentalis muscle maintains tonically the lowest values during REM sleep with very low variability during the some REM sleep episode and across REM episodes, except for very brief phasic activations, whereas during NREM sleep muscle tone shows large variations within the same sleep stage and along the night.x Only one study exists which analyzes the time course of the loss of tone during the transition from NREM to REM sleep integrating the EMG amplitude. However, it was done for long time windows of 20 seconds that does not allow identifying the precise moment of EMG activity drop. Given that the fall in EMG activity is one of the main keys for REM sleep scoring, the objective of the present investigation is to describe the EMG activity of the mentalis muscle during the NREm-REM sleep transition by analyzing short time windows of two seconds. Ten healthy, young adult, right-handed subjects (5 men and 5 women) participated in the study after giving informed consent. All had regular sleeping habits, were in good health and were free of drugs, medication or caffeine intake as assessed by interviews and questionnaires on sleeping habits and health. Polysomnography (PSG) was recorded using a Gross model 8-20E polygraph with filters set at .03 and 70 Hz. Additionally to EEG (C3-A2 and C4-A1), electroculogrom (EOG) and EMG of the mentalis muscle, nasal-oral air flow and EMG of anterior tibialis muscles were recorded to remove those subjects showing signs of sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder. EEG, EMG and EOG were digitized at 1024 Hz through an analog-to-digital converter of 12 bits resolution using the acquisition program Gamma (version 4.4). The initiation of the first three REM sleep episodes of one night for each subject was indicated in the PSG recordings, following the standardized rules of the manual for scoring sleep stages of human subjects. The fourth REM sleep episode was not considered for analysis because not all subjects had a fourth REM episode. EMG activity of the mentalis muscle of three 30-second epochs around the start of REM sleep (the previous one, the REM entrance and the posterior one) was analyzed. EMG activity was submitted to Fast Fourier Transform and absolute power for every 250 msec (256 points) was obtained for two broad bonds: one from 24 to 28 Hz and the other from 28 to 32 Hz, as these have demonstrated significant differences between REM and NREM sleep, in previous studies. Absolute power values were log-transformed previous to statistical analysis to approximate them toward normal distribution. The time course of the drop in muscle tone was established in the case of each individual NREM-REM sleep transition for two second time windows, both visually on the EMG signal and also by statistically comparing consecutive 2-second averages of EMG absolute power (8 means of 250 msec). When there was no clear visual or statistical evidence of decreased EMG activity, the 30-second epoch was divided in half. Additionally, the first rapid eye movement was visually identified. EMG signals were visually inspected and absolute power values of two-second epochs containing eye movement or phasic EMG artifacts were substituted by the average of the preceding and following two-second means. This procedure was chosen instead of rejection in order to maintain the time sequence. The average of substituted epochs was lower than 1 for the NREM-REM sleep transitions. Once the significant differences were established for the individual NREM-REM sleep transitions, the absolute power for the 20 seconds prior and the 20 seconds after the turning point was averaged for the group and compared using the Student I test. A level of p <0.05 was required for significance for both individual and group analyses. EMG drop was statistically identified in 15 out of the 30 NREM-REM sleep transitions (p < 0.05). In 14 cases more than one significant difference was found due to phasic increases shorter than two seconds. Thus, EMG drop was established where both visual inspection of EMG signal and statistical differences were matched. It was necessary to divide the 30-second epoch in half just in one individual case. The comparison of EMG power after averaging for the group the 20 seconds before and the twenty seconds after the individual turning point showed that EMG absolute power was significantly different for the two bands (p < 0.0001 for both bands). The first eye movement occurred after the EMG drop in 28 out of the 30 NREM-REM sleep transitions within a range of 2 and 52 seconds. EMG fall was simultaneous to the first eye movement in one case and eye movement preceded EMG drop in just one NREM-REM sleep transition. Present results indicate that the loss of muscle tone of the mentalis muscle during the transition from NREM to REM sleep occurs suddenly rather than gradually, within a time window lasting no longer than 2 sec. This could be appreciated in individual as well as in group analysis. It still remains a matter of debate if REM sleep is under the control of a single generator that simultaneously commands the start of all of its physiological changes, or if each of the physiological systems involved in REM sleep is under its own command starting at its own time and are only orchestrated by a common mechanism. The loss of muscle tone occurred before the first rapid eye movement in 29 out of 30 of the REM sleep onset episodes analyzed, upholding the proposition that physiological systems involved in REM sleep follow different time courses in agreement with non-simultaneous onset of the different physiological mechanisms as it happens with ponto-geniculate-occipital waves in cats that begin long before EEG desynchronization and EMG fall and with results observed in two studies in man which report that EMG amplitude decreases before eye movements. The sudden drop in muscle tone during NREM-REM sleep transition may help to understand the physiological mechanisms involved in sleep disorders where loss of muscle tone or the lack of it is implicated, such as narcolepsy and REM sleep behavioral disorder. It can also be used as an objective sign to establish the onset of REM sleep in research where the precise moment of REM sleep onset is needed. The time relationship among muscle tone fall and other physiological signs of REM sleep remains to be investigated.

Recent work has demonstrated that human brain networks constructed from neuroimaging data have economical small-world properties that confer high efficiency of information processing at relatively low connection cost. However, it has been unclear how the architecture of complex brain networks functioning at different frequencies can be related to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks. Here, we show that impaired accuracy of working memory could be related to suboptimal cost efficiency of brain functional networks operating in the classical beta frequency band, 15-30 Hz. We analyzed brain functional networks derived from magnetoencephalography data recorded during working-memory task performance in 29 healthy volunteers and 28 people with schizophrenia. Networks functioning at higher frequencies had greater global cost efficiency than low-frequency networks in both groups. Superior task performance was positively correlated with global cost efficiency of the beta-band network and specifically with cost efficiency of nodes in left lateral parietal and frontal areas. These results are consistent with biophysical models highlighting the importance of beta-band oscillations for long-distance functional connections in brain networks and with pathophysiological models of schizophrenia as a dysconnection syndrome. More generally, they echo the saying that "less is more'': The information processing performance of a network can be enhanced by a sparse or low-cost configuration with disproportionately high efficiency.

Theta Phase Synchrony and Conscious Target Perception: Impact of Intensive Mental Training	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; MEDITATION; TASK; CORTEX; EEG; SUPPRESSION; PERFORMANCE	The information processing capacity of the human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the attentional blink-a deficit in identifying the second of two targets (T1 and T2) presented in close succession. This deficit is thought to result from an overinvestment of limited resources in T1 processing. We previously reported that intensive mental training in a style of meditation aimed at reducing elaborate object processing, reduced brain resource allocation to T1, and improved T2 accuracy [Slagter, H. A., Lutz, A., Greischar, L. L., Francis, A. D., Nieuwenhuis, S., Davis, J., et al. Mental training affects distribution of limited brain resources. PloS Biology, 5, e138, 2007]. Here we report EEG spectral analyses to examine the possibility that this reduction in elaborate T1 processing rendered the system more available to process new target information, as indexed by T2-locked phase variability. Intensive mental training was associated with decreased cross-trial variability in the phase of oscillatory theta activity after successfully detected T2s, in particular, for those individuals who showed the greatest reduction in brain resource allocation to T1. These data implicate theta phase locking in conscious target perception, and suggest that after mental training the cognitive system is more rapidly available to process new target information. Mental training was not associated with changes in the amplitude of T2-induced responses or oscillatory activity before task onset. In combination, these findings illustrate the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind by revealing the neural mechanisms that enable the brain to successfully represent target information.

Thirty male and 30 female respondents solved simple auditory and visual tasks while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Also recorded was the percentage of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (%StO(2)) in the respondents' frontal brain areas with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The attended task condition was based on the oddball paradigm. Respondents had to mentally count infrequent target stimuli-tones or shapes. In the unattended condition they just listened to tones or viewed different shapes. Gender related differences in EEG activity were only observed in the amplitudes of the early evoked gamma response and the P3 component. Women displayed higher amplitudes than men. A second finding was that these differences were more pronounced for the visual than for the auditory stimuli. No gender related differences were observed in the ERP latencies, as well as in the amplitudes of the P1-N1 complex, and the induced gamma response. The NIRS data showed that males in their frontal brain areas displayed a higher percentage of StO(2) than did females; and males also showed a higher increase in % StO(2) during task performance as compared with the resting condition. Taken all together the results suggest that the females' visual event-categorization process is more efficient than in males. The data are discussed in the theoretical framework of the evolutionary theory of human spatial sex differences. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Because the developmental profile of HCN channels in the thalamus is not well understood, we combined electrophysiological, molecular, immunohistochemical, EEG recordings in vivo, and computer modeling techniques to examine HCN gene expression and I-h properties in rat thalamocortical relay (TC) neurons in the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus and the functional consequence of this maturation. Recordings of TC neurons revealed an approximate sixfold increase in I-h density between postnatal day 3 (P3) and P106, which was accompanied by significantly altered current kinetics, cAMP sensitivity, and steady-state activation properties. Quantification on tissue levels revealed a significant developmental decrease in cAMP. Consequently the block of basal adenylyl cyclase activity was accompanied by a hyperpolarizing shift of the I-h activation curve in young but not adult rats. Quantitative analyses of HCN channel isoforms revealed a steady increase of mRNA and protein expression levels of HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 with reduced relative abundance of HCN4. Computer modeling in a simplified thalamic network indicated that the occurrence of rhythmic delta activity, which was present in the EEG at P12, differentially depended on I-h conductance and modulation by cAMP at different developmental states. These data indicate that the developmental increase in I-h density results from increased expression of three HCN channel isoforms and that isoform composition and intracellular cAMP levels interact in determining I-h properties to enable progressive maturation of rhythmic slow-wave sleep activity patterns.

Heart rate variability in novice pilots during and after a multi-leg cross-country flight. Aviat Space Environ Med 2009; 80:862-9. Background: A pilot's workload induces autonomic nervous system modulations which could be related to a decrease of vigilance that could impair safety. Kinetics during flight and recovery are not well known. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess linear and non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) modulations and vigilance during a high mental workload induced by a complex flight and subsequent recovery. Methods: There were 10 novice pilots (37.8 +/- 4.4 yr, 115.8 +/- 15.7 h flight experience) who performed a 3 h 30 min (09:30-13:00) multi-leg cross-country flight (Piper Pa28 airplane: 160 hp). We recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) during the flight and performed tests during the 24 h before and after the flight (13:30, 16:00, 18:30, 21:00, and 06:45). Tests included a stand test (10 min supine, 10 min standing), a Mackworth 'clock' vigilance test, and a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. We assessed HRV components by time and frequency domains in parallel with the Poincare plot analysis. Results: The flight induced a progressive decrease of RR intervals, standard deviation between normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), Poincare SDI and SD2 indices, and an increase of the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF). During recovery, vigilance remained depressed for 2 h 30 min after the flight. The decreased RR intervals and SDI persisted for 5 h postflight both in supine and standing positions. LF/HF stayed elevated for 2 h 30 min after the flight. Conclusion: A multi-leg cross-country flight involves a vagal withdrawal and an increase of sympathetic activity lasting 5 h after landing. This delay could be recommended as a safety period.

Long-Term Effects of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy on Local Neural Networks: A Graph Theoretical Analysis of Corticography Recordings	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DISTURBED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; BRAIN NETWORKS; TOPOLOGY; EEG; EPILEPTOGENESIS; PROGRESSION; TRANSITION; CLUSTERS; SURGERY	Purpose: Pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is often treated with surgical intervention at some point. As epilepsy surgery is considered a last resort by most physicians, a long history of epileptic seizures prior to surgery is not uncommon. Little is known about the effects of ongoing TLE on neural functioning. A better understanding of these effects might influence the moment of surgical intervention. Functional connectivity (interaction between spatially distributed brain areas) and network structure (integration and segregation of information processing) are thought to be essential for optimal brain functioning. We report on the impact of TLE duration on temporal lobe functional connectivity and network characteristics. Methods: Functional connectivity of the temporal lobe at the time of surgery was assessed by means of interictal electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings of 27 TLE patients by using the phase lag index (PLI). Graphs (abstract network representations) were reconstructed from the PLI matrix and characterized by the clustering coefficient C (local clustering), the path length L (overall network interconnectedness), and the "small world index'' S (network configuration). Results: Functional connectivity (average PLI), clustering coefficients, and the small world index were negatively correlated with TLE duration in the broad frequency band (0.5-48 Hz). Discussion: Temporal lobe functional connectivity is lower in patients with longer TLE history, and longer TLE duration is correlated with more random network configuration. Our findings suggest that the neural networks of TLE patients become more pathological over time, possibly due to temporal lobe changes associated with long-standing lesional epilepsy.

Development and characterization of in vivo flexible electrodes compatible with large tissue displacements	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; IMPLANT; EEG	Electrical activity is the ultimate functional measure of neuronal tissue and recording that activity remains a key technical challenge in neuroscience. The mechanical mismatch between rigid electrodes and compliant brain tissue is a critical limitation in applications where movement is an inherent component. An electrode that permits recording of neural activity, while minimizing tissue disruption, is beneficial for applications that encompass both normal physiological movements and those which require consistent recording during large tissue displacements. In order to test the extreme of this range of movement, flexible electrodes were developed to record activity during and immediately following cortical impact in the rat. Photolithography techniques were used to fabricate flexible electrodes that were readily insertable into the brain Using a parylene C base and gold conduction lines and contact pads, permitting custom geometry. We found that this electrode configuration retained mechanical and electrical integrity following both durability Studies and large movements within the cortex. This novel flexible electrode configuration provides a novel platform for experimentally examining neuronal activity during a range of brain movements.	[Wester, B. A.; Lee, R. H.; LaPlaca, M.

It proposes to view this distinction in the framework of the branch of Statistical Physics currently referred to as Modern Critical Theory (Stanley, Introduction to phase transitions and critical phenomena, 1987; Marro and Dickman, Nonequilibrium phase transitions in lattice, 1999). Based on established landmarks of brain dynamics, network configurations and their role for conveying oscillatory activity of certain frequencies bands, the question is examined: what kind of state space transitions can systems with these properties undergo, and could the relation between neural processes of sensory-motor cognition and those of events in consciousness be of the same category as is characterized by state transitions in non-equilibrium physical systems? Approaches for empirical validation of this view by suitably designed brain imaging studies, and for computational simulations of the proposed principle are discussed.

[Smith, K., Valentino, D., & Arrucla, J. (2003). Rhythmic oscillations in the performance of a sustained attention task. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 25, 561-570] suggested that sustained human performance may systematically fluctuate in a cyclic manner with periods of 1.5 min and 5.2 min. The current series of investigations sought to manipulate those periodicities by altering task difficulty, administering caffeine, and testing on a more ecologically valid task. Strong evidence of a 1.5 min periodicity was found across studies. Most participants did not demonstrate the 5.2 min periodicity. Moreover, the 1.5 min periodicity was resistant to task manipulations and appeared in similar levels across conditions in all three experiments. These rhythms may be indicative of an endogenous system that modulates sustained attention in humans. Evidence supporting this idea and implications of the research are discussed.

J	Gruzelier, J				Gruzelier, John			A theory of alpha/theta neurofeedback, creative performance enhancement, long distance functional connectivity and psychological integration	COGNITIVE PROCESSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Neuroscience Today - Neuronal Functional Diversity and Collective Behaviors	MAR 26-28, 2007	Firenze, ITALY	COST Act B27, European Comm		Theta waves; Neurofeedback; Performance enhancement; Cognition; Mood; Connectivity	FRONTAL MIDLINE-THETA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-FEEDBACK; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; BIOFEEDBACK; ATTENTION; RHYTHM; RANGE; HIPPOCAMPUS	Professionally significant enhancement of music and dance performance and mood has followed training with an EEG-neurofeedback protocol which increases the ratio of theta to alpha waves using auditory feedback with eyes closed. While originally the protocol was designed to induce hypnogogia, a state historically associated with creativity, the outcome was psychological integration, while subsequent applications focusing on raising the theta-alpha ratio, reduced depression and anxiety in alcoholism and resolved post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). In optimal performance studies we confirmed associations with creativity in musical performance, but effects also included technique and communication. We extended efficacy to dance and social anxiety. Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation. Neuroanatomical circuitry involves the ascending mescencephalic-cortical arousal system, and limbic circuits subserving cognitive as well as affective/motivational functions. Working memory and meditative respectively, involve coupling between frontal and posterior cortices, exemplify a role for theta and alpha waves in mediating the interaction between distal and widely distributed connections. It is posited that this mediation in part underpins the integrational attributes of alpha-theta training in optimal performance and psychotherapy, creative associations in hypnogogia, and enhancement of technical, communication and artistic domains of performance in the arts.

Accordingly, considerable insight has been gained in recent years into a common psychiatric condition, i.e., chronic alcoholism. Material and methods. - We reviewed various physiological. parameters that are altered in chronic alcoholic patients compared to healthy individuals - continuous electroencephalogram, oculomotor measures, cognitive event-related potentials and event-related oscillations - to identify links between these physiological parameters, altered cognitive processes and specific clinical symptoms. Results. - Alcoholic patients display: (1) high beta and theta power in the resting electroencephalogram, suggesting hyperarousal of their central nervous system; (2) abnormalities in smooth pursuit eye movements, in saccadic inhibition during antisaccade tasks, and in prepulse inhibition, suggesting disturbed attention modulation and abnormal patterns of prefrontal activation that may stem from the same prefrontal "inhibitory" cortical. dysfunction; (3) decreased amplitude for cognitive event-related potentials situated along the continuum of information-processing, suggesting that alcoholism is associated with neurophysiological deficits at the level of the sensory cortex and not only disturbances involving associative cortices and limbic structures; and (4) decreased theta, gamma and delta oscillations, suggesting cognitive disinhibition at a functional level. Discussion. - The heterogeneity of alcoholic disorders in terms of symptomatology, course and outcome is the result of various pathophysiological processes that physiological parameters may help to define. These alterations may be related to precise cognitive processes that could be easily monitored neurophysiologically in order to create more homogeneous subgroups of alcoholic individuals.

Neurophysiological models suggest that deficits during WM maintenance in schizophrenia may be explained by abnormalities in the GABAergic system, which will lead to deficits in high-frequency oscillations. However, it is not yet clear which of the three WM phases (encoding, maintenance, retrieval) are affected by dysfunctional oscillatory activity. We investigated the relationship between impairments in oscillatory activity in a broad frequency range (3-100 Hz) and WM load in the different phases of WM in 14 patients with early-onset schizophrenia and 14 matched control participants using a delayed matching to sample paradigm. During encoding, successful memorization was predicted by evoked theta, alpha, and beta oscillatory activity in controls. Patients showed severe reductions in the evoked activity in these frequency bands. During early WM maintenance, patients showed a comparable WM load-dependent increase in induced alpha and gamma activity to controls. In contrast, during the later maintenance phase, patients showed a shift in the peak of induced gamma activity to the lower WM load conditions. Finally, induced theta and gamma activity were reduced in patients during retrieval. Our findings suggest that the WM deficit in schizophrenia is associated with impaired oscillatory activity during all phases of the task and that the cortical storage system reaches its capacity limit at lower loads. Inability to maintain oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands could thus result in the information overload that may underlie both cognitive deficits and psychopathological symptoms of schizophrenia.

Three-Dimensional Surface Maps Link Local Atrophy and Fast Ripples in Human Epileptic Hippocampus	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; NEURON LOSS; 80-500 HZ; RAT; SEIZURES; EEG	Objectives: There is compelling evidence that pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), called fast ripples (FR, 150-500Hz), reflect abnormal synchronous neuronal discharges in areas responsible for seizure genesis in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). It is hypothesized that morphological changes associated with hippocampal atrophy (HA) contribute to the generation of FR, yet there is limited evidence that hippocampal FR-generating sites correspond with local areas of atrophy. Methods: Interictal HFOs were recorded from hippocampal microelectrodes in 10 patients with MTLF. Rates of FR and ripple discharge from each microelectrode were evaluated in relation to local measures of HA obtained using 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal modeling. Results: Rates of FR discharge were 3 times higher in areas of significant local HA compared with rates in nonatrophic areas. Furthermore, FR occurrence correlated directly with the severity of damage in these local atrophic regions. In contrast, we found no difference in rates of ripple discharge between local atrophic and nonatrophic areas. Interpretation: The proximity between local HA and microelectrode-recorded FR suggests that morphological changes such as neuron loss and synaptic reorganization may contribute to the generation of FR. Pathological HFOs, such as FR, may provide a reliable Surrogate marker of abnormal neuronal excitability in hippocampal areas responsible for the generation of spontaneous seizures in patients with MTLE. Based on these data, it is possible that MRI-based measures of local HA could identify FR-generating regions, and thus provide a noninvasive means to localize epileptogenic regions in hippocampus.

The electrobiochemical changes and modifications in EEG rhythms event-related synchronization or event-related desynchronization, ERD or ERS) propagated in the specific and unspecific cortex are added to the changes elicited by the responses and to the new signals originated by those same responses, bringing about perception Diverse factors can alter these glialneuronal circuits, producing alterations in attention processes (ADD) and in the integration with their meaning. The inability to identify signals and integrate correct coordinated responses leads to deficiencies in responding to the environment and to associated morbidities that are added to ADD. ADD and its associated morbidities cause high social and economic impacts and, even more so, because of their persistence into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, highly accurate diagnostic procedures ore needed for these diseases. According to the CIE-10, in the clinical selling symptoms are analyzed without studying the neuro-developmental and neurodegenerative signs that identify alterations in neuronal circuits. As is known, behavior (including motivation, memory, thoughts) results from the Central Nervous System (CNS) activity, and the EEG records the electrical activity of neurons and synapses of the cerebral cortex, where cognitive processes are most likely to take place. To establish more accurate diagnostic procedures for ADD, we are integrating an electronic database, considering the intensity and cerebral distribution of theta (theta), alpha (alpha), and beta (beta) rhythms We propose that the ERD of alpha and beta reflects a cortical activation that gives rise to sensory-motor coordination processes The first stimulations induce ERD, and their repetitions produce its decrement (ERS). ERD habituation In addition, this ERD to ERS change might be reversed when giving meaning to the stimulation We present herein the changes in theta, alpha, and beta rhythms induced by repealed photostimulation (RPS), with the some characteristics, that, when presented, requires the subject to press a knob. Hundred-twenty-four children were studied of the Instituto Nocional de Rehabililacion (INR, for its initials in Spanish) in Mexico City Children were of either gender and aged from 3 to 15 years, separated in four groups of 3-year intervals. During clinical exploration, we searched for possible delays in physical-emotional intellectual development, epilepsy, and medical at psychological treatments during the last six months, which were considered exclusion factors Parents were briefed on the study, explaining them that the procedure hod a low-risk nature and allowed for the analyzis of the electrical activity of the brain Once having understood and accepted the procedure, they signed the informed consent form prepared by the institution. Children were explained "how the batteries of the b 'ain" work and that the procedure caused no pain of all They were asked to close their eyelids during the recordings, and to remain as motionless as possible The exclusion factors left a sample cf 94 children for the habituation analysis and of 47 for the simple conditioning procedures The EEG was recorded in dorsal decuaitus position, with a digital 24-channel electroencephalograph, according to the 10/20 international system In addition, we recorded eye movements and the EKG After 5.min recordings with closed eyelids, photo-stimulation was started of 5 flashes per second during 2s, repealed 20 times (RPS), at 21 to 25 sec. intervals. After finishing the series, 5 min rest were provided, and then a round device with a knob was placed in the children's hands, telling then) to press, the knob at the start of the RPS and to release it of the end Analyses were performed with 1.6 to 40 Hz bandwidth filters. From the bipolar leads, samples recorded 2 sec. before, during, and after the 1(st), 5(th), 10(th), 20(th) associations (PS-knob pressing) were manually chosen For conditioning analyses, we also measured the response latency. The Fourier's FT was applied to the samples and the absolute potency (AP) was calculated for theta (4.0 to 7.5 Hz), alpha (8.0 to 12.5 Hz), and beta (13 to 20 Hz) The average of these frequencies was obtained for each hemisphere (Right, RH, Left, LH) and for both (BH). Wilcoon's test for related samples was used with alpha > 0.05 as significant. Analyses of the AP of the three frequencies in all children revealed a background activity below 10 mu V-2. The first RPS produced a decrease in the AP of theta and alpha, with an increase in beta in BH. At the 5(th) RPS, 0 and a continued to decrease along with an increase in beta At the 10(th) RPS, theta and alpha decreased less but the increase in beta persisted At the 15(th) RPS, theta continued to decrease but alpha increased in the LH and decreased somewhat in the RH, whereas beta cortinued its increase in BH. At the 20(th) RPS, the AP of theta and alpha decreased in BH, but the difference was smaller than that recorded during the. previous RPS. The AP of P continued to increase in BH The most relevant aspects are: a) in G-1 (children aged 3 to 6 years), the AP of the three frequencies is higher, predominating theta, which is twice the magnitude of that of the whale group; b the 1(st) PS produced an increase in the AP of all three frequencies, which was not recorded in the other groups (children aged 6.5 to 15 years); c) in G-4 (children 12.5 to 15 years age), the 1(st) and 5(th) PS produced a clear diminution in the AP of theta and alpha (ERD), which was smaller at file 10(th) RPS and rover sed at the 15(th) and 20(th) RPS (ERS) After indicating to the children that with each RPS they would hove to p, ass a knob, the background activity increased to 12 mu V-2. During the 1(st) association (assoc), the AP of theta and alpha decreased with a slight decrease in beta, the response latency was 930 ms. At the 5(th) assoc, theta decreased together with a small increase in alpha and beta, and the response latency decreased to 750 ms. On the 10(th) and 15(th) assoc, the three frequencies increased and the latency decreased in 650 and 640 ms, respectively. On the 20(th) assoc, the AP increase of each rhythm was smaller, and the latency increased to 750 ms. The EEG analysis per group revealed a higher AP for theta in the smaller children that decreased along increasing age together with a relative increase in alpha, which reached its maximal value in G-4. in the four groups, the RPS induced an undulating tendency towards a decrease in the EEG desynchronization that represents habituation, being more noticeable in G-4. Although the reached synchronization did not reflect a better inhibition, as described in adults, it suggested that, in these children, the inhibitory activity sensory control has not yet developed completely Another important finding is that in G-1, the 1(st) RPS induced and increase in theta and alpha that was ; observed in the other groups This suggests that a facilitation of the circuits predominates in this age group Children of G-4 depict the best habituation curve; however, because of the reduced number of children in this group, some data did not reach statistical significance, their clinical relevance is a strong indicator of the need to enlarge the sample size or more in-depth analyses. The knob-pressing response Improved in correlation with the chronological age, coinciding with the decrease in theta and the increase of a Surprisingly, according to our hypothesis, conditioning at the cortical level would be reflected in or. increase of the beta rhythm (DRE), which we did not register. However, we did find on inverse correlation. between the decrease or increase in theta and alpha rhythms, as well as a better motor response with interhemispheric differences, manifested more intensely in the RH, which for most of the studied population represents the non-dominant, hemisphere. The modification of theta and alpha may be explained as resulting from the functional integration of the specific and unspecific central-encephalic-thalamic-cortical sensorial circuits that may be related, in turn, to alpha rhythm generation and the limbic circuits, related to the theta rhythm, which participate in the integration of memory.

Although collectively labelled 'the Basal Temporal Language Area' (BTLA), these territories are functionally heterogeneous and are involved in language perception (i.e. reading or semantic task) or language production (speech arrest after stimulation). The objective of this Study was to clarify the role of BTLA in the language network in air epileptic patient who displayed jargonaphasia. Methods: Intracerebral evoked related potentials to verbal and non-verbal stimuli in auditory and visual modalities were recorded from BTLA. Time-frequency analysis was perfomed during ictal events. Results: Evoked potentials and induced gamma-band activity provided direct evidence that BTLA is sensitive to language stimuli in both modalities, 350 ms after stimulation. In addition, spontaneous gammaband discharges were recorded from this region during which we observed phonological jargon. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the multimodal nature of this region in speech perception. In the context of transient dysfunction, the patient's lexical semantic processing network is disrupted, reducing spoken output to meaningless phoneme combinations. Significance: This rare opportunity to study the BTLA "in vivo" demonstrates its pivotal role in lexicosemantic processing for speech production and its multimodal nature in speech perception.

The cholinergic agonist carbachol and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine were injected in the NB and RT in the doses of 0.55 and 5.5 nmol while the EEG was recorded. Carbachol injected in the NB decreased the number and the mean duration of SWDs. Scopolamine alone had no influence on SWDs, but could antagonize the effects of carbachol if administered simultaneously in NB. Injections of carbachol in the RT inhibited the occurrence of SWDs, but did not affect the mean duration. Scopolamine administered in the RT had no influence on seizure activity. It is concluded that cholinergic stimulation of the NB or the RT inhibits the cortical synchronous activity characterizing SWDs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hippocampal Sharp Wave/Ripples during Sleep for Consolidation of Associative Memory	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The beneficial effect of sleep on memory has been well-established by extensive research on humans, but the neurophysiological mechanisms remain a matter of speculation. This study addresses the hypothesis that the fast oscillations known as ripples recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during slow wave sleep (SWS) may provide a physiological substrate for long term memory consolidation. We trained rats in a spatial discrimination task to retrieve palatable reward in three fixed locations. Hippocampal local field potentials and cortical EEG were recorded for 2 h after each daily training session. There was an increase in ripple density during SWS after early training sessions, in both trained rats and in rats randomly rewarded for exploring the maze. In rats learning the place -reward association, there was a striking further significant increase in ripple density correlated with subsequent improvements in behavioral performance as the rat learned the spatial discrimination aspect of the task. The results corroborate others showing an experience-dependent increase in ripple activity and associated ensemble replay after exploratory activity, but in addition, for the first time, reveal a clear further increase in ripple activity related to associative learning based on spatial discrimination.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional relationships between oscillatory electroencephalographic (EEG) dominant components with event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) method for idiopathic non-demented Parkinson's patients (PP) and control subjects (CS) during auditory discrimination tasks within two post-stimulus intervals of 0-250 and 250-600 ms. When comparing the CS and PP during the first post-stimulus period, we found delta- and theta-ERS significantly pronounced in CS for both tone types (low-800, high-1,000 Hz) with the following exceptions: at Fz, PP displayed higher delta-ERS, while at C3' theta-ERD in response to a high tone. Alpha-ERS was found in PP in response to either tone at all electrodes and mainly alpha-ERD in CS. In the second post-stimulus interval, the significant differences between the groups were: (i) delta-ERS in CS and delta-ERD in PP in response to the low tone and (ii) delta-ERS for both groups in answer to the high tone, more prominent in CS at Cz and Pz, except for delta-ERD in PP at C3'. For both groups, we detected predominantly theta-ERD and alpha-ERD following both tone types within this second interval. PP showed more expressed theta-ERD at Fz and parietal theta-ERS. Alpha-ERD was significantly higher in CS, while frontal alpha-ERD was more prominent in the PP in response to both tones. The data obtained showed specific functional differences of event-related oscillatory activity in cognitive and sensory-motor information processing between the PP and CS.

We quantified their behaviors during training with an ethogram and measured each individual animals' progress over the training period. Once calm under restraint, rats were conditioned to differentiate between a reward and control whisker twitch, then provide a lick response when presented with the correct stimulus, rewarded by a drop of water. Rats produced the correct licking response (after reward whisker twitch), and learned not to lick after a control whisker was twitched. By implementing a high-density 64-channel electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrode array, we mapped the barrel field of the somatosensory cortex with high spatial and temporal resolution during conditioned lick behaviors. In agreement with previous reports, we observe a larger evoked response after training, probably related to mechanisms of cortical plasticity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The subsequent subtraction of phase-sorted resting-state trials is Supposed to correct for phase-sorting effects otherwise maintained in the Post Stimulus time. Consequently, a true phase dependency of the ERP, considered to be indicative for a phase-reset (Risner, M.L., Aura, C.J., Black, J.E., Gawne, T.J., 2009. The visual evoked potential is independent Of surface alpha rhythm phase. Neurolmage), Would then become apparent. Here we disclose possible pitfalls of this approach causing invalid inferences. We also highlight that inferences based oil this approach first depend oil the assumed concept of a phase reset, and second can provide a hint at but are not Sufficient for disentangling different mechanisms of ERP generation. We will discuss other criteria necessary for further confirmation of the phase reset theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Spectral density and coherence analyses were performed in infants evaluated at 1.1 month (n = 4), 5.75 months (n = 4) or 30.33 months (n = 6) following a prolonged FS and compared to age-matched healthy controls. The impact of severity of seizures was assessed by comparing the children who had prolonged FSs to 4 infants that had experienced a simple FS. Cognitive tests (Bayley, Stanford-Binet) were administered at the time of testing in FS and control children. Behavioural measures (Achenbach Child Behavior Check List) were administered two years after the FS. pVEP responses and coherence measures failed to yield significant differences between the FS groups and healthy controls. However, spectral density measures showed a significant increase in delta band activity in both FS groups and a reduced high frequency density only in the prolonged FS groups that was seen up to 39 months post-seizure. Behavioural and cognitive measures revealed cognitive development within average, but lower attentional capacities in the FS infants. The persistent changes in spectral density patterns seen in children with prolonged FS may reflect seizure induced alterations in the developing brain or a result of a complex mode of inheritance. Further studies are needed to determine whether these observations can be used as a marker to predict the vulnerability of the child in developing behavioral deficits or epilepsy.

EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Model of temporal lobe epilepsy; Neuronal theta activity; EEG; Septum; Hippocampus; Theta rhythm; Kindling; Perforant path; Seizure discharges	FREELY MOVING RAT; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; MEDIAL SEPTUM; DIAGONAL BAND; SEPTOHIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RHYTHM; INNERVATION	The multiunit activity in the medial septal-diagonal band complex (MSDB) and field potentials of the hippocampus were simultaneously recorded in waking healthy rabbits (control) and in the same animals that were then exposed to kindling stimulation of the perforant path. In the control, the bursts of spikes in one group of rhythmic MSDB neurons phase-locked to the top of theta waves in the hippocampus, and in the second group, to the trough of these waves. The stimulation evoked seizure afterdischarges in the hippocampus and seizure bursts of spikes separated by periods of inhibition in MSDB neurons. In the first group of septal cells, seizure bursts coincided with inhibitory periods between afterdischarges in the hippocampus; in the second group, these bursts were observed during seizure afterdischarges, suggesting that different MSDB cells play opposite roles in the development of seizures. Evoked afterdischarges were spontaneously followed by recurrent ictal events; neuronal oscillations at the theta (6-7 Hz) or "twice-theta" frequency (12-14 Hz) preceded these secondary epileptic discharges. As a result of kindling, interictal spikes were recorded in the hippocampus: at the same time, synchronous bursts of many cells appeared in the MSDB. in the epileptic brain, the frequency of both the hippocampal theta rhythm and MSDB neuronal theta bursts increased; in the septum, an augmentation of neuronal rhythmicity was also observed. Theta oscillations, either spontaneous or evoked by sensory stimulation, abolished the epileptiform events. Evidently, the activities within the theta range during preictal and interictal periods are of different significance in the generation of seizures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Since NO is thought to be involved in the regulation of both sleep and circadian rhythms, we analyzed these two processes in mice deficient for cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (PRKG1) in the brain. Prkg1 mutant mice showed a strikingly altered distribution of sleep and wakefulness over the 24 hours of a day as well as reductions in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) duration and in non-REM sleep (NREMS) consolidation, and their ability to sustain waking episodes was compromised. Furthermore, they displayed a drastic decrease in electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the delta frequency range (1-4 Hz) under baseline conditions, which could be normalized after sleep deprivation. In line with the re-distribution of sleep and wakefulness, the analysis of wheel-running and drinking activity revealed more rest bouts during the activity phase and a higher percentage of daytime activity in mutant animals. No changes were observed in internal period length and phase-shifting properties of the circadian clock while chi-squared periodogram amplitude was significantly reduced, hinting at a less robust oscillator. These results indicate that PRKG1 might be involved in the stabilization and output strength of the circadian oscillator in mice. Moreover, PRKG1 deficiency results in an aberrant pattern, and consequently a reduced quality, of sleep and wakefulness, possibly due to a decreased wake-promoting output of the circadian system impinging upon sleep.

J	Smith, AP				Smith, Andrew Paul			Chewing gum, stress and health	STRESS AND HEALTH			English	Article						Chewing gum; Stress; Health	PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; MEMORY; MOOD; MASTICATION; ATTENTION; HUMANS; SCALE; EEG	Hollingworth described chewing gum as 'a technique of relaxation'. Recent research has examined this issue and there is evidence that chewing gum can prevent the adverse effects of acute stress. There are also plausible biological mechanisms that could explain such effects. It is now important to examine chewing gum and chronic stress and the present study involved a survey of this topic. The survey covered the 'stress process, collecting data on exposure to stressful events, levels of perceived stress and health outcomes. Frequency of chewing gum was also recorded. Potential confounding factors (demographics, personality and health-related behaviours) were also recorded. The web-based survey was completed by a community sample of 2,248 full-time workers (68% female. Mean age: 35 years, range 18-74 years). Sixty-one per cent of the sample were gum chewers. The results showed that chewing gum was associated with lower levels of perceived stress (both at work and life in general). Gum chewers were also less likely to be depressed and to have seen their doctor for high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Chewing gum was associated with lower levels of alcohol consumption and with cigarette smoking. Gum chewers were also more likely to be neurotic extraverts. Those who chewed gum were also more likely to be exposed to negative factors at work. Logistic regression analyses showed that the effects of chewing gum on stress and health remained significant when these confounding factors were controlled for. These results suggest that chewing gum may be a simple way of preventing stress and the negative health outcomes that are often associated with it. Intervention studies are now required and the mechanisms underlying the effects reported here need further investigation. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to test the response to repeated partial sleep loss through detailed focus on spectral data and parts of sleep. Design: The experiment involved 4 h of sleep across 5 days in the laboratory (partial sleep deprivation [PSD]), followed by 3 days of recovery sleep. PSD was achieved through a delayed bedtime. Nine individuals participated. To avoid "laboratory monotony," subjects were permitted to leave the lab for a few hours each day. Measurements and results: All sleep stages and the latencies to sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) showed a significant reduction during PSD. However, SWS and TST (total sleep time) during the first half of sleep increased gradually across days with PSD. During the first recovery sleep, SWS was significantly increased, while stage 1 and latency to stage 3 were reduced. All were back to baseline on the second night of recovery sleep. Summed spectral power during the first 3.8 h of sleep showed a gradual and robust increase (50% above baseline) in the range 1.25-7.25 Hz across days with PSD up to first recovery sleep and then returned to baseline. Conclusions: SWS and summed power density in a broad low-frequency band respond to repeated partial sleep deprivation in a dose-response fashion during the first 4 h sleep, apparently reflecting a robust and stable homeostatic response to sleep loss.

The study identified changes of respiratory pattern during odor stimuli and found that inspiratory phase-locked alpha oscillation (I-alpha) from the averaged potentials were triggered by inspiration onset. We performed dipole analysis of I-alpha and found the dipoles were located in the olfactory-related areas: the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and the orbitofrontal cortex. As we often experienced that olfaction is habituated with constant exposure of odor presentation, we compared the respiratory patterns, I-alpha, and dipole localizations of I-alpha during recognition of odor with those of adaptation in odor. We found that changes in tidal volume and respiratory rate returned to the normal breathing level during the adaptation period. From averaging EEGs triggered as the inspiration onset, I-alpha was observed in all electrodes positions during perception of odor; on the other hand, power spectra of frontal areas decreased during the adaptation period. During the adaptation period, dipoles were not estimated in the orbitofrontal cortex, but sustained activations in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were observed.

Even-odd cycle parity in complexity of hemispheric sunspot activity	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Hemispheric sunspot activity; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Even-odd cycle parity	NORTH-SOUTH ASYMMETRY; LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; NUMBERS R-N; MAGNETIC-FIELD; TIME-SERIES; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION; EEG COMPLEXITY; SOLAR-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION	We have used the Lempel-Ziv measure to describe the complexity in sunspot activity during the solar cycles 18-23. In particular, we examined the time series of daily sunspot numbers in the northern and southern hemispheres in each of the six cycles and calculated the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) value for each time series. Our results indicate that in the even cycles, the LZC values of the sunspot numbers in the two hemispheres are very close to each other, whereas in the odd cycles they differ significantly between the two hemispheres. We also find that within each hemisphere the LZC varies from cycle to cycle. This even-odd cycle parity reflects the variations in interhemispheric strengths of the solar magnetic field leading to different temporal distributions of sunspots in the two hemispheres. The degree of complexity may influence the predictability of sunspot activity in the two hemispheres during the various cycles. Although the physical implication of the results is not clear, these results may stimulate new ideas into modeling the complex dynamics of the solar dynamo. (C) 2009 COSPAR.

This approach models a full density on the states of neuronal populations but fitnesses this high-dimensional problem by reformulating density dynamics in terms of ordinary differential equations on the sufficient statistics of the densities considered (c.f., the method of moments). The particular form for the population density we adopt is a Gaussian density (c.f., the Laplace assumption). This means population dynamics are described by equations governing the evolution of the population's mean and covariance. We derive these equations from the Fokker-Planck formalism and illustrate their application to a conductance-based model of neuronal exchanges. One interesting aspect of this formulation is that we can uncouple the mean and covariance to furnish a neural-mass model, which rests only on the populations mean. This enables us to compare equivalent mean-field and neural-mass models of the same populations and evaluate, quantitatively, the contribution of population variance to the expected dynamics. The mean-field model presented here will form the basis of a dynamic causal model of observed electromagnetic signals in future work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sleep pressure estimates (amount of Slow Wave Sleep [SWS]. SWA, and Rate of Synchronization [RoS: the rate of SWA build-up at the beginning of the NREM period]) were compared with the 24-hour patterns of body temperature (Tb-24) and sleep propensity. A moderate sleep debt was incurred over the 48 hour study as indicated by decreased levels of 24 hour sleep. On day 1, ultradian patterns of REM and SWS sleep were prominent; on day 2, more prominent were circadian patterns of REM sleep, SWS, Sleep Latency, TST and Tb-24. Also on Day 2, biphasic patterns of SWA and RoS were expressed, with peaks occuring during the falling and rising limbs of Tb-24. The biphasic peaks in SWA and RoS may be associated with phase-specific interactions of the circadian pacemaker with the sleep homeostat during conditions of moderate sleep prerssure.

To address this discrepancy, we predicted BOLD responses with squared MEG waveforms using a recently proposed energy-density model. Tactile stimuli were delivered to finger tips at SRs of 1, 4, or 10 Hz in successive 25-s blocks, and brain signals were detected from area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex of nine healthy adults using a 306-channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer and a 3-T fMRI magnet. The main MEG deflections decreased in amplitude as a function of SR, whereas the BOLD signals increased from 1- to 4-Hz SR, with no further change at 10 Hz. MEG energy densities, obtained over the whole stimulus train and convolved with different hemodynamic response functions, predicted both the shape and amplitude of the BOLD signals well, and incorporation of nonlinear terms into the model did not offer any further advantage. Thus, squared MEG waveforms obtained over the entire stimulus train provided an appropriate estimate of area 3b neuronal activity associated with the BOLD signal. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1824-1812, 2009.

The present study analyzed electrocorticogram signals in awake rats to further characterize this excessive synchronization in terms of time course, relation to motor activity and state of vigilance. Using substantia nigra pars compacta lesions and both acute and chronic pharmacological interruptions of DA transmission, the present data demonstrated that the appearance of excessive beta synchronization requires a prolonged interruption in DA transmission and builds up progressively. This synchronization was vigilance-state dependent and observed solely during awake-like activity. Furthermore, these data demonstrated for the first time that the appearance of akinesia preceded the excessive cortical beta synchronization. In addition, this synchronization was stronger in the motor than in the somato-sensory cortex and in unilaterally compared with bilaterally lesioned animals. Finally, excessive beta synchronization was accompanied by an increased coherence between motor and somato-sensory cortical activities. These data suggest that excessive beta synchronization is associated with plastic processes whose time course is delayed with respect to the akinesia. Moreover, the expression of this phenomenon, which likely reflects functional changes in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits, requires a specific brain state.

PHASE COUPLING BETWEEN RHYTHMIC SLOW ACTIVITY AND GAMMA CHARACTERIZES MESIOTEMPORAL RAPID-EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP IN HUMANS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hippocampus; rhythmic slow activity; theta; foramen ovale; mesial temporal lobe	WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; ALL-NIGHT SLEEP; HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BEHAVING RAT; NETWORKS; EEG; WAKEFULNESS	In the human sleep literature there is much controversy regarding the existence and the characteristics of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity (RSA). Generally the human RSA is believed to occur in short bursts of theta activity. An earlier study, however, reported mesiotemporal RSA during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep that instead of theta fell in the delta frequency band. We conjectured that if this RSA activity is indeed a human analogue of the animal hippocampal theta then characteristics associated with the animal theta should also be reflected in the human recordings. Here our aim was to examine possible phase coupling between mesiotemporal RSA and gamma activity during REM sleep. The study relied on nine epilepsy surgery candidates implanted with foramen ovale electrodes. Positive half-waves of the 1.5-3 Hz RSA were identified by an automatic algorithm during REM sleep. High-frequency activity was assessed for 11 consecutive 20 Hz-wide frequency bands between 20 and 240 Hz. Increase in high frequency activity was phase coupled with RSA in most frequency bands and patients. Such a phase coupling closely resembles that seen between theta and gamma in rodents. We consider this commonality to be an additional reason for regarding delta rather than theta as the human analogue of RSA in animals. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Steady State Responses: Electrophysiological Assessment of Sensory Function in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Review						entrainment; EEG; neural synchrony; schizophrenia; steady state	MODULATION-FOLLOWING RESPONSE; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BACKWARD-MASKING; PYRAMIDAL CELL; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INTERNEURON NETWORKS	Persons with schizophrenia experience subjective sensory anomalies and objective deficits on assessment of sensory function. Such deficits could be produced by abnormal signaling in the sensory pathways and sensory cortex or later stage disturbances in cognitive processing of such inputs. Steady state responses (SSRs) provide a noninvasive method to test the integrity of sensory pathways and oscillatory responses in schizophrenia with minimal task demands. SSRs are electrophysiological responses entrained to the frequency and phase of a periodic stimulus. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit pronounced auditory SSR deficits within the gamma frequency range (35-50 Hz) in response to click trains and amplitude-modulated tones. Visual SSR deficits are also observed, most prominently in the alpha and beta frequency ranges (7-30 Hz) in response to high-contrast, high-luminance stimuli. Visual SSR studies that have used the psychophysical properties of a stimulus to target specific visual pathways predominantly report magnocellular-based deficits in those with schizophrenia. Disruption of both auditory and visual SSRs in schizophrenia are consistent with neuropathological and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of anatomic abnormalities affecting the auditory and visual cortices. Computational models suggest that auditory SSR abnormalities at gamma frequencies could be secondary to T-aminobutyric acid-mediated or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid dysregulation. The pathophysiological process in schizophrenia encompasses sensory processing that probably contributes to alterations in subsequent encoding and cognitive processing. The developmental evolution of these abnormalities remains to be characterized.

Rhythms of Consciousness: Binocular Rivalry Reveals Large-Scale Oscillatory Network Dynamics Mediating Visual Perception	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL RESPONSES; NEURAL ACTIVITY; CORTICAL AREAS; EEG; FREQUENCY; THETA; TASK; INTEGRATION	Consciousness has been proposed to emerge from functionally integrated large-scale ensembles of gamma-synchronous neural populations that form and dissolve at a frequency in the theta band. We propose that discrete moments of perceptual experience are implemented by transient gamma-band synchronization of relevant cortical regions, and that disintegration and reintegration of these assemblies is time-locked to ongoing theta oscillations. In support of this hypothesis we provide evidence that (1) perceptual switching during binocular rivalry is time-locked to gamma-band synchronizations which recur at a theta rate, indicating that the onset of new conscious percepts coincides with the emergence of a new gamma-synchronous assembly that is locked to an ongoing theta rhythm; (2) localization of the generators of these gamma rhythms reveals recurrent prefrontal and parietal sources; (3) theta modulation of gamma-band synchronization is observed between and within the activated brain regions. These results suggest that ongoing theta-modulated-gamma mechanisms periodically reintegrate a large-scale prefrontal-parietal network critical for perceptual experience. Moreover, activation and network inclusion of inferior temporal cortex and motor cortex uniquely occurs on the cycle immediately preceding responses signaling perceptual switching. This suggests that the essential prefrontal-parietal oscillatory network is expanded to include additional cortical regions relevant to tasks and perceptions furnishing consciousness at that moment, in this case image processing and response initiation, and that these activations occur within a time frame consistent with the notion that conscious processes directly affect behaviour.

Specifically, we consider interactions in the oscillatory 600 Hz activity between the thalamus and the cortical Brodmann areas 3b and 1. This type of cortical activity occurs after electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves such as the median nerve. Our measurements consist of simultaneous 31-channel MEG and 32-channel EEG recordings and individual 3D MRI data. We perform source localization by means of a multi-dipole model. The dipole activation time courses are then modelled by a set of coupled oscillators, described by linear second-order ordinary delay differential equations (DDEs). In particular, a new model for the thalamic activity is included in the oscillatory network. The parameters of the DDE system are successfully fitted to the data by a nonlinear evolutionary optimization method. To activate the oscillatory network, an individual input function is used, based on measurements of the propagated stimulation signal at the biceps. A significant feedback from the cortex to the thalamus could be detected by comparing the network modelling with and without feedback connections. Our finding in humans is supported by earlier animal studies. We conclude that this type of rhythmic brain activity can be modelled by oscillatory networks in order to disentangle feed forward and feedback information transfer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensory gating in intracranial recordings - The role of phase locking	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory evoked potentials; Electrocorticography; Schizophrenia; Auditory cortex; Electroencephalography	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; FREELY-MOVING RATS; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; POPULATION RESPONSES; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; SINGLE-UNIT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P50	For patients with schizophrenia, a deficient gating (or filtering) of sensory input has been described. One major approach to study this sensory gating is to measure event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to paired clicks. In these experiments, sensory gating is quantified as amplitude reduction of the ERP components P50 and N100 from the 1st to the 2nd stimulus. In ERP studies brain electrical signals are averaged over single trials. Alterations in phase locking might be one factor contributing to the observed deficits in sensory gating, but findings have been inconclusive as yet. In particular, the contribution of different frequency bands to the deficit required further investigation. We studied N100 gating by intracranial recordings in a sample of epilepsy patients and subdivided the group into good and poor gators of the intracranial ERP component N100. Data were evaluated by frequency specific wavelet-based phase and power analyses. Poor N100 gators had an increased phase locking in the frequency range from 6.0-15.1 Hz after the 2nd stimulus, as compared to good gators. Other group differences were apparent already before the 2nd stimulus. Poor gators had less phase locked beta band activity (20.2-30.0 Hz) than good gators 200 315 ms after the onset of the 1st stimulus. Within the group of poor gators, lower values of phase locking in this frequency range were also associated with lower gating ratios. The reduced beta band response in response to the 1st stimulus may reflect poorer memory encoding of the 1st stimulus in poor gators. This in turn might lead to increased demands to process the 2nd stimulus. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Induced Gamma-band Activity Elicited by Visual Representation of Unattended Objects	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FIGURE-GROUND ORGANIZATION; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REPETITION PRIMING TASK; HUMAN EEG; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; MODULATION	Object recognition is achieved through neural mechanisms reliant on the activity of distributed neural assemblies that are thought to be coordinated by synchronous firing in the gamma-band range (> 20 Hz). An outstanding question focuses on the extent to which the role of gamma oscillations in object recognition is dependent on attention. Attentional mechanisms determine the allocation of perceptual resources to objects in complex scenes biasing the outcome of their mutual competitive interactions. Would object-related enhancements in gamma activity also occur for unattended objects when perceptual resources are traded off to the processing of concurrent visual material? The present electroencephalogram study investigated event-related potentials and evoked (time- and phase-locked) and induced (non-time- and phase-locked to stimulus onset) gamma-band activity (GBA) using a visual discrimination task of low or high perceptual load at fixation. The task was performed while task-irrelevant familiar or unfamiliar objects coappeared in the surrounding central area. Attentional focus was kept at fixation by varying perceptual load between trials; in such conditions, only holistic object processing or low-level perceptual processing, requiring little or no attention, are thought to occur. Although evoked GBA remained unmodulated, induced GBA enhancements, specific to familiar object presentations, were observed, thus providing evidence for cortical visual representation of unattended objects. In addition, the effect was mostly driven by object-specific activity under low load, implying that, in cluttered or complex scenes, attentional selection likely plays a more significant role in object representation.

Activity Profiles of Cholinergic and Intermingled GABAergic and Putative Glutamatergic Neurons in the Pontomesencephalic Tegmentum of Urethane-Anesthetized Rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SLEEP-WAKING CYCLE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; RETICULAR-FORMATION; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; IN-VIVO; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; STATE CONTROL; CELL AREA; NUCLEUS	Cholinergic neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum form part of the ascending activating system and are thought to participate in stimulating cortical activation. Yet in the laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT and PPT), they lie intermingled with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, which could also modulate cortical activity and sleep-wake state. To characterize the discharge of these cell types in relation to cortical activity, we recorded neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats during spontaneous slow wave and somatosensory evoked fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, then labeled the cells by juxtacellular technique with Neurobiotin (Nb) and dual-immunostained them for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). All cholinergic cells discharged minimally during prestimulation (similar to 0.5 Hz) and moderately in a tonic manner (similar to 4 Hz) during stimulation. Being heterogeneous, some GABAergic, called "On," cells (similar to 48%) increased their discharge (from similar to 4 to 7 Hz), whereas others, called "Off" cells (similar to 38%), decreased or ceased firing during stimulation. Similarly, some noncholinergic/non-GABAergic On cells increased (from similar to 2 to 6 Hz, similar to 49%), whereas other Off cells decreased firing (similar to 35%) during stimulation. Putative glutamatergic On together with GABAergic On neurons could thus act in parallel with cholinergic cells to stimulate cortical activation. Possibly influenced by cholinergic On and glutamatergic Off cells, whose change in discharge precedes theirs, the GABAergic Off cells could oppose neighboring neurons such as noradrenergic cells, which discharge during waking and cease firing during sleep. By concerted activity, these heterogeneous cell groups can modulate cortical activity and behavioral state across the sleep-waking cycle.

Recent studies suggest that reactivity of these rhythms to sensory input reflects a link between perception and action and that abnormalities in this reactivity might reflect impairment in perception-to-action mechanisms. Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are impaired in tasks requiring sensorimotor function, attention, expectancy, and inhibition, yet their sensorimotor mu responses are unknown. Thus, we investigated mu reactivity in a group of adults with ADHD. Methods: Sixteen adults with ADHD and 16 matched control subjects received median nerve stimulation in predictable patterns (trains of four stimuli followed by 4-sec gap) or unpredictable patterns (randomly presented trains of two, four, or six stimuli followed by 4-sec gap). With magnetoencephalography, we examined the effects of stimulus patterning (predictable, unpredictable) on mu reactivity to somatosensory stimuli. Results: Compared with control subjects, the ADHD group showed lower mu reactivity overall and no modulation by unpredictable somatosensory input. By contrast, the control group showed robust mu reactivity to stimuli presented in unpredictable but not predictable patterns. These changes were stronger in the contralateral hemisphere compared with the ADHD group. Conclusions: Cortical mu rhythms are modulated by stimulus predictability and might be involved in attentional alerting (awareness of when an unexpected stimulus occurs). Diminished mu modulation in adult ADHD suggests a possible underlying deficit in the perception-to-action system.

Design: Cross-sectional study using polysomnographic recordings and neuropsychological assessments. Setting: Sleep laboratory in academic center. Participants: Sixteen subjects with developmental dyslexia (mean age 10.8 years) and 11 normally reading children (mean age 10.1 years) underwent overnight polysomnographic recording. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Sleep architecture parameters only showed some statistically significant differences: number of sleep stage shifts per hour of sleep, percentage of N3, and number of R periods were significantly lower in dyslexic children versus controls. CAP analysis revealed a higher total CAP rate and A1 index in stage N3. A2% and A2 index in stage N2 and N3 were lower in dyslexic children while no differences were found for A3 CAP subtypes. The correlation analysis between CAP parameters and cognitive-behavioral measures showed a significant positive correlation between A1 index in N3 with Verbal IQ, full-scale IQ, and Memory and Learning Transfer reading test; while CAP rate in N3 was positively correlated with verbal IQ. Conclusions: To overcome reading difficulties, dyslexic subjects overactivate thalamocortical and hippocampal circuitry to transfer information between cortical posterior and anterior areas. The overactivation of the ancillary frontal areas could account for the CAP rate modifications and mainly for the increase of CAP rate and of A1 index in N3 that seem to be correlated with IQ and reading abilities.

Correlation between BOLD fMRI and theta-band local field potentials in the human hippocampal area. J Neurophysiol 101: 2668-2678, 2009. First published February 25, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn. 91252.2008. The relation between the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which forms the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and underlying neural activity is not well understood. We performed high-resolution fMRI in patients scheduled for implantation with depth electrodes for seizure monitoring while they navigated a virtual environment. We then recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and neural firing rate directly from the hippocampal area of the same subjects during the same task. Comparing BOLD signal changes with 396 LFP and 185 neuron recordings in the hippocampal area, we found that BOLD signal changes correlated positively with LFP power changes in the theta-band (4-8 Hz). This correlation, however, was largely present for parahippocampal BOLD signal changes; BOLD changes in the hippocampus correlated weakly or not at all with LFP power changes. We did not find a significant relationship between BOLD activity and neural firing rate in either region, which could not be accounted for by a lesser tendency for neurons to respond or a greater tendency for neurons to habituate to the task. Strengthening the idea of a dissociation between LFP power and neural firing rate in their relation to the BOLD signal, simultaneously recorded LFP power and neural firing rate changes were uncorrelated across electrodes. Together, our results suggest that the BOLD signal in the human hippocampal area has a more heterogenous relationship with underlying neural activity than has been described previously in other brain regions.

The introduction of presurgical intracranial recordings to localize the epileptogenic zone in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsies opened a new window to the interpretation of seizure generation (ictogenesis). One of the most frequent focal patterns observed with intracranial electrodes at seizure onset is characterized by low-voltage fast activity in the beta-gamma range that may or may not be preceded by changes of ongoing interictal activities. In the present commentary, the mechanisms of generation of focal seizures are reconsidered, focusing on low-voltage fast activity patterns. Experimental findings on models of temporal lobe seizures support the view that the low-voltage fast activity observed at seizure onset is associated with reinforcement and synchronization of inhibitory networks. A minor role for the initiation of the ictal pattern is played by principal neurons that are progressively recruited with a delay, when inhibition declines and synchronous high-voltage discharges ensue. The transition from inhibition into excitatory recruitment is probably mediated by local increase in potassium concentration associated with synchronized interneuronal firing. These findings challenge the classical theory that proposes an increment of excitation and/or a reduction of inhibition as a cause for the transition to seizure in focal epilepsies. A new definition of ictogenesis mechanisms, as herewith hypothesized, might possibly help to develop new therapeutic strategies for focal epilepsies.

J	Popa, D; Popescu, AT; Pare, D				Popa, Daniela; Popescu, Andrei T.; Pare, Denis			Contrasting Activity Profile of Two Distributed Cortical Networks as a Function of Attentional Demands	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; cortex; amygdala; prefrontal; EEG; electroencephalogram; cingulate	BOLD SIGNAL FLUCTUATIONS; RESTING-STATE; DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN-FUNCTION; RHINAL INTERACTIONS; FMRI SIGNALS; FIRING RATE; CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	Recent human functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed that two widely distributed groups of cortical areas display inverse changes in activity when attentional demands increase, with one group showing higher (task-on) and the second lower (task-off) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Moreover, task-on and task-off regions also exhibit slow (< 0.2 Hz) inversely correlated fluctuations in BOLD signal at rest. However, the neuronal correlates of these reciprocal BOLD signal fluctuations are unknown. Here, we addressed this question using simultaneous recordings of unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the cat homologues of task-on and task-off regions. In all states of vigilance, LFP power was lower in task- off than task- on regions with no difference in firing rates. Both sets of regions displayed slow (0.5-0.15 Hz) cyclical modulations in LFP power in all frequency bands but with large and variable phase differences such that task- on and task- off regions were often anticorrelated. Inversely correlated LFP power fluctuations were state-dependent in that they were much more frequent in waking and paradoxical sleep than in slow-wave sleep. Moreover, consistent with fMRI findings, when attentional demands increased, LFP power in task- on and task-off regions changed in opposite directions, further augmenting and decreasing, respectively. At odds with previous fMRI studies, however, the decreased LFP power in task-off regions was associated with increased firing rates, suggesting that the engagement of task- off regions might not be reduced but in fact enhanced during attention.

They synchronize neuronal activity and connect glial cells participating in the regulation of brain metabolism and homeostasis. Gap junction blockers (GJBs) include various chemicals that impair gap junction communication, disrupt oscillatory neuronal activity over a wide range of frequencies, and decrease epileptic discharges. The behavioural and clinical effects of GJBs suggest that gap junctions can be involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, arousal, memory, and breathing. Severe neuropsychiatric side effects suggest the involvement of gap junctions in mechanisms of consciousness. Unfortunately, the available GJBs are not selective and can bind to targets other than gap junctions. Other problems in behavioural studies include the possible adverse effects of GJBs, for example, retinal toxicity and hearing disturbances, changes in blood-brain transport, and the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to design experiments properly to avoid false, misleading or uninterpretable results. We review the pharmacological properties and electrophysiological, behavioural and cognitive effects of the available gap junction blockers, such as carbenoxolone, glycyrrhetinic acid, quinine, quinidine, mefloquine, heptanol, octanol, anandamide, fenamates, 2-APB, several anaesthetics, retinoic acid, oleamide, spermine, aminosulfonates, and sodium propionate. It is concluded that despite a number of different problems, the currently used gap junction blockers could be useful tools in pharmacology and neuroscience. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling brain activation patterns for the default and cognitive states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; GAP-JUNCTIONS; BOLD SIGNAL; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORK; NEURONS; CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS; PERCEPTION	We argue that spatial patterns of cortical activation observed with EEG, MEG and fMRI might arise from spontaneous self-organisation of interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We examine the dynamical behavior of a mean-field cortical model that includes chemical and electrical (gap-junction) synapses, focusing on two limiting cases: the "slow-soma" limit with slow voltage feedback from soma to dendrite, and the "fast-soma" limit in which the feedback action of soma voltage onto dendrite reversal potentials is instantaneous. For slow soma-dendrite feedback, we find a low-frequency (similar to 1 Hz) dynamic Hopf instability, and a stationary Turing instability that catalyzes formation of patterned distributions of cortical firing-rate activity with pattern wavelength similar to 2 cm. Turing instability can only be triggered when gap-junction diffusion between inhibitory neurons is strong, but patterning is destroyed if the tonic level of subcortical excitation is raised sufficiently. Interaction between the Hopf and Turing instabilities may describe the non-cognitive background or "default" state of the brain, as observed by BOLD imaging. In the fast-soma limit, the model predicts a high-frequency Hopf (similar to 35 Hz) instability, and a traveling-wave gamma-band instability that manifests as a 2-D standing-wave pattern oscillating in place at similar to 30 Hz. Small levels of inhibitory diffusion enhance and broaden the definition of the gamma antinodal regions by suppressing higher-frequency spatial modes, but gamma emergence is not contingent on the presence of inhibitory gap junctions; higher levels of diffusion suppress gamma activity. Fast-soma instabilities are enhanced by increased subcortical stimulation. Prompt soma-dendrite feedback may be an essential component of the genesis and large-scale cortical synchrony of gamma activity observed at the point of cognition. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Deep analysis of perception through dynamic structures that emerge in cortical activity from self-regulated noise	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Black noise; Null spike; Power-law PSD; Random noise; Rayleigh distribution; Rice distribution; Spontaneous background activity; Theta-gamma linkage	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; MULTICORTICAL PATTERNS; NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; ORIGIN; MODULATION	The statistical properties of the spontaneous background electrocorticogram (ECoG) were modeled, starting with random numbers, constraining the distributions, and identifying characteristic deviations from randomness in ECoG from subjects at rest and during intentional behaviors. The ECoG had been recorded through 8 9 8 arrays of 64 electrodes, from the surfaces of auditory, visual, or somatic cortices of 9 rabbits, and from the inferotemporal cortex of a human subject. Power spectral densities (PSD) in coordinates of log(10) power versus log(10) frequency of ECoG from subjects at rest usually conformed to noise in power-law distributions in a continuum. PSD of ECoG from active subjects usually deviated from noise in having peaks in log(10) power above the power-law line in various frequency bands. The analytic signals from the Hilbert transform after band pass filtering in the beta and gamma ranges revealed beats from interference among distributed frequencies in band pass filtered noise called Rayleigh noise. The beats were displayed as repetitive down spikes in log(10) analytic power. Repetition rates were proportional to filter bandwidths for all center frequencies. Resting ECoG often gave histograms of the magnitudes and intervals of down spikes that conformed to noise. Histograms from active ECoG often deviated from noise in Rayleigh distributions of down spike intervals by giving what are called Rice (Mathematical analysis of random noise- and appendixes-technical publications monograph B-1589. Bell Telephone Labs Inc., New York, 1950) distributions. Adding power to noise as signals at single frequencies simulated those deviations. The beats in dynamic theory are deemed essential for perception, by gating beta and gamma bursts at theta rates through enhancement of the cortical signal-to-noise ratio in exceptionally deep down spikes called null spikes.

Indeed, the epileptogenic zone may be organized as a simple focal lesional site or as a more complex network (often referred to as the 'epileptogenic network') extending beyond the lesion. This distinction is particularly relevant in developmental lesions such as focal cortical dysplasias or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours and may determine both the surgical strategy and the prognosis. In this study, we have quantified the epileptogenic characteristic of brain structures explored by depth electrodes in 36 patients investigated by stereoelectroencephalography and suffering from focal drug-resistant epilepsy associated with focal cortical dysplasias or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours. This quantification was performed using the 'Epileptogenicity Index' method that accounts for both the propensity of a brain area to generate rapid discharges and the time for this area to get involved in the seizure. Epileptogenicity Index values range from 0 (no epileptogenicity) to 1 (maximal epileptogenicity). We determined Epileptogenicity Index from signals recorded in distinct brain structures including the lesional site. We studied the type of epileptogenic zone organization (focal versus network) and looked for a correlation with clinical data and post-surgical outcome. Mean Epileptogenicity Index in lesional regions was 0.87 (+/- 0.25), and 0.29 (+/- 0.30) in 'non-lesional' structures. The number of highly epileptogenic structures (defined by Epileptogenicity Index value >= 0.4) was 3.14 (+/- 1.87) in the whole population. We found that 31% of patients had only one epileptogenic structure (N-EI >= 0.4 = 1), therefore disclosing a strictly focal epileptogenic zone organization while 25 patients had more than one epileptogenic region, disclosing a network (61%) or bilateral (8%) epileptogenic zone organization. We observed a trend for a difference in seizure outcome according to the type of epileptogenic zone organization. Indeed, 57% of patients with network organization and 87% with focal organization were seizure-free while none of those with bilateral organization became seizure-free. The determination of Epileptogenicity Index computed from electrophysiological signals recorded according to the stereoelectroencephalography technique is a novel tool. Results suggest that it can help in the delineation of the epileptogenic zone associated with brain lesions and that it could be used in the definition of the subsequent surgical resection.

Theta and gamma coherence along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. J Neurophysiol 101: 1192-1200, 2009. First published December 31, 2008; doi:10.1152/jn.90846.2008. Theta and gamma rhythms synchronize neurons within and across brain structures. Both rhythms are widespread within the hippocampus during exploratory behavior and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. How synchronous are these rhythms throughout the hippocampus? The present study examined theta and gamma coherence along the septotemporal (long) axis of the hippocampus in rats during REM sleep, a behavioral state during which theta signals are unaffected by external sensory input or ongoing behavior. Unilateral entorhinal cortical inputs are thought to play a prominent role in the current generation of theta, whereas current generation of gamma is primarily due to local GABAergic neurons. The septal 50% (4-5 mm) of the dentate gyrus (DG) receives a highly divergent, unilateral projection from any focal point along a lateral band of entorhinal neurons near the rhinal sulcus. We hypothesized that theta coherence in the target zone (septal DG) of this divergent entorhinal input would not vary, while gamma coherence would significantly decline with distance in this zone. However, both theta and gamma coherence decreased significantly along the long axis in the septal 50% of the hippocampus across both DG and CA1 electrode sites. In contrast, theta coherence between homotypic (e.g., DG to DG) sites in the contralateral hemisphere (similar to 3-5 mm distant) were quite high (similar to 0.7-0.9), much greater than theta coherence between homotypic sites 3-5 mm distant (similar to 0.4-0.6) along the long axis. These findings define anatomic variation in both rhythms along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, indicate the bilateral CA3/mossy cell projections are the major determinant of theta coherence during REM, and demonstrate that theta coherence varies as a function of anatomical connectivity rather than physical distance. We suggest CA3 and entorhinal inputs interact dynamically to generate theta field potentials and advance the utility of theta and gamma coherence as indicators of hippocampal dynamics.

Different signal-to-noise ratios filter settings and sampling rates were also tested on the estimate of functional connectivity among the network nodes, in simulated and real cases. Methods: Starting from magnetoencephalographic recordings, cortical sources in primary sensorimotor areas of the hand were obtained by functional source separation (FSS). Different criteria for the choice of the model order were compared in the simulated network constructed through one of the FSS-extracted sources and its noise-added delayed copies. In two real cases, a validation of the model order (not known a priori) choice was obtained by comparing the time-frequency properties as depicted by classical non-parametric and WAR methods at rest, during isometric contraction (stationary states) and while dynamically responding to a sensory stimulation (transient state). For completeness, the whole set of WAR functional connectivity measures was taken into account, to assess the most suitable for our network description. Results: That the use of an incorrect model order distorts network functional connectivity estimate was documented both in the realistic simulation and in the two real cases. The Minimal Description Length and Schwartz Bayesian Criterion were selected as the most robust for WAR model order choice. Partial directed coherence (PDC) was the most suitable method for time-frequency connectivity estimate in the simulated as well as in the real cases, both in stationary and transient states. Moreover, the results of MVAR-based connectivity estimate depend on filter setting in the real case. Conclusions: The most robust procedure far choosing the correct WAR model order was provided. The adjunctive comparison of WAR to classical methods is recommended to validate the choice in the real case. Significance: Correct MVAR model order choice and band filtering play an important role for the correct network connectivity estimate. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Melanopsin (Opn4) is a retinal photopigment crucial for conveying nonvisual light information to the brain. Through extensive characterization of sleep and the electrocorticogram (ECoG) in melanopsin-deficient (Opn4(-/-)) mice under various light-dark (LD) schedules, we assessed the role of melanopsin in mediating the effects of light on sleep and ECoG activity. In control mice, a light pulse given during the habitual dark period readily induced sleep, whereas a dark pulse given during the habitual light period induced waking with pronounced theta (7-10 Hz) and gamma (40-70 Hz) activity, the ECoG correlates of alertness. In contrast, light failed to induce sleep in Opn4(-/-) mice, and the dark-pulse-induced increase in theta and gamma activity was delayed. A 24-h recording under a LD 1-h: 1-h schedule revealed that the failure to respond to light in Opn4(-/-) mice was restricted to the subjective dark period. Light induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and in sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) neurons was importantly reduced in Opn4(-/-) mice, implicating both sleep-regulatory structures in the melanopsin-mediated effects of light. In addition to these acute light effects, Opn4(-/-) mice slept 1 h less during the 12-h light period of a LD 12: 12 schedule owing to a lengthening of waking bouts. Despite this reduction in sleep time, ECoG delta power, a marker of sleep need, was decreased in Opn4(-/-) mice for most of the (subjective) dark period. Delta power reached after a 6-h sleep deprivation was similarly reduced in Opn4(-/-) mice. In mice, melanopsin's contribution to the direct effects of light on sleep is limited to the dark or active period, suggesting that at this circadian phase, melanopsin compensates for circadian variations in the photo sensitivity of other light-encoding pathways such as rod and cones. Our study, furthermore, demonstrates that lack of melanopsin alters sleep homeostasis. These findings call for a reevaluation of the role of light on mammalian physiology and behavior.
