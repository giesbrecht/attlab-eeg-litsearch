In 10 children between 6 and 9 years of age with epilepsy with CSWS or related disorders, we investigated HFOs in scalp EEG spikes during slow-wave sleep through temporal expansion of the EEG traces with a low-cut frequency filter at 70 Hz as well as through time-frequency power spectral analysis. HFOs (ripples) concurrent with spikes were detected in the temporally expanded traces, and the frequency of the high-frequency peak with the greatest power in each patient's spectra ranged from 97.7 to 140.6 Hz. This is the first report on the detection of HFOs from scalp EEG recordings in epileptic patients. We speculate that epileptic HFOs may interfere with higher brain functions in epilepsy with CSWS.

However, recent studies have found that the phase coherence of ongoing EEG oscillations is also related to stimulus-related brain activities and could reveal some information (e. g. phase-locked modulation in time-frequency domain) that ERPs could not provide. Here, we used inter-trail phase coherence(ITPC) to analyze the ongoing EEG oscillations under face/object stimuli, which aimed to explore the influence of face/object stimuli on EEG oscillations at various frequency bands (alpha, beta and low frequency gamma). Our preliminary results showed that (1) alpha band has relatively high phase synchronization in the time window of P1-N170-P2 under face/object stimuli; (2) EEG for face stimuli showed higher phase synchronization than object did in the time window of 80-350 ms in alpha band; (3) in low frequency gamma band, faces evoked relatively higher phase synchronization around 170ms than objects did. These results indicated that (1) ITPC, the measure of EEG phase synchronization, could be effectively used in face/object perception to provide oscillatory phase information; (2) the modulation of ITPC value in the alpha band might be more suitable to investigate the face preference EEG activities and locate the time range of the early face perception compared with ERPs; (3) the difference between face and object processing could be reflected in the low frequency gamma band via ITPC values.

In this study we used EEG-fMRI to determine the possible correlation between topographical movement-related EEG changes in brain oscillatory activity recorded from EEG electrodes over the scalp and fMRI cortical responses in motor areas during finger movement. Thirty-two channels of EEG were recorded in 12 subjects during eyes-closed condition inside a three T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner using an MR-compatible EEG recording system. Off-line MRI artifact subtraction software was applied to obtain continuous EEG data during fMRI acquisition. For EEG data analysis we used a time-frequency approach to measure time by varying the energy in a signal at a given frequency band by the convolution of the EEG signal with a wavelet family in the alpha and beta bands. The correlation between the BOLD signal associated with the EEG regressor provides that sensory motor region is a source of the EEG. We conclude that combined EEG-fMRI can be used to investigate movement-related oscillations of the human brain inside an MRI scanner and wavelet analysis adds further details on the EEG changes. The movement-related changes in the EEG signals are useful to identify the brain activation sources responsible for BOLD-signal changes.

A flicker stimulus in the form of repetitive light flashes is used to study the time-variant spectral and phase characteristics of EEG/MEG components during the entrainment of the alpha oscillation by individually adapted flicker frequencies. Two groups of healthy volunteers are investigated: volunteers with a high degree of entrainment effects (group #1) and those with a low degree of entrainment (group #2). By means of time-variant power spectrum and phase-locked power spectrum analysis as well as amplitude-free phase-locking analysis (phase-locking index), the frequency ranges of phase-locked oscillations are identified and quantified. Gamma oscillations are phase-locked with the onset of the flicker stimulation (time-locked) and the entrained alpha oscillation shows a phase-locking approximately 200ms after flicker onset. This holds true for both groups. The results shed light on the coordination characteristics of the brain's activities and provide the basis for a more detailed analysis of time-variant linear and non-linear interactions between the identified frequency ranges.

Time-frequency analysis of movement-related spectral power in EEG during repetitive movements: A comparison of methods	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related de-synchronisation; Repetitive movements; EEG; Time-frequency analysis; Wavelets; Short-time Fourier Transform; Reduced interference distributions	DESYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; CORTEX	During dynamic voluntary movements, power in the alpha- and beta-bands resulting from synchronized neuronal activity is modulated in a manner that is time-locked to movement onset. These signals can be readily recorded from the scalp surface using electroencephalography. Abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of these oscillations are present in a wide variety of movement disorders including Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Most studies have examined movement-related oscillations in the context of single discrete movements, yet marked impairments are often seen during the performance of repetitive movements. For this reason, there is considerable need for analysis methods that can resolve the modulation of these oscillations in both the frequency and time domains. Presently, there is little consensus on which is the most appropriate method for this purpose. In this paper, a comparison of commonly used time-frequency methods is presented for the analysis of movement-related power in the alpha- and beta-bands during repetitive movements. The same principles hold, however, for any form of repetitive or rhythmic input-output processes in the brain. In particular, methods based on band-pass filtering, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), continuous wavelet transform and reduced interference distributions are discussed. The relative merits and limitations in terms of spectral or temporal resolution of each method are shown with the use of simulated and experimental data. It is shown that the STFT provides the best compromise between spectral and temporal resolution and thus is the most appropriate approach for the analysis and interpretation of repetitive movement-related oscillations in health and disease.

However, for high-dimensional EEG signals, the calculations of traditional auto and cross-bicoherences of signals from multiple electrodes are computationally very expensive. This has been compounded by the recognition of the non-stationary character of EEG signals. This paper introduces a new approach, the time-varying canonical bicoherence (CBC) by short-time weighted Fourier transforms. for analyzing QPC nonlinearities of dynamic EEG signals. This new method shows both computational efficiency and simple interpretation of estimated canonical bicoherences. The canonical bicoherence analysis of EEG records, during a human visual stimulus-driven cognitive process, put into evidence of quadratic phase couplings of Beta waves and Delta waves in the frontal regions.

These oscillations are supposed to be involved in several cognitive mechanisms. For instance, oscillatory activity is considered a key component for the top-down control of perception. However, measuring this activity and its influence requires precise extraction of frequency components. This processing is not straightforward. Particularly, difficulties with extracting oscillations arise due to their time-varying characteristics. Moreover, when phase information is needed, it is of the utmost importance to extract narrow-band signals. This paper presents a novel method using adaptive filters for tracking and extracting these time-varying oscillations. This scheme is designed to maximize the oscillatory behavior at the output of the adaptive filter. It is then capable of tracking an oscillation and describing its temporal evolution even during low amplitude time segments. Moreover, this method can be extended in order to track several oscillations simultaneously and to use multiple signals. These two extensions are particularly relevant in the framework of EEG data processing, where oscillations are active at the same time in different frequency bands and signals are recorded with multiple sensors. The presented tracking scheme is first tested with synthetic signals in order to highlight its capabilities. Then it is applied to data recorded during a visual shape discrimination experiment for assessing its usefulness during EEG processing and in detecting functionally relevant changes. This method is an interesting additional processing step for providing alternative information compared to classical time-frequency analyses and for improving the detection and analysis of cross-frequency couplings.

Time Frequency Based Coherence Analysis Between EEG and EMG Activities in Fatigue Duration	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; EMG; Coherence analysis; Fatigue	CONTRACTIONS; SYNCHRONY; MOVEMENTS; SIGNALS; HUMANS; MUSCLE; MEG	In voluntary movements, functional role of synchronized neuronal activity in the human motor system is important to detect and diagnose of the some diseases. In some previous studies, EEG signals and responses belong to an exercise are examined and an increased EEG activity reported in alpha frequency band. The reason of this is not clear whether a change is a direct result of the exhaustion or whether it is an adaptation. Time frequency based coherence analysis may be excellent tools to asses the fatigue stages. The experiment was planned with three fatigue stage and the cortical-muscular synchronizations were observed and examined. Simultaneously cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activities and electromyography (EMG) activities that are activated by phasic voluntary movements are recorded for 10 healthy young person and relation of the coherence between the signals are observed in time frequency domain. There is a decreasing significant coherence activity in third fatigue stage against to first and second fatigue stages. Time frequency based coherence analysis is a good method to explore motor cortex control of muscle activity in the fatigued persons. Time frequency based coherence analysis gives useful result for recordings of simultaneously cortical activity EEG and EMG during a phasic voluntary movement to determination of fatigue levels.

Slow EEG pattern predicts reduced intrinsic functional connectivity in the default mode network: An inter-subject analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Electroencephalography (EEG); BOLD; Resting state; Low-frequency fluctuations; Functional connectivity; Default mode	CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNATURES	The last two decades have witnessed great progress in mapping neural networks associated with task-induced brain activation. More recently, identification of resting state networks (RSN) paved the way to investigate spontaneous task-unrelated brain activity. The cardinal features characterising RSN are low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals synchronised between spatially distinct, but functionally connected brain areas. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI has been previously deployed to study the neurophysiological signature of RSN by comparing EEG power with BOLD amplitudes. We hypothesised that band-limited EEG power may be directly related to network-specific functional connectivity (FC) of BOLD signal time courses. Hence, we studied the association between individual EEG signature and FC in a core RSN, the so-called default mode network (DMN). Combined EEG/fMRI data of 20 healthy volunteers collected during a 15-minute rest period were analysed. Using an inter-subject analysis design, we demonstrated a network and frequency specific relation between RSN FC and EEG. In a multiple regression model, EEG band-powers explained 70% of DMN FC variance, with significant partial correlations of DMN FC to delta (r = -0.73) and beta (r = 0.53) power. The identified EEG pattern has been previously associated with increased alertness. Conversely, an established EEG-derived sedation index (spectral edge frequency SEF95) closely correlated with DMN FC. The study presents an approach that opens a new perspective to EEG/fMRI correlation. Direct evidence was provided for a distinct neurophysiological correlate of DMN FC. This finding further validates the biological relevance of network-specific intrinsic FC and provides an initial neurophysiological basis for interpreting studies of DMN FC alterations.

We had the unique opportunity to record a seizure in EEG with intracerebral macroelectrodes and a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. Considering the notion that faster HFOs are likely more ictogenic, we investigated this ictal EEG data to find if even faster HFOs were present. HFOs were investigated in interictal spikes and seizure activity using time-frequency spectra: t values corresponding to frequencies from 100 to 1000 Hz were obtained by comparison to the background and controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR). The seizure had a right hippocampal onset. HFOs up to 800 Hz as well as HFOs below 500 Hz built up in the hippocampal discharges more at the beginning of the seizure and during the preictal period than in the interictal period. These HFOs were visually confirmed in temporally expanded EEG traces. We demonstrated for the first time the existence of HFOs above 500 Hz and up to 800 Hz with intracerebral macroelectrodes in an epileptic patient; they occurred primarily in association with the seizure discharge. HFOs above 500 Hz possibly reflect facilitation of ictogenic neuronal hypersynchronization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Time-varying parametric modelling and time-dependent spectral characterisation with applications to EEG signals using multiwavelets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELLING IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						time-varying models; autoregressive models; system identification; model structure detection; orthogonal least squares; OLS; time-dependent spectra; wavelets; electroencephalography; EEG	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; NONSTATIONARY EEG; IDENTIFICATION; SERIES; SEGMENTATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INFORMATION; SELECTION; TERM	A new time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) modelling approach is proposed for non-stationary signal processing and analysis, with application to EEG data modelling and power spectral estimation. In the new parametric modelling framework, the time-dependent coefficients of the TVAR model are represented using a novel multiwavelet decomposition scheme. The time-varying modelling problem is then reduced to regression selection and parameter estimation, which can be effectively resolved by using a forward orthogonal regression algorithm. Two examples, one for an artificial signal and another for an EEG signal, are given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the new TVAR modelling method.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a standard tool for monitoring brain states in humans. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying diverse EEG rhythms can be facilitated by using mouse models under molecular, pharmacological, or electrophysiological manipulations. The small size of the mouse brain, however, poses a severe limitation in the spatial information of EEG. To overcome this limitation, we devised a polyimide based microelectrode array (PBM array) with nanofabrication technologies. The microelectrode contains 32 electrodes, weighs 150 mg, and yields noise-insensitive signals when applied on the mouse skull. The high-density microelectrode allowed both global and focused mapping of high resolution EEG (HR-EEG) in the mouse brain. Mapping and dynamical analysis tools also have been developed to visualize the dynamical changes of spatially resolved mouse EEG. We demonstrated the validity and utility of mouse EEG in localization of the seizure onset in absence seizure model and phase dynamics of abnormal theta rhythm in transgenic mice. Dynamic tracking of the EEG map in genetically modified mice under freely moving conditions should allow study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the generation and dynamics of diverse EEG rhythms.

Pitfalls of high-pass filtering for detecting epileptic oscillations: A technical note on "false" ripples	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Oscillations; Ripples; Filtering; Time-frequency	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTRACEREBRAL EEG ACTIVITY; MATCHING PURSUIT; SEIZURE ONSET; 100-500 HZ; BRAIN; EPILEPTOGENICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL; RECORDINGS	Objectives: To analyze interictal High frequency oscillations (HFOs) as observed in the medial temporal lobe of epileptic patients and animals (ripples, 80-200 Hz and fast ripples, 250-600 Hz). To show that the identification of interictal HFOs raises some methodological issues, as the filtering of sharp transients (e. g., epileptic spikes or artefacts) or signals with harmonics can result in "false" ripples. To illustrate and quantify the occurrence of false ripples on filtered EEG traces. Methods: We have performed high-pass filtering on both simulated and real data. We have also used two alternate methods: time-frequency analysis and matching pursuit. Results: Two types of events were shown to produce oscillations after filtering that could be confounded with actual oscillatory activity: sharp transients and harmonics of non-sinusoidal signals. Conclusions: High-pass filtering of EEG traces for detection of oscillatory activity should be performed with great care. Filtered traces should be compared to original traces for verification of presence of transients. Additional techniques such as time-frequency transforms or sparse decompositions are highly beneficial. Significance: Our study draws the attention on an issue of great importance in the marking of HFOs on EEG traces. We illustrate complementary methods that can help both researchers and clinicians.

Using the Gabor transformation two measures of linear phase coupling, the phase-locking index (PLI) and the n:m phase synchronization index (PSI) have been determined. Phase-locking within the frequency ranges 1 -1.5 Hz and 3.5 - 4.5 Hz, and synchronization between both frequency ranges exists. These phase characteristics are significant 2 sec after burst onset and are associated with the maximum-values of the QPC(1- 1.5 Hz double left right arrow 3.5 - 4.5 Hz) which demonstrates that a specific neuronal coordination between the dynamics of phases and of amplitude-frequency dependencies must be underlying.

Topographic mapping of rapid transitions in EEG multiple frequencies: EEG frequency domain of operational synchrony	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Frequency domain; Multiple brain oscillations; Short-term spectral patterns; Functional synchrony and connectivity; Metastability and brain operations	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE; ALPHA; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; THETA	This paper describes for the first time the phenomenon of spatio-temporal mapping of interchannel temporal coincidences of rapid transition processes (RTPs) in multiple EEG frequencies. It is suggested that RTPs in multiple EEG frequencies found in different EEG channels could reflect the process of switching between brain operations performed by different neuronal assemblies. Systematic non-random temporal coincidences among RTPs found in those EEG channels could reflect functional (operational) synchrony. However, until now there have been no studies examining the existence of systematic RTPs synchronization among different EEG channels in a frequency domain. Therefore functional synchrony based on precise (point to point) temporal coincidence of RTPs found in different EEG channels and comparison with surrogate data were estimated. Findings of the present study demonstrated for the first time that non-random temporal coincidence of RTPs in EEG multiple frequencies exist for both closed and open eyes conditions. Each of the states had its own distinguished peculiarities. Similarity of the main peculiarities of operational synchrony found in EEG frequency domain (the present study) with EEG amplitude and phase domains (previous studies) permitted us to conclude that operational synchrony is a universal phenomenon in brain activity. Therefore, patterns of interaction between the cortical areas, which are usually calculated with classical cross-correlation and coherence analysis, may be complemented with operational synchrony.

The objective of this study was to identify the ideal resection margin in neocortical epilepsy guided by subdural electrodes. For this purpose, we investigated the relationship between the extent of resection guided by subdural electrodes and the outcome of epilepsy surgery. Methods: Intracranial EEG studies were analyzed in 177 consecutive patients who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery. We reviewed various intracranial EEG findings and resection extent. We analyzed the relationships between the surgical outcomes and intracranial EEG factors: the frequency, morphology, and distribution of ictal-onset discharges, the propagation speed, and the time lag between clinical and intracranial ictal onset. We also investigated whether the extent of resection, including the area showing ictal rhythm and various interictal abnormalities-such as frequent interictal spikes, pathologic delta waves, and paroxysmal fast activity-influenced the surgical outcome. Results: Seventy-five patients (42%) were seizure free. A seizure-free outcome was significantly associated with a resection that included the area showing ictal spreading rhythm during the first 3 s or included all the electrodes showing pathologic delta waves or frequent interictal spikes. However, subgroup analysis revealed that the extent of resection did not affect the surgical outcome in lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Conclusions: The extent of resection is closely associated with surgical outcome, especially in extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Resection that includes the area with total pathologic delta waves and frequent interictal spikes predicts a good surgical outcome.

A role for rhythmic shifts in the level of wakefulness has been suggested, but their existence has never been proven. In this study we investigated the existence of an oscillation in EEG activity during PB in these patients and assessed its relationship with the ventilatory oscillation. EEG activity was measured by the fractal dimension (FD) and by a spectral technique (weighted mean frequency, WMF) in 17 stable HF patients (mean age +/- SD: 57 +/- 10 yrs, NYHA class: 2.6 +/- 0.4, LVEF: 24 +/- 6%), with sustained PB during supine rest. The relationship between minute ventilation (MV) signal and FD and WMF was assessed by coherence analysis. Most patients (10/17) showed a well defined oscillation in FD and WMF at the frequency of PB closely linked (coherence > 0.7) with the oscillation of MV. In the remaining patients, neither FD nor WMF showed a clear oscillatory pattern synchronous with MV. Overall, the two EEG-derived parameters showed the same coherence with the ventilatory oscillation (mean coherence +/- SD: 0.65 +/- 0.25 vs 0.66 +/- 0.23, for FD and WMF respectively, p = 0.44). Our results provide evidence that during PB in HF patients, EEG activity often, but not always, fluctuates synchronously with the ventilatory oscillation. These fluctuations can be effectively detected by the fractal dimension, but classical spectral methods provide substantially the same information. Other mechanisms, particularly chemical instability in the respiratory control system, are likely to play a role in the genesis of PB.

Cognitive neurocomputation with consciousness is accompanied by 30- to 90-Hz gamma synchrony electroencephalography (EEG), and non-conscious neurocomputation is not. Gamma synchrony EEG derives largely from neuronal groups linked by dendritic-dendritic gap junctions, forming transient syncytia ("dendritic webs") in input/integration layers oriented sideways to axonal-dendritic neurocomputational flow. As gap junctions open and close, a gamma-synchronized dendritic web can rapidly change topology and move through the brain as a spatiotemporal envelope performing collective integration and volitional choices correlating with consciousness. The "conscious pilot" is a metaphorical description for a mobile gamma-synchronized dendritic web as vehicle for a conscious agent/pilot which experiences and assumes control of otherwise non-conscious auto-pilot neurocomputation.

Differentiating essential tremor patients from healthy subjects using time-frequency analysis	ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL SIGNALS AND IMAGES	Biosignal-Brno		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International EURASIP Conference (BIOSIGNAL)	JUN, 2010	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Biomed Engn, European Assoc Speech, Signal & Image Proc (EURASIP), Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMB), Nikon Spol, GMC Co				As to the biological basis, it has remained unclear whether the basic and first "harmonic" frequencies of essential tremor are indeed simply coupled or distinct oscillations. The estimation of dynamics over time in coherent signals from brain and muscles explains two important aspects of these two oscillations. Firstly, at different time intervals both these frequencies are connected to the periphery. Secondly, the dynamics intuitively can indicate whether both these frequencies have a role to play in the tremor generation or voluntary movement in healthy subjects. In this study, the dynamical coherence was estimated using the multitaper method for EEG and EMG data from 5 essential tremor patients and 5 healthy subjects. The results indicate that both frequencies have different dynamics over time. However, the correlation between these two oscillations for essential tremor patients are negative which means that they have distinct dynamics over time, in contrast to the healthy subjects were the correlation was positive. Hence, it supports the hypothesis that they are distinct oscillations in the case of essential tremor patients and simple harmonics in the case of healthy subjects.

Analysis of Coherence in EEGs of Hard-of-Hearing Teenagers	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hard-of-hearing subjects; auditory afferentation; teenagers; EEG frequency components; coherence		According to the data of analysis of coherence indices of the frequency components of background EEGs of hard-of-hearing teenagers (12 to 15 years), the latter are characterized by a greater spatial regularity of delta- and theta-range oscillations in various cerebral cortex regions, as compared with the coherence in normal-hearing teenagers of the same age. This fact can be a manifestation of profound localization of generators structures initiating this slow-wave EEG activity. No clear focus of activity was found for the alpha range of hard-of-hearing teenagers; at the same time, considerable levels of coherence of alpha oscillations were observed in spatially remote cortical zones. This feature shows that the alpha-frequency activity can also be initiated, to a considerable extent, from one source localized in subcortical structures.

Using both statistical analysis and Gaussian discriminative modelling approaches, this paper presents a pilot study of assessing the cross-correlation between EEG frequency bands and heart rate variability (HRV) in normal and sleep apnoea clinical patients. For the study we used EEG (delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta) and HRV (LFnu, HFnu and LF/HF) features from the spectral analysis. The statistical analysis in different sleep stages highlighted that in sleep apnoea patients, the EEG delta, sigma and beta bands exhibited a strong correlation with HRV features. Then the correlation between EEG frequency bands and HRV features were examined for sleep apnoea classification using univariate and multivariate Gaussian models (UGs and MGs). The MG outperformed the UG in the classification. When EEG and HRV features were combined and modelled with MG, we achieved 64% correct classification accuracy, which is 2 or 8% improvement with respect to using only EEG or ECG features. When delta and acceleration coefficients of the EEG features were incorporated, then the overall accuracy improved to 71%.

Using a combined approach we measured spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal along with electroencephalography (EEG) in eleven healthy subjects during relaxed wakefulness (eyes closed). In contrast to other studies which used the EEG frequency information to guide the functional MRI (fMRI) analysis, we opted for transient EEG events, which identify and quantify brain electric microstates as time epochs with quasi-stable field topography. We then used this microstate information as regressors for the BOLD fluctuations. Single trial EEGs were segmented with a specific module of the LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography) software package in which microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials, i.e., the related 3-dimensional distribution of cortical current density in the brain. Using the occurrence and the duration of each microstate, we modeled the hemodynamic response function (HRF) which revealed BOLD activation in all subjects. The BOLD activation patterns resembled well known resting-state networks (RSNs) such as the default mode network. Furthermore we "cross validated" the data performing a BOLD independent component analysis (ICA) and computing the correlation between each ICs and the EEG microstates across all subjects. This study shows for the first time that the information contained within EEG microstates on a millisecond timescale is able to elicit BOLD activation patterns consistent with well known RSNs, opening new avenues for multimodal imaging data processing.

Methods: We combined spontaneous EEG measurement with motor cortex TMS and recorded MEP amplitudes from abductor digiti minimi (ADM). Results: Midrange-beta oscillations over the stimulated left motor cortex were, on average, weaker before large-than small-amplitude MEPs. The phase of occipital midrange-beta oscillations was related to the MEP amplitudes. Conclusions: The present results support the view that MEP and Rolandic beta oscillation amplitudes are associated with motor cortical excitability. However, oscillations seen in EEG reflect the excitability of a large population of cortical neurons, and MEP amplitude is affected also by spinal excitability and action potential desynchronization. Thus, MEP and EEG oscillation amplitudes are not strongly correlated. In addition, even during rest, motor system excitability appears to be related to activity in occipital areas at frequency ranges associated with visuomotor processing. Significance: The ability of spontaneous oscillations and MEPs to inform us about cortical excitability is clarified. For example, it is suggested that oscillatory activity at non-motor sites might be related to motor system excitability at rest. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants were asked to identify targets based on conjunctions of three types of object features (color, size, and completeness). This procedure aimed to examine (1) the modulation of sensory responses to one or more stimulus features characterizing an object and (2) the facilitation and reduction effects associated with competing features, attended and unattended, in the same object. The selection negativity, an event-related potential measure of sensory amplification for attended features, showed a parametric increase of amplitude as a function of the number of attended features. Late oscillations in the gamma band range were also smaller for stimuli with one or more non-attended visual features but were enhanced for stimuli sharing the overall gestalt with the target. The latency of this late gamma modulation was delayed when two target features were combined, compared to one single discriminative feature. Latency analyses also showed that late bursts of induced high-frequency oscillatory activity peaked around 60 ms later than the selection negativity. Oscillatory activity reflected both selective amplification and competition between object features. These results suggest that sensory amplification of selected features is followed by integrative processing in more widespread networks. Oscillatory activity in these networks is reduced by distraction and is enhanced when attended features can be mapped to specific action. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we determine whether PWA drops were associated with changes in cortical activity as determined by EEG spectral analysis. Methods: A 20% decrease in PWA was chosen as a minimum for a drop. A total of 1085 PWA drops from 10 consecutive sleep recordings were analyzed. EEG spectral analysis was performed over 5 consecutive epochs of 5 seconds: 2 before, 1 during, and 2 after the PWA drop. EEG spectral analysis was performed over delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta frequency bands. Within each frequency band, power density was compared across the five 5-sec epochs. Presence or absence of visually scored EEG arousals were adjudicated by an investigator blinded to the PWA signal and considered associated with PWA drop if concomitant. Results: A significant increase in EEG power density in all EEG frequency bands was found during PWA drops (P < 0.001) compared to before and after drop. Even in the absence of visually scored arousals, PWA drops were associated with a significant increase in EEG power density (P < 0.001) in most frequency bands. Conclusions: Drops in PWA are associated with a significant increase in EEG power density, suggesting that these events can be used as a surrogate for changes in cortical activity during sleep.

For maximum benefits from new treatments, VaD should be diagnosed early. Electroencephalogram (EEG) give information about brain status and activity, so it is potential to use EEG-based method to improve early diagnose. In order to explore the brain activities in Vascular Dementia (VaD), S-transform, a time-frequency representation/distribution method and generalized S-transform are used to analyze EEG signals of VaD patients and normal elderly. EEG signals of VaD patients and normal elderly are collected. The results show EEG signals of VaD patients and normal elderly have different time-frequency presentation, probably reflects features of VaD.

In typical clinical situations, hair is parted or removed, and the stratum corneum is either abraded or punctured using invasive penetration devices. These steps increase preparation time, discomfort, and the risk of infection. Cross-linked sodium polyacrylate gel swelled with electrolyte was explored as a possible skin contact element for a prototype preparation-free EEG electrode. As a superabsorbent hydrogel, polyacrylate can swell with electrolyte solution to a degree far beyond typical contemporary electrode materials, delivering a strong hydrating effect to the skin surface. This hydrating power allows the material to increase the effective skin contact surface area through wetting, and noninvasively decrease or bypass the highly resistive barrier of the stratum corneum, allowing for reduced impedance and improved electrode performance. For the purposes of the tests performed in this study, the polyacrylate was prepared both as a solid elastic gel and as a flowable paste designed to penetrate dense scalp hair. The gel can hold 99.2% DI water or 91% electrolyte solution, and the water content remains high after 29 h of air exposure. The electrical impedance of the gel electrode on unprepared human forearm is significantly lower than a number of commercial ECG and EEG electrodes. This low impedance was maintained for at least 8 h (the longest time period measured). When a paste form of the electrode was applied directly onto scalp hair, the impedance was found to be lower than that measured with commercially available EEG paste applied in the same manner. Time-frequency transformation analysis of frontal lobe EEG recordings indicated comparable frequency response between the polyacrylate-based electrode on unprepared skin and the commercial EEG electrode on abraded skin. Evoked potential recordings demonstrated signal-to-noise ratios of the experimental and commercial electrodes to be effectively equivalent. These results suggest that the polyacrylate-based electrode offers a powerful option for EEG recording without scalp preparation.

Human EEG shows long-range temporal correlations of oscillation amplitude in Theta, Alpha and Beta bands across a wide age range	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Self-organized criticality; Long-range temporal correlations; Human brain development; Motor system	SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; SCALING BEHAVIOR; TIME-SERIES; CORTEX; COHERENCE; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS	Objective: Long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG amplitude fluctuations in adults reveal power-law statistics and have been interpreted within the framework of self-organized criticality (SOC). In physical systems states of self-organized criticality showing power-law statistics take time to develop. In this paper we have sought evidence for the idea that brain development tends towards SOC through examining the hypothesis that during normal human development a power law behaviour of EEG oscillations is approached with increasing chronological age. Methods: We examined EEGs from central and parietal electrodes in 36 subjects aged between 0 and 660 months during performance of a steady wrist extension task with their dominant hand and applied spectral and detrended fluctuation analysis in 36 subjects to assess long-range temporal correlations of oscillation amplitude in the Theta, Alpha and Beta frequency bands. Results: Our data indicate that at all subject ages power-law statistics dominate the records at Alpha, Beta and Theta frequencies. Small consistent effects of chronological age were detected for amplitude fluctuations at Theta and Beta frequencies. Conclusions: The data suggest that the scale-free nature of EEG LRTCs is a feature from early childhood through to maturity but that there are changes in the magnitude of these effects with age. Significance: This study is the first to have explored long-range temporal correlations over a wide range of chronological age. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The present review critically evaluates this theory based on the original data obtained in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. It is demonstrated that (1) sleep spindles and spike wave discharges are distinguished in time frequency domain. (2) EEG waveforms of sleep spindles and SWD are underlain by different synaptic processes, as determined with the aid of computational neuronal model of cortical field potentials. (3) Sleep spindles do not precede SWD. EEG analysis of SWD-precursor activity provides us with a clue to possible prediction of absence epilepsy episodes. Furthermore, by studying Granger causality and EEG coherence at the onset of SWD we gain more insight into the dynamics of the thalamocortical neuronal network associations that underlie occurrence of absence seizures. In general, spindle activity and SWD display different time frequency characteristics as measured in cortex and thalamus, they are accompanied by different neuronal processes and require different involvement of neurotransmitters. Sleep spindles and SWD are considered as autonomous EEG phenomena, and straightforward relationship between them is doubtful. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamics of electroencephalogram entropy and pitfalls of scaling detection	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; EEG	In recent studies a number of research groups have determined that human electroencephalograms (EEG) have scaling properties. In particular, a crossover between two regions with different scaling exponents has been reported. Herein we study the time evolution of diffusion entropy to elucidate the scaling of EEG time series. For a cohort of 20 awake healthy volunteers with closed eyes, we find that the diffusion entropy of EEG increments (obtained from EEG waveforms by differencing) exhibits three features: short-time growth, an alpha wave related oscillation whose amplitude gradually decays in time, and asymptotic saturation which is achieved after approximately 1 s. This analysis suggests a linear, stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Langevin equation with a quasiperiodic forcing (whose frequency and/or amplitude may vary in time) as the model for the underlying dynamics. This model captures the salient properties of EEG dynamics. In particular, both the experimental and simulated EEG time series exhibit short-time scaling which is broken by a strong periodic component, such as alpha waves. The saturation of EEG diffusion entropy precludes the existence of asymptotic scaling. We find that the crossover between two scaling regions seen in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of EEG increments does not originate from the underlying dynamics but is merely an artifact of the algorithm. This artifact is rooted in the failure of the "trend plus signal" paradigm of DFA.	[Ignaccolo, M.; West, B.

Subjects were required to perform actions with everyday objects and to maintain either a meaningful or a meaningless end posture with the object. Analysis of the EEG data focused on the beta-frequency band, as previous studies have indicated that the maintenance of a posture is reflected in stronger beta-oscillations. Time frequency analysis indicated that the execution of actions resulting in a meaningless compared to a meaningful end posture was accompanied by a stronger beta-desynchronization towards the end of the movement and a stronger subsequent beta-rebound after posture-onset. The effect in the beta-frequency band was localized to premotor, parietal and medial frontal areas and could not be attributed to differences in timing or movement complexity between meaningful and meaningless actions. Together these findings directly show that the motor system is differentially activated during the execution and maintenance of semantically correct or incorrect end postures. This suggests that semantic object knowledge is indeed represented in motor-related brain areas, organized around specific end postures associated with the use of objects.

Methods: EEG data were recorded from 17 male schizophrenia patients in a stable phase of illness and 17 healthy controls. Results: As compared with controls, patients displayed smaller N200 amplitudes and less evoked theta for correct hit trials; and smaller N200 and P300 amplitudes and less evoked delta and theta for correct reject trials. Effect sizes were largest for evoked delta. Source localisation revealed reduced activation in schizophrenia patients during the N200 and P300 time windows in anterior and posterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus and precuneus. Evoked delta and theta oscillations were significantly correlated with the variability of reaction times and the performance level statistic d-prime. Conclusions: The results demonstrate impairment of frontal and parietal brain areas involved in response control in schizophrenia. They also suggest that the timing of oscillations in patients is less precise leading to smaller evoked amplitudes and more variable reaction times. Significance: These findings add to the evidence that abnormal EEG oscillations contribute to impaired behavioural control in schizophrenia.

This study examines this question in a group of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAAs). Methods: EEGs were recorded on 48 LTAAs and 48 age and gender-matched nonalcoholic controls (NACs) during the performance of a 3-condition visual target detection task. The event-related data were analyzed to extract ERP amplitude measures and total and evoked ERO power measures. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance to determine the contributions of ERO versus ERP measures to discriminate between the LTAA versus NAC groups. Results: The LTAA group showed significantly lower evoked delta ERO power and total delta and theta ERO power compared to the control group. The evoked and total ERO power measures provide an alternative (but not more powerful) representation of the group difference than does P3b amplitude. There was a weak suggestion that nonphase-locked theta ERO power (which contributes to total ERO power) might provide independent discriminatory information. Conclusions: Reduced evoked ERO power in the response to target stimuli provided an alternative and comparable representation of the reduced P3b amplitude in LTAA. This is not surprising as the evoked ERO power measures are derived from time-frequency representations of the ERP waveform. Induced theta oscillations might provide independent discriminatory information beyond ERP amplitude measures, but separate analysis of the event-related nonphase-locked activity is required to investigate this further.

Identifying robust and sensitive frequency bands for interrogating neural oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 7.5-9.5 HZ CHANGES; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; EEG-ALPHA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE; AFFECTIVE RESPONSES	Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in using neural oscillations to characterize the mechanisms supporting cognition and emotion. Oftentimes, oscillatory activity is indexed by mean power density in predefined frequency bands. Some investigators use broad bands originally defined by prominent surface features of the spectrum. Others rely on narrower bands originally defined by spectral factor analysis (SPA). Presently, the robustness and sensitivity of these competing band definitions remains unclear. Here, a Monte Carlo-based SPA strategy was used to decompose the tonic ("resting" or "spontaneous") electroencephalogram (EEG) into five bands: delta (1-5 Hz), alpha-low (6-9 Hz), alpha-high ( 10-11 Hz), beta (12-19 Hz), and gamma (>21 Hz). This pattern was consistent across SPA methods, artifact correction/rejection procedures, scalp regions, and samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that SFA failed to deliver enhanced sensitivity: narrow alpha sub-bands proved no more sensitive than the classical broadband to individual differences in temperament or mean differences in task-induced activation. Other analyses suggested that residual ocular and muscular artifact was the dominant source of activity during quiescence in the delta and gamma bands. This was observed following threshold-based artifact rejection or independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction, indicating that such procedures do not necessarily confer adequate protection. Collectively, these findings highlight the limitations of several commonly used EEG procedures and underscore the necessity of routinely performing exploratory data analyses, particularly data visualization, prior to hypothesis testing. They also suggest the potential benefits of using techniques other than SFA for interrogating high-dimensional EEG datasets in the frequency or time-frequency (event-related spectral perturbation, event-related synchronization/desynchronization) domains.

Approximate entropy (ApEn), as a complexity-based method appears to have potential application to physiological and clinical time-series data. Therefore, we present a ApEn based statistical measure for brain-death EEC analysis. Measure crossing all channels extends along the tune-coordinate of EEC signal to observe the variation of the dynamic complexity. However, it is found that high frequency noise such as electronic interference from the surrounding containing in the real-life recorded EEC lead to inconsistent ApEn result. To solve this problem, in our method, a. processing approach of EEC signal denoising is proposed by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Thus, high frequency interference component can be discarded from the noisy period along the time-coordinate of EEC signals. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method and the accuracy of this dynamic complexity measure is well improved.

A full understanding of the mechanisms at play requires input from electrophysiological studies. Here, we discuss human and non-human primate electrophysiological data that explore the neural correlates of the default-mode network. Beyond the promising findings obtained with non-invasive approaches, emerging evidence suggests that invasive recordings in humans will be crucial in order to elucidate the neural correlates of the brain's default-mode function. In particular, we contend that stereotactic-electroencephalography, which consists of implanting multiple depth electrodes for pre-surgical evaluation in drug-resistant epilepsy, is particularly suited for this endeavor. We support this view by providing rare data from depth recordings in human posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex that show transient neural deactivation during task-engagement.

The time course of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) changes in absence seizures in relation to EEG and behavior is not known. We acquired simultaneous EEG-fMRI in 88 typical childhood absence seizures from nine pediatric patients. We investigated behavior concurrently using a continuous performance task or simpler repetitive tapping task. EEG time-frequency analysis revealed abrupt onset and end of 3-4 Hz spike-wave discharges with a mean duration of 6.6 s. Behavioral analysis also showed rapid onset and end of deficits associated with electrographic seizure start and end. In contrast, we observed small early fMRI increases in the orbital/medial frontal and medial/lateral parietal cortex >5 s before seizure onset, followed by profound fMRI decreases continuing >20 s after seizure end. This time course differed markedly from the hemodynamic response function (HRF) model used in conventional fMRI analysis, consisting of large increases beginning after electrical event onset, followed by small fMRI decreases. Other regions, such as the lateral frontal cortex, showed more balanced fMRI increases followed by approximately equal decreases. The thalamus showed delayed increases after seizure onset followed by small decreases, most closely resembling the HRF model. These findings reveal a complex and long-lasting sequence of fMRI changes in absence seizures, which are not detectable by conventional HRF modeling in many regions. These results may be important mechanistically for seizure initiation and termination and may also contribute to changes in EEG and behavior.

Methods: Large-scale correlation of intracranial EEG was assessed by the total correlation strength (TCS), a measure derived from the eigenvalue spectra of zero-lag correlation matrices computed in a time-resolved manner by using a moving window approach. The relative change of total correlation strength (Delta(j)) resulting from leaving out EEG channel j ("leave-one-out approach") was used to quantify the contribution of local neuronal activity to large-scale EEG correlation. Results: 19 seizures of 3 patients were analyzed. On average, TCS increased significantly from the pre-ictal to the ictal, and from the ictal to the postictal state. In the pre-ictal state, Delta(j) was significantly more negative when EEG channels that recorded the electrical activity of brain tissue considered to be epileptogenic were left out; the identification of the epileptogenic area, that was subsequently surgically removed in two patients, was based on visual analysis. The spatio-temporal pattern of Delta(j) dramatically changed at seizure onsets and endings, revealing qualitative similarities between the seizures of different patients. Discussion: The evolution of large-scale EEG correlation in the high-frequency range is qualitatively similar to the one previously described for the low-frequency range. Because the two patients who underwent surgery became seizure free, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that epileptogenic brain tissue may be characterized by its relatively increased contribution to pre-ictal large-scale correlation.

Currently the only effective treatment is surgery (hemispherectomy). The objective of our study is to detect the exact epileptogenic focus through the analysis of multimodal noninvasive and innocuous functional neuroimaging. The subject is a 5-year-old female patient with Rasmussen encephalopathy. Continuous and simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) was recorded. The sources of background and paroxysmal activity of EEG were computed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Image analysis (SPM: statistic parametric mapping) was obtained for the areas where statistically significant differences in the fMRI BOLD response were computed, and the results from both techniques were compared. The main source of paroxysmal activity by EEG analysis was found in the anterolateral left hemisphere, with a significant increase in absolute and relative energies of slow frequency bands (theta-delta): Z >= 3. The fMRI BOLD signal (basal vs. paroxysmal activity) was significantly different in the same region (t-test >= 2.39). The generators of propagated paroxysmal activity were found in similar areas for both techniques. In conclusion, simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording allows the analysis of two harmless functional neuroimaging techniques separately and together in the same time period. In our case, it allowed the accurate delineation of epileptogenic foci and areas of spread with high spatiotemporal resolution, which is crucial for epilepsy surgery.	[Cuspineda Bravo, E.

METHODS: EEG was continuously monitored in nine newborn piglets exposed to a severe hypoxic period. Power spectra in five frequency bands were calculated using Fourier transformation. Spectral edge frequency 90 (SEF90) was defined as the frequency below which 90% of the power in the EEG was located. The piglets were divided into two groups; Group 1 represented piglets with some EEG recovery and Group 2 represented piglets without any EEG recovery. RESULTS: The recovery of the EEG in Group 1 had the same time course in all frequency bands. SEF90 indicates recovery earlier than the value of total power. But SEF90 also signals activity in the EEGs that were almost completely suppressed. When SEF90 was calculated during periods of periodic EEG activity during the very early phase of recovery, the values fell within the same range as during the control period. CONCLUSION: Spectral analysis of continuous EEG in newborn piglets exposed to very severe hypoxia showed that no specific frequency band of the EEG preceded the other ones during recovery. The results of the SEF90 measure, demonstrates the need for critical analysis of the raw EEG before any reliable estimation of cerebral function can be made.

In this study, we investigate the representation, analysis and classification of the EEG data recorded from four subjects during motor imagery. Four classes of imagery are recorded: left hand, right hand, the tongue and one foot, with 40 trials each. Knowing the locations of the electrodes and the brain regions where the activation related with this four motor imagery tasks occurs, we apply the time-frequency analysis for the corresponding EEG signals. For separating the source signals, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on JADE algorithm is applied. Then we represent the extracted components with the time-frequency analysis, using the spectrogram and the wavelet transform. Finally, we compare the results obtained for these methods with that obtained from the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP), with the EEGLAB application, to identify the Event Related Synchronization/Desynchronization (ERS/ERD) of the miu band when the imagination of movement starts.

We report a data-driven approach to image spatio-temporal features of neural oscillatory activity and event-related activity from continuously recorded EEG and fMRI signals. Methods: This approach starts with using the independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose the spatio-temporal EEG data into a linear combination of scalp potential maps and time courses. The time course of each independent component (IC) is used to construct a regressor to fit the fMRI time series. The resultant fMRI map then feeds back as a spatial constraint to the estimation of the source distribution underlying the corresponding IC's scalp map. The estimated source distributions multiplied by the corresponding IC time courses are summed across all ICs, giving rise to the reconstructed spatio-temporal brain activity. Functional connectivity between cortical areas can be further revealed from the imaged source signals using phase synchrony measures. We tested the method using both simulated oscillatory activity and event-related neural activity at various cortical regions. We also used this method to study the alpha-band EEG modulations in an eyes-open-eyes-closed human experiment. Results: In the simulation study, reliable reconstruction of the localization, time-frequency feature and cortical functional connection were achieved for the simulated oscillatory and event-related activities. In the experimental study, the alpha rhythmic modulation was localized mainly in the occipital visual area and the parieto-occipital sulcus. Within these regions, time-frequency analysis and phase-synchronization analysis indicated increased alpha power and alpha-band phase-synchronization in eyes-closed condition versus eyes-open condition. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the proposed approach is well suited to image continuously oscillatory activities and their functional connectivity. Significance: Such ability promises to facilitate the investigation of the long-term neural behaviors and large-scale cortical interactions involved in spontaneous brain activity and cognitive tasks.

Further, evidence suggests that states Of uncertainty, anticipation and anxious apprehension involve a high degree of SW-FW Coupling. We examined whether adults pre-selected for high and low social anxiety showed distinct patterns of frontal brain oscillatory coupling during resting baseline and the anticipation of a self-presentation task. As predicted, the high socially anxious group showed significantly greater SW-FW coupling than the low socially anxious group, in the right, but not left, frontal electrode sites while anticipating a public speaking task. Additionally, the low socially anxious group showed a decrease in delta power from baseline to speech anticipation, suggesting that they found the same task potentially rewarding. Exploratory analyses indicated no effects of delta-gamma coupling. However, EEG gamma band power increased during the speech anticipation condition, in the parietal electrode sites. Our results are discussed in the context of previous Studies on cross-frequency EEG coupling in relation to individual differences in motivation and emotion and future directions for studying the neural correlates of anxiety.

It can provide clinical diagnosis information for doctors by the effective processing of EEG data. Therefore, the analyzing methods of EEG are the key technology of the brain-computer interface. Based on wavelet transform, short-time Fourier transform, spectrum analysis and the Wigner distribution, some methods were used to analyze the EEG signals collected from drinking testers and no-drinking testers. Experimental results showed that there were relevant effects of the chronic alcohol's stimulation on the nervous system in a certain extent. In the drinking tester's EEG data, transient pulse signals appeared in the nearby of 0.6s, the energy of EEG power spectrum concentrated obviously in the low frequency. It is clear that the methods presented in this paper could extract the feature effectively.

Real-time differentiation of nonconvulsive status epilepticus from other encephalopathies using quantitative EEG analysis: A pilot study	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Nonconvulsive status epilepticus; Nonlinear dynamical measures; Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; COMPLEXITY; SEIZURES; DYNAMICS; BRAIN	Purpose: Distinguishing nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) from some nonepileptic encephalopathies is a challenging problem. In many situations, NCSE and nonepileptic encephalopathies are indistinguishable by clinical symptoms and can produce very similar electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Misdiagnosis or delay to diagnosis of NCSE may increase the rate of morbidity and mortality. Methods: We developed a fast-differentiating algorithm using quantitative EEG analysis to distinguish NCSE patients from patients with toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (TME). EEG recordings were collected from I I patients, including 6 with NCSE and 5 with TME. Three nonlinear dynamic measures were used in the proposed algorithm: the maximum short-term Lyapunov exponent (STLmax), phase of attractor (phase/angular frequency), and approximate entropy (ApEn). A further refined metric derived from STLmax and phase of attractor (the mean distance to EEG epoch samples from their centroid in the feature space) was also utilized as a criterion. Paired t tests were carried out to further clarify the separation between the EEG patterns of NCSE and TME. Results: Computational results showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm was sufficient to distinguish NCSE from TME. The results were consistent in all subjects in our study. Conclusions: The study presents evidence that the maximum short-term Lyapunov exponents (STIL-max) and phase of attractors (phase/angular frequency) can be useful in assisting clinical diagnosis of NCSE. Findings presented in this article provide a promising indication that the proposed algorithm may correctly distinguish NCSE from TME. Although the exact mechanism of this association remains unknown, the authors suggest that epileptic activity is highly associated with and can be modeled by dynamic systems.

In a paradigm requiring sustained vigilance for instance, we previously observed that higher prestimulus activity in a cingulo-insular-thalamic network facilitated subsequent perception. Here, we test our proposed interpretation that this network underpins maintenance of tonic alertness. We used simultaneous acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in the absence of any paradigm to test an ensuing hypothesis, namely that spontaneous fluctuations in this ICN's activity (as measured by fMRI) should show a positive correlation with the electrical signatures of tonic alertness (as recorded by concurrent EEG). We found in human subjects (19 male, 7 female) that activity in a network comprising dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, anterior prefrontal cortex and thalamus is positively correlated with global field power (GFP) of upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) oscillations, the most consistent electrical index of tonic alertness. Conversely, and in line with earlier findings, alpha band power was negatively correlated with activity in another ICN, the so-called dorsal attention network which is most prominently involved in selective spatial attention. We propose that the cingulo-insular-thalamic network serves maintaining tonic alertness through generalized expression of cortical alpha oscillations. Attention is mediated by activity in other systems, e. g., the dorsal attention network for space, selectively disrupts alertness-related suppression and hence manifests as local attenuation of alpha activity.

EEGs recorded at the vertex and EMGs recorded at the right tibialis anterior muscle (TA) were analyzed in 13 healthy subjects. Subjects were requested to perform: (1) isometric TA contraction, (2) imagery of the same movement without overt motor behavior, and (3) rest without MI. The results show significant EEG-EMG coherence during ME, as well as TRPI during both ME and MI tasks within a similar 14-30 Hz band. The magnitude of EEG-EMG coherence and TRPI varied among the subjects. Intersubject analysis revealed a significant correlation between EFG-EMG coherence and TRPI.

JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SYSTEM; FREQUENCY; RABBIT; CORTEX; INFORMATION; POTENTIALS; BEHAVIOR	Kay LM, Lazzara P. How global are olfactory bulb oscillations? J Neurophysiol 104: 1768-1773, 2010. First published July 21, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00478.2010. Previous studies in waking animals have shown that the frequency structure of olfactory bulb (OB) local field potential oscillations is very similar across the OB, but large low-impedance surface electrodes may have favored highly coherent events, averaging out local inhomogeneities. We tested the hypothesis that OB oscillations represent spatially homogeneous phenomena at all scales. We used pairs of concentric electrodes (200 mu m outer shaft surrounding an inner 2-3 mu m recording site) beginning on the dorsal OB at anterior and medial locations in urethane-anesthetized rats and measured local field potential responses at successive 200 mu m depths before and during odor stimulation. Within locations (outer vs. inner lead on a single probe), on the time scale of 0.5 s, coherence in all frequency bands was significant, but on larger time scales (10 s), only respiratory (1-4 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations showed prominent peaks. Across locations, coherence in all frequency bands was significantly lower for both sizes of electrodes at all depths but the most superficial 600 mu m. Near the pial surface, coherence across outer (larger) electrodes at different sites was equal to coherence across outer and inner (small) electrodes within a single site and larger than coherence across inner electrodes at different sites. Overall, the beta band showed the largest coherence across bulbar sites and electrodes. Therefore larger electrodes at the surface of the OB favor globally coherent events, and at all depths, coherence depends on the type of oscillation (beta or gamma) and duration of the analysis window.

Preparatory Activations across a Distributed Cortical Network Determine Production of Express Saccades in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUALLY GUIDED SACCADES; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; REACTION-TIMES; ATTENTION; EEG; MONKEY; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENTS	Reaction time variability across trials to identical stimuli may arise from both ongoing and transient neural processes occurring before trial onset. These processes were examined with dense-array EEG as humans completed saccades in a "gap" paradigm known to elicit bimodal variability in response times, including separate populations of "express" and regular reaction time saccades. Results indicated that express reaction time trials could be differentiated from regular reaction time trials by (1) pretrial phase synchrony of occipital cortex oscillations in the 8-9 Hz (low alpha) frequency range (lower phase synchrony preceding express trials), (2) subsequent mid-and late-gap period cortical activities across a distributed occipital-parietal network (stronger activations preceding express trials), and (3) posttarget parietal activations locked to response generation (weaker preceding express trials). A post hoc path analysis suggested that the observed cortical activations leading to express saccades are best understood as an interdependent chain of events that affect express saccade production. These results highlight the importance of a distributed posterior cortical network, particularly in right hemisphere, that prepares the saccade system for rapid responding.

A study on the EEG phase reset analysis by an inverse transform method	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 25, PT 4: IMAGE PROCESSING, BIOSIGNAL PROCESSING, MODELLING AND SIMULATION, BIOMECHANICS	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Congress of the IUPESM/World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	SEP 07-12, 2009	Munich, GERMANY	IUPESM, Int Org Med Phys (IOMP)		EEG phase reset; auditory attention; inverse transform	OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	We propose a signal processing tool for evaluating the electroencephalogram (EEG) phase reset due to auditory attention by utilizing an inverse analysis of the instantaneous phase for the very first time. EEGs were acquired through an auditory attention experiments with the highest entropy stimulation paradigm. We examined single sweeps of auditory late response (ALR) with the complex continuous wavelet transform. The phase in the frequency band that corresponds to auditory attention was reset to the mean phase of the averaged EEG. Then the inverse transform was applied to reconstruct the phase-modified signal. We found a significant enhancement of the N100 wave in the reconstructed signal. Analysis of the phase noise shows the effects of phase jittering on the generation of the N100 wave implying that a preferred phase is needed to generate the event related potential (ERP). Furthermore, by resetting the phase only at the theta border of no attention data to the mean phase of attention data yields a result that resembles the attention data. These results show direct connections between EEGs and ERPs and thus reinforce studies on the importance of the EEG phase reset in the ERP generation.

Classification of Sleep Stages Using Multi-wavelet Time Frequency Entropy and LDA	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep stage scoring; multi-wavelets; time frequency entropy; linear discriminant analysis	NEURAL-NETWORK	Background: The process of automatic sleep stage scoring consists of two major parts: feature extraction and classification. Features are normally extracted from the polysomnographic recordings, mainly electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. The EEG is considered a non-stationary signal which increases the complexity of the detection of different waves in it. Objectives: This work presents a new technique for automatic sleep stage scoring based on employing continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using different mother wavelets to detect different waves embedded in the EEG signal. Methods: The use of different mother wavelets increases the ability to detect waves in the EEG signal. The extracted features were formed based on CWT time frequency entropy using three mother wavelets, and the classification was performed using the linear discriminant analysis. Thirty-two data sets from the MIT-BIH database were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results: Features of a single EEG signal were extracted successfully based on the time frequency entropy using the continuous wavelet transform with three mother wavelets. The proposed method has shown to outperform the classification based on a CWT using a single mother wavelet. The accuracy was found to be 0.84, while the kappa coefficient was 0.78. Conclusions: This work has shown that wavelet time frequency entropy provides a powerful tool for feature extraction for the non-stationary EEG signal; the accuracy of the classification procedure improved when using multiple wavelets compared to the use of single wavelet time frequency entropy.

A device can possibly be designed for responsive brain stimulation of the epileptogenic focus for seizure control but optimal seizure detection patterns and stimulus parameters are not yet determined. To explore the possibility of identifying a signature prior to the seizure, we studied the dynamic evolution of frequency from electroencephalography (EEG) of three patients with partial epilepsy using the method of frequency flow. We found that prior to seizure, the frequency flow dynamics exhibit a buildup of 5-12 Hz activity which remains high during the initial stage of the seizure with a characteristic time constant and may be used for seizure detection and/or anticipation. We conclude that dynamics of frequency flow in the 5-12 Hz range can be a potential marker for the detection and/or the anticipation of the seizure in temporal lobe epilepsy.

Design: Sleep EEG was recorded when children were 9/10 years old and 1 to 3 years later after sleeping at home on a fixed schedule for at least one week. Setting: A 4-bed sleep laboratory. Participants: Fourteen (5 girls) healthy children ages 9/10 (mean = 10.13, SD = +/- 0.51) years at initial and 11 to 13 (mean = 12.28, SD = +/- 0.62) years at follow-up. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: All-night polysomnography was performed at each assessment and sleep stages were scored with Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. Slow wave sleep minutes decreased from the initial to the follow-up session by 29%, while minutes of stage 2 increased by 17%. NREM and REM sleep EEG spectra from two central and two occipital leads were examined for developmental changes. All-night analyses showed a significant decrease of EEG power from the initial to follow-up session across a range of frequencies during NREM and REM sleep. This decline occurred across leads and states in the delta/theta bands (3.8 - 7 Hz). Time-frequency analyses indicated that this effect was consistent across the night. The decline in power with age was most pronounced in the left central and right occipital leads. The frequency of greatest power in the sigma band (11 - 16 Hz) was significantly higher at follow-up. Conclusions: This longitudinal analysis highlights asymmetrical frequency-specific declines in sleep EEG spectral power with early adolescent maturation, which may reflect early signs of the cortical synaptic pruning in the healthy adolescent.

This requires reliable sleep stage scoring programs. Present solutions suffer, however, from the lack of flexible adaptation to experimental conditions and unreliable selection of stage-discriminating variables. EEG was recorded in freely moving C57BL/6 mice and different sets of frequency variables were used for analysis. Parameters included conventional power spectral density functions as well as period-amplitude analysis. Manual staging was compared with the performance of two different supervised classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Classification Tree. Gamma activity was particularly high during REM (rapid eye movements) sleep and waking. Four out of 73 variables were most effective for sleep wake stage separation: amplitudes of upper gamma-, delta- and upper theta-frequency bands and neck muscle EMG. Using small sets of training data, LDA produced better results than Classification Tree or a conventional threshold formula. Changing epoch duration (4 to 10 s) had only minor effects on performance with 8 to 10 s yielding the best results. Gamma and upper theta activity during REM sleep is particularly useful for sleep wake stage separation. Linear discriminant analysis performs best in supervised automatic staging procedures. Reliable semiautomatic sleep scoring with LDA substantially reduces analysis time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most studies in this field focus on exploring the relationships between fMRI signals and the power spectrum at some specific frequency bands (alpha, beta, etc.). On the other hand, brain mapping of EEG signals (e.g., interictal spikes in epileptic patients) usually assumes an haemodynamic response function for a parametric analysis applying the GLM, as a rough approximation. The integration of the information provided by the high spatial resolution of MR images and the high temporal resolution of EEG may be improved by referencing them by transfer functions, which allows the identification of neural driven areas without strong assumptions about haemodynamic response shapes or brain haemodynamic's homogeneity. The difference on sampling rate is the first obstacle for a full integration of EEG and fMRI information. Moreover, a parametric specification of a function representing the commonalities of both signals is not established. In this study, we introduce a new data-driven method for estimating the transfer function from EEG signal to fMRI signal at EEG sampling rate. This approach avoids EEG subsampling to fMRI time resolution and naturally provides a test for EEG predictive power over BOLD signal fluctuations, in a well-established statistical framework. We illustrate this concept in resting state (eyes closed) and visual simultaneous fMRI-EEG experiments. The results point out that it is possible to predict the BOLD fluctuations in occipital cortex by using EEG measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Measuring phase-amplitude coupling between neuronal oscillations of different frequencies. J Neurophysiol 104: 1195-1210, 2010. First published May 12, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00106.2010. Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler distance-a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions-and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.

To investigate whether non-phase-locked neural oscillations engage in the self-reference effect, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults during trait judgments of the self and a familiar other The wavelet analysis was used to calculate non-phase-locked time-frequency power associated with encoding of trait adjectives referenced to the self or the familiar other at theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-27 Hz) and gamma (28-40 Hz) bands We found that, relative to other-referential traits, self-referential traits induced event-related synchronization of theta-band activity over the frontal area at 700-800 ms and of alpha-band activity over the central area at 400-600 ms In contrast, event-related desynchronization associated with self-referential traits was observed in beta-band activity over the central-parietal area at 700-800 ms and in gamma-band activity over the fronto-central area at 500-600 ms Moreover, valence of traits referenced to the self and self-relevance of traits respectively led to modulations of theta/alpha- and beta/gamma-band activity Finally, event-related synchronization of frontal theta-band activity at 700-800 ms positively correlated with the self-reference effect observed during memory retrieval Our results indicate that non-phase-locked neural activity is involved in self-reflexive thinking In addition, low and high-frequency neural oscillations play different roles in emotional and cognitive aspects of self-reference processing (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of oscillatory changes during Sahaj Samadhi meditation (a concentrative form of meditation that is part of Sudarshan Kriya yoga). EEG was recorded during Sudarshan Kriya yoga meditation for meditators and relaxation for controls. Spectral and coherence analysis was performed for the whole duration as well as specific blocks extracted from the initial, middle, and end portions of Sahaj Samadhi meditation or relaxation. The generation of distinct meditative states of consciousness was marked by distinct changes in spectral powers especially enhanced theta band activity during deep meditation in the frontal areas. Meditators also exhibited increased theta coherence compared to controls. The emergence of the slow frequency waves in the attention-related frontal regions provides strong support to the existing claims of frontal theta in producing meditative states along with trait effects in attentional processing. Interestingly, increased frontal theta activity was accompanied reduced activity (deactivation) in parietal-occipital areas signifying reduction in processing associated with self, space and, time.

This model includes one sub-population of pyramidal cells and one sub-population of interneurons targeting the perisomatic region of pyramidal cells where fast GABAergic currents are mediated. We identified some conditions for which the model can reproduce the features of high-frequency, chirp-like (from similar to 100 to similar to 70 Hz) signatures observed in real depth-EEG signals recorded in epileptic patients at seizure onset ("fast onset activity"). These conditions included appropriate alterations in (i) the strengths of GABAergic and glutamatergic connections, and (ii) the amplitude of average EPSPs/IPSPs. Results revealed that a subtle balance between excitatory and inhibitory feedbacks is required in the model for reproducing a 'realistic' fast activity, i.e., showing a reduction of frequency with a simultaneous increase in amplitude, as actually observed in epileptogenic cerebral cortex. Results also demonstrated that the number of scenarios (variation, in time, of model parameters) leading to chirp-like signatures was rather limited. First, to produce high-frequency output signals, the model should operate in a "resonance" region, at the frontier between a stable and an unstable region. Second both EPSP and IPSP amplitudes should decrease with time in order to obey the frequency/amplitude constraint. These scenarios obtained through a mathematical analysis of the model show how some alteration in the structure of neural networks can lead to dysfunction. They also provide insights into potentially important mechanisms for high-frequency epileptic activity generation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cortical inhibition (CI) is measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electromyography (EMG) through long-interval CI (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) paradigms. Recently, we illustrated that LICI can be measured from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) through combined TMS with electroencephalography (EEG). We further demonstrated that LICI had different effects on cortical oscillations in the DLPFC compared with motor cortex. The purpose of this study was to establish the validity and reliability of TMS-EEG indices of CI and to replicate our previous findings in an extended sample. The validity of TMS-EEG was examined by evaluating its relationship to standard EMG measures of LICI and the CSP in the left motor cortex in 36 and 16 subjects, respectively. Test-retest reliability was examined in 14 subjects who returned for a repeat session within 7 days of the first session. LICI was applied to the left DLPFC in 30 subjects to compare LICI in the DLPFC with that in the motor cortex. In the motor cortex, EEG measures of LICI correlated with EMG measures of LICI and CSP. All indices of LICI showed high test-retest reliability in motor cortex and DLPFC. Gamma and beta oscillations were significantly inhibited in the DLPFC but not in the motor cortex, confirming previous findings in an extended sample. These findings demonstrate that indexing LICI through TMS combined with EEG is a valid and reliable method to evaluate inhibition from motor and prefrontal regions.

J	Rose, M; Haider, H; Buchel, C				Rose, Michael; Haider, Hilde; Buechel, Christian			The Emergence of Explicit Memory during Learning	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; learning; memory	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AWARENESS; STRIATUM; CONSCIOUSNESS; PREDICTIONS; SEQUENCES; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; REWARD; ROLES	In incidental learning situations, contingencies are extracted from the environment without the intention to learn and can change behavior without awareness for the extracted regularity. The development of explicit access to the learned regularity is an important learning mechanism that is rarely examined. With a series of behavioral, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we were able to show that the emergence of awareness for a hidden regularity is accompanied by an increase in neural activity and in high-frequency coupling between distant brain areas as observed with a time-frequency resolved EEG analysis. More importantly, the increase in neural coupling was observed before awareness for the learned material was established behaviorally. In addition, coupling increases were paralleled by an fMRI-signal increase in the ventral striatum and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex directly preceding the emergence of awareness. The involvement of this system, which has already been linked to the processing of predictions and prediction errors, indicates the relevance of a reinforcement signal to generate awareness for the learned contingencies. Thus, our data provide direct evidence for the necessity of large-scale coupling and the evaluation of a predictive stimulus value as the basis for a transition from implicit to explicit memory.

To evaluate this analytic approach as an aid to elucidating the pathophysiologic mechanisms in schizophrenia, we examined MSE in EEG activity in drug-naive schizophrenia subjects pre- and post-treatment with antipsychotics in comparison with traditional EEG analysis. We recorded eyes-closed resting-state EEG from frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in drug-naive 22 schizophrenia and 24 age-matched healthy control subjects. Fifteen patients were re-evaluated within 2-8 weeks after the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. For each participant, MSE was calculated on one continuous 60-s epoch for each experimental session. Schizophrenia subjects showed significantly higher complexity at higher time scales (lower frequencies) than did healthy controls in fronto-centro-temporal, but not in parieto-occipital regions. Post-treatment, this higher complexity decreased to healthy control subject levels selectively in fronto-central regions, while the increased complexity in temporal sites remained higher. Comparative power analysis identified spectral slowing in frontal regions in pre-treatment schizophrenia subjects, consistent with previous findings, whereas no antipsychotic treatment effect was observed. In summary, multiscale entropy measures identified abnormal dynamical EEG signal complexity in anterior brain areas in schizophrenia that normalized selectively in fronto-central areas with antipsychotic treatment. These findings show that entropy-based analytic methods may serve as a novel approach for characterizing and understanding abnormal cortical dynamics in schizophrenia and elucidating the therapeutic mechanisms of antipsychotics.

Schizophrenia, in particular, has been described as a 'disconnection syndrome', but similar principles are likely to apply to depression and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). All these diseases are associated with impaired co-ordination of neural population activity, which manifests as abnormal EEG (electroencephalogram) and LFP (local field potential) oscillations both within and across subcortical and cortical brain regions. Importantly, it is increasingly possible to link oscillations and interactions at distinct frequencies to the physiology and/or pathology of distinct classes of neurons and interneurons Such analyses increasingly implicate abnormal levels, timing or modulation of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic inhibition in brain disease. The present review discusses the evidence suggesting that dysfunction of a particular class of interneurons, marked by their expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, could contribute to the broad range of neurophysiological and behavioural symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia.

However, using such stimuli in the experimental setting is disadvantageous as they are too brief to faithfully simulate clinical pain. We aimed at utilizing continuous EEG to investigate the properties of peak alpha frequency (PAF) as an objective cortical measure associated with subjective perception of tonic pain. Five minute long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with peak frequencies of alpha power-curves derived from central, temporal and frontal electrodes. NPSs and PAFs remained stable throughout the recording conditions (RM-ANOVAs; Ps>0.51). In the noxious condition, PAFs obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs (Ps<0.001). Moreover, resting-state PAPs recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps<0.01). These psychophysical-neurophysiological relations attest to the properties of PAF as a novel cortical objective measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Moreover, resting-state PAFs might hold inherent pain modulation attributes, possibly enabling the prediction of individual responsiveness to prolonged pain. The relevance of PAF to the neural processing of tonic pain may indicate its potential to advance pain research as well as clinical pain characterization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, for the first time, the long-distance intra-hemispheric event related coherence (auditory oddball paradigm) and evoked coherence (simple sound) were compared in order to evaluate the effects of cognitive tasks on the long-distance coherences. Seventeen healthy subjects (8 female, 9 male) were included in the study. The coherence was analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency ranges for (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-7, F-4-T-8, F-3-O-1,O- F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The coherence to target responses were higher than the non-target and simple auditory response coherence. This difference is significant for the delta coherence for both hemispheres and for theta coherences over the left hemisphere. The highest coherences were recorded at fronto-temporal locations for all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha). Furthermore, fronto-parietal coherences were higher than the fronto-occipital coherences for all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha).These results show that the fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal connections are most relevant for the identification of the target signal. This analysis open the way for a new interpretation of dynamic localization results during cognitive tasks.

J	Singh, AK; Phillips, S				Singh, Archana K.; Phillips, Steven			Hierarchical control of false discovery rate for phase locking measures of EEG synchrony	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Hierarchical false discover rate; Phase locking values; Synchrony; Electroencephalography; Visual search	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TESTS	Computing phase-locking values (PLVs) between EEG signals is becoming a popular measure for quantifying functional connectivity, because it affords a more detailed picture of the synchrony relationships between channels at different times and frequencies. However, the accompanying increase in data dimensionality incurs a serious multiple testing problem for determining PLV significance. Standard methods for controlling Type I error, which treat all hypotheses as belonging to a single family, can fail to detect any significant discoveries. Instead, we propose a novel application of a hierarchical FDR method, which subsumes multiple families, for detecting significant PLV effects. For simulations and experimental data. we show that the proposed hierarchical FDR method is most powerful. This method revealed significant synchrony effects in the expected regions at an acceptable error rate of 5%, where other methods, including standard FDR correction failed to reveal any significant effects.

Six patients, who underwent presurgical workup for epilepsy surgery with preoperative simultaneous MEG and subdural iEEG recordings, were investigated. HGOs in iEEG were detected automatically and served as triggers for averaging and localization of simultaneous MEG data. iEEG-HGOs were detected in all patients and MEG-HGOs in five patients. HGOs were highly associated with epileptic networks and correctly identified seizure-onset zones in five (MEG) and six patients (iEEG). Minimum-norm source analysis of MEG data yielded concordant localizations. Noninvasive analysis of HGOs may allow investigation of epileptic networks independent of spikes and seizures. Determination of sensitivity and specificity, as well as development of MEG-HGO analysis without the need of iEEG should be addressed in a larger study.

Sleep onset latencies are determined by visual analysis, which is costly and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to implement and test a single automatic algorithm to detect the sleep onset in the MSLT on the basis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The designed algorithm computed the relative EEG spectral powers in the occipital area and detected the sleep onset corresponding to the intersection point between the lower and alpha frequencies. The algorithm performance was evaluated by comparing the sleep latencies computed automatically by the algorithm and by a sleep specialist using MSLT recordings from a total of 19 patients (95 naps). The mean difference in sleep latency between the two methods was 0.025 min and the limits of agreement were +/- 2.46 min (Bland-Altman analysis). Moreover, the intra-class correlation coefficient showed a considerable inter-rater reliability (0.90). The algorithm accurately detected the sleep onset in the MSLT. The devised algorithm can be a useful tool to support and speed up the sleep specialist's work in routine clinical MSLT assessment.

They are highly random in nature and may contain useful information about the brain state. However, it is very difficult to get useful information from these signals directly in the time domain just by observing them. They are basically non-linear and nonstationary in nature. Hence, important features can be extracted for the diagnosis of different diseases using advanced signal processing techniques. In this paper the effect of different events on the EEG signal, and different signal processing methods used to extract the hidden information from the signal are discussed in detail. Linear, Frequency domain, time - frequency and non-linear techniques like correlation dimension (CD), largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), Hurst exponent (H), different entropies, fractal dimension(FD), Higher Order Spectra (HOS), phase space plots and recurrence plots are discussed in detail using a typical normal EEG signal.

This study sought to clarify the usefulness of time-frequency analyses using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for ictal onset and propagation of ictal MEG activity in patients with neocortical epilepsy. Methods: Four ictal MEG discharges in two patients with perirolandic epilepsy and one with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) were evaluated by time-frequency analyses using STFT. Prominent oscillation bands were collected manually and the magnitudes of those specific bands were superimposed on individual 3D-magnetic resonance images. Results: SIFT showed specific rhythmic activities from alpha to beta bands at the magnetological onset in all four ictal MEG records. Those activities were located at the vicinity of interictal spike sources, as estimated by the single dipole method (SDM), and two of the four ictal rhythmic activities promptly propagated to ipsilateral or bilateral cerebral cortices. The patients with FLE and perirolandic epilepsy underwent frontal lobectomy and resection of primary motor area, respectively including the origin of high-magnitude areas of a specific band indicated by SIFT, and have been seizure free after the surgery. Conclusions: STFT for ictal MEG discharges readily demonstrated the ictal onset and propagation. These data were important for decisions on surgical procedure and extent of resection. Ictal MEG analyses using STFT could provide a powerful tool for noninvasive evaluation of ictal onset zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that BBB damage triggers seizures. We have used the BBB osmotic disruption procedure (BBBD) to examine the correlation between BBB opening, pattern of white blood cell (WBCs) entry into the brain and seizure occurrence. These findings were compared to results from resected epileptic brain tissue from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. We confirmed that a successful BBB osmotic opening (BBBD) leads to the occurrence of acute epileptiform discharges. Electroencephalography (EEG) and time-joint frequency analysis reveal EEG slowing followed by an increase in the 10-20 Hz frequency range. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled WBCs (GFP-WBCs) suspended in Evans Blue we found that, at time of BBB-induced epileptiform discharges, WBCs populated the perivascular space of a leaky BBB. Similar results were obtained at time of pilocarpine seizure. No frank WBCs extravasation in the brain parenchyma was observed. In TLE brain specimens, CD45-positive leukocytes were detected only in the vascular and perivascular spaces while albumin and IgG extravasates were parenchymal. The pattern was similar to those observed in rats. Our data suggest that neither acute-induced nor chronic seizures correlate with WBC brain parenchymal migration while albumin and IgG brain leakage is a hallmark of acute and chronic seizures.

For this aim, first, several time-frequency transforms were applied to five scalp EEG datasets in order to extract discriminant features. Regarding high number of channels and features, kernel-principal-component-analysis (KPCA) was utilized to reduce the feature size in order to decrease the complexity. Then, the projected features were fed to an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the subjects. The achieved results show that our scheme is capable of classifying normal and epileptic subjects up to 92% and 93% accuracies, respectively.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining of EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the representation of time-frequency patterns of the signal's information content by WC qualiatative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions in time-frequency spectrum during the specified task of BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns are classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). This innovative characteristic of the process justifies the feasibility of the proposed approach to other data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches in this field and on non stationary time series analysis.

Breakdown in cortical effective connectivity during midazolam-induced loss of consciousness	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						anesthesia; high-density electroencephalography; transcranial magnetic stimulation	MAGNETIC STIMULATION; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MOLECULAR TARGETS; VEGETATIVE STATE; THALAMIC NEURONS; SLEEP; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; SEDATION	By employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we recently reported that cortical effective connectivity is disrupted during early non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This is a time when subjects, if awakened, may report little or no conscious content. We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject's level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for > 300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC. Moreover, these results suggest that it might be possible to use TMS-EEG to assess consciousness during anesthesia and in pathological conditions, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.

Multimodal imaging techniques rely on the assumption of a common neuronal source for the different recorded signals. In order to maximally exploit the combination of these techniques, one needs to understand the coupling (i.e., the relation) between electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Recently, simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements have been used to investigate the relation between the two signals. Previous attempts at the analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data reported significant correlations between regional BOLD activations and modulation of both event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory EEG power, mostly in the alpha but also in other frequency bands. Beyond the correlation of the two measured brain signals, the relevant issue we address here is the ability of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. Using multivariate machine learning-based regression, we show how it is possible to predict EEG power oscillations from simultaneously acquired fMRI data during an eyes-open/eyes-closed task using either the original channels or the underlying cortically distributed sources as the relevant EEG signal for the analysis of multimodal data.

Cortical interdependence assessed from EEG signals typically exhibits increasing levels of correlation because human subjects progress from wake to deeper stages of sleep. EEG signals acquired from previously existing polysomnogram datasets were subjected to mutual information analysis to detect changes in information transmission associated with change in sleep stage and to understand how age affects the interdependence values. We observed a significant reduction in the interdependence between central EEG signals of elderly subjects in nonrapid eye movement and rapid eye movement stage sleep in comparison with middle-aged subjects (age group effect: elderly versus middle aged P < 0.001, sleep stage effect: P < 0.001, interaction effect between age group and sleep stage: P = 0.007). A narrowband analysis revealed that the reduction in mutual information was present in delta, theta, and sigma frequencies. These findings suggest that the lowered cortical interdependence in sleep of elderly subjects may indicate independently evolving dynamic neural activities at multiple cortical sites. The loss of synchronization between neural activities during sleep in the elderly may make these women more susceptible to localized disturbances that could lead to frequent arousals.

EEG microstate sequences in healthy humans at rest reveal scale-free dynamics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						critical state; microstates; resting-state networks; self-similar processes; wavelet fractal analysis	MAP SERIES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FRACTAL ANALYSIS; STATE NETWORKS; VISUAL-IMAGERY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SMALL-WORLD; COMPLEXITY; FREQUENCY; SEGMENTATION	Recent findings identified electroencephalography (EEG) microstates as the electrophysiological correlates of fMRI resting-state networks. Microstates are defined as short periods (100 ms) during which the EEG scalp topography remains quasi-stable; that is, the global topography is fixed but strength might vary and polarity invert. Microstates represent the subsecond coherent activation within global functional brain networks. Surprisingly, these rapidly changing EEG microstates correlate significantly with activity in fMRI resting-state networks after convolution with the hemodynamic response function that constitutes a strong temporal smoothing filter. We postulate here that microstate sequences should reveal scale-free, self-similar dynamics to explain this remarkable effect and thus that microstate time series show dependencies over long time ranges. To that aim, we deploy wavelet-based fractal analysis that allows determining scale-free behavior. We find strong statistical evidence that microstate sequences are scale free over six dyadic scales covering the 256-ms to 16-s range. The degree of long-range dependency is maintained when shuffling the local microstate labels but becomes indistinguishable from white noise when equalizing microstate durations, which indicates that temporal dynamics are their key characteristic. These results advance the understanding of temporal dynamics of brain-scale neuronal network models such as the global workspace model. Whereas microstates can be considered the "atoms of thoughts," the shortest constituting elements of cognition, they carry a dynamic signature that is reminiscent at characteristic timescales up to multiple seconds. The scale-free dynamics of the microstates might be the basis for the rapid reorganization and adaptation of the functional networks of the brain.

Bifurcation analysis of neural mass models: Impact of extrinsic inputs and dendritic time constants	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; FIELD-THEORY; EEG; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION	Neural mass models (NMMs) explain dynamics of neuronal populations and were designed to strike a balance between mathematical simplicity and biological plausibility. They are currently widely used as generative models for noninvasive electrophysiological brain measurements; that is, magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here, we systematically describe the oscillatory regimes which a NMM of a single cortical source with extrinsic input from other cortical and subcortical areas to each subpopulation can explain. For this purpose, we used bifurcation analysis to describe qualitative changes in system behavior in response to quantitative input changes. This approach allowed us to describe sequences of oscillatory regimes, given some specific input trajectory. We systematically classified these sequential phenomena and mapped them into parameter space. Our analysis suggests a principled scheme of how complex M/EEG phenomena can be modeled parsimoniously on two time scales: While the system displays fast oscillations, it slowly traverses phase space to another qualitatively different oscillatory regime, depending on the input dynamics. The resulting scheme is useful for applications where one needs to model an ordered sequence of switching between qualitatively different oscillatory regimes, for example, in pharmacological interventions, epilepsy, sleep, or context-induced state changes.

Cortical signals were obtained from scalp EEG signals through the high-resolution EEG technique, which relies on realistic head models and linear inverse solutions. Functional networks were estimated by computing the spectral coherence-i.e. a measure of synchronization in the frequency domain-between the time series of all the available cortical sources. To analyze those cortical networks we followed a theoretical graph approach by computing the network density as the total number of links and the node degree as the number of links of each cortical source. The major result suggest that in the Alpha2 frequency band (11-13 Hz) the cortical functional networks of the SCHZ patients present the largest differences when compared with those of a group of control (CTRL) subjects. In particular, the structure of the SCHZ network altered radically during the memory task, as the number of links that were different from the REST condition increased sensibly with respect to the CTRL network. In addition, a compensatory mechanism was found in the SCHZ patients during the correct performance of the memory task where the node degree showed a frontal asymmetry with higher activation of the left frontal lobe-i.e. higher number of connections-in the Alpha2 frequency band.

However, emission techniques used for these measurements are characterized by relatively low temporal and spatial resolutions, whereby brain activity is averaged over minutes (the time required to obtain a single acquisition). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquires images with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI can detect transient increases in activity associated with slow waves and slow and fast spindles during nonREM sleep. EEG/fMRI data show regionally specific increases in activity in relation to slow waves (brainstem, cerebellum, ventral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, parahippocampus areas) and slow (thalamus, anterior cingulate, insula) and fast spindles (additional responses in cingulate motor areas and sensorimotor contrices); some of which are involved in memory processing. These data demonstrate that nonREM sleep is not a state of brain quiescence, but a highly active state during which brain activity is consistently synchronized to slow waves and spindles in specific brain regions. These neural activity patterns have possible implications for memory processing.

Subjects' brain dynamics associated with motion sickness were measured using a 32-channel EEG system. Their degree of motion sickness was simultaneously and continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing non-stop behavioral references to the recorded EEG changes The acquired EEG signals were parsed by independent component analysis (ICA) into maximally independent processes. The decomposition enables the brain dynamics that are induced by the motion of the platform and motion sickness to be disassociated. Five MS-related brain processes with equivalent dipoles located in the left motor, the parietal. the right motor, the occipital and the occipital midline areas were consistently identified across all subjects. The parietal and motor components exhibited significant alpha power suppression in response to vestibular stimuli, while the occipital components exhibited MS-related power augmentation in mainly theta and delta bands: the occipital midline components exhibited a broadband power increase Further, time series cross-correlation analysis was employed to evaluate relationships between the spectral changes associated with different brain processes and the degree of motion sickness According to our results, it is suggested both visual and vestibular stimulations should be used to induce motion sickness in brain dynamic studies (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Particularly, the method extracts features from the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution using tracks estimated from the McAulay-Quatieri sinusoidal model. The proposed features are the length, frequency, and energy of the principal track. We evaluate the proposed scheme using several datasets and we compute sensitivity, specificity, F-score, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, and percentile bootstrap confidence to conclude that the proposed scheme generalizes well and is a suitable approach for automatic seizure detection at a moderate cost, also opening the possibility of formulating new criteria to detect, classify or analyze abnormal EEGs.

However, since EEG data are complex, it is difficult to extract them as a source of intended, significant information. In order to effectively extract EEG data, this paper employs the maximum entropy method (MEM) for frequency analyses and investigates an alpha frequency band and beta frequency band in which features are more apparent. At this time, both the alpha and beta frequency bands are divided further into several sub-bands so as to extract detailed EEG data where the loss of data is small. In addition, learning vector quantization (LVQ) is used for clustering the EEG data with features extracted. In this paper, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the EEG data of one subject and two subjects and comparing the results with other related studies. By applying the proposed method further to the EEG data of three subjects, and comparing the results with related studies, the effectiveness of the proposed method will be determined.

Evidence for gamma inhibition deficits in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia	BRAIN			English	Article						transcranial magnetic stimulation; electroencephalography; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; WORKING-MEMORY; INTERNEURON NETWORKS; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; GENE-EXPRESSION; IN-VITRO; TMS-EEG	Previous studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have deficits in cortical inhibition. Through the combination of interleaved transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we have recently reported on methods in which cortical inhibition can be measured from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a cortical region that is more closely associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, it is possible to index cortical inhibition of specific oscillatory frequencies including the gamma band (30-50 Hz) whose modulation has been related to higher order cortical processing. In this study, we show that patients with schizophrenia have significant deficits of cortical inhibition of gamma oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to healthy subjects and patients with bipolar disorder, while no deficits are demonstrated in the motor cortex. These results suggest that the lack of inhibition of gamma oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent an important frontal neurophysiological deficit, which may be responsible for the spectrum of deficits commonly found in schizophrenia.

Photosensitive epilepsy: Spectral and coherence analyses of EEG using 14 Hz intermittent photic stimulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						IGE; Photosensitivity; AR model; Spectral analysis; Coherence analysis	IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; TIME-SERIES MODELS; INDUCED SEIZURES; OSCILLATIONS; PATTERN; EMG; NEURONS	Objective: To evaluate the EEG recorded in photosensitive idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) patients at rest and during 14 Hz IPS, frequency capable of inducing photoparoxysmal responses (PPRs). Methods: Power spectrum density and coherence profiles were estimated using a block autoregressive parametric model (AR) in 28 patients and 22 controls. Results: At rest, the intra-and inter-hemispheric coherence spectra showed a significantly larger number of coherence peaks in the gamma band in patients with respect to controls. During intermittent photic stimulation (IPS), coherent gamma activity is mainly presented as IPS frequency harmonics; moreover, the patients' mean coherence values significantly increased. In six patients re-evaluated with IPS after putting on glasses with Z1 blue lens (which counteracts PPR) the spectral and coherence profiles tended to return to the resting ones. Conclusions: Patients are endowed with inherited EEG hyper-synchrony as shown by the large number of coherence peaks detectable under resting conditions, whereas IPS enhances intra-and inter-hemispheric mean coherence values in the gamma band. The persistence of alpha activity peaks during IPS in most controls but not in patients suggests that the alpha generating network plays a significant role in counteracting PPR. Significance: Both gamma and alpha EEG generators are involved in the PPR generation and in the widespread synchronisation characterising the IGE-associated photosensitivity.

A new method for detecting SSOs is presented and compared to previous canonical methods. The main result of this research is that for the first time an extensive SSO analysis is applied to clinical EEG montages, based on low-density EEG recordings. The proposed method gives positive indications about its effectiveness also for altered sleep, extending the SSO analysis to extreme cases, and thus, opening a new front for investigating pathophysiological correlates of sleep disorders.

However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG delta phase reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs presenting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG delta phase or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or delta phase alone. The model suggested also ways to improve and extend current algorithms for online prediction of spike rates from EEGs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Subjects comprised 11 patients scheduled to undergo heart surgery under extracorporeal circulation. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of propofol combined with remifentanil, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to keep an identical BIS value (target BIS value, 40-45). Raw EEG signals were collected through the BIS monitor. Approximate entropy, bicoherence and power spectrum were analyzed before and after CPB, in addition to other EEG parameters. Results: In the late hypothermic CPB period, both 95% spectral edge frequency and approximate entropy decreased, notwithstanding a lack of significant difference in BIS index. Bicoherence growths in delta-theta and alpha areas decreased simultaneously. Conclusions: In the late CPB period, although BIS value is unchanged, EEG often expresses a slow EEG rhythm accompanied by disproportional de-synchronous characteristics. Significance: CPB caused the EEG de-synchronous features, which are not quantified by the BIS algorithm. It has the possibility to increase the vulnerability of nociceptive perception.

The brain has greater exposure to mobile-phone radiation (MPR) than the rest of the body, and there are experimental findings suggesting that electromagnetic fields may modulate the activity of neural networks. The tendency towards electrical instability of the neural networks of epileptics suggests that these persons may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. In this study, we determined the effects of mobile-phone radiation on the electroencephalographic (EEG) spectra of nine epileptic patients undergoing routine video-EEG monitoring. For each of nine scalp areas and four wavebands ( alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), three spectral features were extracted from EEG segments recorded before, during, and after 20 minutes of continuous exposure to mobile-phone radiation. Statistical analyses showed associations between mobile-phone radiation and increased EEG activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma wavebands. The increase In alpha-wave power was similar to that reported for non-epileptic individuals. The increase in beta- and gamma-wave power may be related to epileptic alterations.

Neuronal activity in the human brain can be non-invasively imaged with magneto(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), but the large-scale structure of synchronized cortical networks supporting cognitive processing has remained uncharacterized. We combined simultaneous MEG and EEG (MEEG) recordings with minimum-norm-estimate-based inverse modeling to investigate the structure of oscillatory phase synchronized networks that were active during visual working memory (VWM) maintenance. Inter-areal phase-synchrony was quantified as a function of time and frequency by single-trial phase-difference estimates of cortical patches covering the entire cortical surfaces. The resulting networks were characterized with a number of network metrics that were then compared between delta/theta- (3-6 Hz), alpha- (7-13 Hz), beta- (16-25 Hz), and gamma- (30-80 Hz) frequency bands. We found several salient differences between frequency bands. Alpha- and beta-band networks were more clustered and small-world like but had smaller global efficiency than the networks in the delta/theta and gamma bands. Alpha- and beta-band networks also had truncated-power-law degree distributions and high k-core numbers. The data converge on showing that during the VWM-retention period, human cortical alpha- and beta-band networks have a memory-load dependent, scale-free small-world structure with densely connected core-like structures. These data further show that synchronized dynamic networks underlying a specific cognitive state can exhibit distinct frequency-dependent network structures that could support distinct functional roles.

However, the analysis, classification and interpretation of TMS-evoked potentials are hampered by scarce a priori knowledge about the physiological effect of TMS and by lack of an established data analysis framework. Here, we implemented a standardized, data-driven procedure to characterize the electrical response of the cerebral cortex to TMS by means of three synthetic indices: significant current density (SCD), phase-locking (PL) and significant current scattering (SCS). SCD sums up the amplitude of all significant currents induced by TMS, PL reflects the ability of TMS to reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations, while SCS measures the average distance of significantly activated sources from the site of stimulation. These indices are aimed at capturing different aspects of brain responsiveness, ranging from global cortical excitability towards global cortical connectivity. We analyzed the EEG responses to TMS of Brodmann's area 19 at increasing intensities in five healthy subjects. The spatial distribution and time course of SCID, PL and SCS revealed a reproducible profile of excitability and connectivity, characterized by a local activation threshold around a TMS-induced electric field of 50 V/m and by a selective propagation of TMS-evoked activation from occipital to ipsilateral frontal areas that reached a maximum at 70-100 ms. These general indices may be used to characterize the effects of TMS on any cortical area and to quantitatively evaluate Cortical excitability and connectivity in physiological and pathological conditions.

Superposition Model Predicts EEG Occipital Activity during Free Viewing of Natural Scenes	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED RESPONSES; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LAMBDA WAVES; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PATTERN REVERSAL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; ARTIFACTS	Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) produced by a stimulus are thought to reflect either an increase of synchronized activity or a phase realignment of ongoing oscillatory activity, with both mechanisms sharing the assumption that ERPs are independent of the current state of the brain at the time of stimulation. In natural viewing, however, visual inputs occur one after another at specific subject-paced intervals through unconstrained eye movements. We conjecture that during natural viewing, ERPs generated after each fixation are better explained by a superposition of ongoing oscillatory activity related to the processing of previous fixations, with new activity elicited by the visual input at the current fixation. We examined the electroencephalography (EEG) signals that occur in humans at the onset of each visual fixation, both while subjects freely viewed natural scenes and while they viewed a black or gray background. We found that the fixation ERPs show visual components that are absent when subjects move their eyes on a homogeneous gray or black screen. Single-trial EEG signals that comprise the ERP are predicted more accurately by a model of superposition than by either phase resetting or the addition of evoked responses and stimulus-independent noise. The superposition of ongoing oscillatory activity and the visually evoked response results in a modification of the ongoing oscillation phase. The results presented suggest that the observed EEG signals reflect changes occurring in a common neuronal substrate rather than a simple summation at the scalp of signals from independent sources.

High frequency oscillations (HFOs-ripples, 80-250 Hz; fast ripples, 250-500 Hz) are linked to seizure onset. This study investigates whether interictal HFOs are more frequent in areas with a low threshold to provoke ADs or seizures. Methods: Intracranial EEG studies were filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. HFOs were visually identified. Twenty patients underwent ES, with gradually increasing currents. Results were interpreted as agreeing or disagreeing with the intracranial study (clinical-EEG seizure onset defined the SOZ). Current thresholds provoking an AD or seizure were correlated with the rate of HFOs of each channel. Results: ES provoked a seizure in 12 and ADs in 19 patients. Sixteen patients showed an ES response inside the SOZ, and 10 had additional areas with ADs. The response was more specific for mesiotemporal than for neocortical channels. HFO rates were negatively correlated with thresholds for ES responses; especially in neocortical regions; areas with low threshold and high HFO rate were colocalized even outside the SOZ. Discussion: Areas showing epileptic HFOs colocalize with those reacting to ES. HFOs may represent a pathologic correlate of regions showing an ES response; both phenomena suggest a more widespread epileptogenicity.

To address this issue, 10 patients with four different scalp ictal patterns (ictal spikes, rhythmic activity, paroxysmal fast activity, obscured) were investigated by both HR-EEG and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Sixty-four scalp-EEG sensors and a sampling rate of 1 kHz were used to record scalp ictal patterns. Five different source models (moving dipole, rotating dipole, MUSIC, LORETA, and sLORETA) were used in order to perform source localization. Seven to 10 intracerebral electrodes were implanted during SEEG investigations. For each source model, the concordance between ictal source localization and epileptogenic zone defined by SEEG was assessed. Results were considered to agree if they localized in the same sublobar area as defined by a trained epileptologist. Across the study population, the best concordance between source localization methods and SEEG (9/10) was obtained with equivalent current dipole modeling. MUSIC and LORETA had a concordance of 7/10 whereas sLORETA had a concordance of only 5/10. Four of our patients classified into different groups (ictal spikes, paroxysmal fast activity, obscured) had complete concordance between source localization methods and SEEG. A high signal to noise ratio, a short time window of analysis (<1 s) and bandpass filtering around the frequency of rhythmic activity allowed improvement of the source localization results. A high level of agreement between source localization methods and SEEG can be obtained for ictal spike patterns and for scalp-EEG paroxysmal fact activities whereas scalp rhythmic discharges can be accurately localized but originated from seizure propagation network.

However, the challenge remains to find reliable biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity that can be used to track the functional decline over time and test efficacy of therapeutic intervention. While many recent studies have focused on neuroimaging techniques based on brain hemodynamic activity, comparatively fewer have utilized electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). This review aims to summarise and integrate key electroencephalographical findings from the last two decades in symptomatic and pre-diagnostic HD, in context with recent neuroimaging data, and to use this information to identify promising candidate markers for future research and clinical consideration.

Brain-machine interfaces in space: Using spontaneous rather than intentionally generated brain signals	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Review						Brain-machine interface; Brain-computer interface; Astronaut; Electroencephalography; NIRS	OSCILLATIONS; WORKLOAD; SYSTEM	Recent advances in non-invasive brain-machine or brain-computer interfaces (BMIs/BCIs) have demonstrated that humans can control computers or simple robotic devices using only brain signals. These successes have lead to the suggestion that BM's could significantly improve the safety and efficiency of space operations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based BMIs are most relevant for potential space applications due to their portability, non-invasiveness, and relative inexpensiveness. However, BMIs using these methods are limited in their speed, content, and accuracy of information transfer. In this paper, we suggest that the performance limitations of current BMIs may reflect the incomplete information of non-invasive signals rather than merely a lack of maturity of the technology. As an alternative to using BMIs for direct control, we describe how new research on monitoring spontaneously generated brain signals may be practically applied in space operations.

Cortical EEG sources were estimated by standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results showed that (i) the frontal delta sources were greater in amplitude in the amnesic MCI and SMC subjects than in the Nold subjects (p < 0.05-0.01); (ii) the parietal and occipital theta sources were lower in amplitude in the SMC subjects than in the Nold subjects (p < 0.046); (iii) the occipital theta sources were greater in amplitude in the amnesic MCI subjects than in the SMC and non-amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.02-0.01); (iv) the parietal and occipital alpha 1 sources were greater in amplitude in the Nold subjects than in the SMC, non-amnesic MCI and amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.00001); (v) the central alpha I sources were lower in amplitude in the SMC subjects than in the non-amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.002); (vi) the occipital alpha 1 sources were greater in amplitude in the SMC subjects than in the amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.0003); (vii) the parietal and occipital alpha 2 sources were greater in amplitude in the Nold subjects than in the non-amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.041-0.0004); (viii) the occipital alpha 2 sources were greater in the SMC subjects than in the non-amnesic MCI subjects (p < 0.02). These results suggest that amnesic MCI and SMC subjects present some of the typical alterations of brain neural synchronization as revealed by resting cortical EEG rhythms in Alzheimer's disease patients.

This area has regained new attention due to the possibilities of multi-dimensional signal processing. In this work we analyze measured visual-evoked potentials on the basis of the time-varying spectrum for each channel. Recently, parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis has been used to identify the signal components in the space-time-frequency domain. However, the PARAFAC decomposition is not able to cope with components appearing time-shifted over the different channels. Furthermore, it is not possible to track PARAFAC components over time. In this contribution we derive how to overcome these problems by using the PARAFAC2 model, which renders it an attractive approach for processing EEG data with highly dynamic (moving) sources.

To assess reliability, the results obtained by pre-surgical MEG and intraoperative electrocorticography were compared. Methods: Four children with symptomatic localization-related epilepsy caused by circumscribed cortical lesion were examined in the present study using 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG with a sampling rate of 600 Hz. One patient had dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial. tumor (DNT) and three patients had focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Aberrant areas were superimposed, to reconstruct 3D MRI images, and illustrated as moving images. Results: In three patients, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analyses of MEG showed rhythmic activities just above the lesion with FCD and in the vicinity of DNT. In one patient with FCD in the medial. temporal lobe, rhythmic activity appeared in the ipsilateral frontal lobe and temporal lateral aspect. These findings correlate well with the results obtained by intraoperative electrocorticography. After the surgery, three patients were relieved of their seizures, and the area of rhythmic MEG activity disappeared or become smaller. One patient had residual rhythmic MEG activity, and she suffered from seizure relapse. Conclusion: Time-frequency analyses using STFT successfully depicted MEG rhythmic fast activity, and would provide valuable information for pre- and post-surgical evaluations to define surgical strategies for patients with epilepsy.

A well-established phenomenon is that slow wave/fast wave ratios (SW/FW) are increased in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Several researchers have also begun to study relationships between SW/FW and affect. This work Suggests that increased SW/FW may reflect reduced frontal cortical control over subcortical affective approach drive. The present Study (n = 28) aimed to further examine this notion by testing several predictions derived from it. In line with these predictions, SW/FW was found to correlate negatively with fearful modulation of response inhibition in an emotional go/no-go task and with self-reported attentional control. Results also Suggested a positive relation between SW/FW and trait approach motivation and a negative relation to anxiety, as predicted. These results are consistent with previous Studies and support the notion that SW/FW may provide a useful tool in the study of affect and emotion regulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To date, no study has explored the temporal dynamics of gamma band in the early stages of dementia. At baseline, gamma band analysis was performed in 29 cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during the n-back task. Based on phase diagrams, multiple linear regression models were built to explore the relationship between the cognitive status and gamma oscillation changes over time. Individual measures of phase diagram complexity were made using fractal dimension values. After 1 year, all cases were assessed neuropsychologically using the same battery. A total of 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). When adjusted for gamma values at lag -2, and -3 ms, PMCI cases displayed significantly lower average changes in gamma values than SMCI cases both in detection and 2-back tasks. Gamma fractal dimension of PMCI cases displayed significantly higher gamma fractal dimension values compared to SMCI cases. This variable explained 11.8% of the cognitive variability in this series. Our data indicate that the progression of cognitive decline in MCI is associated with early deficits in temporal binding that occur during the activation of selective attention processes.

Professional pianists and musically naive subjects observed these movements with the aim of either replicating or recognizing them at a later stage. A non-linear measure of functional coupling was used to investigate EEG activity. In the 10-13 Hz frequency band and in musically naive subjects, functional coupling during observation for replica was greater within central and neighboring areas than during observation for recognition. An opposite pattern was found in the 4-8 Hz frequency band. In the 10-13 Hz band and in areas including the parietal cortex, functional coupling in musically naive subjects was greater compared to professional pianists under observation for replica. Results are discussed in the light of recent findings from the cognitive and behavioral neuroscience literature.

EEG signatures of auditory activity correlate with simultaneously recorded fMRI responses in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Single-trial; Event-related potential; Time-frequency analysis; Auditory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ACOUSTIC NOISE; TIME-COURSE; 3-T FMRI; CORTEX; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION	We recorded auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) during simultaneous, continuous fMRI and identified trial-to-trial correlations between the amplitude of electrophysiological responses, characterised in the time domain and the time-frequency domain, and the hemodynamic BOLD response. Cortical AEPs were recorded from 30 EEG channels within the 3 T MRI scanner with and without the collection of simultaneous BOLD fMRI. Focussing on the Cz (vertex) EEG response, single-trial AEP responses were measured from time-domain waveforms. Furthermore, a novel method was used to characterise the single-trial AEP response within three regions of interest in the time-frequency domain (TF-ROIs). The latency and amplitude values of the N1 and P2 AEP peaks during fMRI scanning were not significantly different from the Control session (p>0.16). BOLD fMRI responses to the auditory Stimulation were observed in bilateral secondary auditory cortices as well as in the right precentral and postcentral gyri, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor cortex (SMC). Significant single-trial correlations were observed with a voxel-wise analysis, between (I) the magnitude of the EEG TF-ROI1 (70-800 MS post-stimulus, 1-5 Hz) and the BOLD response in right primary (Heschl's gyrus) and secondary (STG, planum temporale) auditory cortex; and (2) the amplitude of the P2 peak and the BOLD response in left pre- and postcentral gyri, the ACC and SMC. No correlation was observed with single-trial NI amplitude on a voxel-wise basis. An fMRI-ROI analysis of functionally-identified auditory responsive regions identified further single-trial correlations of BOLD and EEG responses. The TF amplitudes in TF-ROI1 and TF-RO12 (20-400 ms post-stimulus, 5-15 Hz) were significantly correlated with the BOLD response in all bilateral auditory areas investigated (planum temporale, superior temporal gyrus and Heschl's gyrus). However the N1 and P2 peak amplitudes, occurring at similar latencies did not show a correlation in these regions. N1 and P2 peak amplitude did correlate with the BOLD response in bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri and the SMC. Additionally P2 and TF-ROI1 both correlated with the ACC. TF-ROI3 (400-900 ms post-stimulus. 4-10 Hz) correlations were only observed in the ACC and SMC. Across the group, the subject-mean N1 peak amplitude correlated with the BOLD response amplitude in the primary and secondary auditory cortices bilaterally, as well as the right precentral gyrus and SMC. We confirm that auditory-evoked EEG responses can be recorded during continuous and simultaneous fMRI. We have presented further evidence of an empirical single-trial coupling between the EEG and BOLD fMRI responses, and show that a time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals can yield additional BOLD fMRI correlates, predominantly in auditory cortices, beyond those found using the, evoked response amplitude alone.

Neuroimaging studies have revealed the contributions of different brain regions to different functional roles in WM tasks; however, little is known about the neural mechanism governing their coordination. Electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, especially theta and alpha, are known to appear over distributed brain regions during WM tasks, but the rhythms associated with task-relevant regional coupling have not been obtained thus far. In this study, we conducted time-frequency analyses for EEG data in WM tasks that include manipulation periods and memory storage buffer periods. We used both auditory WM tasks and visual WM tasks. The results successfully demonstrated function-specific EEG activities. The frontal theta amplitudes increased during the manipulation periods of both tasks. The alpha amplitudes increased during not only the manipulation but also the maintenance periods in the temporal area for the auditory WM and the parietal area for the visual WM. The phase synchronization analyses indicated that, under the relevant task conditions, the temporal and parietal regions show enhanced phase synchronization in the theta bands with the frontal region, whereas phase synchronization between theta and alpha is significantly enhanced only within the individual areas. Our results suggest that WM task-relevant brain regions are coordinated by distant theta synchronization for central executive functions, by local alpha synchronization for the memory storage buffer, and by theta-alpha coupling for inter-functional integration.

High gamma mapping using EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						High gamma; Motor cortex; Synchronization; EEG; BCI	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CORTICAL MOTOR AREAS; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; MEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENTS	High gamma (HG) power changes during motor activity, especially at frequencies above 70 Hz, play an important role in functional cortical mapping and as control signals for BCI (brain-computer interface) applications. Most studies of HG activity have used ECoG (electrocorticography) which provides high-quality spatially localized signals, but is an invasive method. Recent studies have shown that non-invasive modalities such as EEG and MEG can also detect task-related HG power changes. We show here that a 27 channel EEG (electroencephalography) montage provides high-quality spatially localized signals non-invasively for HG frequencies ranging from 83 to 101 Hz. We used a generic head model, a weighted minimum norm least squares (MNLS) inverse method, and a self-paced finger movement paradigm. The use of an inverse method enables us to map the EEG onto a generic cortex model. We find the HG activity during the task to be well localized in the contralateral motor area. We find HG power increases prior to finger movement, with average latencies of 462 ms and 82 ms before EMG (electromyogram) onset. We also find significant phase-locking between contra- and ipsilateral motor areas over a similar HG frequency range; here the synchronization onset precedes the EMG by 400 ms. We also compare our results to ECoG data from a similar paradigm and find EEG mapping and ECoG in good agreement. Our findings demonstrate that mapped EEG provides information on two important parameters for functional mapping and BCI which are usually only found in HG of ECoG signals: spatially localized power increases and bihemispheric phase-locking.

The configuration of the signals waveform may contain valuable and useful information about the different states of the brain. Since the biological signals are personal, indications may occur highly random in both time and frequency domains. Thus the computer analyzing is necessary. EEG is decomposed by wavelet transform and coefficient sets are obtained. In this paper spectral entropy is applied to these coefficient sets for epileptic seizures detection. This process is applied to three different groups of EEG signals: 1) healthy states, 2) epileptic states during a seizure-free interval (interictal EEG), 3) epileptic states during a seizure (ictal EEG). At the end the statistical analysis is applied for distinguishing the coefficient sets. This statistical process can differentiate between ictal and healthy subject (with eyes close) of cD2 coefficients (15-30 Hz) with 99% p-value.

On the Recording Reference Contribution to EEG Correlation, Phase Synchorony, and Coherence	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Bipolar electroencephalography (EEG); coherence; corrected EEG; correlation; phase synchrony; referential EEG; scalp reference signal; spectral power	SCALP REFERENCE SIGNAL; TIME-SERIES; SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA; NETWORK; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; ANXIETY; POWER	The degree of synchronization in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is commonly characterized by the time-series measures, namely, correlation, phase synchrony, and magnitude squared coherence (MSC). However, it is now well established that the interpretation of the results from these measures are confounded by the recording reference signal and that this problem is not mitigated by the use of other EEG montages, such as bipolar and average reference. In this paper, we analyze the impact of reference signal amplitude and power on EEG signal correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC. We show that, first, when two nonreferential signals have negative correlation, the phase synchrony and the absolute value of the correlation of the two referential signals may have two regions of behavior characterized by a monotonic decrease to zero and then a monotonic increase to one as the amplitude of the reference signal varies in [0,+infinity). It is notable that even a small change of the amplitude may lead to significant impact on these two measures. Second, when two nonreferential signals have positive correlation, the correlation and phase-synchrony values of the two referential signals can monotonically increase to one (or monotonically decrease to some positive value and then monotonically increase to one) as the amplitude of the reference signal varies in [0,+infinity). Third, when two nonreferential signals have negative cross-power, the MSC of the two referential signals can monotonically decrease to zero and then monotonically increase to one as reference signal power varies in [0,+infinity). Fourth, when two nonreferential signals have positive cross-power, the MSC of the two referential signals can monotonically increase to one as the reference signal power varies in [0,+infinity). In general, the reference signal with small amplitude or power relative to the signals of interest may decrease or increase the values of correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC. However, the reference signal with high relative amplitude or power will always increase each of the three measures. In our previous paper, we developed a method to identify and extract the reference signal contribution to intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In this paper, we apply this approach to referential iEEG recorded from human subjects and directly investigate the contribution of recording reference on correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC. The experimental results demonstrate the significant impact that the recording reference may have on these bivariate measures.

RAT MODEL OF INFLUENZA-ASSOCIATED ENCEPHALOPATHY (IAE): STUDIES OF ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG) IN VIVO	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; influenza; hyperthermia; cytokines; theta activity; hippocampus	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; LOW-DOSE KETAMINE; MEDIAL SEPTUM; THETA-RHYTHM; SLEEP; NEURONS; PAIN; ENCEPHALITIS; ISOFLURANE; GENERATION	Influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is characterized by severe neurological complications during high-grade fever with high morbidity and mortality in children. The major neurological complications during high-grade fever include convulsive seizures, loss of consciousness, neuropsychiatric behavior (hallucination, meaningless speech, disorientation, laughing alone); high voltage amplitude slow waves and the occurrence of theta oscillation are depicted on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the IAE patients. At the early phase of the disease, the cytokines levels increase in severe cases. To understand the neuronal properties in the CNS leading to these neurological complications in IAE patients, we recorded EEG signals from the hippocampus and cortex of rats infected with influenza A/WSN/33 H1N1 virus (IAV) strain. Abnormal EEG activities were observed in all infected rats under anesthesia, including high voltage EEG burst amplitude and increased EEG spikes in the early phase (8 h-day 2) of infection, and these increases at the early phase were in parallel with a significant increase level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum. When the infected rats were heat-stressed by elevating the rat body core temperature to 39-41 degrees C, these abnormal EEG activities were enhanced, and the oscillation pattern shifted in most of rats from slow bursting waves (<1 Hz) to theta oscillation (3-6 Hz). These results indicate that the abnormal EEG activities in IAE patients could be well reproduced in anesthetized IAV infected rats under hyperthermia, hence this animal model will be useful for further understandings the mechanism of neuronal complications in IAE patient during high-grade fever.

The proposed method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates those using least-squares estimation with a kernel having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to obtain the optimal bandwidth, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Simulation results show that the LPM-based TVAR identification method outperforms conventional methods for different scenarios. The advantages of the LPM method make it a useful high-resolution time-frequency analysis (TFA) technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like EEG. Experimental results show that the LPM method can reveal more meaningful time-frequency characteristics than wavelet transform.	[Zhang, Z. G.; Chan, S. C.; Hung, Y.

Recent work suggests that similar high-frequency oscillations can be detected in the seizure onset zone using standard diagnostic macroelectrodes. However, only a few channels were examined in these studies, so little information is available on the spatial extent of high-frequency oscillations. Here, we present data on high-frequency oscillations recorded from a larger number of intracerebral contacts spatial (mean 38) in 16 patients. Data were obtained from 1 h of interictal recording sampled at 1024 Hz and was analysed using a new semi-automatic detection procedure based on a wavelet decomposition. A detailed frequency analysis permitted a rapid and reliable discrimination of high-frequency oscillations from other high-frequency events. A total of 1932 high-frequency oscillations were detected with an average frequency of 261 +/- 53 Hz, amplitude of 11.9 +/- 6.7 mu V and duration of 22.7 +/- 11.6 ms. Records from a patient often showed several different high-frequency oscillation patterns. We classified 24 patterns from 11 patients. Usually (20/24 patterns) high-frequency oscillations were nested in an epileptic paroxysm, such as a spike or a sharp wave, and typically high-frequency oscillations (19/24) were recorded from just one recording contact. Unexpectedly in other cases, high-frequency oscillations (5/24) were detected simultaneously on two or three contacts, sometimes separated by large distances. This large spatial extent suggests that high-frequency oscillations may sometimes result from a neuronal synchrony manifest on a scale of centimetres. High-frequency oscillations were almost always recorded in seizure-generating structures of patients suffering from mesial (9/9) or polar (1/3) temporal lobe epilepsy. They were never found in the epileptic or healthy basal, lateral temporal or extra temporal neocortex nor in the healthy amygdalo-hippocampal complex. These findings confirm that the generation of oscillations at frequencies higher that 200 Hz is, at this scale, a specific, intrinsic property of seizure-generating networks in medial and polar temporal lobes, which have a common archaic phylogenetic origin. We show that this activity can be detected and its spatial extent determined with conventional intracranial electroencephalography electrodes in records from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is a reliable marker of the seizure onset zone that should be considered in decisions on surgical treatment.

Several methods have been suggested to determine a quantitative index for depth of anesthesia. In this paper an efficient method based on Wigner-Ville transform is proposed to achieve a better estimation of the depth index during the surgery. Wigner-Ville distribution represents the EEG signal windows during the surgery into time-frequency domain and the depth index is extracted from this space. As far as the amplitude of EEG signal is not important for calculating anesthesia depth, we decline the effect of signal amplitude in different windows while frequency content of signal does not change. The proposed method leads to increase the depth index robustness and provides very similar results to the Bispectral index (BIS). Ten subjects are participated in this study and the isoflurane drug is used during the surgery. Copyright (c) 2010 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Oscillations; Phase resetting; Induced and evoked EEG activity; Delta; Theta; Cross-spectral interaction	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; P300; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE; TESTS; DELTA	Objective. Patients suffering from schizophrenia demonstrate impaired low frequency electrophysiological responses to stimuli, but it remains unclear whether these abnormalities arise from phase resetting of ongoing oscillations, new phase-locked (evoked) activity or non-phase-locked (induced) activity Our goal is to clarify the contribution of each of these three processes to the impairment of neural activity during information processing in schizophrenia, by using statistics that do not confound increases in the mean post-stimulus signal with phase resetting Methods. Thirty-four male schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy matched controls performed an auditory oddball task. We applied the analysis procedure developed by Martinez-Montes et al [18] based on complex-valued wavelet transform to event-related signal elicited by target stimuli. Results The largest abnormalities were found for phase-locked delta (1-4 Hz) and non-phase-locked theta (4-8 Hz). Delta phase resetting was moderately impaired and related to symptoms of disorganization. It also predicted evoked theta signal Conclusion: The substantial reduction of both evoked and induced oscillatory activity in schizophrenia indicates diminished recruitment of brain circuits engaged not only in stimulus-locked perceptual processing but also in more extensive processing less tightly time locked to the stimulus Although reduced phase resetting makes a lesser contribution, it indicates a deficit in the ability to harness ongoing electrical activity (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The first goal of the present study was to conduct a quantitative analysis of sleepwalkers' sleep EEG by studying fluctuations in spectral power for delta (1-4 Hz) and slow delta (0.5-1 Hz) before the onset of somnambulistic episodes. A secondary aim was to detect slow-wave oscillations to examine changes in their amplitude and density prior to behavioral episodes. Participants: Twenty-two adult sleepwalkers were investigated polysomnographically following 25 h of sleep deprivation. Results: Analysis of patients' sleep EEG over the 200 sec prior to the episodes' onset revealed that the episodes were not preceded by a gradual increase in spectral power for either delta or slow delta over frontal, central, or parietal leads. However, time course comparisons revealed significant changes in the density of slow-wave oscillations as well as in very slow oscillations with significant increases occurring during the final 20 sec immediately preceding episode onset. Conclusions: The specificity of these sleep EEG parameters for the occurrence and diagnosis of NREM parasomnias remains to be determined.

Cortical dynamics of selective attention to somatosensory events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Somatosensory cortex; Cortical oscillations; Magnetoencephalography; Alpha; Beta; Gamma; Phase-locking; Median nerve stimulation	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; GAMMA-BAND; TACTILE DEFENSIVENESS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; ALPHA-FREQUENCY; BETA-ACTIVITY; TOP-DOWN; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Recent studies have shown evidence of somatosensory deficits in individuals with attentional difficulties yet relatively little is known about the role of attention in the processing of somatosensory input. Neuromagnetic imaging studies have shown that rhythmic oscillations within the human somatosensory cortex are strongly modulated by somatosensory stimulation and may reflect the normal processing of such stimuli. However, few studies have examined how attention influences these cortical oscillations. We examined attentional effects on human somatosensory oscillations during median nerve stimulation by conducting time-frequency analyses of neuromagnetic recordings in healthy adults. We found that selective attention modulated somatosensory oscillations in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands that were both phase-locked and non-phase-locked to the stimulus. In the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), directing the subject's attention toward the somatosensory stimulus resulted in increased gamma band power (30-55 Hz) that was phase-locked to stimulus onset. Directed attention also produced an initial suppression (desynchrony) followed by enhancement (synchrony) of beta band power (13-25 Hz) that was not phase-locked to the stimulus. In the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), directing attention towards the stimulus increased phase-locked alpha (7-9 Hz) power approximately 30 ms after onset of phase-locked gamma in SI, followed by a non-phase-locked increase in alpha power. We suggest that earlier phase-locked oscillatory power may reflect the relay of input from SI to SII, whereas later non-phase-locked rhythms reflect stimulus-induced oscillations that are modulated by selective attention and may thus reflect enhanced processing of the stimulus underlying the perception of somatosensory events.

However, these topics have typically been examined in isolation, and little is known about how these processes might interact. Here, we investigated whether EEG oscillations arising specifically during the delay of a delayed matching-to-sample task reflect successful LTM encoding. Given previous findings of increased alpha and theta power with increasing WM load, together with the assumption that successful memory encoding involves processes that are similar to those that are invoked by increasing WM load, alpha and theta power should be higher for subsequently remembered stimuli. Consistent with this assumption, we found stronger alpha power for subsequently remembered stimuli over occipital-to-parietal scalp sites. Furthermore, stronger theta power was found for subsequently remembered stimuli over parietal-to-central electrodes. These results support the idea that alpha and theta oscillations modulate successful LTM encoding. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cannabis intake disrupts synchronicity of theta oscillations and interferes with memory performance. Sixteen participants smoked cigarettes containing 0.0, 29.3, 49.1, or 69.4 mg Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a randomized crossover design and performed working memory and general attention tasks. Dose-dependent effects of THC were observed for resting state EEG theta and beta power, working memory (per-item search time), and attentional performance (percent errors and RT). The THC effects on EEG theta power and memory performance were correlated, whereas other EEG and behavioral effects were not. These findings confirm and extend previous results in rodents and humans, and corroborate a neurocomputational model that postulates that temporal aspects of information processing in working memory depend causally on nested oscillations in the theta and gamma (>30 Hz) bands.

Our focus is on the problem of separating signals from the spatially close early visual areas. The solution involves taking advantage of known functional anatomy to guide stimulus selection and employing principles of spatial and temporal response properties that simplify analysis. The method also unifies MEG and EEG recordings and provides a means for improving existing boundary element head models. In going beyond carefully controlled stimuli, in natural viewing with scanning eye movements, assessing brain states with BCI is a most challenging task. Frequent eye movements contribute artifacts to the recordings. A linear regression method is introduced that is shown to effectively characterize these frequent artifacts and could be used to remove them. In free viewing, saccadic landings initiate visual processing epochs and could be used to trigger strictly time based analysis methods. However, temporal instabilities indicate frequency based analysis would be an important adjunct. The class of Cauchy filter functions is introduced that have narrow time and frequency properties well matched to the EEG/MEG spectrum for avoiding channel leakage.

In this paper, EEG signals are recorded simultaneously while acupuncturing at 'Zusanli' acupoint (St36) manually. The subjects are 5 acupuncture university students. Every volunteer is acupunctured for four times with different frequencies where 20 groups, 60 pieces data (before, during and after acupuncture for each group) is selected to compare the acupuncture effect on complexity of brain activity. Analyze EEG signals recorded from electrodes C3, C4 with box chart and barchart. statistical significance is tested by t-test to compare the effect of acupuncture. Analyze EEG signals recorded from 20 electrodes with brain image which reflect the complexity of the whole brain directly to find out which region of brain is affected most by acupuncture. The conclusion derived from experiments and analysis is that acupuncture would increase complexity of the whole brain activity and have the greatest impact on forehead region.

Episodic waveforms in the electroencephalogram during general anaesthesia: a study of patterns of response to noxious stimuli	ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE			English	Article						electroencephalography; opioid; anaesthesia; spindles; slow oscillation	SEVOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; TRACHEAL INTUBATION; NITROUS-OXIDE; IN-VITRO; SLEEP; FENTANYL; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS	Previous studies of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during anaesthesia have identified two distinct patterns of change in response to a noxious stimulus, a classical arousal pattern and a paradoxical arousal pattern. We developed methods of EEG analysis to quantify episodic EEG patterns - namely sleep spindle-like ('10 Hz-score') and burst-suppression-like fluctuations in high frequencies ('high frequency variation index') - and used traditional power spectral quantification of non-episodic delta waves. We studied 30 healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia with propofol, fentanyl (1.0, 2.5 or 4.0 mu g/kg, n=10 for each group), muscle relaxant and sevoflurane. Prefrontal EEG data were recorded during the operation and analysed for changes in episodic patterns before and after noxious stimuli (intubation and incision). Before noxious stimuli, the EEG patterns varied markedly between patients and were not strongly correlated to calculated effect-site concentrations of fentanyl, propofol or sevoflurane. Noxious stimuli reduced the 10 Hz-score from 0.25 to 0.20 (P=0.01) after intubation and from 0.33 to 0.27 (P=0.01) after incision; and high frequency variation index from 2.8 to 2.0 (P=0.02) after incision - the classical arousal pattern. The nociception-induced reduction in spindles was greater in the low-dose fentanyl group (P=0.01). There was less tachycardia in the high-dose fentanyl group (P=0.002). It is possible to quantify such episodic EEG patterns during general anaesthesia and in this study noxious stimulation tended to reduce the prevalence of these patterns.	[Sleigh, J.

Cross-frequency coupling in mesiotemporal EEG recordings of epileptic patients	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Article						Mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy; Epileptic focus; Cortico-cortical resonances; Bispectrum; Bicoherence	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BISPECTRAL INDEX; INTERICTAL SPIKES; SCALP EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTRODE; SPECTRA; RAT	Semi-invasive foramen ovate (Fov) electrodes were used to record electrical activity in the vicinity of the inferior mesial temporal region of epileptic patients, in addition to standard scalp EEG. Third order cumulant analysis was used to measure the phase-coupled frequencies corresponding to non-linear coupling of spectral frequency components, somewhat analogous to frequencies of resonance. On the basis of the distribution of these frequencies, an index of resonance (IR) is defined as the ratio between the number of peaks in the gamma-band (40-55 Hz) vs. the number of peaks in the beta-band (15-30 Hz). The epileptogenic focus was located in the hemisphere with lower resonant frequencies because these frequencies were characteristic of a spread of the seizure over a broader area. In the case of Fov electrodes IR could differentiate a group of patients affected by a tumor compared to patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. The novel index IR appears as an interesting parameter to evaluate the level of interareal functional connectivity in Fov recordings in epileptic patients, but its usage is likely to be extended in electrophysiological studies.

Further, there is a general belief that meditation is an absolutely safe practice devoid of any harmful effects. However, with the advent of neuroimaging techniques, the possibility of adverse effects has been raised in recent times. One such issue that has been debated is the potential epileptogenic versus antiepileptic influence exerted by meditation. This brief article attempts to study the potential role of meditation-induced EEG fast oscillations in the predisposition to seizures in meditation practitioners with epilepsy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM OSCILLATIONS DIFFERENTIATE SEMANTIC AND PROSODIC PROCESSES DURING SENTENCE READING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						semantic congruency; rhythmic pattern; prosody; sentence processing; time-frequency analysis	ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-RESPONSES; POWER INCREASES; EEG COHERENCE; COMPREHENSION; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORRELATE; ERP	How prosodic information is processed at the neural level during silent sentence reading is an unsolved issue. In this study, we investigate whether and how the processing of prosodic constraints can be distinguished from the processing of semantic constraints by measuring changes in event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power. We visually presented Chinese sentences containing verb noun combinations that were semantically congruent or incongruent and that had normal or abnormal rhythmic patterns and asked participants to judge whether the sentences were semantically and rhythmically acceptable. In Chinese, the rhythmic pattern refers to the combination of words with different syllable lengths. While the [1+1] pattern is normal for a verb noun combination, the [2+1] pattern is abnormal. With the critical nouns, we found that the violation of semantic constraints was associated with the low beta (16-20 Hz) decrease in the early window (0-200 ms post onset) and the alpha (10-15 Hz) and low beta decrease in the later window (400-657 ms) while the processing of the abnormal rhythmic pattern was associated with the theta (4-6 Hz) and the alpha increase in the early window and the alpha and upper beta (20-24 Hz) decrease in the later window. These findings suggest that although the processing of semantic constraints and the processing of rhythmic pattern may partially share neuro-cognitive processes, as reflected by the similar decreases in alpha band power, they can nevertheless be differentiated in EEG responses during sentence reading.

The neuronal mechanisms underlying RSNs remain poorly understood. Here, we describe magnetoencephalo-graphic correspondents of two well-characterized RSNs: the dorsal attention and the default mode networks. Seed-based correlation mapping was performed using time-dependent MEG power reconstructed at each voxel within the brain. The topography of RSNs computed on the basis of extended (5 min) epochs was similar to that observed with fMRI but confined to the same hemisphere as the seed region. Analyses taking into account the nonstationarity of MEG activity showed transient formation of more complete RSNs, including nodes in the contralateral hemisphere. Spectral analysis indicated that RSNs manifest in MEG as synchronous modulation of band-limited power primarily within the theta, alpha, and beta bands-that is, in frequencies slower than those associated with the local electrophysiological correlates of event-related BOLD responses.

Dynamical correlation of non-stationary signals in time domain-A comparative study	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Multitaper; Wavelet; Harmonic; Coherence; Corticomuscular	TREMOR	In a thorough study, the multitaper (MTM) and the extended continuous wavelet-transform (CWT) coherence-analysis methods were compared in terms of there application in determining the dynamics from the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals of patients with Parkinsonian tremor. The main aim of the study in a biological point of view is to analyze whether the basic tremor frequency and its "first harmonic" frequency of Parkinsonian tremor are really harmonically related or are in fact distinct processes. The extension of the CWT is achieved by using a Morlet wavelet as the analysis window with an adjustable relative bandwidth which gives the flexibility in setting a desired frequency resolution. In order to obtain a perspective view of the two methods, they were applied to two different model signals to determine their actual threshold in detecting short-lived changes in the analysis of non-stationary signals and to determine their noise thresholds by adding external noise to the signals to test the reduction in coherence to be not merely due to the random fluctuations in stochastic signals. Beyond applying an autoregressive 2nd-order and a coupled van der Pol model system, however, also true EEG and EMG data from five Parkinson patients were used. The results were compared in terms of the time and frequency resolutions of these two methods, and it was determined that the multitaper method was able to detect reduction in power and coherence as short as 1 s. The extended CWT analysis only revealed gaps that were longer than 3 s. The time gaps in the coherence indicate the loss of connection between the cortex and muscle during the respective time intervals. This more accurate analysis of the MTM was also seen in the dynamical EEG EMG coherence at the tremor frequency and its "first harmonic" of Parkinsonian patients. In terms of our "biological" aim, this shows distinct prevalence of the corticomuscular coupling at those frequencies over time. Applying this method to biological data reveals important aspects about their dynamics, e.g., the distinct dynamics between basic frequency and "first harmonic" frequency over time in Parkinsonian tremor.

Purpose: The impact of exercise on brain function has gained broad interest. Because hemodynamic and imaging studies are difficult to perform during and after exercise, electroencephalography (EEG) is often the method of choice. Within this study, we aimed 1) to extend prior work examining changes in scalp-recorded brain electrical activity associated with exercise and 2) to use a distributed source localization algorithm (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography [sLORETA]) to model the probable neural sources of changes in EEG activity after exercise. Methods: Electrocortical activity of 22 recreational runners (21-45 yr) was recorded before and after exhaustive treadmill ergometry. Data were analyzed using sLORETA. Results: There was an increase in alpha-1 activity (7.5-10 Hz) immediately after exercise, which was localized to the left frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 8). This finding is consistent with alterations in emotional processing. Fifteen minutes after exercise, a decrease in alpha-2 (10-12.5 Hz), beta-1 (12.5-18 Hz), and gamma activities (35-48 Hz) was observed in Brodmann areas 18 and 20-22, which are well known to be involved in language processing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that sLORETA is a robust method that allows brain activity maps to be generated from standardized EEG recordings following exercise.

We reviewed 45 brain-imaging studies of creative cognition. We found little clear evidence of overlap in their results. Nearly as many different tests were used as there were studies; this test diversity makes it impossible to interpret the different findings across studies with any confidence. Our conclusion is that creativity research would benefit from psychometrically informed revision, and the addition of neuroimaging methods designed to provide greater spatial localization of function. Without such revision in the behavioral measures and study designs, it is hard to see the benefit of imaging. We set out eight suggestions in a manifesto for taking creativity research forward.

Gert			A DC attenuator allows common EEG equipment to record fullband EEG, and fits fullband EEG into standard European Data Format	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Fullband EEG; DC EEG; European Data Format; EDF; Filtering; Inverse filter; Analysis; EEG analysis	TIME CONSTANT; SCALP EEG; POTENTIALS; SHIFTS; SLEEP; BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; ELECTRODES; EXCHANGE	Objective: Traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) recorders reject low frequencies and DC and therefore cannot handle fullband EEG. Dedicated fullband recorders use non-standard file formats, because the standard format (EDF) cannot handle large DC electrode offset voltages. Both facts limit the development and use of fullband EEG. We developed a modification that allows conventional equipment to record fullband EEG, and adapts both types of recorders to EDF. Methods: The modification is a simple filter that attenuates the DC component and thus makes the EEG fit within traditional equipment limitations and EDF. The review software automatically 'de-attenuates' the DC component, without loss of information. Results: DC attenuation by a factor of 10 made both types of recorders store DC attenuated fullband EEG into EDF files. Recordings were made during 0.5-24 h in 46 subjects. The DC de-attenuator automatically reconstructed the original fullband EEG within an amplitude range of +/- 100 mV and with a resolution of 0.3 mu V. Using sintered Ag-AgCl electrodes attached with common procedures, reconstructed DC EEG in spontaneously moving subjects ranged between +/- 32 mV. Conclusions: The modification works. Fullband recordings can now be analyzed by independent software, archived and exchanged. Significance: Any EEG system can be made to record fullband EEG into standard EDF.

ERPs can be classified by their time/frequency characteristics and spatial location on the scalp. Traditionally, ERPs are manually located by temporally and spatially averaged EEG signals. This process is error prone and sensitive to a priori assumptions. Our proposed algorithm is a general neuroscience-focused data mining algorithm that performs time and frequency analysis on ERPs and automatically extracts templates corresponding to Spectral Spatio-Temporal (SST) regions exhibiting significant differences between experimental outcomes. The method uses time-aligned templates, which preserve the characteristics of the signal important to cognitive researchers. The ability of the selected signal templates to differentiate between stimulus responses has been verified using a pattern recognition procedure. SST template extraction is tested on data taken from a Go/NoGo task and shown to both find relationships consistent with published neuroscience literature as well as novel relationships.

The Department of Pathophysiology of Wroclaw Medical University was for many years gathering a lot of digital, binary data acquired by STELLA and NEUROMIC own-constructed measurement systems. This data are very interesting for planned research. In this paper the authors present a review of brain evoked responses variability and describe modern methods of analysis of non-averaged, single-trial responses. In order to achieve this, the authors want to take advantage of progressive mathematical tools, e.g. time-frequency analysis methods and advanced statistical techniques as well as high-tech IT tools. Selected methods are illustrated with the use of own measurement material. They will be used in research of the function of human nervous system based on recorded single-trial responses. In the future, it will be used in verification of their clinical applications (Adv Clin Exp Med 2010, 19, 3, 289-299).

In a moving-window analysis, the EEG from each channel is decomposed by wavelet packet transform. Using wavelet coefficients from seizure and nonseizure references, a patient-specific measure is developed to quantify the separation between seizure and nonseizure states for the frequency range of 1-30 Hz. Utilizing this measure, a frequency band representing the maximum separation between the two states is determined and employed to develop a normalized index, called combined seizure index (CSI). CSI is derived for each epoch of every EEG channel based on both rhythmicity and relative energy of that epoch as well as consistency among different channels. Increasing significantly during ictal states, CSI is inspected using one-sided cumulative sum test to generate proper channel alarms. Analyzing alarms from all channels, a seizure alarm is finally generated. The algorithm was tested on scalp EEG recordings from 14 patients, totaling similar to 75.8 h with 63 seizures. Results revealed a high sensitivity of 90.5%, a false detection rate of 0.51 h(-1) and a median detection delay of 7 s. The algorithm could also lateralize the focus side for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Gamma Oscillatory Power is Impaired During Cognitive Control Independent of Medication Status in First-Episode Schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; gamma oscillations; cognitive control; first episode; prefrontal cortex	PREFRONTAL CORTEX DYSFUNCTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BAND ACTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; STEADY-STATE; EEG DYNAMICS; DEFICITS; PERCEPTION	Schizophrenia is characterized by impaired cognitive control associated with prefrontal cortex dysfunction, but the underlying pathophysioloical mechanisms remain unknown. Higher cognitive processes are associated with cortical oscillations in the gamma range, which are also impaired in chronic schizophrenia. We tested whether cognitive control-related gamma deficits are observed in first-episode patients, and whether they are associated with antipsychotic medication exposure. Fifty-three first-episode schizophrenia patients (21 without antipsychotic medication treatment) and 29 healthy control subjects underwent electroencephalography (EEG) during performance of a preparatory cognitive control task (preparing to overcome prepotency or POP task). The first-episode schizophrenia patient group was impaired (relative to the control group) on task performance and on delay-period gamma power at each of the three subgroups of frontal electrodes. The unmedicated patient subgroup was similarly impaired compared with controls, and was not different on these measures compared with the medicated patient subgroup. In contrast, delay-period theta power was not impaired in the full patient group nor in the unmedicated patient subgroup. Impaired cognitive control-related gamma cortical oscillatory activity is present at the first psychotic episode in schizophrenia, and is independent of medication status. This suggests that altered local circuit function supporting high-frequency oscillatory activity in prefrontal cortex ensembles may serve as the pathophysiological substrate of cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia.

An extended motor network generates beta and gamma oscillatory perturbations during development	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Precentral; ERD; ERS; Synchronization; Cortex; MEG; Cerebellum; Magnetoencephalography; Somatosensory; Mu; Child	CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; TACTILE STIMULATION; PRECENTRAL GYRUS; HUMAN BRAIN; MOVEMENT; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY	This study examines the time course and neural generators of oscillatory beta and gamma motor responses in typically-developing children. Participants completed a unilateral flexion-extension task using each index finger as whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were acquired. These MEG data were imaged in the frequency-domain using spatial filtering and the resulting event-related synchronizations and desynchronizations (ERS/ERD) were subjected to voxel-wise statistical analyses to illuminate time-frequency specific activation patterns. Consistent with adult data, these children exhibited a pre-movement ERD that was strongest over the contralateral post-central gyrus, and a post-movement ERS response with the most prominent peak being in the contralateral precentral gyms near premotor cortices. We also observed a high-frequency (similar to 80 Hz) ERS response that coincided with movement onset and was centered on the contralateral precentral gyms, slightly superior and posterior to the beta ERS. In addition to pre- and post-central gyri activations, these children exhibited beta and gamma activity in supplementary motor areas (SMA) before and during movement, and beta activation in cerebellar cortices before and after movement. We believe the gamma synchronization may be an excellent candidate signal of basic cortical motor control, as the spatiotemporal dynamics indicate the primary motor cortex generates this response (and not the beta oscillations) which is closely yoked to the initial muscle activation. Lastly, these data suggest several additional neural regions including the SMA and cerebellum are involved in basic movements during development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We study the relationship between resonant properties of neurons and network oscillations in a computational model of neocortex. Our findings suggest that resonance is associated with subthreshold oscillation of neurons. This subthreshold behavior affects spike timing and plays a significant role in the generation of the network's extracellular currents reflected in the EEG. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

EEG Sleep Spectra in Older Adults Across All Circadian Phases During NREM Sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						Aging; spectral analysis; 2-process model of sleep regulation	VENTROLATERAL PREOPTIC NUCLEUS; SPINDLE FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; HOMEOSTATIC REGULATION; EXOGENOUS MELATONIN; YOUNG-ADULT; TEMPERATURE; RHYTHMS; PROPENSITY	Study Objectives: Healthy aging is associated with changes in sleep-wake regulation, and those changes often lead to problems sleeping, both during the night and during daytime. We aimed to examine the electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep spectra during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep when sleep was scheduled at all times of day. Design/Interventions: After three 24-h baseline (BL) days, participants were scheduled to live on 20-hour "days" consisting of 6.7 hours of bed rest and 13.3 hours of wakefulness for 12 consecutive days (forced desynchrony, FD). The EEG was recorded from a central derivation during all scheduled sleep episodes, with subsequent visual scoring and spectral analysis. Setting: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit of the Brigham & Women's Hospital General Clinical Research Center. Participants: Twenty-four healthy older subjects (64.2 +/- 6.3 yr; 13 women, 11 men) Measurements and Results: Compared with BL nights, EEG activity in the slow wave (0.5 to 5.25 Hz), theta (6 to 6.25 and 7 Hz), alpha (10 to 11.25 Hz), and high spindle range (14.5 to 15.5 Hz) was significantly greater during FD, when subjects slept across many times of day and night. During FD, there was a significant interaction between homeostatic and circadian factors, such that EEG delta activity (0.5 to 1.5 Hz) was higher in the biological morning/early afternoon than at other times. EEG activity was significantly increased in almost all frequency ranges (0.5 to 21 Hz) during the biological day, as compared with the biological night, except for the lower EEG spindle range (12.25 to 14 Hz). Overall, EEG beta activity was positively correlated with wakefulness and negatively correlated with total sleep time. Conclusion: Our findings provide some new evidence for the underlying mechanisms that contribute to age-related difficulties in sleep consolidation, especially when sleep occurs during the daytime.

We here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas. In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework. Given that alpha activity is by far the strongest signal recorded by EEG and MEG, we propose that a major part of the electrophysiological activity detected from the working brain reflects gating by inhibition.

Using combined blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 9.4 T and electroencephalography (EEG), these changes can be characterized with high spatiotemporal resolution. We studied BOLD changes in anesthetized Wistar rats during bicuculline-induced tonic-clonic seizures. Bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, was injected systemically and seizure activity was observed on EEG as high-amplitude, high-frequency polyspike discharges followed by clonic paroxysmal activity of lower frequency, with mean electrographic seizure duration of 349 s. Our aim was to characterize the spatial localization, direction, and timing of BOLD signal changes during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods. Group analysis was performed across seizures using paired t-maps of BOLD signal superimposed on high-resolution anatomical images. Regional analysis was then performed using volumes of interest to quantify BOLD timecourses. In the pre-ictal period we found focal BOLD increases in specific areas of somatosensory cortex (S1, S2) and thalamus several seconds before seizure onset. During seizures we observed BOLD increases in cortex, brainstem and thalamus and BOLD decreases in the hippocampus. The largest ictal BOLD increases remained in the focal regions of somatosensory cortex showing pre-ictal increases. During the post-ictal period we observed widespread BOLD decreases. These findings support a model in which "generalized" tonic-clonic seizures begin with focal changes before electrographic seizure onset, which progress to non-uniform changes during seizures, possibly shedding light on the etiology and pathophysiology of similar seizures in humans.

When the cross-correlation coefficient is estimated using a finite amount of data points, its non-random part may be strongly contaminated by a sizable random contribution, such that no reliable conclusion can be drawn about genuine mutual interdependencies. The random correlations are determined by the signals' frequency content and the amount of data points used. Here, we introduce adjusted correlation matrices that can be employed to disentangle random from non-random contributions to each matrix element independently of the signal frequencies. Extending our previous work these matrices allow analyzing spatial patterns of genuine cross-correlation in multivariate data regardless of confounding influences. The performance is illustrated by example of model systems with known interdependence patterns. Finally, we apply the methods to electroencephalographic (EEG) data with epileptic seizure activity.

Cortical Networks Produce Three Distinct 7-12 Hz Rhythms during Single Sensory Responses in the Awake Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; GUSTATORY CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TASTE; REFLECTS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; REJECTION; INGESTION	Cortical rhythms in the alpha/mu frequency range (7-12 Hz) have been variously related to "idling," anticipation, seizure, and short-term or working memory. This overabundance of interpretations suggests that sensory cortex may be able to produce more than one (and even more than two) distinct alpha/mu rhythms. Here we describe simultaneous local field potential and single-neuron recordings made from primary sensory (gustatory) cortex of awake rats and reveal three distinct 7-12 Hz de novo network rhythms within single sessions: an " early," taste-induced similar to 11 Hz rhythm, the first peak of which was a short-latency gustatory evoked potential; a " late," significantly lower-frequency (similar to 7 Hz) rhythm that replaced this first rhythm at similar to 750-850 ms after stimulus onset (consistently timed with a previously described shift in taste temporal codes); and a "spontaneous" spike-and-wave rhythm of intermediate peak frequency (similar to 9 Hz) that appeared late in the session, as part of a oft-described reduction in arousal/attention. These rhythms proved dissociable on many grounds: in addition to having different peak frequencies, amplitudes, and shapes and appearing at different time points (although often within single 3 s snippets of activity), the early and late rhythms proved to have completely uncorrelated session-to-session variability, and the spontaneous rhythm affected the early rhythm only (having no impact on the late rhythm). Analysis of spike-to-wave coupling suggested that the early and late rhythms are a unified part of discriminative taste process: the identity of phase-coupled single-neuron ensembles differed from taste to taste, and coupling typically lasted across the change in frequency. These data reveal that even rhythms confined to a narrow frequency band may still have distinct properties.	[Tort, Adriano B.

The purpose of the present study was to analyse the sources of poststimulus increases of 1530 Hz oscillations during noxious laser stimulation of four different body regions and to compare the sources of the poststimulus synchronisation with the sources of the N2 component of laser-evoked potential (LEP). In 10 healthy subjects, moderately painful laser stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the right hand, dorsum of the right foot, right groin, and right side of the face. EEG data, recorded from ill scalp sites, were analysed using event-related desynchronisation method and source dipole analysis. A profound amplitude increase of 15-30 Hz oscillations peaking 1-2 s after noxious laser stimulation was found during stimulation of each body part. The sources of these oscillations were located in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex and showed no somatotopic arrangement. The sources of the N2-LEP component were located in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex 25-30 mm rostral to the sources of 15-30 Hz oscillations. The amplitude of the poststimulus synchronisation of 15-30 Hz oscillations correlated (P<0.05) with the amplitude of N2-LEP component. Results show that noxious laser stimuli induce bursts of 15-30 Hz oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex. The poststimulus increases of 15-30 Hz oscillations may stand for transient cortical inhibition possibly aiding temporary suppression of motor programs that have been primed by noxious stimulation.

The methodology is based on the segmentation of the time-frequency plane in regions with relatively homogeneous synchronization patterns, which is performed by means of a seeded region-growing algorithm, and a Bayesian regularization procedure. We have implemented these methods in an interactive application for the study of cognitive experiments, although some of the techniques discussed in this work can also be applied to other multidimensional data sets. To demonstrate our methodology, results corresponding to a figure and word categorization EEG experiment are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

So the properties of the generators of various EEG oscillations might be investigated by their spatial differences of the long-range temporal correlations. In the present study, these correlations were characterized with respect to their topography during different vigilance states by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The results indicated that (1) most of the scaling exponents acquired from different EEG derivations for various oscillations were significantly different in each vigilance state; these differences might be resulted from the different quantities and different locations of sleep stage-dependent generators of various neuronal processes; (2) there might be multiple generators of delta and theta over the brain and many of them were sleep stage-dependent; (3) the best site of the frontal electrode in a fronto-parietal bipolar electrode for sleep staging might be above the anterior midline cortex. We suggest that DFA analysis can be used to explore the properties of the generators of a given neuronal oscillation, and the localizations of these generators if more electrodes are involved.

The time-frequency analysis, particularly the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville ( SPWV) distribution, is applied to process the LFP signal and to determine the start and end time of epileptic seizure. We found that the " ridge-like" feature in the joint time-frequency domain is correlated to the seizure. Then we use the criteria to find the time of seizure and compare them with the actual event time. The results show that this processing method is suitable to build new criteria to detect and analyze abnormal LFP and the close-loop epileptic stimulation therapy.

NEURON 58; BAND RESPONSE; ET-AL.; EEG; SCALP; MANIFESTATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; TOPOGRAPHY; ARTIFACTS; DIRECTION	Gamma is an important frequency band of the electroencephalogram (EEG), but its study has been impaired by problems with artefacts. This paper focuses on the artefacts caused by contraction of the extra-ocular muscles at the start of a saccade, which produces spurious gamma oscillations in the EEG. An algorithm was written and tested which detects and reduces the effect of this artefact. It involves novel adaptations of standard regression techniques which have traditionally been used to reduce blink artefacts, so as to render them applicable to the gamma band ocular artefact. Before the algorithm can be applied any power-line noise must be removed by noise cancellation and not notch filtering. The sharp, broadband gamma peak at around 200 ms was substantially reduced by the algorithm in all three subjects tested. However, there may be lower amplitude, task related, modulations in gamma which are uncovered when the artefact is reduced. The amplitude of the artefact had its largest positive value at the most anterior electrodes and its largest negative value at midline central and parietal electrodes, and these two sets of locations also showed the greatest reductions in gamma band magnitude after application of the algorithm. This study demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the saccade linked gamma band artefact.

Alpha-gamma interactions are disturbed in schizophrenia: A fusion of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; ICA; Somatosensory	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BLIND SEPARATION; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; PREPULSE INHIBITION; WORKING-MEMORY; BAND RESPONSES; PHASE-LOCKING; AUDITORY P300; DEFAULT-MODE; EEG	Objective: To delineate regional brain activity associated with the alpha oscillations related to perception of sensory stimuli, and test the hypothesis that the synchronisation of alpha oscillations with stimulus onset is impaired in schizophrenia. Methods: Joint independent component analysis was applied to electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded in 19 individuals with schizophrenia and 19 healthy individuals during a vibrotactile somatosensory task. Results: In healthy individuals the strongest component was dominated by alpha oscillations, and was associated not only with activity in somatosensory regions but also in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (the salience network). In schizophrenia, the strongest component had low alpha power and activity was limited mainly to somatosensory regions. Furthermore, in the healthy group, but not the patients, significant correlation was observed between the strongest component and evoked gamma power. Conclusion: The correlation between the alpha-dominated component and evoked gamma power is consistent with the hypothesis that gamma localised to sensory cortex elicits stimulus-locking of spatially distinct, large-scale ongoing alpha oscillations. Furthermore, this hypothesised mechanism appears to be disrupted in schizophrenia. Significance: These findings suggest that a weakened alpha-gamma interaction underlies impaired recruitment of the brain during sensory information processing in schizophrenia.

It remains unknown whether cortical activation in the superior temporal gyrus during an auditory motor task is affected by laterality of hand-motor responses Here, event-related gamma-oscillations were intracranially recorded as quantitative measures of cortical activation; we determined how cortical structures were activated by auditory-cued movement Using each hand in 15 patients with focal epilepsy. Auditory-verbal stimuli elicited augmentation of gamma-oscillations in a posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, whereas hand-motor responses elicited gamma-augmentation in the pre- and postcentral gyn. The magnitudes of such gamma-augmentation in the superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyn were significantly larger when the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere was required to be used for motor responses, compared with when the ipsilateral hand was. The superior temporal gyrus in each hemisphere might play a greater pivotal role when the contralateral hand needs to be used for motor responses, compared with when the ipsilateral hand does.

A salient pattern during working memory is electroencephalographic frontal midline theta activity which has been suggested to reflect monitoring functions in order to deal with a task. In general, theta activity has been credited with integrative functions of distributed activity. In the present study, we focused on electroencephalographic power analyses and cross-frequency phase synchronization in order to test whether frontal midline theta activity is linked to more locally generated gamma oscillations during the performance of a verbal delayed match to sample task. The task consisted of two different conditions where subjects either had to reorganize three consonant letters in alphabetical order (manipulation condition) or where they merely had to retain the three consonant letters (retention condition). Results revealed higher frontal midline theta activity for the manipulation of maintained stimulus material compared to pure retention of stimulus material. Interestingly, power differences between conditions were most pronounced during the second half of the delay period. Cross-frequency phase synchronization between frontal midline theta activity and distributed gamma activity, on the other hand, was predominant during the first half of the delay period and was stronger for manipulation compared to retention. We suggest that coupling of frontal midline theta to gamma activity reflects monitoring functions on the temporal segregation of memory items, whereas higher frontal midline theta power in the second half of the delay period might be associated with rehearsal processes. Rehearsal processes in the manipulation condition are likely more pronounced, because rehearsal of a new letter string in a limited time window requires higher mental effort compared to pure retention where rehearsal processes may already start at the beginning of the delay period.

Associations of waking EEG structure with chronotype and trototype of 130 sleep deprived individuals	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH			English	Article						sleep deprivation; sleep restriction; sleepiness; sleep homeostasis; circadian process; sleep-wake adaptability	INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; DEPRIVATION; WAKEFULNESS; MODULATION; ALERTNESS	We explored the relationship between inter-individual variation in waking EEG spectra and trait-like variation in sleep-wake adaptability. Resting EEG was recorded every three hours (nine times) in the course of sustained wakefulness of 130 healthy subjects. EEG powers were averaged across 10 frequency ranges ( from slow delta to slow gamma) and further reduced by performing principal component analysis. It yielded the subjects' scores on three largest principal components (PCs) with eigenvalues greater or approximately equal to 1. These PCs were interpreted as EEG amplifying (#1), EEG slowing (#2), and EEG smoothing (#3).

Our hypothesis is that the needs of the typewriting task will demand the coupling of different brain areas, and that the gamma band will promote the binding of information. It is also expected that the neuromodulator will modify this coupling. The sample was composed of 39 healthy subjects. We used a randomized double-blind design and divided subjects into three groups: placebo (n = 13), bromazepam 3 mg (n = 13) and bromazepam 6 mg (n = 13). The two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a main effect for the factors condition (i.e., C4-CZ electrode pair) and moment (i.e., C3-CZ, C3-C4 and C4-CZ pairs of electrodes). We propose that the gamma band plays an important role in the binding among several brain areas in complex motor tasks and that each hemisphere is influenced in a different manner by the neuromodulator.

Unfortunately, since the EEMD is highly compute-intensive, the method does not apply in real-time applications on top of commercial-off-the-shelf computers. Aiming at this problem, a parallelized EEMD method has been developed using general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), namely, G-EEMD. A spectral entropy facilitated by G-EEMD was, therefore, proposed to analyze the EEG data for estimating the depth of anesthesia (DoA) in a real-time manner. In terms of EEG data analysis, G-EEMD has dramatically improved the run-time performance by more than 140 times compared to the original serial EEMD implementation. G-EEMD also performs far better than another parallelized implementation of EEMD bases on conventional CPU-based distributed computing technology despite the latter utilizes 16 high-end computing nodes for the same computing task. Furthermore, the results obtained from a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model analysis indicate that the EEMD method is slightly more effective than its precedent alternative method (EMD) in estimating DoA, the coefficient of determination R(2) by EEMD is significantly higher than that by EMD(p < 0.05, paired t-test) and the prediction probability P(k) by EEMD is also slighter higher than that by EMD (p < 0.2, paired t-test).

Spectral analysis was performed on 60s of artefact-free EEG samples distributed equally throughout the first four REM sleep periods of the second night. EEG coherence was calculated for six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta, and total spectrum) using a 22-electrode montage. The magnitude of coherence function was computed for intra- and interhemispheric pairs of recording sites. Results were compared by Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). Each time the autistic group showed a greater EEG coherence than the controls; it involved intrahemispheric communication among the left visual cortex (O1) and other regions either close to or distant from the occipital cortex. In contrast, lower coherence values involved frontal electrodes in the right hemisphere. No significant differences between groups were found for interhemispheric EEG coherence. These results show that the analysis of EEG coherence during REM sleep can disclose patterns of cortical connectivity that can be reduced or increased in adults with autism compared to typically developed individuals, depending of the cortical areas studied. Superior coherence involving visual perceptual areas in autism is consistent with an enhanced role of perception in autistic brain organization.

Hemicraniectomy: A New Model for Human Electrophysiology with High Spatio-temporal Resolution	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-ARTERY INFARCTION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EEG; SKULL; GAMMA; SCALP	Human electrophysiological research is generally restricted to scalp EEG, magneto-encephalography, and intracranial electrophysiology. Here we examine a unique patient cohort that has undergone decompressive hemicraniectomy, a surgical procedure wherein a portion of the calvaria is removed for several months during which time the scalp overlies the brain without intervening bone. We quantify the differences in signals between electrodes over areas with no underlying skull and scalp EEG electrodes over the intact skull in the same subjects. Signals over the hemicraniectomy have enhanced amplitude and greater task-related power at higher frequencies (60-115 Hz) compared with signals over skull. We also provide evidence of a metric for trial-by-trial EMG/EEG coupling that is effective over the hemicraniectomy but not intact skull at frequencies >60 Hz. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the hemicraniectomy model provides a means for studying neural dynamics in humans with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution.

Multi-scale phase average waveforms were collected using a conditional phase averaging technique Amplitude of phase average waveform from EEG signals of epilepsy seizure, subclinical epileptic discharge, and EEG signals of normal children were compared and statistically analyzed in the first half-cycle MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multi-scale wavelet coefficient and the evolution of EEG signals were observed during childhood absence epilepsy seizures using wavelet transformation Multi-scale phase average waveforms from EEG signals were observed using a conditional sampling method and phase averaging technique RESULTS: Multi-scale characteristics of EEG signals demonstrated that 12-scale (3 Hz) rhythmical activity was significantly enhanced during childhood absence epilepsy seizure and co-existed with background structure (< 1 Hz, low frequency discharge) The phase average wave exhibited opposed phase abnormal rhythm at 3 Hz Prior to childhood absence epilepsy seizure, EEG detected opposed abnormal a rhythm and 3 Hz composition, which were not detected with traditional EEG. Compared to EEG signals from normal children, epileptic discharges from clinical and subclinical childhood absence epilepsy seizures were positive and amplitude was significantly greater (P < 0 05) CONCLUSION: Wavelet transformation was used to analyze EEG signals from childhood absence epilepsy to obtain multi-scale quantitative characteristics and phase average waveforms Multi-scale wavelet coefficients of EEG signals correlated with childhood absence epilepsy seizure, and multi-scale waveforms prior to epilepsy seizure were similar to characteristics during the onset period Compared to normal children, EEG signals during epilepsy seizure exhibited an opposed phase model	[Zhang, Meiyun; Zhang, Benshu; Wang, Fenglou; Chen, Ying] Tianjin Med Univ, Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Meiyun] Tianjin Peoples Hosp, Dept Neurol, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Nan] Tianjin Univ, Dept Mech, Tianjin 300051, Peoples R China		Zhang, MY (corresponding author), Tianjin Med Univ, Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China.

J	Herrmann, CS; Frund, I; Lenz, D				Herrmann, Christoph S.; Fruend, Ingo; Lenz, Daniel			Human gamma-band activity: A review on cognitive and behavioral correlates and network models	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Behavior; Binding; EEG; Evoked; Gamma-band activity; Induced; Memory-match	EARLY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; MIDDLE-LATENCY RESPONSE; HUMAN EEG; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; REACTION-TIMES; DYNAMICS	Gamma-band oscillations (roughly 30-100 Hz) in human and animal EEG have received considerable attention in the past due to their correlations with cognitive processes. Here, we want to sketch how some of the higher cognitive functions can be explained by memory processes which are known to modulate gamma activity. Especially, the function of binding together the multiple features of a perceived object requires a comparison with contents stored in memory. In addition, we review recent findings about the actual behavioral relevance of human gamma-band activity. Interestingly, rather simple models of spiking neurons are not only able to generate oscillatory activity within the gamma-band range, but even show modulations of these oscillations in line with findings from human experiments.

Fractal Components From Electroencephalogram Provide Features For Brain Computer Interface	ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL SIGNALS AND IMAGES	Biosignal-Brno		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International EURASIP Conference (BIOSIGNAL)	JUN, 2010	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Biomed Engn, European Assoc Speech, Signal & Image Proc (EURASIP), Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMB), Nikon Spol, GMC Co			TIME-SERIES; DIMENSION; EEG	This paper presents an application of nonlinear science to investigate the alteration of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in two brain states, i.e. idle state and imagination of movement. Based on Coarse Graining Spectrum analysis (GCSA) we extract fractal components from the recorded EEG signal in the frequency domain. The aim of this work is to extract reliable features based on random fractal components to apply as features in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Data recorded from six subjects for a BCI system is used to evaluate the proposed method. The result derived from Soft Margin Support Vector Machine classification shows that there is significant discrepancy in spectral components that could be a powerful method in investigating brain activities.

Role of neuronal synchrony in the generation of evoked EEG/MEG responses. J Neurophysiol 104: 3557-3567, 2010. First published October 13, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00138.2010. Evoked EEG/MEG responses are a primary real-time measure of perceptual and cognitive activity in the human brain, but their neuronal generator mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Arguments have been put forward in favor of either "phase-reset" of ongoing oscillations or "added-energy" models. Instead of advocating for one or the other model, here we show theoretically that the differentiation between these two generation mechanisms might not be possible if based solely on macroscopic EEG/MEG recordings. Using mathematical modeling, we show that a simultaneous phase reset of multiple oscillating neuronal (microscopic) sources contributing to EEG/MEG can produce evoked responses in agreement with both, the "added-energy" and the "phase-reset" model. We observe a smooth transition between the two models by just varying the strength of synchronization between the multiple microscopic sources. Consequently, because precise knowledge about the strength of microscopic ensemble synchronization is commonly not available in noninvasive EEG/MEG studies, they cannot, in principle, differentiate between the two mechanisms for macroscopic-evoked responses.

Painful stimuli are of utmost behavioral relevance and can therefore involuntarily affect attentional resources and interfere with ongoing behavior. However, the neuronal mechanisms which subserve the involuntary attentional effects of pain are largely unknown yet. Here, we therefore investigated the neuronal mechanisms of the attentional effects of pain by using electroencephalography during a visual attention task with the concurrent presentation of painful stimuli. Our results confirm that painful and visual stimuli induce gamma oscillations over central and occipital areas, respectively. Pain-induced gamma oscillations were correlated with pain-induced changes in visual gamma oscillations. Behaviorally, we observed variable effects of pain on visual reaction times, yielding an increase of reaction times for some subjects, as well as a decrease of reaction times for others. Most importantly, however, these changes in visual task performance were significantly related to pain-induced changes of visual gamma oscillations. These findings demonstrate that the variable attentional effects of pain are closely related to changes in neuronal gamma oscillations in the human brain. In the hypervigilant state of chronic pain, maladaptive changes in the attentional effects of pain may be associated with abnormal changes in neuronal gamma oscillations. Our findings may thus contribute to the understanding of the neuronal substrates of pain in health and may open a new window towards the understanding of pathological alterations of the pain experience in chronic pain syndromes.

The seizure detection is an important tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, an epileptic seizure classification method based on features of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) of EEG records is proposed. The Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of EEG records are first computed, and then several time and frequency features of IMFs are extracted. A features selection based on a Mann-Whitney test and Lambda of Wilks criterion is performed, then these parameters are used in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify epileptic seizure and normal EEG segments. The algorithm was tested in 3 intracranial channels EEG records acquired in 21 patients with refractory epilepsy and validated by the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg. The signal was divided in 15 s segments. In 45517 segments analyzed (689 with epileptic seizures) the sensitivity and specificity obtained with this method were 69.4% and 69.2% respectively. It could be concluded that the developed method could be a promising tool for epileptic seizure detection in EEG records.

Here we re-analyzed those electroencephalographic (EEG) data to test whether a parallel increase in amplitude of late positive event-related potentials takes place. Methods: Intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) activity had been recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. During the recording of the intracerebral EEG activity, the subjects performed a computerized version of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after the listening of the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Results: We found that late positive event-related potentials (ERPs) peaking at about 350 ms post-stimulus in amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex had a higher amplitude during the listening of the repeated words that were subsequently recalled than for those that were not recalled. Conclusions: Late positive ERPs reflect a functional mechanism implemented in a human brain network spanning amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex which is at the basis of the memorization processes of verbal materials. Significance: This ERP component is a promising neuromarker of successful memorization of repeated words in humans. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Single-Trial EEG-EMG Coherence Analysis Reveals Muscle Fatigue-Related Progressive Alterations in Corticomuscular Coupling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coherence; electroencephalogram (EEG); electromyogram (EMG); fatigue	MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS; SUPRASPINAL FACTORS; PRACTICAL GUIDE; WAVELET; SYNCHRONIZATION; OUTPUT; TASK; STIMULATION; MODULATION; PRECISION	Voluntary muscle fatigue is a progressive process. A recent study demonstrated muscle fatigue-induced weakening of functional corticomuscular coupling measured by coherence between the brain [electroencephalogram (EEG)] and muscle [electromyogram (EMG)] signals after a relatively long-duration muscle contraction. Comparing the EEG-EMG coherence before versus after fatigue or between data of two long-duration time blocks is not adequate to reveal the dynamic nature of the fatigue process. The purpose of this study was to address this issue by quantifying single-trial EEG-EMG coherence and EEG, EMG power based on wavelet transform. Eight healthy subjects performed 200 maximal intermittent handgrip contractions in a single session with handgrip force, EEG and EMG signals acquired simultaneously. The EEG and EMG data during each 2-s handgrip was subjected to single trial EEG-EMG wavelet energy spectrum and coherence computation. The EEG-EMG coherence and energy spectrum at beta (15 similar to 35 Hz) and gamma (35-50 Hz) frequency bands were statistically analyzed in 2-block (75 trials per block), 5-block (30 trials/block), and 10-block (15 trials/block) data settings. The energy of both the EEG and EMG signals decreased significantly with muscle fatigue. The EEG-EMG coherence had a significant reduction for the 2-block comparison. More detailed dynamical changing and inter-subject variation of the EEG-EMG coherence and energy were revealed by 5- and 10-block comparisons. These results show feasibility of wavelet transform-based measurement of the EEG-EMG coherence and corresponding energy based on single-trial data, which provides extra information to demonstrate a time course of dynamic adaptations of the functional corticomuscular coupling, as well as brain and muscle signals during muscle fatigue.

Methods: Four healthy volunteers were instructed to perform an intended motor imagery task following an external sync signal in order to turn on a virtual switch provided on a computer screen. No specific mental task was required during the 'No Control' state. The beta band event-related frequency power (event-related desynchronization or ERD) from a single EEG Laplacian channel was monitored online in real-time. The computer continuously monitored the relative ERD power level until it exceeded a pre-set threshold and turned on the virtual switch. Results: Subject 1 achieved lowest average false positive rate of 0.4 +/- 0.9% in a five-session online study during the entire 'No Control' state, whereby the subject required 6.8 +/- 0.6 s of active urging time or total response time of 20.5 +/- 1.9 s to perform repeated attempts in order to turn on the switch in the online interactive switch operation. The average false positive rate among four subjects was 0.8 +/- 0.4% with average active urging time of 12.3 +/- 4.4 s or average response time of 36.9 +/- 13.0 s. Offline analysis from subject 2 shows that the overall performance from 10-fold cross-validation was 96.2% with 3 consecutive epoch averaging, which was further improved to 99.0% by computationally intensive methods. Conclusions: The novel design of the brain-controlled switch using the ERD feature associated with motor imagery achieved minimal false positive rate with a reasonable active urging time or response time to activate the switch. Significance: The reliability and convenience of the developed brain-controlled switch may extend current brain-computer interface capacities in practical communication and control applications.

Motor imagery has been successfully used in BCI for communication and control. During motor imagery, for EEG based BCI, it was known that the discriminative frequency bands are subject-specific. Moreover, such discriminative frequency bands for each subject might vary from time to time. In this paper, we investigate the variability of discriminative spectral ranges and its impact on classification accuracy. It is found that for each subject, his discriminative frequency bands changes significantly from session to session, but keeps almost stable within a session. We then propose a method to adaptively update the discriminative frequency bands using Time-Frequency fisher ratio. From the experimental analysis, it is found that we can reduce the average error rate by 11.50% compared to the case where fixed discriminative frequency bands obtained from calibration session are used.

One way to bypass such attributes would be to employ ambiguous stimuli that are not biased toward any particular object class and analyze neural activity in response to those stimuli in a manner similar to traditional reverse correlation for mapping visual receptive fields. Accordingly, we sought to derive whole face representations directly from neural activity in the human brain using electroencephalography (EEG). We presented ambiguous fractal noise stimuli to human participants and asked them to rate each stimulus along a "face not present" to "face present" continuum while simultaneously recording EEGs. All EEGs were subjected to a time-frequency analysis near 170 ms (negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset have been linked to early face processing) for five different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) on a trial-by-trial basis, independent of the behavioral responses. Images containing apparent face-like structure were obtained for theta through gamma frequency bands for strong negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset. The presence of the face-like structure in the spatial images derived from brain signals was objectively verified using both Fourier methods and trained neural networks. The results support the use of a modified reverse correlation technique with EEG as a non-biased assessment of brain processes involved in the complex integration of spatial information into objects such as human faces.

Electroencephalograms and physical reflexes of broilers after electrical waterbath stunning using an alternating current	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						broiler; stunning; rectangular alternating current; electroencephalogram; physical reflex	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SLAUGHTER METHODS; CHICKENS; FREQUENCY; POULTRY; BRAIN; DC	Stunning efficiency of broilers after electrical waterbath stunning with an alternating current was assessed using electroencephalograms (EEG) and physical reflexes. Four hundred eighty-nine broilers (246 males and 243 females) were stunned in an electrical waterbath with a rectangular alternating stunning current of 60, 80, 100, 120, and 150 mA and frequencies of 70, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,500 Hz. Stunning time was 10 s. The EEG was recorded for 120 s poststun. Occurrence of spontaneous breathing, eye blinking, and wing flapping and the corneal reflex were recorded. The EEG was analyzed regarding the occurrence of a profound suppression to less than 10% of the prestun level in the 2 to 30-Hz band and 13 to 30-Hz band. The occurrence of epileptiform patterns was assessed and the occurrence of clonic-tonic convulsions was recorded. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant effect of stunning frequency and stunning current for all groups in the EEG analysis. Stunning frequencies above 400 Hz or below 100 mA did not result in profound suppression of brain power to less than 10% of the prestun level in more than 90% of the broilers and can therefore not be recommended. More than 80% of the birds stunned with 70 or 100 Hz at 100 mA or 70, 100, and 200 Hz with 120 and 150 mA did not recover from stunning. The occurrence of epileptiform activity could only be observed in a few birds. It is assumed that this is due to the long stunning time of 10 s and epileptiform activity could have occurred just before EEG recording started. A maximum of 30% of birds with corneal reflexes and spontaneous eye blinking should not be exceeded, whereas at 15 s poststun, not more than 15% of birds should show spontaneous eye blinking. Wing flapping occurred in at least 50% of birds with adequate stunning results. This seems to be related to convulsions and could cause meat quality defects.

Then the index is used to separate healthy participants from epileptic and manic patients based on spontaneous EEG analysis. Finally, it is used to track a tonic-clonic seizure EEG signal, and a conspicuous change was found in the complexity profiles of delta band (1-3.5 Hz) oscillations at the onset of seizure. We conclude that this index would be useful for quantification of a wide range of time series including neural oscillations.

For a long time it is known that EEG activity is altered by drugs. Quantitative EEG analysis helps to delineate effects of antidepressants on brain activity. Cordance is an EEG measure with a superior correlation with regional brain perfusion. Prefrontal quantitative EEG cordance appears to be a predictor of the response to antidepressants. Sleep EEG shows characteristic changes in depression as impaired sleep continuity, desinhibition of REM sleep and changes of nonREM sleep. Elevated REM density (a measure for frequency of rapid eye movements) characterizes an endophenotype in family studies of depression. REM-sleep changes including a more distinct REM rebound after sleep deprivation are found in animal models of depression. Most antidepressants suppress REM sleep in depressed patients, normal controls and laboratory animals. REM suppression appears to be a distinct, but not an absolute requirement for antidepressive effects of a compound. Sleep-EEG variables like REM latency or certain clusters of variables were shown to predict the response to the treatment with a certain antidepressant or even the course of the disorder for several years. Some of these predictive sleep-EEG markers of the longterm course of depression appear to be closely related to hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical system activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sleep EEG Predictors and Correlates of the Response to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia	SLEEP			English	Article						Insomnia; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; EEG; spectral analysis; homeostatic sleep drive	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPINDLE FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; POWER SPECTRA; ADENOSINERGIC MODULATION; DYSFUNCTIONAL BELIEFS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; DELTA-ACTIVITY; NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; DEPRIVATION	Study Objectives: Determine the relationship of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral measures and the response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in primary insomnia (PI). Design: Patients with PI were randomly assigned to CBT or a placebo intervention (PC). Ambulatory polysomnography was performed before and after treatment. Setting: University medical center sleep laboratory. Participants: Thirty PI patients with sleep maintenance difficulty evident in subjective sleep measures. Interventions: CBT and PC. Results: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night, compared with PC. This change was associated with subjective improvement in response to CBT. Furthermore, lower pretreatment peak EEG delta power in the first NREM cycle and a more gradual decline in delta power predicted a better response to CBT. Increased wake time during the day produced by CBT was correlated with an increase in the steepness of the slope of EEG delta power and subjective improvement. Traditional polysomnography measures were associated with the subjective CBT response to a greater degree among patients whose total sleep time estimates better approximated polysomnography-derived total sleep time. In contrast, changes in all-night averaged NREM EEG spectral indices were more strongly related to subjective improvement in individuals who underestimated total sleep time to a greater extent. Conclusions: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night. This change is linked to the therapeutic effect of CBT, which appears to occur in conjunction with an increase in homeostatic sleep drive. Traditional polysomnography indices and all-night averaged NREM EEG measures appear to be related to subjective improvements with CBT in subsets of patients with PI.

J	Min, BK; Park, HJ				Min, Byoung-Kyong; Park, Hae-Jeong			Task-related modulation of anterior theta and posterior alpha EEG reflects top-down preparation	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VISUAL EVOKED-RESPONSE; CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ERROR-DETECTION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY	Background: Prestimulus EEG alpha activity in humans has been considered to reflect ongoing top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks. Since theta oscillations may be related to poststimulus top-down processing, we investigated whether prestimulus EEG theta activity also reflects top-down cognitive preparation for a stimulus. Results: We recorded EEG data from 15 healthy controls performing a color and shape discrimination task, and used the wavelet transformation to investigate the time course and power of oscillatory activity in the signals. We observed a relationship between both anterior theta and posterior alpha power in the prestimulus period and the type of subsequent task. Conclusions: Since task-differences were reflected in both theta and alpha activities prior to stimulus onset, both prestimulus theta (particularly around the anterior region) and prestimulus alpha (particularly around the posterior region) activities may reflect prestimulus top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks.

The proposed method is based on the principle component analysis known also as the Karhunen-Lo,ve transform. Features frequently used in the sleep stage classification studies were divided into three main groups: (i) time-domain features, (ii) frequency-domain features, and (iii) hybrid features. That how well features in each group separate the sleep stages was determined by performing extensive simulations and it was seen that the results obtained are in agreement with those available in the literature. Considering the fact that sleep stage classification algorithms consist of two steps, namely feature extraction and classification, it will be possible to tell a priori whether the classification step will provide successful results or not without carrying out its realization thanks to the proposed method.

Using high-density scalp electroencephalography, we examined how synchronized activity depends on visual stimulus information and on individual observer sensitivity. In a perceptual grouping task, we varied the ambiguity of visual stimuli and estimated observer sensitivity to this variation. We found that durations of synchronized activity in the beta frequency band were associated with both stimulus ambiguity and sensitivity: the lower the stimulus ambiguity and the higher individual observer sensitivity the longer were the episodes of synchronized activity. Durations of synchronized activity intervals followed an extreme value distribution, indicating that they were limited by the slowest mechanism among the multiple neural mechanisms engaged in the perceptual task. Because the degree of stimulus ambiguity is (inversely) related to the amount of stimulus information, the durations of synchronous episodes reflect the amount of stimulus information processed in the task. We therefore interpreted our results as evidence that the alternating episodes of desynchronized and synchronized electrical brain activity reflect, respectively, the processing of information within local regions and the transfer of information across regions.

Theta synchrony supports Weber-Fechner and Stevens' Laws for error processing, uniting high and low mental processes	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Weber-Fechner Law; Stevens' Law; EEG oscillations; theta; ACC; rule violation	WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; CONFLICT; REPRESENTATIONS; CORTEX; JUDGMENTS; FEEDBACK; NUMBERS; POWER	Human brain theta rhythm has been related to the operation of a generic mechanism involved in error detection processes of different types (e.g., detecting incorrect motor responses or incorrect arithmetic equations). This theta activity seems to be sensitive to error salience or magnitude, that is, stronger theta activity is found with larger or more deviant errors (e.g., 1+2=8) than with smaller or less deviant ones (e.g., 1+2=4). A time-frequency decomposition analysis indicated that theta activity is modulated by the magnitude of erroneous information in a nonlinear fashion, which can be characterized using Weber-Fechner's law of logarithmic function and Stevens' law of power function. The present study suggests that the generic mechanisms for error detection and evaluation may share similar fundamental neural schemes with primary cognitive and sensory or perceptual processes, which are directly involved in processing the specific type of input.

J	Oren, I; Hajos, N; Paulsen, O				Oren, Iris; Hajos, Norbert; Paulsen, Ole			Identification of the current generator underlying cholinergically induced gamma frequency field potential oscillations in the hippocampal CA3 region	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; IN-VITRO; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; INTERNEURONS; INHIBITION; RAT; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; CORTEX; MODEL	Gamma frequency oscillations (30-100 Hz) are prominent in the hippocampal EEG signal during active network states. An intrahippocampal gamma generator has been identified in the CA3 region. To understand the mechanism of oscillation generation, both the rhythm and the current generators must be identified. While earlier work has elucidated mechanisms of rhythm generation, little attention has been given to identifying the CA3 gamma current generator. Here, we aimed to identify a current generator underlying cholinergically induced gamma frequency oscillations in vitro. To this end, we analysed the instantaneous fluctuations in the wavelet amplitude of the field potential oscillation recorded in the stratum pyramidale, and concomitantly recorded action potentials and synaptic input in individual, anatomically identified neurons. The data revealed that perisomatic inhibitory currents in pyramidal cells generated the majority of the field potential. Pyramidal cell action currents also contributed to the field. In contrast, we found no evidence that excitatory currents contribute significantly to the field oscillations in this model. The moment-by-moment analysis of the dynamics of the field potential presented here provides insight into the distinct contributions of synaptic and action currents to the EEG signal and sheds light on the changing balance of excitation and inhibition during cholinergically induced gamma frequency oscillations.

Removal of Movement Artifact From High-Density EEG Recorded During Walking and Running	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; STRIDE INTERVAL; DYNAMICS; FMRI; GAIT; SEPARATION; QUALITY	Gwin JT, Gramann K, Makeig S, Ferris DP. Removal of movement artifact from high-density EEG recorded during walking and running. J Neurophysiol 103: 3526-3534, 2010. First published April 21, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00105.2010. Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in static seated or prone conditions. EEG signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then performed component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to 8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.

We use intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to validate our fMRI/MEG measurements. Twelve controls completed a semantic judgment task with fMRI and MEG that included words presented once (new, 'N') and words that repeated (old. 'O') Six patients with epilepsy completed the same task during iEEG recordings Blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses for N vs. I words were examined across the cortical surface and within regions of interest. MEG waveforms for N vs. O words were estimated using a noise-normalized minimum norm solution, and used to interpret the timecourse of fMRI Spatial concordance was observed between fMRI and MEG repetition effects from 350 to 450 ms within bilateral occipitotemporal and medial temporal, left prefrontal, and left posterior temporal cortex Additionally, MEG revealed widespread sources within left temporoparietal regions, whereas fMRI revealed bilateral reductions in occipitotemporal and left superior frontal, and increases in inferior parietal, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal activity BOLD suppression in left posterior temporal, left inferior prefrontal, and right occipitotemporal cortex correlated with MEG repetition-related reductions IEEG responses from all three regions supported the timecourse of MEG and localization of fMRI. Furthermore, iEEG decreases to repeated words were associated with decreased gamma power in several regions, providing evidence that gamma oscillations are tightly coupled to cognitive phenomena and reflect regional activations seen in the BOLD signal (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[McDonald, Carrie R.] Multimodal Imaging Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [McDonald, Carrie R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [McDonald, Carrie R.; Thesen, Thomas; Girard, Holly M.; Sherfey, Jason S.; Cash, Sydney S.; Leonard, Matthew K.; Hagler, Donald J., Jr.; Dale, Anders M.; Halgren, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Multimodal Imaging Lab, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Blumberg, Mark; Trongnetrpunya, Amy; Devinsky, Orrin; Kuzniecky, Rubin] NYU, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, Dept Neurol, New York, NY USA; [Dolye, Werner K.] NYU, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Cash, Sydney S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA USA; [Hagler, Donald J., Jr.; Dale, Anders M.; Halgren, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Radiol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Dale, Anders M.; Halgren, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Leonard, Matthew K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cognit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA		McDonald, CR (corresponding author), Multimodal Imaging Lab, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,Suite C101, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

Changes in subthalamic activity during movement observation in Parkinson's disease: Is the mirror system mirrored in the basal ganglia?	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Local field potentials; Parkinson's disease; Mirror neuron system; Movement observation; Subthalamic nucleus	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURON SYSTEM; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; IMITATION; NUCLEUS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS	Objective: The observation of a voluntary movement executed by another person is associated with an alpha and beta EEG desynchronization over the motor cortex, thought to reflect activity from the human "mirror neuron" system. The aim of our work was to study the changes in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship with cortical activity, during movement observation. Methods: Bilateral EEG and STN LFP recordings were acquired in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, through surgically implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Oscillatory changes during movement execution and movement observation were compared with two different control conditions (simple stimulus and rotating stimulus observation), in "off" and "on" motor states. Time-frequency transforms and event-related coherence were used for the analysis. Results: Movement observation was accompanied by bilateral beta reduction in subthalamic power and cortico-STN coherence, which was smaller than the decrease observed during movement execution, but significant when compared with the two control conditions. Conclusions: Movement observation is accompanied by changes in the beta oscillatory activity of the STN, similar to those observed in the EEG. Significance: These changes suggest that the basal ganglia might be engaged by the activity of the human mirror system. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Faes, L; Nollo, G				Faes, Luca; Nollo, Giandomenico			Extended causal modeling to assess Partial Directed Coherence in multiple time series with significant instantaneous interactions	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Partial Directed Coherence; Granger causality; Multivariate autoregressive models; Multivariate time series; EEG; Cardiovascular variability	PRESSURE VARIABILITY INTERACTIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABILITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; HEART PERIOD; SIGNALS; IDENTIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; DIRECTIONALITY	The Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and its generalized formulation (gPDC) are popular tools for investigating, in the frequency domain, the concept of Granger causality among multivariate (MV) time series. PDC and gPDC are formalized in terms of the coefficients of an MV autoregressive (MVAR) model which describes only the lagged effects among the time series and forsakes instantaneous effects. However, instantaneous effects are known to affect linear parametric modeling, and are likely to occur in experimental time series. In this study, we investigate the impact on the assessment of frequency domain causality of excluding instantaneous effects from the model underlying PDC evaluation. Moreover, we propose the utilization of an extended MVAR model including both instantaneous and lagged effects. This model is used to assess PDC either in accordance with the definition of Granger causality when considering only lagged effects (iPDC), or with an extended form of causality, when we consider both instantaneous and lagged effects (ePDC). The approach is first evaluated on three theoretical examples of MVAR processes, which show that the presence of instantaneous correlations may produce misleading profiles of PDC and gPDC, while ePDC and iPDC derived from the extended model provide here a correct interpretation of extended and lagged causality. It is then applied to representative examples of cardiorespiratory and EEG MV time series. They suggest that ePDC and iPDC are better interpretable than PDC and gPDC in terms of the known cardiovascular and neural physiologies.

Multivariate EEG signals were recorded while participants made preference decisions, based on approachability, between two faces presented sequentially with unrestricted viewing time; the decision being made after presentation of the second face. The paired faces were similar in their physical properties, emphasizing the role of the subjective experience of the participants in making the decisions. EEG signals were analyzed in terms of event-related-potential (ERP) components and wavelet-based time-frequency-representations (TFR). The behavioural data showed that the presentation order and the exposure duration did not influence preference formation. The EEG data showed three effects. The earliest effect, the sustained posterior ERP positivity for preferred first faces as compared to non-preferred first faces, was found following the onset of the first face, and this was interpreted as the formation of a positive first impression of the first face. The two later effects following the second faces were an increase of frontal theta band oscillations around 500 ms for preferred second faces and of posterior gamma band oscillations around 650 ms for preferred first faces: both of which were interpreted as being related to the formation of a preference. All of these effects occurred well before the moment of conscious decision, thereby suggesting the implicitness of these neurally identifiable components. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Predicting stimulus-locked single unit spiking from cortical local field potentials	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						LFP; Spike prediction; Auditory cortex; Gamma band; Theta band; Beta band; Oscillation; Bayesian algorithm; A1; Evoked potentials; Electroencephalography; EEG; Hilbert transform; Single cortical cells; Phase; Despiking	VISUAL-CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN NEOCORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FREQUENCY; MODULATION	The rapidly increasing use of the local field potential (LFP) has motivated research to better understand its relation to the gold standard of neural activity, single unit (SU) spiking. We addressed this in an in vivo, awake, restrained mouse auditory cortical electrophysiology preparation by asking whether the LFP could actually be used to predict stimulus-evoked SU spiking. Implementing a Bayesian algorithm to predict the likelihood of spiking on a trial by trial basis from different representations of the despiked LFP signal, we were able to predict, with high quality and fine temporal resolution (2 ms), the time course of a SU's excitatory or inhibitory firing rate response to natural species-specific vocalizations. Our best predictions were achieved by representing the LFP by its wide-band Hilbert phase signal, and approximating the statistical structure of this signal at different time points as independent. Our results show that each SU's action potential has a unique relationship with the LFP that can be reliably used to predict the occurrence of spikes. This "signature" interaction can reflect both pre- and post-spike neural activity that is intrinsic to the local circuit rather than just dictated by the stimulus. Finally, the time course of this "signature" may be most faithful when the full bandwidth of the LFP, rather than specific narrow-band components, is used for representation.

The aim of this work is to analyze the variation of neuron activity of the brain after the stimuli from the acupuncture. The analysis has been carried out by applying sample entropy, which is a non-linear organization estimator. Through the calculation, the sample entropy before the stimulation of acupuncture Neiguan and Shenmen was compared with after the stimulation. The result shows that the sample entropy is smaller after the stimulation of acupuncturing the acupoints Shenmen and Neiguan. It shows higher regularity of the EEG signal after the acupuncture compare to the signal before the acupuncture.

They are thought to underlie the restorative function of sleep. We investigated the behaviour of slow oscillations in humans under increased sleep pressure to assess their contribution to sleep homeostasis. EEG recordings (C3A2) of baseline and recovery sleep after sleep deprivation (eight healthy males, mean age 23 years; 40 h of prolonged wakefulness) were analysed. Half-waves were defined as positive or negative deflections between consecutive zero crossings in the 0.5-2 Hz range of the band-pass filtered EEG. Increased sleep pressure resulted in a redistribution of half-waves between 0.5 and 2 Hz: the number of half-waves per minute was reduced below 0.9 Hz while it was increased above 1.2 Hz. EEG power was increased above 1 Hz. The increase in frequency was accompanied by increased slope of the half-waves and decreased number of multi-peak waves. In both baseline and recovery sleep, amplitude and slope were correlated highly over a broad frequency range and positive half-waves were characterized by a lower frequency than the negative ones, pointing to a longer duration of up- than down-states. We hypothesize that the higher frequency of slow oscillatory activity after prolonged wakefulness may relate to faster alternations between up- and down-states at the cellular level under increased sleep pressure. This study does not question slow-wave activity as a marker of sleep homeostasis, as the observed changes occurred within the same frequency range.

At the same time. closed eyes and open eyes conditions differed from each other by the percent distribution of different types of SPs The probabilities for the occurrence of particular SP types were typical for each of the examined conditions with domination of alpha-rhythmical SPs during closed eyes condition and domination of delta-theta-rhythmical SPs during open eyes condition The findings suggest that the diversity of SPs varies as a function of functional state of the brain during resting conditions Understanding of the diversity of short-term EEG SP types is important theoretically and practically, and is significant for advancing the interpretation of the EEG signal (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

Currently, parameters (e.g. channels and frequency band) are often manually selected. It is time-consuming and not easy to obtain an optimal combination of parameters for a BCI. In this paper, motor imagery-based BCIs are considered, in which channels and frequency band are key parameters. First, a semi-supervised support vector machine algorithm is proposed for automatically selecting a set of channels with given frequency band. Next, this algorithm is extended for joint channel-frequency selection. In this approach, both training data with labels and test data without labels are used for training a classifier. Hence it can be used in small training data case. Finally, our algorithms are applied to a BCI competition data set. Our data analysis results show that these algorithms are effective for selection of frequency band and channels when the training data set is small.

StereoEEG (SEEG) recordings were analyzed in four patients with medically intractable partial seizures due to focal cortical dysplasia type IIA. Characteristics of HFO within seizure onset zone (SOZ), irritative zone, and remote brain areas were investigated. Whilst the rate of occurrence for ripples (80-200 Hz) was significantly higher in recordings from within than outside the SOZ, the rate of fast ripples (200-450 Hz) was less reliable index of SOZ. Interestingly, the mean powers across subjects were significantly higher within than outside the SOZ in both ripple and fast ripple frequency ranges. Our study demonstrates a capacity of interictal HFO to detect the SOZ in focal cortical dysplasias. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have indicated that the holistic properties of mental imagery generation can be evaluated more easily than the partial properties. However, the relationship between partial and holistic mental imagery generations has not been clearly demonstrated. To address this issue, we designed a task to investigate the changes in the spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during partial or holistic imagery generation. EEG signals were obtained from 18 healthy subjects, and a statistical measure of spectral dynamics between two EEG signals in per frequency band was performed. Additionally, a bicoherence spectrum analysis was used to detect the phase coupling within these two imagery conditions. Our results indicated that EEG of the partial imagery appeared earlier and stronger than that of the holistic imagery in the theta (5-8 Hz) range in a time window around 220 to 300 ms after cue onset, and a slight decrease in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band was observed at around 270 ms. The scalp topography of these changes in the theta and alpha bands distributed overall significantly in the frontal and central-temporal areas. The significant phase coupling within two conditions was remarkable at high frequency. From these results, we infer that there are complex relations between partial and holistic imageries. The generation of partial mental imagery is not a subprocess of holistic imagery, but it is relevant to holistic imagery and requires correct modification from the holistic information.

Mobile-phone pulse triggers evoked potentials	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mobile phone; Electric field; Evoked potentials; Recurrence analysis; Nonlinear	ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELD; LOCALIZATION; EEG	If mobile-phone electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are hazardous, as suggested in the literature, processes or mechanisms must exist that allow the body to detect the fields. We hypothesized that the low-frequency pulses produced by mobile phones (217 Hz) were detected by sensory transduction. as evidenced by the ability of the pulses to trigger evoked potentials (EPs). Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from six standard locations in 20 volunteers and analyzed to detect brain potentials triggered by a pulse of the type produced by mobile phones. Evoked potentials having the expected latency were found in 90% of the volunteers, as assessed using a nonlinear method of EEG analysis. Evoked potentials were not detected when the EEG was analyzed using time averaging. The possibility of systematic error was excluded by sham-exposure analyses. The results implied that mobile-phones trigger EP at the rate of 217 Hz during ordinary phone use. Chronic production of the changes in brain activity might be pertinent to the reports of health hazards among mobile-phone users. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG signals of patients with mildAD are transformed to a wavelet time-frequency representation, and afterwards a sparsification process (bump modeling) extracts time-frequency oscillatory bursts. We observed that organized oscillatory events contain stronger discriminative signatures than averaged spectral EEG statistics for patients in a probable early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, bump modeling enhanced the difference between mildAD patients and age-matched control subjects in the theta and beta frequency ranges. This effect is consistent with previous results obtained on other databases.

Those issues include: EEG preprocessing, checking if the necessary conditions of VAR model applicability are met, optimal order selection, and assessment of the validity of fitted VAR model. Both non-directed (ordinary coherence and imaginary part of the complex-valued coherency) and directed (directed coherence, directed transfer function and partial directed coherence) measures of the strength of inter-channel coupling are discussed. These measures are analyzed with respect to their properties (scale invariance) and known problems in using them (spurious interactions, volume conduction).

J	Busch, NA; VanRullen, R				Busch, Niko A.; VanRullen, Rufin			Spontaneous EEG oscillations reveal periodic sampling of visual attention	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WAGON WHEEL ILLUSION; ALPHA-PHASE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; STIMULUS ONSET; REACTION TIME; BRAIN; PERCEPTION	An important effect of sustained attention is the facilitation of perception. Although the term "sustained" suggests that this beneficial effect endures continuously as long as something is attended, we present electrophysiological evidence that perception at attended locations is actually modulated periodically. Subjects detected brief light flashes that were presented peripherally at locations that were either attended or unattended. We analyzed the correlation between detection performance for attended and unattended stimuli and the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations, which relate to subsecond fluctuations of neuronal excitability. Although on average, detection performance was improved by attention-indicated by reduced detection thresholds at attended locations-we found that detection performance for attended stimuli actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of spontaneous oscillations in the. (approximate to 7 Hz) frequency band just before stimulus onset. This fluctuation was absent for unattended stimuli. This pattern of results suggests that "sustained" attention in fact exerts its facilitative effect on perception in a periodic fashion.

Evoked and event related coherence of Alzheimer patients manifest differentiation of sensory-cognitive networks	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer; Evoked coherence; Event related coherence; Oddball paradigm; Brain oscillation; Cholinergic	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS	In previous studies on Alzheimer's patients it was shown that, in frontal and parietal locations, delta and theta responses of AD patients were greatly reduced. The present study analyzed coherence functions in these highly affected frontal and parietal areas. Visual sensory and event related coherences of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (AD) were analyzed comparatively. A total of 38 mild, probable AD subjects (19 untreated, 19 treated with cholinesterase inhibitors) were compared with a group of 19 healthy controls. The sensory evoked coherence and event related target coherences were analyzed for delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency ranges for long-range intra-hemispheric (F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2) electrode pairs. The healthy control group showed significantly higher values of event related coherence in "delta", "theta" and "alpha" bands in comparison to the de nova and medicated AD groups (p<0.01 for the delta, theta and alpha) upon application of a target stimuli. In contrast, almost no changes in event related coherences were observed in beta and gamma frequency bands. Furthermore, no differences were recorded between healthy and AD groups upon application of simple light stimuli. Besides this, coherence values upon application of target stimuli were higher than sensory evoked coherence in all groups and in all frequency bands (p<0.01). The cognitive networks of AD patients were highly impaired in comparison to networks activated by sensory stimulation, thus showing separate activation of sensory and cognitive networks.

These configurations are known as states (Wake, REM sleep and NonREM sleep) and stages (N1-N3 within NREM sleep). These two fundamental descriptive domains, time course and variable configuration, can be readily rendered available through improved visualization techniques. Time course is summarized by EEG spectrograms, instantaneous frequency analysis of cardio-respiratory signals and other sleep dependent variables. State and stage configurations can be further evidenced as clusters in 2D or 3D spaces whose axis are sleep-relevant extracted variables. The latter techniques also allows for visualization of transition process as pathways from one cluster to another.

In addition. gamma-band oscillations have attracted much interest during the last few years since they are thought to play a Crucial role in many aspects of brain function related to perception and cognition. It was the aim of the present simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study to identify brain regions specifically involved in the generation of the auditory gamma-band response (GBR) using single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI. Ten healthy Subjects participated in this study Three different runs of an auditory choice reaction task with increasing difficulty were performed Brain activity was recorded simultaneously with high density FEG (61 channels) and fMRI (1.5 T). BOLD correlates of the GBR have been predicted using the sing-le-trial amplitude of the GBR Reaction times (p<0.001). error rates (p<005) and self-ratings of task difficulty and effort demands (p<0.001) were related to the level of difficulty in the task In addition,we found a significant influence of task difficulty oil the amplitude of the GBR at Cz (p<0.05). Using single-trial Coupling of EEG and fMRI GBR-specific activations were found only in the auditory cortex, the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the most difficult run. Single-trial coupling might be a useful method in order to increase our knowledge about the functional neuroanatomy of "neural ensembles" coupled by 40 Hz oscillations (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, it has been shown that the hippocampus is important for WM maintenance of multiple items or associations between item features. Previous studies using intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the hippocampus of patients with epilepsy revealed slow positive potentials during maintenance of a single item and during LTM encoding, but slow negative potentials during maintenance of multiple items. These findings predict that WM maintenance of multiple items interferes with LTM encoding, because these two processes are associated with slow potentials of opposing polarities in the hippocampus. Here, we tested this idea in a dual-task paradigm involving a LTM encoding task nested into a WM Sternberg task with either a low (one item) or a high (three items) memory load. In the high WM load condition, LTM encoding was significantly impoverished, and slow hippocampal potentials were more negative than in the low WM load condition. Time-frequency analysis revealed that a reduction of slow hippocampal activity in the delta frequency range supported LTM formation in the low load condition, but not during high WM load. Together, these findings indicate that multi-item WM and LTM encoding interfere within the hippocampus.

The relative powers of EEG for delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands as well as the characteristics of their time evolution and their relationships with the concentrations of anaesthetics were used as the EEG spectra indices. The time evolutions of the individual wave powers in 75% of patients were similar for all the anaesthetics used in this study at the same method of administration. Well correlated biphasic changes in the slow and fast wave powers emerged after propofol induction as well as in association with the volatile anaesthetics action. Wave powers as well as their relationships with the anaesthetic concentrations were not hampered by the variability across the patients and anaesthetics used in this study. Comparing the branches of increasing and decreasing concentration, the hysteresis phenomenon, i.e. systematic decrease or increase of each wave power, was observed at the end of anaesthesia for each of the volatile anaesthetics. A rapid increase of sevoflurane concentration at the initial phase of anaesthesia caused more effective attenuation of beta waves than in the case of gradual anaesthetic administration but it happened at the cost of the intensification of delta waves.

In mice, EGCG antagonized the caffeine-induced reduction in both the open arm entry number and time-spent in open arm on elevated plus-maze. In addition, EGCG also antagonized the caffeine-induced reduction in both the central zone distance and central zone time-spent on an open field apparatus, respectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from the rat anterior cerebral cortex. Caffeine increased the power density-ratios of fast (FW: 8.00-20.00 Hz) and slow (SW: 0.75-8.00 Hz) frequency spectrum bands in these EEG recordings. However, EGCG reduced the caffeine-induced increase of FW/SW ratios. Thus, EGCG reverses caffeine-induced anxiogenic-like effects. We also provide additional evidence that the EEG FW/SW (or SW/FW) ratios can be a useful tool for the prediction of anxiogenic and/or anxiolytic effects in an animal model.

Given that the visual marking of HFOs is highly time-consuming and subjective, automatic detectors are necessary. In this study, we present a novel automatic detector that detects HFOs by incorporating information of previously detected baselines. The detector was trained on 72 channels and tested on 278, achieving a mean sensitivity of 96.8% with a mean false positive rate of 4.86%. This low rate is reasonable since only visually marked baseline segments were considered as the true negatives. This detector could be useful for the systematic study of HFOs and for their eventual clinical application.

In this paper we present the initial results for an automatic seizure detection Matlab-based tool being developed. It tries to recognize some seizures clues, such as amplitude/frequency increases and rhythms between 3 and 20 Hz, all of them lasting at least 10 seconds. The increases in the power ratios alpha/delta and alpha/theta are used to flag events that are likely to be Seizures. The envelope trend is used to determine increases in the peak to peak amplitude. The cross-correlation analysis enables the comparison between 2 EEG channels.

Non-linear recurrence analysis of NREM human sleep microstructure discloses deterministic oscillation patterns related to sleep stage transitions and sleep maintenance	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EEG; QUANTIFICATION	Sleep is a dynamic process aimed at obtaining the required neurophysiological states at certain times, according to circadian and homeostatic needs and despite external or internal interfering stimuli. In this context, peculiar transient synchronized EEG patterns (TSEP) are supposed to play the main role in the building up of EEG synchronization and in the flexible adaptation against perturbations Our study aimed at disclosing and quantifying attractor driven, hidden periodicity or, conversely, chaotic oscillation patterns in the series of these TSEP related to sleep stage transitions and sleep maintenance. At first we devised a multistep algorithm, able to capture TSEP from EEG during sleep in 10 healthy volunteers. The time series of TSEP were then analyzed according to the Recurrence Plot (RP). TSEP series showed to form a pseudo-periodic series which becomes progressively denser and more stable until steady slow wave NREM sleep is reached, but looses stability just before REM sleep starts. This suggests that deterministic oscillatory patterns maybe adequate descriptors of the balance between homeostatic needs for NREM sleep and REM sleep pressure, supported by different cortical neuronal populations interactions.

We employ a test-retest strategy using two large sample normative databases (N = 57 and 84). Using a BSS method in the complex Fourier domain, we show that we can rigourously study the out-of-phase dependence of the extracted components, albeit they are extracted so as to be in-phase independent (by BSS definition). Our focus on lagged communication between components effectively yields dependence measures unbiased by volume conduction effects, which is a major concern about the validity of any dependence measures issued by EEG measurements. We are able to show the organization of the extracted components in two networks. Within each network components oscillate coherently with multiple-frequency dynamics, whereas between networks they exchange information at non-random multiple time-lag rates.

Cross-regional cortical synchronization during affective image viewing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Emotion; Motivated attention; EEG Coherence; Beta oscillation; Prefrontal cortex	OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; EMOTION; MODULATION; COHERENCE; CORTEX; GAMMA	Affective perception has been suggested to involve the coordinated activation of widely distributed cortical networks, including those involved in sensory storage/analysis and higher-order structures, such as the prefrontal cortex that regulate these processes. We measured regional electroencephalogram (EEG) activity while young adult participants viewed images varying in arousal and valence (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant). Viewing highly arousing images led to a significant enhancement of EEG coherence between prefrontal and posterior electrodes in both cerebral hemispheres. Long distance interhemispheric coherence also increased during affective image viewing, but only among females. Increases in coherent brain electrical activity were specific to oscillations in the beta (14 to 30 Hz) bandwidth, while right hemispheric networks oscillating in the theta (4 to 7 Hz) range tended to de-synchronize during viewing of affective images. Although directionality could not be inferred, analyses of lead-lag relations showed the prefrontal electrodes leading the posterior clusters, consistent with top down modulation. Our results suggest large-scale synchronization of cortical cells during affective viewing and emphasize the role of beta oscillations in mediating such binding. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The IFAST Model Allows the Prediction of Conversion to Alzheimer Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment with High Degree of Accuracy	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; EEG processing; implicit function as squashing time; mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer disease; auto contractive map	EEG; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; DEMENTIA	This paper presents the results obtained with the innovative use of special types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) assembled in a novel methodology named IFAST (implicit function as squashing time) capable of compressing the temporal sequence of electroencephalographic (EEG) data into spatial invariants. The aim of this study is to test the potential of this parallel and nonlinear EEG analysis technique in providing an automatic classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of accuracy. Eyes-closed resting EEG data (10-20 electrode montage) were recorded in 143 amnesic MCI subjects. Based on 1-year follow up, the subjects were retrospectively classified to MCI converted to AD and MCI stable. The EEG tracks were successively filtered according to four different frequency ranges, in order to evaluate the hypotheses that a specific range, corresponding to specific brain wave type, could provide a better classification (0.12 Hz, 12.2-29.8 Hz; 30.2-40 Hz, and finally Notch Filter 48 - 50 Hz). The spatial content of the EEG voltage was extracted by IFAST step-wise procedure using ANNs. The data input for the classification operated by ANNs were not the EEG data, but the connections weights of a nonlinear auto-associative ANN trained to reproduce the recorded EEG tracks. These weights represented a good model of the peculiar spatial features of the EEG patterns at scalp surface. The classification based on these parameters was binary and performed by a supervised ANN. The best results distinguishing between MCI stable and MCI/AD reached to 85.98%.(012 Hz band). And confirmed the working hypothesis that a correct automatic classification can be obtained extracting spatial information content of the resting EEG voltage by ANNs and represent the basis for research aimed at integrating spatial and temporal information content of the EEG. These results suggest that this low-cost procedure can reliably distinguish eyes-closed resting EEG data in individual MCI subjects who will have different prognosis at 1-year follow up, and is promising for a large-scale periodic screening of large populations at amnesic MCI subjects at risk of AD.

Averaging multiple event-locked trials is thought to result in the cancellation of the seemingly random phased ongoing activity while leaving the evoked response. However, recent work strongly challenges this conventional view and demonstrates that the ongoing activity is not averaged out due to specific non-sinusoidal properties. As a consquence, systematic modulations in ongoing activity can produce slow cortical evoked responses reflecting cognitive processing. In this review we introduce the concept of "rhythmic pulsing" to account for this specific non-sinusoidal property. We will explain how rhythmic pulsing can create slow evoked responses from a physiological perspective. We will also discuss how the notion of rhythmic pulsing provides a unifying framework linking ongoing oscillations, evoked responses and the brain's capacity to process incoming information.

Although their functional role is unquestioned and their physiological origin is nowadays widely accepted, little is known about their relationship to neuronal activity. The combined recording of EEG and fMRI allows the temporal correlation between fluctuations of the RSNs and the dynamics of EEG spectral amplitudes. So far, only relationships between several EEG frequency bands and some RSNs could be demonstrated, but no study accounted for the spatial distribution of frequency domain EEG. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study we report on the topographic association of EEG spectral fluctuations and RSN dynamics using EEG covariance mapping. All RSNs displayed significant covariance maps across a broad EEG frequency range. Cluster analysis of the found covariance maps revealed the common standard EEG frequency bands. We found significant differences between covariance maps of the different RSNs and these differences depended on the frequency band. Conclusions/Significance: Our data supports the physiological and neuronal origin of the RSNs and substantiates the assumption that the standard EEG frequency bands and their topographies can be seen as electrophysiological signatures of underlying distributed neuronal networks.

However, the questions of how fast these oscillations can reach, and which frequency range is clinically important remain unanswered. We recorded interictal and ictal very high frequency oscillations (VHFO) of 1000-2500 Hz by subdural electrodes using 10 kHz sampling rate. We describe the characteristics of VHFO, and discuss their underlying mechanism and clinical significance. Methods: Five patients with neocortical epilepsy were studied. All patients underwent intracranial EEG monitoring with subdural electrodes. EEG recording with sampling rate of 10 kHz was conducted. Histopathology revealed malformation of cortical development in all cases. Results: In four of five patients, very high frequency activities of 1000-2500 Hz were detected in highly localized cortical regions (one to four electrodes in individual patient). We named these activities "very high frequency oscillations (VHFO)". Interictally, VHFO appeared intermittently, and were interrupted by spikes. Sustained VHFO without spikes appeared around the start of seizures. Conclusions: Both interictal and ictal VHFO can be recorded by subdural electrodes. Compared to HFO previously reported, VHFO have much higher frequency, more restricted distribution, smaller amplitude, and different timing of onset. Significance: Recording of VHFO may be useful for identifying the epileptogenic zone. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Nikulin, VV; Kegeles, J; Curio, G				Nikulin, Vadim V.; Kegeles, Jewgeni; Curio, Gabriel			Miniaturized electroencephalographic scalp electrode for optimal wearing comfort	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electrode; EEG; Cortex; Humans; Brain-computer interface; Oscillations	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG; COMMUNICATION; BCI	Objective: Current mainstream EEG electrode setups permit efficient recordings, but are often bulky and uncomfortable for subjects. Here we introduce a novel type of EEG electrode, which is designed for an optimal wearing comfort. The electrode is referred to as C-electrode where "C" stands for comfort. Methods: The C-electrode does not require any holder/cap for fixation on the head nor does it use traditional pads/lining of disposable electrodes - thus, it does not disturb subjects. Fixation of the C-electrode on the scalp is based entirely on the adhesive interaction between the very light C-electrode/wire construction (< 35 mg) and a droplet of EEG paste/gel. Moreover, because of its miniaturization, both C-electrode (diameter 2-3 mm) and a wire (diameter similar to 50 mu m) are minimally (or not at all) visible to an external observer. EEG recordings with standard and C-electrodes were performed during rest condition, self-paced movements and median nerve stimulation. Results: The quality of EEG recordings for all three types of experimental conditions was similar for standard and C-electrodes, i.e., for near-DC recordings (Bereitschaftspotential), standard rest EEG spectra (1-45 Hz) and very fast oscillations similar to 600 Hz (somatosensory evoked potentials). The tests showed also that once being placed on a subject's head, C-electrodes can be used for 9 h without any loss in EEG recording quality. Furthermore, we showed that C-electrodes can be effectively utilized for Brain-Computer Interfacing. C-electrodes proved to posses a high stability of mechanical fixation (stayed attached with 2.5 g accelerations). Subjects also reported not having any tactile sensations associated with wearing of C-electrodes. Conclusion: C-electrodes provide optimal wearing comfort without any loss in the quality of EEG recordings.

Techniques based on tensor decompositions are recognized to be efficient in this framework, provided some diversity is available, in addition to time and space. With this goal, some authors have proposed to decompose a Space-Time-Frequency data tensor. In this paper, we propose a new multiway approach based on Space-Time-Wave-Vector (STWV) data which is obtained by a 3D local Fourier transform over space accomplished on the measured data. This method does not only permit to accurately localize sources even in a noisy environment, but simultaneously extracts the temporal behaviour associated with each source. The performance of this STWV analysis is investigated by means of computer simulations in the context of ElectroEncephalo-Graphic (EEG) data analysis.

Comparison of five directed graph measures for identification of leading interictal epileptic regions	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						directed graph measurements; epilepsy; intracerebral EEG recordings; multiple graph analysis; mutual information	TIME-DELAY ESTIMATION; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; CROSS-CORRELATION; EEG SIGNALS; DYNAMICS; PROPAGATION; FREQUENCY	Directed graphs (digraphs) derived from interictal periods of intracerebral EEG (iEEG) recordings can be used to estimate the leading interictal epileptic regions for presurgery evaluations. For this purpose, quantification of the emittance contribution of each node to the rest of digraph is important. However, the usual digraph measures are not very well suited for this quantification. Here, we compare the efficiency of recently introduced local information (LI) measure and a new measure called total global efficiency with classical measures like global efficiency, local efficiency and node degree. For evaluation, the estimated leading interictal epileptic regions based on five measures are compared with seizure onset zones obtained by visual inspection of epileptologists for five patients. The comparison revealed the superior performance of the LI measure. We showed efficiency of different digraph measures for the purpose of source and sink node identification.

Since the change is well above perceptual threshold in continuous viewing, the failure (termed change blindness) has been attributed to abnormal visual short-term memory (VSTM) However, it is still unclear where the abnormality lies among the phases in VSTM. namely, encoding, maintenance, and retrieval-comparison EEG oscillations, especially the gamma activity, have been suggested as neural signatures of VSTM. but have not been examined in the context of change blindness. Thus, we asked in the present study whether change detection or failure is correlated with EEG oscillatory activities and. if so. whether the timing and the spatial distribution of the oscillations could pin-point the abnormal phase of VSTM in change blindness. While on EEG recording, subjects watched morphed pictures of human faces in trials which consisted of a 200-ms initial image display, a 500-ms blank period. and a 200-ms comparison image display The two images were either the same or clearly different above threshold Trials with different images were classified as hit or missed, based on subjects' responses, and EEG data were compared between the two types of trials Enhanced gamma activity was observed in the right temporal-parietal region during all periods in the hit trials compared to the missed ones Frontal theta activity was increased during initial image encoding, whereas beta activity was decreased during maintenance and retrieval-comparison in the hit trials. These results point to weak encoding of initial images as the culprit for a later failure in change detection, while abnormal processing in subsequent phases of VSTM may result from the weak encoding and also contribute to change blindness (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Towards Estimating Selective Auditory Attention From EEG Using A Novel Time-Frequency-Synchronisation Framework	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			MODE	An original experimental design is combined with a novel signal processing approach so as to provide cognitive clues in the study of auditory scene analysis and in the design of auditory brain computer interfaces. Volunteers attended a single auditory stimulus in a perceptually complex auditory environment of speech and music, wherein the experiment aim was to estimate the attended stimulus from recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). Unlike previous studies, the complex nature of the auditory environment does not allow for straightforward analysis that exploits convenient properties of the stimuli. To provide insight, synchronised neuronal activity was analysed within a novel signal processing framework that models energy and phase dynamics independently using empirical mode decomposition. By design, the proposed approach caters for higher order information and is suitable for nonstationary data, both critical properties in the analysis of cognitive activity. T he proposed methodology achieved a median classification accuracy of 71% in a series of selective attention experiments with several volunteers.

Such measures may form signal features capable of characterizing and differentiating the underlying neural activity. The objective of this chapter is to validate the use of wavelets in extracting such features in the Lime scale domain and evaluate them in a simulated environment assuming two tasks (control and target) that resemble widely used scenarios of assessing and quantifying complex cognitive functions or pathologies. The motivation for this work stems from the ability of time frequency features to encapsulate significant power alteration of EEG in time, thus characterizing the brain response in terms of both spectral and temporal activation. In the presented algorithmic scenario, brain areas' electrodes of significant activation during the target task are extracted using time-averaged wavelet power spectrum estimation. Then, a refinement step makes use of statistical significance-based criteria for comparing wavelet power spectra between the target task and the control condition. The results indicate the ability of the proposed methodological framework to correctly identify and select the most prominent channels in terms of "activity encapsulation," which are thought to be the most significant ones.

Methods: Six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (4 females, 2 males) participated in the prospective pilot study while enrolled for video/EEG monitoring (24 h/day, 2-4 days). ECG was continuously recorded and 30 min seizure-sessions (25-30 min pre-seizure to 30 sec-5 min post-seizure onset) and 30 min non-seizure-sessions (day- and night sessions for each patient, as control) were chosen for further HRV-analysis. Low frequency (LF) (0.04-0.15 Hz), High frequencies (HF) (0.15-0.40 Hz), LF/HF, LF/(LF+HF) and reciprocal HF-power was determined using continuous FFT-spectral analysis of 64 R-R interval windowing with maximum overlapping. Results: Six seizures were recorded and analyzed from three patients (2 females, 1 male). All of the analyzed EEG-correlated seizures showed reciprocal HF-power peaks between 10 sec pre seizure-onset and 24 sec post seizure-onset with peak amplitudes 2.96-93.63 times higher than control maximum peak. For the other parameters we could not find significant difference between seizure and non-seizure sessions. Conclusion: Specifically high reciprocal HF-power peaks suggest suppressed parasympathetic activity just around seizure-onset time. Seizure detection using HRV-analysis seems to be a promising method for non-invasive seizure detection in the early phase of the clinical event (even preceding the onset).

Resonance phenomena in the human auditory cortex: individual resonance frequencies of the cerebral cortex determine electrophysiological responses	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Steady state; Resonance; Gamma oscillations	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; STEADY-STATE; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ATTENTION; BRAIN; DELTA; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	The brain can be considered a dynamical system which is able to oscillate at multiple frequencies. To study the brain's preferred oscillation frequencies, the resonance frequencies in the frequency response of the system can be assessed by stimulating the brain at various stimulation frequencies. Furthermore, the event-related potential (ERP) can be considered as the brain's impulse response. For linear dynamical systems, the frequency response should be equivalent to the frequency transform of the impulse response. The present study test whether this fundamental relation is also true for the frequency transform of the ERP and the frequency response of the brain. Results show that the spectral characteristics of both impulse and frequency response in the gamma frequency range are significantly correlated. Thus, we speculate that the resonance frequencies determine the frequency spectrum of the impulse response. This, in turn, implies that both measures are determined by the same, individually specific, neuronal generator mechanisms.	[Herrmann, C.

In this study, we used a single bipolar cortical EEG electrode at the frontal-parietal location with a 0.5-30 Hz filter band and a clustering sleep-staging algorithm including seven classification parameters. The agreements between the computer and two independent raters were 96.9 +/- 1.1% for Wake, 97.1 +/- 1.4% for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and 91.4 +/- 2.5% for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the overall agreement was 96.7 +/- 0.7%. These results indicate that the accuracies of sleep staging remain high even though only a single EEG channel was used and that a system based on this scheme would be suitable for realtime and long-term studies of sleep.

Epilepsy is related to theta band brain connectivity and network topology in brain tumor patients	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; SEIZURE; HERITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Both epilepsy patients and brain tumor patients show altered functional connectivity and less optimal brain network topology when compared to healthy controls, particularly in the theta band. Furthermore, the duration and characteristics of epilepsy may also influence functional interactions in brain networks. However, the specific features of connectivity and networks in tumor-related epilepsy have not been investigated yet. We hypothesize that epilepsy characteristics are related to (theta band) connectivity and network architecture in operated glioma patients suffering from epileptic seizures. Included patients participated in a clinical study investigating the effect of levetiracetam monotherapy on seizure frequency in glioma patients, and were assessed at two time points: directly after neurosurgery (t1), and six months later (t2). At these time points, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded and information regarding clinical status and epilepsy history was collected. Functional connectivity was calculated in six frequency bands, as were a number of network measures such as normalized clustering coefficient and path length. Results: At the two time points, MEG registrations were performed in respectively 17 and 12 patients. No changes in connectivity or network topology occurred over time. Increased theta band connectivity at t1 and t2 was related to a higher total number of seizures. Furthermore, higher number of seizures was related to a less optimal, more random brain network topology. Other factors were not significantly related to functional connectivity or network topology. Conclusions: These results indicate that (pathologically) increased theta band connectivity is related to a higher number of epileptic seizures in brain tumor patients, suggesting that theta band connectivity changes are a hallmark of tumor-related epilepsy. Furthermore, a more random brain network topology is related to greater vulnerability to seizures. Thus, functional connectivity and brain network architecture may prove to be important parameters of tumor-related epilepsy.

At the same time, it is commonly acknowledged that acupuncture plays an important role in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is indeed receiving more and more attentions from the world. It is likely that a combination of acupuncture and magnetic stimulation which is non-invasive, painless and secure could give rise to treatments with substantial medical significance. This study discusses (a) the difference of EEG with pre- and post-stimulations at two different acupoints including Zusanli (St36) and Hegu (LI4) with three different frequencies (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz and 3 Hz) based on complexity analysis; (b) the character of the somatosensory evoked potentials(SEPs) in response to acupoint stimulation ( Hegu) and mock point stimulation. The result indicates that different acupoints can induce different brain activity under the same stimulation correlated with the physical properties of the acupoints; and P150 can be observed after acupoint stimulation whereas mock point stimulation does not produce the same effect.

Mass synchronization: Occurrence and its control with possible applications to brain dynamics	CHAOS			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; OSCILLATIONS; PROPAGATION; NETWORKS; EEG; STIMULATION; SPIKING; MODELS	Occurrence of strong or mass synchronization of a large number of neuronal populations in the brain characterizes its pathological states. In order to establish an understanding of the mechanism underlying such pathological synchronization, we present a model of coupled populations of phase oscillators representing the interacting neuronal populations. Through numerical analysis, we discuss the occurrence of mass synchronization in the model, where a source population which gets strongly synchronized drives the target populations onto mass synchronization. We hypothesize and identify a possible cause for the occurrence of such a synchronization, which is so far unknown: Pathological synchronization is caused not just because of the increase in the strength of coupling between the populations but also because of the strength of the strong synchronization of the drive population. We propose a demand controlled method to control this pathological synchronization by providing a delayed feedback where the strength and frequency of the synchronization determine the strength and the time delay of the feedback. We provide an analytical explanation for the occurrence of pathological synchronization and its control in the thermodynamic limit. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Good practices in EEG-MRI: The utility of retrospective synchronization and PCA for the removal of MRI gradient artefacts	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Gradient artefact; Synchronization; PCA; Simulation	FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; SIGNALS; RECORDINGS	The electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inside the scanner is obstructed by the MRI gradient artefact (MGA) originating from the electromagnetic interference of the MRI with the sensitive measurement of electrical scalp potentials Post-processing algorithms based on average artefact subtraction (AAS) have proven to be efficient in removing the MGA. However, the residual MGA after AAS still limits the quality and usable bandwidth of the EEG data despite further reduction through resampling. principal component analysis (PCA), and regressive filtering We recently demonstrated that the residual MGA can largely be avoided by means of hardware synchronization Here we present a new software synchronization method, which substitutes hardware synchronization and facilitates the removal of motion artefacts by PCA. The effectiveness of the retrospective synchronization algorithm (Resync) is demonstrated by comparison to the aforementioned techniques For this purpose, we also developed a method for simulating the MGA and we propose new concepts for quantifying and comparing the performance of post-processing algorithms for EEG-MRI data. Results indicate that the benefits of (retrospective) synchronization and PCA depend largely on the relative contribution of timing errors and motion artefacts to the residual MGA as well as the frequency range of interest (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Depend on these main findings correlated with MS, we attempt to develop an EEG based classification system to automatically classify subject's MS level and find the suitable EEG features via common feature extraction, selection and classifiers technologies in this study. If we can find the regulations and then develop an algorithm to predict MS occurring, it would be a great benefit to construct a safe and comfortable environment for all drivers and passengers when they are cruising in the car, bus, ship or airplane. EEG is one of the best methods for monitoring the brain dynamics induced by motion-sickness because of its high temporal resolution and portability. After collecting the EEG signals and subjective MS level in a realistic driving environment, we first do the data pre-processing part including ICA, component clustering analysis and time-frequency analysis. Then we adopt three common feature extractions and two feature selections (FE/FS) technologies to extract or select the correlated features such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), forward feature selections (FFS) and backward feature selections (BFS) and feed the feature maps into three classifiers (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML), k-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Experimental results show that classification performance of all our proposed technologies can be reached almost over 95%. It means it is possible to apply the effective technology combination to predict the subject's MS level in the real life applications. The better combination in this study is using LDA and Gaussian based ML classifier. This advantage can be widely used in machine learning area for developing the prediction algorithms in the future.

The participants were divided into high and low achievements groups based on the median split of mean originality scores separately under the first and second instructions. Creative problem solving was generally accompanied by desynchronization of the EEG alpha oscillations. Sex- and creativity-related differences were more pronounced under the first instruction, i.e. during the "free" divergent thinking. A more pronounced alphal desynchronization in posterior hemispheric regions vs. anterior hemispheric regions was found in men with high originality scores. No regional differences were found in women and in men with low originality scores. In the alpha2 frequency band, an occipito-frontal gradient of desynchronization becomes typical for all participants, except men with low originality scores. Furthermore, alpha2 desynchronization is stronger in high creativity men as compared to low creativity men, while the inverse pattern was found in women. Under motivation to unique image generation an asymmetry was found in the activation of posterior right and left hemispheric regions with the predominance of the right hemisphere for all subjects.

J	Naruse, Y; Matani, A; Miyawaki, Y; Okada, M				Naruse, Yasushi; Matani, Ayumu; Miyawaki, Yoichi; Okada, Masato			Influence of Coherence Between Multiple Cortical Columns on Alpha Rhythm: A Computational Modeling Study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						event-related synchronization; event-related desynchronization; neural mass model; event-related potential; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography	VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; HUMAN-MEMORY; EEG ALPHA; RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PATTERNS	In electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals, stimulus-induced amplitude increase and decrease in the alpha rhythm, known as event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD), emerge after a task onset. ERS/ERD is assumed to reflect neural processes relevant to cognitive tasks. Previous studies suggest that several sources of alpha rhythm, each of which can serve as an alpha rhythm generator, exist in the cortex. Since EEG/MEG signals represent spatially summed neural activities, ERS/ERD of the alpha rhythm may reflect the consequence of the interactions between multiple alpha rhythm generators. Two candidates modulate the magnitude of ERS/ERD: (1) coherence between the activities of the alpha rhythm generators and (2) mean amplitude of the activities of the alpha rhythm generators. M this study, we use a computational model of multiple alpha rhythm generators to determine the factor that dominantly causes ERS/ERD. Each alpha rhythm generator is modeled based on local column circuits in the primary visual cortex and made to interact with the neighboring generators through excitatory connections. We observe that the model consistently reproduces spontaneous alpha rhythms, event-related potentials, phase-locked alpha rhythms, and ERS/ERD in a specific range of connectivity coefficients. Independent analyses of the coherence and amplitude of multiple alpha rhythm generators reveal that the ERS/ERD in the simulated data is dominantly caused by stimulus-induced changes in the coherence between multiple alpha rhythm generators. Nonlinear phenomena such as phase-resetting and entrainment of the alpha rhythm are related to the neural mechanism underlying ERS/ERD. Hum Brain Mapp 31:703-715, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Synchrony in Normal and Focal Epileptic Brain: The Seizure Onset Zone is Functionally Disconnected	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; IN-VIVO; POSTTRAUMATIC EPILEPTOGENESIS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURAL NETWORKS; EEG RECORDINGS; CONNECTIVITY	Warren CP, Hu S, Stead M, Brinkmann BH, Bower MR, Worrell GA. Synchrony in normal and focal epileptic brain: the seizure onset zone is functionally disconnected. J Neurophysiol 104: 3530-3539, 2010. First published October 6, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00368.2010. Synchronization of local and distributed neuronal assemblies is thought to underlie fundamental brain processes such as perception, learning, and cognition. In neurological disease, neuronal synchrony can be altered and in epilepsy may play an important role in the generation of seizures. Linear cross-correlation and mean phase coherence of local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly used measures of neuronal synchrony and have been studied extensively in epileptic brain. Multiple studies have reported that epileptic brain is characterized by increased neuronal synchrony except possibly prior to seizure onset when synchrony may decrease. Previous studies using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), however, have been limited to patients with epilepsy. Here we investigate neuronal synchrony in epileptic and control brain using intracranial EEG recordings from patients with medically resistant partial epilepsy and control subjects with intractable facial pain. For both epilepsy and control patients, average LFP synchrony decreases with increasing interelectrode distance. Results in epilepsy patients show lower LFP synchrony between seizure-generating brain and other brain regions. This relative isolation of seizure-generating brain underlies the paradoxical finding that control patients without epilepsy have greater average LFP synchrony than patients with epilepsy. In conclusion, we show that in patients with focal epilepsy, the region of epileptic brain generating seizures is functionally isolated from surrounding brain regions. We further speculate that this functional isolation may contribute to spontaneous seizure generation and may represent a clinically useful electrophysiological signature for mapping epileptic brain.

In this study we have quantified the "epileptogenicity" of mesial temporal lobe structures (M), lateral neocortical regions (L), and extratemporal perisylvian structures (ET) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in order to classify the brain networks involved in seizure generation. Methods: Thirty-four patients having TLE investigated by intracerebral recordings using stereotactic electroencephalography (EEG) (SEEG) were selected. Epileptogenicity of M, L, and ET structures was quantified according to the "epileptogenicity index" (EI), a new way to quantify rapid discharges at seizure onset, ranging from 0 (no epileptogenicity) to 1 (maximal epileptogenicity). Results: Automatic clustering using EI values from M, L, and ET separated patients into four classes: mesial group (max EI in M), lateral group (max EI in L), mesiolateral group (high EI in both M and L) and temporoperisylvian group (TPS) (high values in ET). The median number of highly epileptogenic structures (defined by EI > 0.3) was four, a result confirming that most TLE is organized as "epileptogenic networks." We found that the duration of epilepsy was correlated with the number of epileptogenic structures and that surgical prognosis was also related to the extent of the epileptogenicity in the brain. Conclusions: Several distinct epileptogenic networks are involved in seizure generation in TLE. Findings advocate for a progressive recruitment of epileptogenic structures in human brain with time.

J	Pletzer, B; Kerschbaum, H; Klimesch, W				Pletzer, Belinda; Kerschbaum, Hubert; Klimesch, Wolfgang			When frequencies never synchronize: The golden mean and the resting EEG	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Golden mean; Resting EEG; Synchronization; Excitatory phase; Frequency band	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; CORTEX	The classical frequency bands of the EEG can be described as a geometric series with a ratio (between neighbouring frequencies) of 1.618, which is the golden mean. Here we show that a synchronization of the excitatory phases of two oscillations with frequencies f1 and f2 is impossible (in a mathematical sense) when their ratio equals the golden mean, because their excitatory phases never meet. Thus, in a mathematical sense, the golden mean provides a totally uncoupled ('desynchronized') processing state which most likely reflects a 'resting' brain, which is not involved in selective information processing. However, excitatory phases of the f1- and f2-oscillations occasionally come close enough to coincide in a physiological sense. These coincidences are more frequent, the higher the frequencies f1 and f2. We demonstrate that the pattern of excitatory phase meetings provided by the golden mean as the 'most irrational' number is least frequent and most irregular. Thus, in a physiological sense, the golden mean provides (i) the highest physiologically possible desynchronized state in the resting brain, (ii) the possibility for spontaneous and most irregular (!) coupling and uncoupling between rhythms and (iii) the opportunity for a transition from resting state to activity. These characteristics have already been discussed to lay the ground for a healthy interplay between various physiological processes (Buchmann, 2002). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The methods used are wavelet transform, cross wavelet transform, phase/amplitude correlation, and phase synchronization. We computed the linear relationship and phase synchronization between uterine signals measured during the same contractions at two different sites on data obtained from women during pregnancy and labor. The results show that the Morlet wavelet transform can successfully analyze and quantify the relationship between uterine electrical activities at different sites and could be employed to investigate the evolution of uterine contraction from pregnancy to labor.

Sustained gamma-band EEG following negative words in depression and schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Depression; Schizophrenia; Emotion; Gamma; EEG; Rumination	FREQUENCY CORTICAL RESPONSES; AFFECTIVE REACTIVITY; EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; MOOD; STIMULI; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; BRAIN	Introduction: Sustained and elaborative emotional information processing in depression and decreased affective elaboration in schizophrenia are considered hallmarks of these disorders but have not been directly measured. Gamma-band (35-45 Hz) EEG has been associated with semantic functions such as feature binding and may index these elaborative processing. This study examined whether there were group differences in baseline and sustained gamma-band EEG following emotional stimuli in healthy adults as well as adults with depression and schizophrenia. Methods: 24 never-depressed healthy controls, 14 patients with DSM-IV unipolar major depressive disorder, and 15 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia completed a lexical emotion identification task during EEG assessment. Gamma-band (35-45 Hz) EEG in response to negative words was the primary dependent measure. Results: As predicted, depressed individuals displayed sustained and increased gamma-band EEG throughout the task, and particularly in the seconds following negative words. Individuals with schizophrenia displayed decreased gamma-band activity throughout the task. Conclusions: These data suggest that gamma-band EEG, measured over several seconds, may serve as a useful index of sustained semantic information processing. Depressed individuals appear to engage in sustained elaboration following emotional stimuli, whereas individuals with schizophrenia are not as prone to this type of elaborative processing.

A longitudinal study of how voluntary training of specific electro cortical activity produces any stable changes in the electroencephalogram is also presented. Correlations of these changes with short term memory are also hypothesized. In this work the human brain was seen as an electrochemical machine capable of receiving stimuli and adapt accordingly. So, only relevant EEG activity was fed back to the trainee by a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in an intelligible way, allowing the identification of phasic changes in the EEG and what cognitive state caused it. The results from this study showed that it is possible to learn to change some rhythmical activity in the EEG, in this case the alpha activity, after a few feedback sessions. A positive relation between this frequency band and cognitive processes was also observed. These results also indicate that the proposed EEG biofeedback protocol can be shaped as a tool for those who rely on BCI to communicate with the external world as it allows the tracking and training of individual frequency bands.

Functional Interactions in Hierarchically Organized Neural Networks Studied with Spatiotemporal Firing Patterns and Phase-Coupling Frequencies	CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; spike timing dependent plasticity; synaptic pruning; preferred firing sequence; insomnia; EEG	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; NEURONAL SPIKE TRAINS; GROUPING ALGORITHM; CONNECTIONS; EEG; PLASTICITY; INSOMNIA; RAT; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS	A scalable hardware/software hybrid module called Ubidule- endowed with bio-inspired ontogenetic and epigenetic features is configured to run a neural networks simulation with developmental and evolvable capabilities. We simulated the activity of hierarchically organized spiking neural networks characterized by an initial developmental phase featuring cell death followed by spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity in presence of background noise. An upstream 'sensory' network received a spatiotemporally organized external input and downstream networks were activated only via the upstream network. Precise firing sequences, formed by recurrent patterns of spikes intervals above chance levels, were observed in all recording conditions, thus suggesting the build-up of a connectivity able to sustain temporal information processing. The activity of a Ubinet -a network of Ubidules- is analyzed by means of virtual electrodes that recorded neural signals similar to EEG. The analysis of these signals was compared with a small set of human recordings and revealed common patterns of shift in quadratic phase coupling. The results suggest some interpretations of changes and plasticity of functional interactions between cortical areas driven by external stimuli and by learning/cognitive paradigms.

We studied 16 patients, 7 MCS and 9 SND with age between 18 and 49 years. Three minutes of ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was obtained at rest from 19 standard scalp locations, while subjects were alert but kept their eyes closed. GC was formulated in terms of linear autoregressive models that predict the evolution of several EEG time series, each representing the activity of one channel. The entire network of causally connected brain areas can be summarized as a graph of incompletely connected nodes. The 19 channels were grouped into five gross anatomical regions, frontal, left and right temporal, central, and parieto-occipital, while data analysis was performed separately in each of the five classical EEG frequency bands, namely delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Our results showed that the SND group consistently formed a larger number of connections compared to the MCS group in all frequency bands. Additionally, the number of connections in the delta band (0.1-4 Hz) between the left temporal and parieto-occipital areas was significantly different (P < 0.1%) in the two groups. Furthermore, in the beta band (12-18 Hz), the input to the frontal areas from all other cortical areas was also significantly different (P < 0.1%) in the two groups. Finally, classification of the subjects into distinct groups using as features the number of connections within and between regions in all frequency bands resulted in 100% classification accuracy of all subjects. The results of this study suggest that analysis of brain connectivity networks based on GC can be a highly accurate approach for classifying subjects affected by severe traumatic brain injury.

Rezaei			Electroencephalogram Signals Processing for the Diagnosis of Petit mal and Grand mal Epilepsies Using an Artificial Neural Network	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Tonic-clonic epilepsy; petit mal epilepsy; Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT); absence epilepsy	EEG; PREDICTION	In this study, a novel wavelet transform-neural network method is presented. The presented method is used for the classification of grand mal (clonic stage) and petit mal (absence) epilepsies into healthy, ictal and interictal (EEGs). Preprocessing is included to remove an artifact occurred by blinking and a wandering baseline (electrodes movement) as well as an eyeball movement artifact using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). Denoising EEG signals from the AC power supply frequency with a suitable notch filter is another job of preprocessing. The preprocessing enhanced speed and accuracy of the processing stage (wavelet transform and neural network). The EEGs signals are categorized into normal and petit mal and clonic epilepsy by an expert neurologist. The categorization is confirmed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. The dataset includes waves such as sharp, spike and spike-slow wave. Through the Countinous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and separated and used as classifier input. We introduce a two-stage classifier based on the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network localized in both time and frequency contexts. The particular coefficients of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) are networks. The simulation results are very promising and the accuracy of the proposed method obtained is of about 80%.

Our data demonstrate theta, gamma, and delta oscillations in left ER particularly for remote autobiographical memory. Gamma is predominant in hippocampally projecting layers during presentation of the memory cue, whereas the a is prolonged and dominant in cortically projecting layers during memory retrieval. Gamma interactions between ER and hippocampal formation (HF) may elicit an HF contribution to recall under influences relayed from the association cortex (AC). This contribution may then be relayed back to AC during retrieval of the memory orchestrated by theta interactions with ER. Accordingly, theta oscillations were recorded simultaneously in frontal and temporal cortices. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model was developed in concert with the MSR for evaluation of critical aspects of the design and then determination of degaussing effectiveness. The FEA model generates a full three-dimensional map of the shielding factor as a function of frequency and is sensitive to the number, thickness, and spacing of wall shielding, as well as access ports such as the door, vents and feed through panel. This simulation uses quadratic vector Lagrange elements to solve for the total electric and magnetic potentials using a time-harmonic analysis. With this model, estimation of the spatial variation in the shielding factor for a modestly shielded room is demonstrated. The Dartmouth MSR has internal dimensions of 2.35m x 2.35m x 2.16m and has two high conductivity eddy current layers and one mu metal layer (two additional layers, one eddy current and one mu metal layer will be added in the near future). The simulation results indicate that the shielding factor at the center of the MSR does not vary significantly with incident angle of the applied magnetic field. However, spatial inhomogeneities in the shielding factor are evident near MSR access ports. The results of this simulation will be used in future work, where the degaussing of the room will be validated against modeling predictions. Our future modeling work will add a virtual patient and virtual instruments, electroencephalography (EEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), for evaluation of achievable multimodal contrast to noise.

Existing methods for measuring the level of hypnotic susceptibility are subjective, with some problems. In this study, a feature based on EEG weighted regional frequency was introduced, which can characterize the level of the subject's hypnotizability objectively. The ability of this feature for making a significant difference between three hypnotizable groups at the end of hypnotic suggestion was shown using statistical analyses. This feature was calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition method and the Hilbert transform. The EEG signals that were used in this study were recorded during hypnotic suggestion from 32 subjects. A K-nearest neighborhood-based classifier was designed for classification of the hypnotizable groups. The performance of the classifier was validated using the leave-one-out method, which showed the mean error of 3.13% in determination of the subject's hypnotic susceptibility level. This evaluation and obtaining the error were done by comparing the new method's results with the score of hypnotizability that was determined for each subject, using the subjective Waterloo-Stanford criterion. The new method, as opposed to common subjective clinical methods, represents a real time and objective procedure for determining hypnotic susceptibility.	[Baghdadi, G.; Nasrabadi, A.

J	Gunes, S; Polat, K; Yosunkaya, S				Guenes, Salih; Polat, Kemal; Yosunkaya, Sebnem			Efficient sleep stage recognition system based on EEG signal using k-means clustering based feature weighting	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						k-Means clustering based feature weighting; Sleep scoring; EEG signal; k-Nearest neighbor classifier; Decision tree; Polysomnography	DOPPLER ULTRASOUND; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS	Sleep scoring is one of the most important methods for diagnosis in psychiatry and neurology. Sleep staging is a time consuming and difficult task conducted by sleep specialists. The purposes of this work are to automatic score the sleep stages and to help to sleep physicians on sleep stage scoring. In this work, a novel data preprocessing method called k-means clustering based feature weighting (KMCFW) has been proposed and combined with k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) and decision tree classifiers to classify the EEG (electroencephalogram) sleep into six sleep stages including awake, N-REM (non-rapid eye movement) stage 1, N-REM stage 2, N-REM stage 3, REM, and non-sleep (movement time). First of all, frequency domain features belonging to sleep EEG signal have been extracted using Welch spectral analysis method and composed 129 features from EEG signal relating each sleep stages. In order to decrease the features, the statistical features comprising minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, and mean value have been used and then reduced from 129 to 4 features. In the second phase, the sleep stages dataset with four features has been weighted by means of k-means clustering based feature weighting. Finally, the weighted sleep stages have been automatically classified into six sleep stages using k-NN and C4.5 decision tree classifier. In the classification of sleep stages, the k values of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 in k-NN classifier have been used and compared with each other. In the experimental results, while sleep stages has been classified with 55.88% success rate using k-NN classifier (for k value of 40), the weighted sleep stages with KMCFW has been recognized with 82.15% success rate k-NN classifier (for k value of 40). And also, we have investigated the relevance between sleep stages and frequency domain features belonging to EEG signal. These results have demonstrated that proposed weighting method have a considerable impact on automatic determining of sleep stages. This system could be used as an online system in the automatic scoring of sleep stages and helps to sleep physicians in the sleep scoring process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The basic assumption is that oscillatory phase synchronization plays an important role for process binding - the transient linking of different cognitive processes - which may be considered a special type of large scale communication. We investigate this question for memory processes on the basis of different types of oscillatory synchronization mechanisms. The reviewed findings suggest that theta and alpha phase coupling (and phase reorganization) reflect control processes in two large memory systems, a working memory and a complex knowledge system that comprises semantic long-term memory. It is suggested that alpha phase synchronization may be interpreted in terms of processes that coordinate top-down control (a process guided by expectancy to focus on relevant search areas) and access to memory traces (a process leading to the activation of a memory trace). An analogous interpretation is suggested for theta oscillations and the controlled access to episodic memories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial analyses of the topography of the spontaneous EEG also show discrete epochs of stable global brain states (so-called microstates), but they remain quasi-stationary for only about 100 ms. In order to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states, we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with the hemodynamic response function allowed to fit a linear model to the fMRI BOLD responses and revealed four distinct distributed networks. These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention reorientation, and subjective interoceptive-autonomic processing. We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the four typical microstates of the spontaneous EEG seem to represent the neurophysiological correlate of four of the RSNs and show that they are fluctuating much more rapidly than fMRI alone suggests.

To better understand the operation of brain networks at these characteristic time scales during speech perception, we studied the spatial and dynamic properties of EEG responses to five different stimuli (1) amplitude modulated (AM) speech, (2) AM speech with added broadband noise, (3) AM reversed speech, (4) AM broadband noise, and (5) AM pure tone Amplitude modulation at gamma band frequencies (40 Hz) elicited steady-state auditory evoked responses (SSAERs) bilaterally over primary auditory cortices Reduced SSAERs were observed over the left auditory cortex only for stimuli containing speech In addition, we found over the left hemisphere, anterior to primary auditory cortex, a network whose instantaneous frequencies in the theta to alpha band (4-16 Hz) are correlated with the amplitude envelope of the speech signal This correlation was not observed for reversed speech The presence of speech in the sound input activates a 4-16 Hz envelope tracking network and suppresses the 40-Hz gamma band network which generates the steady-state responses over the left auditory cortex We believe these findings to be consistent with the idea that processing of the speech signals involves preferentially processing at syllabic time scales rather than phonetic time scales (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved	[Deng, Siyi; Srinivasan, Ramesh] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Cognit Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA		Srinivasan, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Cognit Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.

J	Yamanaka, K; Yamamoto, Y				Yamanaka, Kentaro; Yamamoto, Yoshiharu			Single-trial EEG Power and Phase Dynamics Associated with Voluntary Response Inhibition	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO-NOGO TASKS; GO/NOGO TASK; STIMULUS PROBABILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN DYNAMICS	Human voluntary response inhibition has frequently been investigated using go/no-go RT tasks. Recent studies have indicated that not only the traditional averaging waveforms of EEG activities (ERPs) but also the power and phase dynamics of single-trial EEG are important in studying the neural correlates of various human cognitive functions. Therefore, here, we aimed to undertake a detailed study of the time/frequency power and phase dynamics of single-trial EEG during go/no-go RT tasks, with focus particularly on the no-go-specific power and phase dynamics, which are presumed to involve the voluntary response inhibition processes. Thus, we demonstrated no-go-specific theta band EEG power increases and intertrial phase-locking in the midline-frontal areas, which are related to no-go-specific midline-frontal negative-positive ERP waveforms (no-go N2/no-go P3). In addition, we observed no-go-specific alpha band EEG intertrial phase-locking with an adjacent dephasing phenomenon, which is mainly associated with the early part of no-go N2. The estimated time point when the no-go-specific midline-frontal dephasing phenomenon occurred corresponded to the initial part of the voluntary response inhibition process (decision to withhold). Moreover, the no-go-specific phase dynamics in the midline-frontal areas just before and around the no-go N2 peak latency, unlike the power modulations, were affected by changes in the no-go stimulus probability, suggesting the dependence of only phase dynamics on no-go stimulus probability. From these results, we conclude that the complex power and phase dynamics of the theta and alpha band EEG in the midline-frontal areas are specific to no-go trials, being the underlying bases of the no-go-specific ERP waveforms, and suggest that the phase dynamics just before and around the no-go N2 peak latency may involve, at least, the initial part of the voluntary response inhibition process (decision to withhold).

They reflect the influence of parasympathetic and sympathetic systems over the cardiac activity. In past years, a considerable number of methodological approaches applied to non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have been developed for the assessment of autonomic function. They are based on quantitative analyses of the heart rate variability (HRV), which, through different measurements in time and frequency domains or through non-linear estimations, have revealed useful information in diverse clinical contexts. In the present article, we provide a review of the general aspects related to the analysis of HRV including a brief summary of the physiological bases and methodological approaches together with some reported applications.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Slow blood pressure oscillations; Self-paced movements; Heart rate; Baroreflex loop	FINGER MOVEMENT; HUMAN BRAIN; REFLEXES; HUMANS; SYSTEM; MODEL	Slow oscillations around 0.1 Hz are characteristic features of both the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Such oscillation have been reported, e.g. in blood pressure, heart rate, EEG and brain oxygenation. Hence, conscious intention of a motor act may occur only as a result of brain activity changes in frontal and related brain areas, or might be entrained by slow oscillations in the blood pressure. Twenty-six subjects were asked to perform voluntary, self-paced (at free will) brisk finger movements. Some subjects performed self-paced movements in relatively periodic intervals of around 10 s at the decreasing slope of the slow 0.1-Hz blood pressure oscillation. Our study reveals the first time that self-paced movements, at least in some subjects, do not stem from "free will" based on brain activity alone, but are influenced by slow blood pressure oscillations.

However, recent results have challenged this view by showing a modulation of alpha activity in cortical areas representing unattended information during active tasks. These data have led us to think that alpha waves would support a 'gating function' on sensorial stimulation that actively inhibits unattended information in attentional tasks. Visual suppression occurring during a saccade and blink entails an inhibition of incoming visual information, and it seems to occur at an early processing stage. In this study, we hypothesized that the neural mechanism through which the visual system exerts this inhibition is the active imposition of alpha oscillations in the occipital cortex, which in turn predicts an increment of alpha amplitude during a visual suppression phenomena. We measured visual suppression occurring during short closures of the eyelids, a situation well suited for EEG recordings and stimulated the retinae with an intra-oral light administered through the palate. In the behavioral experiment, detection thresholds were measured with eyes steady open and steady closed, showing a reduction of sensitivity in the latter case. In the EEG recordings performed under identical conditions we found stronger alpha activity with closed eyes. Since the stimulation does not depend on whether the eyes were open or closed, we reasoned that this should be a central effect, probably due to a functional role of alpha oscillation in agreement with the 'gating function' theory.

Senkowski et al. (2008) Trends Neurosci., 31, 401-409]. The present study investigated whether audiovisual integration of emotional information emerges early at unisensory or later at higher association cortices. Emotional stimuli were presented in three blocks: audiovisual (AV), auditory (A) and visual (V). Eighteen participants performed a delayed emotional recognition task (happy, angry or neutral prosody and/or facial expression) while whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were obtained. Time-frequency evoked and total power analyses were performed on the sensor data, and source localization of the frequencies of interest performed via a synthetic aperture magnetometry beamformer. To examine crossmodal integration between bimodal and unimodal conditions, two contrasts were specified: AV > A and AV > V. In the AV > A contrast, early effects were observed on both the temporal and the occipital evoked responses. However, at the source level, early alpha suppression was limited to the occipital sources without changes in temporal cortices. In the AV > V contrast, sensor and source findings revealed increased alpha suppression only in temporal cortices, with no changes in visual cortex. Thus, no crossmodal effect in unisensory areas emerged. Instead, increased frontal alpha activity in both the AV > A and AV > V contrasts supports the view that affective information from face and prosody converges at higher association cortices.

Four levels of roughness were presented under low-demanding and high-demanding conditions. In both conditions, an oddball paradigm was used to present three target surfaces varying in roughness (low, mid, and high levels of roughness), and a nontarget flat surface. The results showed that centro-parietal theta oscillations are involved in allocating attentional resources when participants have to update new information induced by incoming haptic stimuli. Theta power was higher in the high-demanding task compared to the low-demanding. Furthermore, theta power varied depending on tactile roughness but not in a linear manner.

K-space reconstruction of magnetic resonance inverse imaging (K-InI) of human visuomotor systems	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related; fMRI; InI; Visual; MRI; Neuroimaging; K-InI; Inverse solution; MEG; EEG; Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Latency; Timing; Rapid imaging; Auto-calibration	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; COIL ARRAYS; SENSE-EPI; PARALLEL; GRAPPA; ACQUISITION	Using simultaneous measurements from multiple channels of a radio-frequency coil array, magnetic resonance inverse imaging (InI) can achieve ultra-fast dynamic functional imaging of the human with whole-brain coverage and a good spatial resolution. Mathematically, the InI reconstruction is a generalization of parallel MRI (pMRI), which includes image space and k-space reconstructions. Because of the auto-calibration technique, the pMRI k-space reconstruction offers more robust and adaptive reconstructions compared to the image space algorithm. Here we present the k-space InI (K-Inl) reconstructions to reconstruct the highly accelerated BOLD-contrast fMRI data of the human brain to achieve 100 ms temporal resolution. Simulations show that K-InI reconstructions can offer 3D image reconstructions at each time frame with reasonable spatial resolution, which cannot be obtained using the previously proposed image space minimum-norm estimates (MNE) or linear constraint minimum variance (LCMV) spatial filtering reconstructions. The InI reconstructions of in vivo BOLD-contrast fMRI data during a visuomotor task show that K-InI offer 3 to 5 fold more sensitive detection of the brain activation than MNE and a comparable detection sensitivity to the LCMV reconstructions. The group average of the high temporal resolution K-Inl reconstructions of the hemodynamic response also shows a relative onset timing difference between the Visual (first) and somatomotor (second) cortices by 400 ms (600 ms time-to-peak timing difference). This robust and sensitive K-InI reconstruction can be applied to dynamic MRI acquisitions using a large-n coil array to improve the spatiotemporal resolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A longitudinal study of differences in electroencephalographic activity among breastfed, milk formula-fed, and soy formula-fed infants during the first year of life	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Brain; Infant formula; EEG; Spectral analysis	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; ACTION-POTENTIALS; BRAIN; EEG; MATURATION; SPEECH; POWER; MYELINATION	Background The extent to which adequate nutrition from infant diets differentially influence developmental outcomes in healthy infants has not been determined Aim: To compare the effects of the major infant diets on the development of brain electrical activity during infancy. Study design Scalp EEG signals (124 sites) recorded from the same infants during quiet wakefulness at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months Subjects Healthy, full-term infants (40/group, gender matched) either breastfed (BF) or fed milk formula (MF) or soy formula (SF) through the first 6 months. Outcome measures. Power spectral values for frequencies in the 0 1-30 Hz range Results Significant diet-related differences were present across frequency bands and included effects that were time- [peaks in 0.1-3 Hz at 6 (MF,SF) and 9 months (BF); 3-6 Hz at 6 months (MF, SF>BF); increases in 6-9 Hz from 3 to 6 months (MF>BF) and from 6 to 9 months (MF>SF)] and gender-related (9-12 Hz and 12-30 Hz: at 9 months BF>MF, SF boys, and MF>SF girls). Conclusions The development of brain electrical activity during infancy differs between those who are breastfed compared with those fed either milk or soy formula, but is generally similar for formula-fed groups. These variations in EEG activity reflect diet-related influences on the development of brain structure and function that could put infants on different neurodevelopmental trajectories along which cognitive and brain function development will proceed (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

Creative problem solving was accompanied with an enhancement of the beta2-synchronization differently associated to task type and sex. Widespread enhancement of power together with increased coherence focused in the right frontal cortex was found during the performance of verbal creative task in comparison to figural one. There were no sex differences in the creativity indices, but the coherence brain maps revealed more pronounced task-related increases in intrahemispheric coherence in the posterior cortex and in the left prefrontal site in males than in females. Originality scores of verbal associates positively correlated with task-related coherence focused mainly in the left frontal site only in males whereas originality scores of figural images negatively correlated with coherence reactivity (experimental minus baseline values) only in females. These task- and sex-associated effects in creativity-related topographic changes of the beta2 - synchronization may reflect different strategies of multimodal information selection during creative thinking in men and women.

The results show that memory matching appears as transient phase-synchronization over parieto-occipital regions between theta (4-8 Hz) and high gamma (50-70 Hz) oscillations. 150-200 ms post probe presentation When memory representation and visual information match. phase-synchronization is stronger in the right hemisphere, conversely, when they do not match, stronger phase synchronization is observed in the left hemisphere The present results reveal the integrative role of oscillatory activity in the memory matching process (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Holz, Elisa Mira; Glennon, Mark; Prendergast, Karen; Sauseng, Paul] Salzburg Univ, Dept Physiol Psychol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Sauseng, Paul] Univ Hosp Harnburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Brain Imaging & Neurostimulat Lab, Hamburg, Germany; [Glennon, Mark; Prendergast, Karen] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Psychol, Galway, Ireland		Sauseng, P (corresponding author), UKE Univ Hosp Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Brain Imaging & NeuroStimulat Lab, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.								60	56	59	0	21	ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE	SAN DIEGO	525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA	1053-8119	1095-9572		NEUROIMAGE	Neuroimage	AUG 1	2010	52	1					326	335		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.003			10	Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	609EJ	20382239				2022-08-02	WOS:000278637700033

Preprocessing is included to remove artifacts occurred by blinking, wandering baseline (electrodes movement) and eyeball movement using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). De-noising EEG signals from the AC power supply frequency with a suitable notch filter is another job of preprocessing. In experimental data, the preprocessing enhanced speed and accuracy of the processing stage (wavelet transform and neural network). The EEGs signals are categorized to normal and petit mal and clonic epilepsy by an expert neurologist. The categorization is confirmed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis and brain mapping. The dataset includes waves such as sharp, spike and spike-slow wave. Through the Counties Wavelet Transform (CWT) of EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and separated and used as classifier input. We introduce a two-stage classifier based on the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network location in both time and frequency contexts. The brain mapping used for finding the epilepsy locates in the brain. The simulation results are very promising and the accuracy of the proposed classifier in experimental clinical data is similar to 80%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Typically, these patients are poor surgical candidates and many times experience recurrences of seizure activity following resection of the assumed seizure focus. Methods: We applied a causal measurement technique-the directed transfer function (DTF)-in an effort to determine the cortical location responsible for the propagation of the seizure activity. Intracranial seizure recordings were obtained from a group of 11 pediatric patients with medically intractable neocortical-onset epilepsy. Time windows were selected from the recordings following onset of the ictal activity. The DTF was applied to the selected time windows, and the frequency-specific statistically significant source activity arising from each cortical recording site was quantified. The DTF-estimated source activity was then compared with the seizure-onset zone(s) identified by the epileptologists. Results: In an analysis of the 11 pediatric patients, the DTF was shown to identify estimated ictal sources that were highly correlated with the clinically identified foci. In addition, it was observed that in the patients with multiple ictal foci, the topography of the casual source activity from the analyzed seizures was associated with the separate clinically identified seizure-onset zones. Discussion: Although localization of neocortical-onset seizures is typically challenging, the causal measures employed in this study-namely the directed transfer function-identified generators of the ictal activity that were highly correlated with the cortical regions identified as the seizure-onset zones by the epileptologists. This technique could prove useful in the identification of seizure-specific propagation pathways in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy.

Alpha frequencies were calculated based on two events: eyes close and eyes close calculating. These results were then analyzed to find their change. The frequency of alpha rhythm becomes high from eyes close only condition to eyes close calculating. The cognitive processes lead to the increase of the frequency of alpha rhythm. This result indicates that alpha frequency is an important parameter of cognitive performance. A higher alpha frequency is needed to complete a cognitive task	[Chen, Zhihua; Zhao, Li] Dalian Jiaotong Univ, Software Technol Inst, AI & Bioinformat Technol Lab, Dalian 116052, Peoples R China; [Zou, Safeng] Xinhua Hosp Dalian Univ, Dept Neurol, Dalian 116021, Peoples R China; [Meichsner, Jie Hu] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA		Chen, ZH (corresponding author), Dalian Jiaotong Univ, Software Technol Inst, AI & Bioinformat Technol Lab, Dalian 116052, Peoples R China.								33	1	1	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1948-2914		978-1-4244-6496-8	INT CONF BIOMED			2010							823	827		10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639933	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639933			5	Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Informatics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Medical Informatics	BVY38					2022-08-02	WOS:000293143501042

Estimating the transfer function from neuronal activity to BOLD using simultaneous EEG-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GENERALIZED SPIKE; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; POTENTIALS; SIGNAL; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; EEG/FMRI; MEG	Previous studies using combined electrical and hemodynamic measurements of brain activity, such as EEG and (BOLD) fMRI, have yielded discrepant results regarding the relationship between neuronal activity and the associated BOLD response. In particular, some studies suggest that this link, or transfer function, depends on the frequency content of neuronal activity, while others suggest that total neuronal power accounts for the changes in BOLD. Here we explored this dependency by comparing different frequency-dependent and independent transfer functions, using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Our results suggest that changes in BOLD are indeed associated with changes in the spectral profile of neuronal activity and that these changes do not arise from one specific spectral band. Instead they result from the dynamics of the various frequency components together, in particular, from the relative power between high and low frequencies. Understanding the nature of the link between neuronal activity and BOLD plays a crucial role in improving the interpretability of BOLD images as well as on the design of more robust and realistic models for the integration of EEG and fMRI (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Placement of stimulation electrodes at the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for seizure reduction enables the study of the thalamocortical interplay in human subjects. Nocturnal sleep electroencephalograms (EEGs) and local field potentials (LFPs) of the left and right thalamus (LT, RT) were recorded in three subjects receiving ANT stimulation. Sleep stages were scored according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. The whole-night time-frequency coherence maps between EEG (C3, C4) and LFP (LT, RI) showed specific coherence patterns during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Pooled coherence in the NREM stage was significant in slow, delta, theta and spindle frequency ranges. The spindle oscillations had the highest coherence (0.17-0.58) in the homolateral hemisphere. Together, these observations indicate that the oscillations were related to thalamocortical circuitry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TOPOLOGICAL INFERENCE FOR EEG AND MEG	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Random field theory; topological inference; statistical parametric mapping	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; RANDOM-FIELD THEORY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; EVOKED FIELDS; IMAGES; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENT; SIGNALS; EEG/MEG; BRAIN	Neuroimaging produces data that are continuous in one or more dimensions. This calls for an inference framework that can handle data that approximate functions of space, for example, anatomical images, time-frequency maps and distributed source reconstructions of electromagnetic recordings over time. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is the standard framework for whole-brain inference in neuroimaging: SPM uses random field theory to furnish p-values that are adjusted to control family-wise error or false discovery rates, when making topological inferences over large volumes of space. Random field theory regards data as realizations of a continuous process in one or more dimensions. This contrasts with classical approaches like the Bonferroni correction, which consider images as collections of discrete samples with no continuity properties (i.e., the probabilistic behavior at one point in the image does not depend on other points). Here, we illustrate how random field theory can be applied to data that vary as a function of time, space or frequency. We emphasize how topological inference of this sort is invariant to the geometry of the manifolds on which data are sampled. This is particularly useful in electromagnetic studies that often deal with very smooth data on scalp or cortical meshes. This application illustrates the versatility and simplicity of random field theory and the seminal contributions of Keith Worsley (1951-2009), a key architect of topological inference.

A variety of effects of surgical incision on the electroencephalogram (EEG) during modern general anesthesia have been previously described; including both increases and decreases in both high and low frequencies in the EEG. What are the patterns commonly seen during routine clinical anesthesia? Methods. We analyzed pre-frontal EEG data from a previously published study (116 adult patients having general anesthesia maintained with either desflurane or propofol) (Leslie et al. in Anesthesiology 111: 547-555, 2009), The EEG was quantified using seven estimated parameters: slope and intercept of the underlying non-oscillatory (logarithmically transformed) power spectrum, amplitude and frequency of the episodic frontal alpha (EFA) oscillation, peak power in the delta waveband, high frequency variability index, and bispectral index (BIS). We compared a 30 s EEG segment from 2 min before, with that 2 min after the surgical incision. Results. The pre-incision EEGs showed a wide spread of different values for the estimated EEG parameters, but the propofol group had increased EFA amplitude. Incision was associated with decreased EFA activity (p = 0.0004), and high frequency variability (p = 0.04, repeated measures ANOVA). The effects of the incision were independent of the type of drug used for maintenance of anesthesia, and on the pre-incision BIS. The loss of EFA tended to be associated with an increase in delta power (r = -0.39, p < 0.0001). Conclusions. During anesthesia maintained with desflurane or propofol, surgical incision has modest effects on the EEG patterns. It does not cause an increase in high frequency power; the most consistent changes are a loss of EFA amplitude and burst suppression patterns. This effect is not strongly modified by the depth of anesthesia-as estimated by the BIS.

Methods: Standard all night EEG sleep parameters were obtained from 18 un-medicated subjects with AS and 14 controls (age range: 7.5-21.5 years) after one adaptation night. Spectral, and phase coherence measures were computed for multiple frequency bands during NREM sleep. Results: Sleep latency and wake after sleep onset were increased in AS. Absolute power spectrum density (PSD) was significantly reduced in AS in the alpha, sigma, beta and gamma bands and in all 10 EEG derivations. Relative PSD showed a significant increase in delta and a decrease in the sigma band for frontal, and in beta for centro-temporal derivations. Intrahemispheric coherence measures were markedly lower in AS in the frontal areas, and the right hemisphere over all EEG channels. The most prominent reduction in intrahemispheric coherence was observed over the fronto-central areas in delta, theta, alpha and sigma EEG frequency bands. Conclusion: EEG power spectra and coherence during NREM sleep, in particular in fronto-cortical derivations are different in AS compared to typically developing children and adolescents. Significance: Quantitative analysis of the EEG during NREM sleep supports the hypothesis of frontal dysfunction in AS. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Secondly, we detail the rationale and implementation of the "baseline-shift index" (BSI) for deducing whether empirical oscillations have non-zero mean. Finally, we illustrate with empirical data why the "amplitude fluctuation asymmetry" (AFA) index should be used with caution in research aimed at explaining variability in evoked responses through a mechanism of amplitude modulation of ongoing oscillations. Methods: An analytical approach, simulations and empirical MEG data were used to compare the specificity of BSI and AFA index to differentiate between a non-zero mean and a non-sinusoidal shape of neuronal oscillations. Results: Both the BSI and the AFA index were sensitive to the presence of non-zero mean in neuronal oscillations. The AFA index, however, was also sensitive to the shape of oscillations even when they had a zero mean. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that it is the non-zero mean of neuronal oscillations, and not an amplitude asymmetry of peaks and troughs, that is a prerequisite for the generation of evoked responses through a mechanism of amplitude modulation of oscillations. Significance: A clear distinction should be made between the shape and non-zero mean properties of neuronal oscillations. This is because only the latter contributes to evoked responses, whereas the former does not. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Perceptual priming leads to reduction of gamma frequency oscillations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cerebral cortex; plasticity; representation sharpening; gamma oscillations; learning	CORTICAL CIRCUITS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; MECHANISMS; REPETITION; MEMORY; BRAIN; COMPETITION; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION	Oscillations of neural activity are ubiquitous in the brain and are critical for normal cognitive function. In the visual system, repetitive presentation of a stimulus results in the reduction of power elicited in the gamma frequency band. However, this reduction does not result in degradation of perception; on the contrary, perception is improved by prior experience with the stimulus. To explain how reduction of gamma frequency oscillations, observed in priming experiments, can lead to improvement in behavior, we assume that visual processing takes place in two distinct stages: representation sharpening in the early visual areas and competitive interaction among representations in the higher visual areas and the prefrontal cortex. Here, we present a network model of spiking neurons that demonstrates how stimulus repetition leads to a decrease in power of the local field potential oscillations in the gamma frequency range in the early layer and also improves network response by reducing the latency to reach a decision in the higher area.

Subjects with high- (Highs) and low (Lows)-susceptibilities to hypnosis have shown different levels of skill at visual and somesthetic-guided imageries performed during upright stance. The aim of this experiment is to study the modulation of the EEG alpha and theta band amplitude during guided visual and somesthetic imageries in Highs and Lows, as these rhythms are responsive to the cognitive activities involved in mental imagery. Our results show that, at variance with standing subjects, subjects in both groups in a semi-reclined position report higher vividness and lower effort for visual than for somesthetic imagery. EEG patterns however are different between the two groups. Highs exhibit a more widespread alpha desynchronization and slightly different EEG patterns during visual and somesthetic imageries, while Lows show segregated alpha- and theta-desynchronization, without any difference between the tasks. Our results indicate that different. hypnotizability-related cognitive strategies, that are revealed by differences in EEG modulation, are responsible for the similar subjective experience associated with visual and somesthetic imageries in Highs and Lows. In addition, in both groups higher order mental representation of different sensory modalities might be subserved by a unique integrated neural network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

FMRI studies have localized load modulated activity to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Recently, an EEG-fMRI study found that low frequency band (theta and alpha) activity negatively correlated with the BOLD signal during the retention phase of a WM task. However, the coupling of higher (beta and gamma) frequencies with the BOLD signal during WM is unknown. Methodology: In 16 healthy adult subjects, we first investigated EEG-BOLD signal correlations for theta (5-7 Hz), alpha1 (8-10), alpha2 (10-12 Hz), beta1 (13-20), beta2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) during the retention period of a WM task with set size 2 and 5. Secondly, we investigated whether load sensitive brain regions are characterised by effects that relate frequency bands to BOLD signals effects. Principal Findings: We found negative theta-BOLD signal correlations in the MPFC, PPC, and cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). For alpha1 positive correlations with the BOLD signal were found in ACC, MPFC, and PCC; negative correlations were observed in DLPFC, PPC, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Negative alpha2-BOLD signal correlations were observed in parieto-occipital regions. Beta1-BOLD signal correlations were positive in ACC and negative in precentral and superior temporal gyrus. Beta2 and gamma showed only positive correlations with BOLD, e. g., in DLPFC, MPFC (gamma) and IFG (beta2/gamma). The load analysis revealed that theta and-with one exception-beta and gamma demonstrated exclusively positive load effects, while alpha1 showed only negative effects. Conclusions: We conclude that the directions of EEG-BOLD signal correlations vary across brain regions and EEG frequency bands. In addition, some brain regions show both load sensitive BOLD and frequency band effects. Our data indicate that lower as well as higher frequency brain oscillations are linked to neurovascular processes during WM.

Analyses of resting-state and task-related neural synchrony indicate that gamma-oscillations emerge during early childhood and precise temporal coordination through neural synchrony continues to mature until early adulthood. The late maturation of neural synchrony is compatible with changes in the myelination of cortico-cortical connections and with late development of GABAergic neurotransmission. These findings highlight the role of neural synchrony for normal brain development as well as its potential importance for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia.

The full details of their large-scale coordination across multiple cortical networks are still unknown. Furthermore, it is not known whether oscillations with similar characteristics are also present in the human brain. In this study, we examined the existence of gamma oscillations during poly-somnographically defined sleep-wake states using large-scale microelectrode recordings (up to 56 channels), with single-cell and spike-time precision, in epilepsy patients. We report that low (40-80 Hz) and high(80-120 Hz) gamma oscillations recurrently emerged overtime windows of several hundreds of milliseconds in all investigated cortical areas during slow-wave sleep. These patterns were correlated with positive peaks of EEG slow oscillations and marked increases in local cellular discharges, suggesting that they were associated with cortical UP states. These gamma oscillations frequently appeared at approximately the same time in many different cortical areas, including homotopic regions, forming large spatial patterns. Coincident firings with millisecond precision were strongly enhanced during gamma oscillations but only between cells within the same cortical area. Furthermore, in a significant number of cases, cortical gamma oscillations tended to occur within 100 ms after hippocampal ripple/sharp wave complexes. These data confirm and extend earlier animal studies reporting that gamma oscillations are transiently expressed during UP states during sleep. We speculate that these high-frequency patterns briefly restore "microwake" activity and are important for consolidation of memory traces acquired during previous awake periods.

Here the hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG human subjects trained to discriminate simultaneous visual-auditory CS. Signals were continuously recorded from 64 equispaced scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Hilbert transform gave the analytic phase, which segmented the EEG into temporal frames, and the analytic amplitude, which expressed the pattern in each frame as a feature vector. Methods applied to the ECoG were adapted to the EEG for systematic search of the beta-gamma spectrum, the time period after CS onset, and the scalp surface to locate patterns that could be classified with respect to type of CS. Spatial patterns of EEG amplitude modulation were found from all subjects that could be classified with respect to stimulus combination type significantly above chance levels. The patterns were found in the beta range (15-22 Hz) but not in the gamma range. They occurred in three short bursts following CS onset. They were non-local, occupying the entire array. Our results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so that future studies in brain-computer interfacing can be better focused. Our methods may be most valuable for analyzing data from dense arrays with very high spatial and temporal sampling rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maximum and mean levels of wavelet coefficient (WLC) were analyzed in the alpha-and theta-bands. In subjects with the rigid cognitive set, the WLC maxima in the alpha-band were higher than that in subjects with the plastic set. The mean level of the theta-oscillations in subjects without set manifestations (plastic set) was higher than in subjects who displayed erroneous responses (rigid set). At different stages of the experiment, different values of the maximum and mean levels were observed in the studied frequency bands.

This empirical observation has been confirmed and quantified by many investigators suggesting that the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli is facilitated by probability-based confidence of anticipation. However, the exact neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. Here we show that performance changes related to different levels of expectancy originate in dynamic modulation of delta oscillation phase. Our results obtained in rhythmic auditory target detection tasks indicated significant entrainment of the EEG delta rhythm to the onset of the target tones with increasing phase synchronization at higher levels of predictability. Reaction times correlated with the phase of the delta band oscillation at target onset. The fastest reactions occurred during the delta phase that most commonly coincided with the target event in the high expectancy conditions. These results suggest that low-frequency oscillations play a functional role in human anticipatory mechanisms, presumably by modulating synchronized rhythmic fluctuations in the excitability of large neuronal populations and by facilitating efficient task-related neuronal communication among brain areas responsible for sensory processing and response execution.

The approach is based on the utilization of an extended multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model, including instantaneous effects in addition to the lagged effects traditionally studied, to fit the observed multiple time series prior to PDC computation. Model identification is performed combining standard MVAR coefficient estimation with a recent technique for instantaneous causal modeling based on independent component analysis. The approach is first validated on simulated MVAR processes showing that, in the presence of instantaneous effects, only the extended model is able to interpret the imposed Granger causality patterns, while the traditional MVAR approach may yield strongly biased PDC estimates. The subsequent application to multichannel EEG time series confirms the potentiality of the approach in real data applications, as the importance of instantaneous effects led to significant differences in the PDC estimated after traditional and extended MVAR identification.

Individual/Typological Peculiarities of EEG Rearrangements in Humans Related to the Analysis of Olfactory Information: Role of Extroversion/Introversion	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; olfactory stimulation; olfactory analyzer; spectral power; coherence; essential oils; extroversion/introversion	EMOTION; NEUROTICISM; MEMORY; BRAIN; EXTROVERSION	We studied changes in human EEGs related to presentation of olfactory stimuli (smells of essential oils) and dependence of such rearrangements on the level of extroversion/introversion typical of the tested subject. It was shown that this feature of personality noticeably influences the pattern of odorant-induced changes in EEG. Persons with a predominance of introversion were characterized by higher levels of nonspecific activation of the brain related to perception of olfactory stimuli, which was manifested in a decrease in the power of low-frequency EEG components in the parietal, occipital, and temporal cerebral cortices. The pattern of the rise in coherence level of high-frequency spectrum range oscillations directed toward caudal leads is considered a manifestation of intensification of the intrinsic associative processes. In individuals with a predominance of extroversion, we observed, on the whole, smaller levels of nonspecific cerebral activation upon the action of olfactory stimulation. The fronto-parietal pattern of spatial EEG synchronization is indicative of the development of sensory-analytical processes related to perception of external information. In general, our data agree with the interpretation of such a psychological parameter as extroversion/introversion.	[Cherninskii, A. A.; Piskorskaya, N. G.; Zima, I. G.; Krizhanovskii, S.

Visual gamma oscillations and evoked responses: Variability, repeatability and structural MRI correlates	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; GABA CONCENTRATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN BRAIN; FREQUENCY; CORTEX; STRIATE; EEG; LOCALIZATION; COMPONENTS	There is increasing interest in the role gamma oscillations (similar to 40 Hz) play in visual information processing. Despite this interest, and in contrast to the classically studied visual evoked potential, surprisingly little is known about the intra-individual repeatability of induced gamma oscillations. Similarly, little is known about inter-individual variability in terms of gamma oscillation frequency, bandwidth and amplitude with no extant normative data for these parameters. The purpose of the current study was therefore to examine the repeatability of visual gamma oscillations and to provide the first normative data on them. Our results demonstrate that evoked responses were highly repeatable across recording sessions whereas for induced visual gamma oscillations a large amount of inter-individual variability existed in terms of frequency, bandwidth and amplitude. However, these parameters and the general morphology of the gamma band response were stable within the same individuals for at least 4 weeks. The high degree of individual variability in gamma oscillations for gamma amplitude, bandwidth and frequency suggests that between-group studies on gamma oscillations will be difficult, requiring relatively large amounts of data to detect differences. However, the high degree of individual repeatability for gamma oscillation frequency, bandwidth and amplitude suggests that these dependent variables will be well suited for repeated-measure designs such as pharmacological studies. A number of individuals are described which show clear evoked responses yet a near absence of gamma oscillations and vice versa suggesting dissociations between the generative mechanisms of these responses. Our results also demonstrate that gamma frequency tends to decline with age and is positively correlated with the thickness of the pericalcarine cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In animals, sleep spindles can be synchronous across multiple cortical and thalamic locations, suggesting a distributed stable phase-locked generating system. The high synchrony of spindles across scalp EEG sites suggests that this may also be true in humans. However, prior MEG studies suggest multiple and varying generators. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded 306 channels of MEG simultaneously with 60 channels of EEG during naturally occurring spindles of stage 2 sleep in 7 healthy subjects. High-resolution structural MRI was obtained in each subject, to define the shells for a boundary element forward solution and to reconstruct the cortex providing the solution space for a noise-normalized minimum norm source estimation procedure. Integrated across the entire duration of all spindles, sources estimated from EEG and MEG are similar, diffuse and widespread, including all lobes from both hemispheres. However, the locations, phase and amplitude of sources simultaneously estimated from MEG versus EEG are highly distinct during the same spindles. Specifically, the sources estimated from EEG are highly synchronous across the cortex, whereas those from MEG rapidly shift in phase, hemisphere, and the location within the hemisphere. Conclusions/Significance: The heterogeneity of MEG sources implies that multiple generators are active during human sleep spindles. If the source modeling is correct, then EEG spindles are generated by a different, diffusely synchronous system. Animal studies have identified two thalamo-cortical systems, core and matrix, that produce focal or diffuse activation and thus could underlie MEG and EEG spindles, respectively. Alternatively, EEG spindles could reflect overlap at the sensors of the same sources as are seen from the MEG. Although our results generally match human intracranial recordings, additional improvements are possible and simultaneous intra-and extra-cranial measures are needed to test their accuracy.

Thalamocortical model for a propofol-induced alpha-rhythm associated with loss of consciousness	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						general anesthesia; oscillations; global coherence; GABA	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; INHIBITORY NEURONS; MU RHYTHM; EEG; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; NETWORKS; FMRI	Recent data reveal that the general anesthetic propofol gives rise to a frontal alpha-rhythm at dose levels sufficient to induce loss of consciousness. In this work, a computational model is developed that suggests the network mechanisms responsible for such a rhythm. It is shown that propofol can alter the dynamics in thalamocortical loops, leading to persistent and synchronous alpha-activity. The synchrony that forms in the cortex by virtue of the involvement of the thalamus may impede responsiveness to external stimuli, thus providing a correlate for the unconscious state.

Magnetoencephalography demonstrates multiple asynchronous generators during human sleep spindles. J Neurophysiol 104: 179-188, 2010. First published April 28, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00198.2010. Sleep spindles are similar to 1 s bursts of 10-16 Hz activity that occur during stage 2 sleep. Spindles are highly synchronous across the cortex and thalamus in animals, and across the scalp in humans, implying correspondingly widespread and synchronized cortical generators. However, prior studies have noted occasional dissociations of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) from the EEG during spindles, although detailed studies of this phenomenon have been lacking. We systematically compared high-density MEG and EEG recordings during naturally occurring spindles in healthy humans. As expected, EEG was highly coherent across the scalp, with consistent topography across spindles. In contrast, the simultaneously recorded MEG was not synchronous, but varied strongly in amplitude and phase across locations and spindles. Overall, average coherence between pairs of EEG sensors was similar to 0.7, whereas MEG coherence was similar to 0.3 during spindles. Whereas 2 principle components explained similar to 50% of EEG spindle variance, similar to 15 were required for MEG. Each PCA component for MEG typically involved several widely distributed locations, which were relatively coherent with each other. These results show that, in contrast to current models based on animal experiments, multiple asynchronous neural generators are active during normal human sleep spindles and are visible to MEG. It is possible that these multiple sources may overlap sufficiently in different EEG sensors to appear synchronous. Alternatively, EEG recordings may reflect diffusely distributed synchronous generators that are less visible to MEG. An intriguing possibility is that MEG preferentially records from the focal core thalamocortical system during spindles, and EEG from the distributed matrix system.

Although the perceptual closure index observed in electroencephalography reflects that an object has been recognized, the full spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical source activity underlying perceptual closure processing remain unknown so far. To address this question, we recorded magnetoencephalographic activity in 15 subjects (11 females) during a visual closure task and performed beamforming over a sequence of successive short time windows to localize high-frequency gamma-band activity (60-100 Hz). Two-tone images of human faces (Mooney faces) were used to examine perceptual closure. Event-related fields exhibited a magnetic closure index between 250 and 325 ms. Time-frequency analyses revealed sustained high-frequency gamma-band activity associated with the processing of Mooney stimuli; closure-related gamma-band activity was observed between 200 and 300 ms over occipitotemporal channels. Time-resolved source reconstruction revealed an early (0-200 ms) coactivation of caudal inferior temporal gyrus (cITG) and regions in posterior parietal cortex (PPC). At the time of perceptual closure (200-400 ms), the activation in cITG extended to the fusiform gyrus, if a face was perceived. Our data provide the first electrophysiological evidence that perceptual closure for Mooney faces starts with an interaction between areas related to processing of three-dimensional structure from shading cues (cITG) and areas associated with the activation of long-term memory templates (PPC). Later, at the moment of perceptual closure, inferior temporal cortex areas specialized for the perceived object are activated, i.e., the fusiform gyrus related to face processing for Mooney stimuli.

In this work, we examine how sentence-level syntactic unification operations are reflected in the oscillatory dynamics of the MEG. Participants read sentences that were either correct, contained a word category violation, or were constituted of random word sequences devoid of syntactic structure. A time-frequency analysis of MEG power changes revealed three types of effects. The first type of effect was related to the detection of a (word category) violation in a syntactically structured sentence, and was found in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. A second type of effect was maximally sensitive to the syntactic manipulations: A linear increase in beta power across the sentence was present for correct sentences, was disrupted upon the occurrence of a word category violation, and was absent in syntactically unstructured random word sequences. We therefore relate this effect to syntactic unification operations. Thirdly, we observed a linear increase in theta power across the sentence for all syntactically structured sentences. The effects are tentatively related to the building of a working memory trace of the linguistic input. In conclusion, the data seem to suggest that syntactic unification is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the lower-beta frequency band.

One of the major advantages of this technique over the EEG is the lack of distortion of MEG signals by the skull and intervening soft tissue. In addition, the MEG preferentially records activity from tangential sources thus recording activity predominantly from sulci, which is not contaminated by activity from apical gyral (radial) sources. While the MEG is probably more sensitive than the EEG in detecting interictal spikes, especially in the some locations such as the superficial frontal cortex and the lateral temporal neocortex, both techniques are usually complementary to each other. The diagnostic accuracy of MEG source localization is usually better as compared to scalp EEG localization. Functional localization of eloquent cortex is another major application of the MEG. The combination of high spatial and temporal resolution of this technique makes it an extremely helpful tool for accurate localization of visual, somatosensory and auditory cortices as well as complex cognitive functions like language. Potential future applications include lateralization of memory function.

VWM is based on sustained neuronal activity in a complex cortical network of frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas. The neuronal mechanisms that coordinate this distributed processing to sustain coherent mental images and the mechanisms that set the behavioral capacity limit have remained unknown. We mapped the anatomical and dynamic structures of network synchrony supporting VWM by using a neuro informatics approach and combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Interareal phase synchrony was sustained and stable during the VWM retention period among frontoparietal and visual areas in alpha- (10-13 Hz), beta- (18-24 Hz), and gamma- (30-40 Hz) frequency bands. Furthermore, synchrony was strengthened with increasing memory load among the frontoparietal regions known to underlie executive and attentional functions during memory maintenance. On the other hand, the subjects' individual behavioral VWM capacity was predicted by synchrony in a network in which the intraparietal sulcus was the most central hub. These data suggest that interareal phase synchrony in the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency bands among frontoparietal and visual regions could be a systems level mechanism for coordinating and regulating the maintenance of neuronal object representations in VWM.

The signals used in this work come from individuals who are visually stimulated. The stimuli are black-and-white checkerboards, like stripes, flickering at different frequencies. Four experiments were performed for the BCI development. For all experiments, the volunteers were asked to watch a stimulation screen with a central stripe or to watch a stimulation screen with four stripes presented simultaneously, one at each side, one at the top and one at the bottom. The EEG signal analysis consists of two steps: feature extraction, performed using a statistic test, and classification, performed by a rule-based classifier. This kind of classifier obtains good results in a short time and does not demand any training. The result is a system with high classification rate (up to 96%), high information transfer rate (ITR) (up to 101.66 bits/min), and processing time of about 120 ms for each incremental analysis. Each frequency value can be associated to a user command or a user feeling. The user, who is seated on the wheelchair, can thus choose a specific place to move to. Upon such choice, the control system onboard the wheelchair generates reference paths with low risk of collision, connecting the current position to the chosen one. Therefore, a system to allow people with severe motor disfunction to have the quality of their lives improved is the proposal of the work.

The EEG was recorded in conditions of passive listening, mental and sensory-motor tasks. The artifact free trials were filtered (bandpass 0.5-45 [Hz]) and the normalized averaged power spectra for each record, tone and task condition was calculated. We compared the power spectra in alpha frequency range between stable, intermediate and neurotic groups divided according the scores on EPQ. The volunteers with high neuroticism scores showed more prominent power spectra in alpha 2 frequency range more expressed in task conditions. The obtained data showed specific functional meaning of event related oscillatory activity in cognitive and sensorymotor information processing depending on individual personality type.

Given this situation, we would expect that there should be observable and perhaps major changes in electrocortical activity and responses. In this review, we discuss developmental reductions in EEG power and alterations in the dominant band of EEG oscillation frequency, moderated by developmental factors such as growth-related changes in grey and white matter, and in the developmental history of cognitive and sociocultural stressors. Similarly, we summarize alterations in event-related potential components reflecting stimulus processing, response monitoring, and response anticipation. We review the literature on such changes in EEG and event-related potentials during the adolescent period and summarize some of the new developments in the field as well as interpretative difficulties.

This work aims at investigating the existence of habituation in the cortical response, more specifically in the alpha band peak of parietal and occipital areas (10-20 international system electroencephalogram, EEG, protocol). The EEG signals were acquired during sequences of MI of volleyball spike movement in kinesthetic and visual modalities and also at control condition. Thirty right-handed male subjects (18 to 40 years) were assigned to either an 'athlete' or a 'non-athlete' group, both containing 15 volunteers. Paired Wilcoxon tests (with alpha=0.05) indicates that sequential MI of complex tasks promotes cortical changes, mainly in the power vicinity of the alpha peak. This finding is more pronounced along the initial trials and also for the athletes during the modality of kinesthetic motor imagery.

The level of frontal-temporal beta-2 band EEG synchronization distinguishes anterior cingulate cortex from other frontal regions	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Anterior cingulate cortex; Consciousness; EEG; Large-scale integration	VISUAL-CORTEX; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; COGNITION; MODULATION; INTERFACE; ATTENTION; MECHANISM	Recent findings indicate that complex cognitive functions are organized at a global level in the brain and rely on large-scale information processing requiring functional integration of multiple disparate neural assemblies. The critical question of the integration of distributed brain activities is whether the essential integrative role can be attributed to a specific structure in the brain or whether this ability is inherent to the cognitive network as a whole. The results of the present study show that mean values of the running correlation function in frontal-temporal EEG pairs with one electrode in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are significantly higher than the same values in other frontal-temporal pairs. These findings indicate a particular role of the ACC in large-scale communication, which could reflect its unique integrative functions in cognitive processing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Shifts in gamma phase-amplitude coupling frequency from theta to alpha over posterior cortex during visual tasks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrocorticogram; oscillations; cross-frequency coupling; phase-amplitude coupling; gamma; alpha; theta	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS; REFLECT; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; INCREASES; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS	The phase of ongoing theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) electrophysiological oscillations is coupled to high gamma (80-150 Hz) amplitude, which suggests that low-frequency oscillations modulate local cortical activity. While this phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been demonstrated in a variety of tasks and cortical regions, it has not been shown whether task demands differentially affect the regional distribution of the preferred low-frequency coupling to high gamma. To address this issue we investigated multiple-rhythm theta/alpha to high gamma PAC in two subjects with implanted subdural electrocorticographic grids. We show that high gamma amplitude couples to the theta and alpha troughs and demonstrate that, during visual tasks, alpha/high gamma coupling preferentially increases in visual cortical regions. These results suggest that low-frequency phase to high-frequency amplitude coupling is modulated by behavioral task and may reflect a mechanism for selection between communicating neuronal networks.

Resting-state EEG gamma activity in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; Children; EEG; Gamma	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; STIMULANT MEDICATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; SUBTYPES	Objective: Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) have well-described abnormalities in the four traditional EEG bands. However, to date the gamma band has not been widely investigated. This study investigated resting-state EEG in children with AD/HD and matched controls, with a particular focus on gamma activity. Method: Forty children with AD/HD, and 40 age-and sex-matched controls, participated. EEG was recorded from 19 sites during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to provide estimates for absolute and relative power in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Results: Children with AD/HD had elevated levels of absolute delta and theta power, and decreased levels of absolute beta and gamma power, compared to controls. With relative power measures, children with AD/HD showed enhanced delta and theta activity, with reduced alpha, beta and gamma activity. Inattention scores on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale were negatively correlated with absolute gamma. Conclusions: These patients demonstrate the typical EEG profile in the eyes-closed resting state, over the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, associated with AD/HD. In addition, compared with controls, they demonstrate reduced absolute and relative gamma activity. These differences appear to contribute importantly to their dysfunctional stimulus processing, and impact their behavioural outcomes. Significance: This resting-state study extends the well-established fast-wave EEG deficits in children with AD/HD to the gamma band, and links that to increased inattention, which is of special importance in understanding their cognitive-processing problems.

QEEG study of chronic tinnitus patients	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							THALAMOCORTICAL-THETA COHERENCE; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; LIMBIC SYSTEM; HEARING-LOSS; BRAIN; PAIN; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Background: The physiopathological mechanism underlying the tinnitus phenomenon is still the subject of an ongoing debate. Since oscillatory EEG activity is increasingly recognized as a fundamental hallmark of cortical integrative functions, this study investigates deviations from the norm of different resting EEG parameters in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus. Results: Spectral parameters of resting EEG of male tinnitus patients (n = 8, mean age 54 years) were compared to those of age-matched healthy males (n = 15, mean age 58.8 years). On average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2-100 Hz. Using LORETA source analysis, the generators of delta, theta, alpha and beta power increases were localized dominantly to left auditory (Brodmann Areas (BA) 41,42, 22), temporo-parietal, insular posterior, cingulate anterior and parahippocampal cortical areas. Conclusions: Tinnitus patients show a deviation from the norm of different resting EEG parameters, characterized by an overproduction of resting state delta, theta and beta brain activities, providing further support for the microphysiological and magnetoencephalographic evidence pointing to a thalamocortical dysrhythmic process at the source of tinnitus. These results also provide further confirmation that reciprocal involvements of both auditory and associative/paralimbic areas are essential in the generation of tinnitus.

J	Born, J				Born, Jan			Slow-wave sleep and the consolidation of long-term memory	WORLD JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Hippocampus; memory; memory consolidation; sleep; slow oscillation; slow-wave sleep	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL; RIPPLES; REACTIVATION; PLASTICITY; NETWORKS; SPINDLES; HUMANS	Slow-wave sleep (SWS) has been shown to play an important role in the reinforcement of declarative memory. A dialogue between the neocortex and hippocampus is important during this consolidation and appears to be largely regulated by <1 Hz electroencephalographic (EEG) slow oscillations. Events experienced during wakefulness are encoded in the neocortex but, simultaneously they are encoded even more strongly in the hippocampus. Slow oscillations that characterize SWS originate in the neocortex and their amplitude increases with increased amounts of information encoded during prior waking. Neuronal activity is temporarily grouped by these slow oscillations into up-states of enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. Grouping is not only induced in the neocortex but also in other relevant structures, such as the thalamus and the hippocampus, generating spindle activity and sharp-wave ripples, respectively. Sharp-wave ripples are known to accompany a memory replay of encoded information in the hippocampus during SWS which stimulates the transfer of this memory-related information to the neocortex. The slow oscillations synchronize this transfer with the thalamocortical spindles arriving at the neocortex at the same time as the hippocampal memory information. This synchronization is thought to be critical to the long-term storage of respective memories within neocortical networks.

Such processes could start in the EEG as a result of a stimuli, e.g., steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). In many applications, the Welch method is used with standard set-ups for window lengths and number of averaged spectra/spectrograms. This paper optimizes the window lengths and number of windows of the Welch method and other more recent, socalled, multiple window or multitaper methods and compares the mean squared errors of these methods. Approximative formulas for the choice of optimal number of windows and window lengths are also given. Examples of spectrogram estimation of SSVEP are shown. (C) 2010 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, both tonic and phasic theta activity were analysed in 22 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 16 healthy elderly controls. Single-trial theta power responses were evaluated by an active auditory oddball paradigm along an early poststimulus window (0-250 ms) and a late time window (250-500 ms), and then compared to prestimulus theta power during both target tone and standard tone processing. The main findings were: (1) in AD patients, there was an increased prestimulus theta power, as well as no significant poststimulus theta power increase upon both target and non-target stimulus processing; (2) in healthy aged controls, only during target tone processing, an enhancement of both early and late theta responses relative to the prestimulus baseline was found. Moreover, healthy controls had a frontal dominance of theta power. The results might indicate that, during target processing, theta response is not functionally sensitive in AD and cannot be involved in processing demands as efficiently as in healthy controls. From a psychophysiological point of view, this might suggest an impairment of attentional allocation resources. The psychological implications might be related to selective attention/working-memory impairment from the early stage of the disease. Our data confirm that both tonic and phasic theta are relevant indicators of cognitive performance: the lack of a phasic theta and an increase in tonic theta are congruous findings in cognitive decline. Another factor worth noting is that in AD patients theta response is not dominant at the frontal site (as observed in healthy controls), indicating a weaker frontal lobe network reactivity during stimulus processing.

Brain dynamics in the auditory Go/NoGo task as a function of EEG frequency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain dynamics; Event-related potentials; Orthogonal phase effects; Phase synchronisation; Auditory Go/NoGo task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODDBALL TASK; STIMULUS ONSET; ALPHA-PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS	We examined relationships between the phase of narrow-band electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at stimulus onset and the resultant event-related potentials (ERPs) in an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task with a fixed SOA, in the context of a novel conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity vs. positivity, negative driving vs. positive driving, waxing vs. waning). ERP responses to each stimulus type were analysed. Prestimulus narrow-band EEG activity (in 1 Hz bands from 1 to 13 Hz) at Cz was assessed for each trial using FFT decomposition of the EEG data. For each frequency, the cycle at stimulus onset was used to sort trials into four phases, for which ERPs were derived from the raw EEG activity at 9 central sites. The occurrence of preferred phase-defined brain states was confirmed at a number of frequencies, crossing the traditional frequency bands. As expected, these did not differ between Go and NoGo stimuli. These preferred states were associated with more efficient processing of the stimulus, as reflected in differences in latency and amplitude of the N1 and P3 ERP components. The present results, although derived in a different paradigm by EEG decomposition methods different from those used previously, confirm the existence of preferred brain states and their impact on the efficiency of brain dynamics involved in perceptual and cognitive processing.

The local mean estimation of the quadrivariate signal is based on taking real-valued projections of the input in different directions in a multidimensional space where the signal resides. To this end, the set of direction vectors is generated on 3-sphere (residing in 4D space) via the low-discrepancy Hammersley sequence. It has also been shown that the resulting set of vectors is more uniformly distributed on a 3-sphere as compared to that generated by a uniform angular coordinate system. The ability of QEMD to extract common modes within multichannel data is demonstrated by simulations on both synthetic and real-world signals.

Reduction of irrelevant and redundant data from TFRs for EEG signal classification	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			TIME; SELECTION	Time-frequency representations (TFR) are one of the most popular characterization methods for non-stationary biosignals. Despite of their potential advantages, these representations suffer of large quantity of redundant and irrelevant data which makes them difficult to use for classification purposes. In this work, a methodology for reduction of irrelevant and redundant data is explored. This approach consists on removing irrelevant data, applying a relevance measure on the t-f plane that measures the dependence of each t-f point with the class labels. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are used as non-supervised and supervised linear decomposition approaches to reduce redundancy of remaining t-f points. Results show that the proposed methodology improves the performance of classifier up to 3% when no relevance and redundancy on TFRs is reduced.	[Avendano-Valencia, L. D.; Martinez-Vargas, J.

It was hypothesized that EEG-reactivity as reflected by different measures would be lower in the elderly. In two age groups (young: N = 23, mean age = 21.5+/-2.2 years; old: N = 25, mean age = 66.9 +/- 3.6 years) absolute frequency spectra, Omega-complexity, synchronization likelihood and network properties (clustering coefficient and characteristic path length) of the EEG were analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2 frequency bands occurring as a result of eyes opening. Absolute spectral power was higher in the young in the delta, alpha1 and alpha2 bands in the posterior area. The alpha1 peak frequency decreased following eyes opening in the young, while no change was observed in the elderly. Omega-complexity was higher in the elderly especially in the frontal area and increased following eyes opening. Values of the clustering coefficient, path length and that of the "small-world index" decreased as a result of eyes opening, the latter in the fast frequency range. The results suggest reduced reactivity in the elderly as shown by frequency spectra and decreased level of integrative activity particularly in the frontal area probably as a result of reduced interneuronal processing capacity. Indices of network characteristics reveal a shift towards more random topology especially in the beta frequencies caused by eyes opening. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the discriminatory power of non-phase-locked oscillations in a group of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAAs) and nonalcoholic controls (NACs). Methods: EEGs were recorded from 48 LTAAs and 48 age and gender comparable NACs during rest with eyes open (EO) and during the performance of a three-condition visual target detection task. The data were analyzed to extract resting power, ERP amplitude and non-phase-locked ERO power measures. Data were analyzed using MANCOVA to determine the discriminatory power of induced theta ERO vs. resting theta power vs. P300 ERP measures in differentiating the LTAA and NAC groups. Results: Both groups showed significantly more theta power in the pre-stimulus reference period of the task vs. the resting EO condition. The resting theta power did not discriminate the groups, while the LTAAs showed significantly less pre-stimulus theta power vs. the NACs. The LTAAs showed a significantly larger theta event-related synchronization (ERS) to the target stimulus vs. the NACs, even after accounting for pre-stimulus theta power levels. ERS to non-target stimuli showed smaller induced oscillations vs. target stimuli with no group differences. Alcohol use variables, a family history of alcohol problems, and the duration of alcohol abstinence were not associated with any theta power measures. Conclusions: While reference theta power in the task and induced theta oscillations to target stimuli both discriminate LTAAs and NACs, induced theta oscillations better discriminate the groups. Induced theta power measures are also more powerful and independent group discriminators than the P3b amplitude. Significance: Induced frontal theta oscillations promise to provide biomarkers of alcoholism that complement the well-established P300 ERP discriminators.

This system has been extensively studied using visual stimuli and recent evidence suggests that it is also responsive to the sound of motor actions. Here, we presented action (finger and tongue clicks) and acoustically matched sounds to investigate action-related sound processing in a 12-year-old child undergoing intracranial monitoring of epileptic seizures. Electroencephalography grids were located over a large portion of the right hemisphere, including motor cortex. Wavelet analysis carried out on electrodes overlying the functionally defined hand representation of the motor cortex revealed early (100 ms) and late (250-450 ms) decreases in mu rhythm power (12 and 20 Hz) selective for natural finger-clicks compared with control sounds. These data suggest the presence of a rapid, multimodal resonance mechanism modulating motor cortex activity.

Since it is crucial to identify the conditions when the site is changed with such beneficial or detrimental results, the peri-infarct changes were investigated before and just after inducing a focal infarct on rat cortex. The receptive fields in the peri-infarct cortex began to increase a few hours after the infarct, and reached a statistical significance at 6 hours (Dunnett post hoc tests; p<0.05). In temporal association with these changes, EEG in the peri-infarct cortex showed epileptiform activities containing large-amplitude spike-and-wave discharges. The gross amplitude, peak-to-peak amplitude and burst frequency showed statistically significant increases within 4 hours, in comparison to those of the controls (Dunnett post hoc tests; p<0.05). FFT power spectrum analyses showed a distinct increase in similar to 25 Hz frequency bands in the post-stroke groups. The homogeneous area of the contralateral hemisphere in the infarct group, in contrast, did not show such plastic or excitability changes. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that the peri-infarct cortex acquires the characteristics of potential epileptogenesis and functional recovery within hours of a stroke.

In this electroencephalographic study, we assessed hemispheric asymmetries in regulating motor responses by analyzing oscillatory brain activity during a go/nogo task in younger and older right-handed participants. Three conditions were embedded in the task: go, high-conflict and low-conflict nogo. The hand used to respond to go stimuli was varied block-wise. Independently of the go/nogo conditions and responding hand, young participants showed asymmetric desynchronizations in the mu (10 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) frequency bands that was stronger in the scalp sensorimotor region contralateral to the hand used for the go responses, while older adults showed a more symmetric pattern of desynchronization. These findings indicate that a loss of hemispheric asymmetry is a hallmark of the aging motor system, consistent with a decline of inter-hemispheric motor inhibition in normal aging.

Transient decoupling of cortical EEGs following arousals during NREM sleep in middle-aged and elderly women	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Arousals; Sleep; Interdependence; Age; Mutual information	MUTUAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; TIME; DELTA; RELIABILITY; DISTURBANCE; COHERENCE; ELECTRODE; PATTERNS	Spontaneous cortical arousals in non-REM sleep increase with age and contribute to sleep fragmentation in the elderly. EEG spectral power in the faster frequencies exhibits well-described shifts during arousals. On the other hand, EEG activities also exhibit correlations, which are interpreted as an index of interdependence between distant cortical neural activities. The possibility of changes to the interdependence between cortical regions due to an arousal has not been considered. In this work, using previously recorded C3A2 and C4A1 EEG signals from two groups of adults, middle-aged (42-50 years) and elderly (71-86 years) women, we examined the effects of spontaneous arousals in NREM sleep on cortical interdependence. We quantified the auto- and cross-correlations in these signals using mutual information and characterized these correlations in periods before the onset and following the end of arousals. The pre-arousal period exhibited significantly higher interdependence between central regions than that following the arousal in both age groups (middle-aged: p = 0.004, elderly: p < 0.0001). Also, for both EEG signals the auto mutual information had a faster rate of decay, implying lower signal predictability, following the arousal than prior to it (both age groups, p < 0.0001). These results indicate that the state of the cortex is different after, compared to before, the arousal even when the spectral power changes characteristic of an arousal are no longer visible. The findings suggest that the state following an arousal characterized by lower interdependence may resemble a more vigilant period during which the system may be vulnerable to more arousals.

As such they have been implicated in rhythm generation of network activity in many brain regions including the hippocampus. However, several recent publications indicate that their roles extend beyond that of rhythm generation. Firstly, it has been shown that, in addition to rhythm generation, GABAergic perisomatic inhibition also serves as a current generator contributing significantly to hippocampal oscillatory EEG signals. Furthermore, GABAergic interneurons have a previously unrecognized role in the initiation of hippocampal population bursts, both in the developing and adult hippocampus. In this review, we describe these new observations in detail and discuss the implications they have for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological hippocampal network activities. This review is part of the Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience's special topic entitled "GABA signaling in health and disease" based on the meeting at the CNCR Amsterdam.

Application of matched filtering to identify behavioral modulation of brain oscillations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Motor system; Local field potentials; Brain oscillations; Matched filtering	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; MOTOR CORTEX; MOVEMENT; OUTPUT; RHYTHM; EEG	Brain oscillations modulated by motor behaviors are coupled to steady-state and other potentially unrelated to movement oscillations, with energy in the same frequency bands as the signals of interest. We applied matched filtering, a quasi-optimum signal detection technique, to decouple and extract movement-related signals from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in monkey motor cortical areas during the execution of a visually instructed reach-out task. Using a matched-filterbank, we examined coupling and interference of pre-movement and initial steady-state oscillations with movement-induced signals. Once these signal contributions were eliminated, we were able to identify significant correlations of the residual signals with behavioral parameters, which appeared attenuated by pre-movement signal interference in the raw LFPs. Specifically, the maximum and minimum amplitudes of filtered LFPs were directly modulated by peak movement velocity and micro-movements, respectively, identified in recorded hand velocity profiles. In addition, we identified phase correlations between signals during the delay (when the instructional cue was presented) and movement intervals, as well as modulation of LFP phase by movement direction. For pairs of orthogonal movement directions, corresponding LFP signals were consistently out of phase. Finally, beta-band energy which is typically reduced during movement execution, possibly partly due to destructive interference between the modulated by behavior signal and unrelated oscillations, appeared to be recovered in the filtered signals.

This review summarizes progress in research on mechanisms of their generation and potential clinical applications over that period. Recent findings Initially, pHFOs were recorded with microelectrodes in the hippocampus of rodents and patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), but recently pHFOs have also been recorded with clinical depth and grid electrodes in multiple brain areas including the hippocampus and neocortex of patients with different types of epilepsy. One hypothesis is that pHFOs reflect fields of hypersynchronized action potentials (bursts of population spikes) within small discrete neuronal clusters responsible for seizure generation. Studies suggest that pHFOs can be used as a reliable biomarker for epileptogenesis, epileptogenicity, and the delineation of the epileptogenic region. Summary Recording of pHFOs with clinical electrodes provides a means for further investigation of their functional role in the epileptic brain and as a potential biomarker of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity and for presurgical mapping.

Reactivity of hemodynamic responses and functional connectivity to different states of alpha synchrony: A concurrent EEG-fMRI study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG-FMRI; ICA; Resting state; Spontaneous activity; HRF; Functional connectivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN-FUNCTION; DEFAULT-MODE; RHYTHM; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; SIGNAL	Concurrent EEG-fMRI studies have provided increasing details of the dynamics of intrinsic brain activity during the resting state. Here, we investigate a prominent effect in EEG during relaxed resting, i.e. the increase of the alpha power when the eyes are closed compared to when the eyes are open. This phenomenon is related to changes in thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical synchronization. In order to investigate possible changes to EEG-fMRI coupling and fMRI functional connectivity during the two states we adopted a data-driven approach that fuses the multimodal data on the basis of parallel ICA decompositions of the fMRI data in the spatial domain and of the EEG data in the spectral domain. The power variation of a posterior alpha component was used as a reference function to deconvolve the hemodynamic responses from occipital, frontal, temporal, and subcortical fMRI components. Additionally, we computed the functional connectivity between these components. The results showed widespread alpha hemodynamic responses and high functional connectivity during eyes-closed (EC) rest, while eyes open (EO) resting abolished many of the hemodynamic responses and markedly decreased functional connectivity. These data suggest that generation of local hemodynamic responses is highly sensitive to state changes that do not involve changes of mental effort or awareness. They also indicate the localized power differences in posterior alpha between EO and EC in resting state data are accompanied by spatially widespread amplitude changes in hemodynamic responses and inter-regional functional connectivity, i.e. low frequency hemodynamic signals display an equivalent of alpha reactivity.

Spatially and spectrally distributed oscillations are imposed on the background activity by inhibitory feedback in the gamma range (3080 Hz). Beats recur at theta rates (37 Hz), at which the order parameter transiently approaches zero and microscopic activity becomes disordered. After these null spikes, the order parameter resurges and initiates a frame bearing a mesoscopic spatial pattern of gamma amplitude modulation that governs the microscopic activity, and that is correlated with behavior. The brain waves also reveal a spatial pattern of phase modulation in the form of a cone. Using the formalism of the dissipative many-body model of brain, we describe the null spike as a singularity, the following amplitude pattern as a ground state, and the phase cone as the manifestation of a stabilizing vortex.

A putative marker of such mirror activity is the suppression of electroencephalographic oscillations in the 8-12 Hz range, which, when recorded over somatosensory areas, is associated with motor activity and labeled mu rhythms. We investigated whether mu-suppression can be modulated by attention to another person's intention as expressed by her hand movement toward an object and whether this suppression is distinguished from the suppression of alpha waves that oscillate in the same frequency range and are modulated by attention and cognitive load. Both mu and alpha suppressions were modulated by task difficulty, and not distinctively by intention, reflecting the recruitment of resources needed for task performance.

Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies that demonstrated a genetic contribution to evoked responses generally focused on characteristics of representative brain potentials. Here we demonstrate significantly smaller amplitude differences within MZ compared to DZ twin pairs for the complete SEF time series (across left and right hand SEFs: 0.37 vs. 0.60 pT(2) and 0.28 vs. 0.39 pT(2) for primary [SI] and secondary [SII] sensory cortex activation) and higher MZ than DZ wave shape correlations (.71 vs. .44 and .52 vs. .35 for SI and SII activation). Our findings indicate a genetic influence on MEG-recorded evoked brain activity and also confirm our recent conclusion (van 't Ent, van Soelen, Stam, De Geus, & Boomsma, 2009) that higher MZ resemblance for EEG amplitudes is not trivially reflecting greater MZ concordance in intervening biological tissues.

Twenty-eight children, 22 young adults and 20 middle-aged participants were administered the same sample of written words and normalized amplitudes of delta, theta, alpha and beta bands were analyzed. Only young adults showed rightwards lateralization in delta frequency band. Task-dependent right-lateralization marked adults' theta and alpha distributions, whereas only linguistic vs. non-linguistic differences were found in children. Concerning the high-beta band, all groups showed left-lateralized linguistic effects. In adults slow rhythms represent indices of active inhibition of task-irrelevant regions, but in children they marked incomplete automated linguistic processing.

Direct brain recordings fuel advances in cognitive electrophysiology	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; HIGH-FREQUENCY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; HUMAN CORTEX; BOLD FMRI	Electrocorticographic brain recordings in patients with surgically implanted electrodes have recently emerged as a powerful tool for examining the neural basis of human cognition. These recordings measure the electrical activity of the brain directly, and thus provide data with higher temporal and spatial resolution than other human neuroimaging techniques. Here we review recent research in this area and in particular we explain how electrocorticographic recordings have provided insight into the neural basis of human working memory, episodic memory, language, and spatial cognition. In some cases this research has identified patterns of human brain activity that were unexpected on the basis of studies in animals.

J	Koenig, T; Melie-Garcia, L				Koenig, Thomas; Melie-Garcia, Lester			A Method to Determine the Presence of Averaged Event-Related Fields Using Randomization Tests	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Evoked potentials; Randomization; Global Field Power; Averaging; Signal-to-noise ratio		We present a simple and effective method to test whether an event consistently activates a set of brain electric sources across repeated measurements of event-related scalp field data. These repeated measurements can be single trials, single subject ERPs, or ERPs from different studies. The method considers all sensors simultaneously, but can be applied separately to each time frame or frequency band of the data. This allows limiting the analysis to time periods and frequency bands where there is positive evidence of a consistent relation between the event and some brain electric sources. The test may therefore avoid false conclusions about the data resulting from an inadequate selection of the analysis window and bandpass filter, and permit the exploration of alternate hypotheses when group/condition differences are observed in evoked field data. The test will be called topographic consistency test (TCT). The statistical inference is based on simple randomization techniques. Apart form the methodological introduction, the paper contains a series of simulations testing the statistical power of the method as function of number of sensors and observations, a sample analysis of EEG potentials related to self-initiated finger movements, and Matlab source code to facilitate the implementation. Furthermore a series of measures to control for multiple testing are introduced and applied to the sample data.

It will be discussed that at both levels electroencephalographic theta activity is responsible for control of working memory functions. On item level, exact phase coding, e.g., approached by coupling between theta and gamma oscillations or phase resetting of theta frequency, is suggested to integrate information into working memory representations. At process level interregional theta synchronization is discussed to integrate brain structures necessary for working memory. When discussing the specificity of theta activity for control of working memory processes it will be suggested that theta oscillations might play an important general integrative role in organization of brain activity. And as working memory often involves a variety of cognitive processes which need to be coordinated there is particular need for an integrative brain mechanism like theta activity as suggested in this review.

Here we argue that the full manifestation of this fundamental sleep oscillation in a corticothalamic module requires the dynamic interaction of three cardinal oscillators: one predominantly synaptically based cortical oscillator and two intrinsic, conditional thalamic oscillators. The functional implications of this hypothesis are discussed in relation to other EEG features of NREM sleep, with respect to coordinating activities in local and distant neuronal assemblies and in the context of facilitating cellular and network plasticity during slow-wave sleep.

Methods - This modulation, which is a sort of phase dependent amplitude modulation, is studied in 10 children in various depths of Desflurane anesthesia. Two parameters are defined 10 quantify the modulation: strength of modulation (SOM) and phase of modulation (POM). SOM indicates to what extent delta and alpha activities we related to each other, and POM is the delta phase in which the alpha amplitude is maximal. These parameters are analyzed in different DOA for various formations of delta sub-bands. Results. - The ability of POM and SOM were explored to characterize mechanisms contributing to delta activities and their correlation with the level of anesthesia These parameters are influenced by DOA and frequency intervals of delta sub-bands. SOM takes higher values around certain frequency ranges of delta band According to this, delta band comprises three main sub-bands in various unconsciousness levels. Although boundaries of these sub-bands change with DOA, they are almost in [0.1-0.5] Hz (very slow delta), [0.7-1.7] Hz (slow delta) and [2-4] Hz (fast delta) intervals. POMs relating to slow and fast delta bands increase with consciousness level This is in indication that delta waves differently modulate alpha EEG activities (in terms of phase lag) in different DOA. In deep anesthesia, POM relating to fast delta correlates with DOA better than POM relating to slow delta does In light anesthesia this correlation is inversed. Investigation regarding to different formations of delta sub-bands shows that POM relating to [1.8-4] Hz is a proper choice for distinguishing deep, moderate and light anesthesia. Conclusion - SOM allows separating mechanisms underlying delta band activities, and POM call be seen as a complementary neurophysiologic-based parameter for quantifying DOA (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We investigated whether HFOs can delineate epileptogenic areas even outside the SOZ by correlating the resection of HFO-generating areas with surgical outcome. Methods: Twenty patients who underwent a surgical resection for medically intractable epilepsy were studied. All had presurgical intracerebral EEG (500Hz filter and 2,000Hz sampling rate), at least 12-month postsurgical follow-up, and a postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HFOs (ripples, 80-250Hz; fast ripples, >250Hz) were identified visually during 5 to 10 minutes of slow-wave sleep. Rates and extent of HFOs and interictal spikes in resected versus nonresected areas, assessed on postsurgical MRIs, were compared with surgical outcome (Engel's classification). We also evaluated the predictive value of removing the SOZ in terms of surgical outcome. Results: The mean duration of follow-up was 22.7 months. Eight patients had good (Engel classes 1 and 2) and 12 poor (classes 3 and 4) surgical outcomes. Patients with a good outcome had a significantly larger proportion of HFO-generating areas removed than patients with a poor outcome. No such difference was seen for spike-generating regions or the SOZ. Interpretation: The correlation between removal of HFO-generating areas and good surgical outcome indicates that HFOs could be used as a marker of epileptogenicity and may be more accurate than spike-generating areas or the SOZ. In patients in whom the majority of HFO-generating tissue remained, a poor surgical outcome occurred.

It is still unclear how various cues interact to achieve this unified percept and whether this interaction depends on task demands. Studies investigating the effect of cue combination on the human EEG are still lacking. in the present study, we combined psychophysics, ERP and time-frequency analysis to investigate the interaction of orientation and spatial frequency as visual cues in a figure detection task. The figure was embedded in a matrix of Gabor elements, and we systematically varied figure saliency by changing the underlying cue configuration. We found a strong correlation between the posterior P2 amplitude and the perceived saliency of the figure: the P2 amplitude decreased with increasing saliency. Analogously, the power of the theta-band decreased for more salient figures. At longer latencies, the posterior P3 component was modulated in amplitude and latency, possibly reflecting increased decision confidence at higher saliencies. in conclusion, when the cue composition (e.g. one or two cues) or cue strength is changed in a figure detection task, first differences in the electrophysiological response reflect the perceived saliency and not directly the underlying cue configuration.

J	Seelke, AMH; Blumberg, MS				Seelke, Adele M. H.; Blumberg, Mark S.			Developmental appearance and disappearance of cortical events and oscillations in infant rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sleep; EEG; Delta activity; Slow activity transient; Spindle burst; GABA	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; CORTEX IN-VIVO; SPINDLE BURSTS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; QUIET SLEEP; EEG; GABA; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS	Until recently, organized and state-dependent neocortical activity in infant rats was thought to commence with the emergence of delta waves at postnatal day (P)11. This view is changing with the discovery of several forms of cortical activity that are detectible soon after birth, including spindle bursts (SBs) and slow activity transients (SATs). Here we provide further evidence of surprisingly rich cortical activity patterns during early development and document, in P5-P13 rats, the appearance, disappearance, and transient expression of three cortical events and oscillations. EEG activity in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices was recorded in unanesthetized, head-fixed subjects using 16-channel laminar silicon electrodes and Ag-AgCl electrodes. In addition to SATs, we identified two novel forms of activity: cortical sharp potentials (CSPs) and gamma bursts (GBs). SBs were not observed in these areas. CSPs, defined as discrete, biphasic events with a duration of 250 ms, exhibited an inverted-U developmental trajectory with peak prevalence at P9. In contrast, GBs, defined as brief bursts of 40-Hz activity, increased steadily in prevalence and duration from P5 through P13. The prevalence of SATs decreased steadily across the ages tested here. Furthermore, both CSPs and GBs were more likely to occur during sleep than during wakefulness. Because SATs, CSPs, and GBs exhibit different developmental trajectories and rates of occurrence, and can occur independently of each other, they appear to be distinct patterns of neuronal activity. We hypothesize that these diverse patterns of neurophysiological activity reflect the instantaneous local structure and connectivity of the developing neocortex. Published by Elsevier B.V.

While slow oscillations are primarily generated and modulated by the cortex, sleep spindles are initiated by the thalamic reticular nucleus and regulated by thalamo-reticular and thalamo-cortical circuits. In a recent high-density EEG study, the authors found that 18 medicated schizophrenia patients had reduced sleep spindles, compared with healthy and depressed subjects, during the first non-REM episode. In the present study, the authors investigated whether spindle deficits were present in a larger sample of schizophrenia patients, were consistent across the night, were related to antipsychotic medications, and were suggestive of impairments in specific neuronal circuits. Method: Whole-night high-density EEG recordings were performed in 49 schizophrenia patients, 20 nonschizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotic medication, and 44 healthy subjects. In addition to sleep spindles, several parameters of slow waves were assessed. Results: Schizophrenia patients had whole-night deficits in spindle power (12-16 Hz) and in slow (12-14 Hz) and fast (14-16 Hz) spindle amplitude, duration, number, and integrated activity in the prefrontal, centroparietal, and temporal regions. Integrated spindle activity and spindle number had the largest effect sizes (effect size: >= 2.21). In contrast, no slow wave deficits were found in schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: These results indicate that spindle deficits can be reliably established in schizophrenia, are stable across the night, are unlikely to be due to antipsychotic medications, and point to deficits in the thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamo-reticular circuits.

This has particular significance clinically, as for example falling injuries may occur if care is not taken to perform tasks one at a time. We investigated whether this difficultyx results from impaired dopamine-modulated connectivity. We recorded the EEG in PD subjects off and on L-dopa medication performing simultaneous and unimanual tracking tasks. To deal with the inherent non-stationarity of the EEG during motor tasks, we segmented the data into task-related sections based on transient synchronisation between independent components of the data, before assessing the mutual information (MI) between each EEG channel pair. In both tasks, PD subjects off-medication demonstrated enhanced fronto-central and decreased occipital synchronisation within theta and alpha bands, and widespread increased beta-band synchronisation, compared to controls. Synchronisation changes in theta and beta bands were partially normalised by L-dopa, but L-dopa had relatively little effect on alpha band synchronisation. When comparing simultaneous movements to unimanual tracking, PD subjects off-medication demonstrated synchronisation changes within theta and beta bands, however alpha connectivity was largely unchanged. These results suggest that downstream influences of impaired basal ganglia function on cortico-cortical connectivity may result in difficulties with dual task performance in PD.

The EEG data analysis was based on the resting eyes closed brain activity of 300 respondents (160 females). The NIRS analyses was based on 155 respondents (88 females). The total power, coherence and approximate entropy measures were calculated for the EEG recordings in the delta, theta, lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha, upper alpha, beta and gamma bands. Based on the filtered NIRS data the concentration, the peak frequency and the Hurst exponent (H) of oxi-Hb and deoxi-Hb were determined. Higher power values in females as compared with males were observed in the beta and gamma bands. In the lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha and upper alpha bands this difference was only pronounced in the parieto-occipital areas. Higher coherences in the delta band in females as compared to males was observed, whereas a reverse pattern of differences was present in the beta and gamma bands. A similar pattern of differences was also observed for the ApEn measures. Males showed a higher percentage of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, more irregular and faster spontaneous fluctuations in oxi-Hb and deoxi-Hb as compared with females. It can be concluded that males and females differ in the local as well as long range coding of information - the binding of distributed responses - as well as in the excitability dynamics of their cortical network.

Unsupervised classification of high-frequency oscillations in human neocortical epilepsy and control patients. J Neurophysiol 104: 2900-2912, 2010. First published September 1, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.01082.2009. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been observed in animal and human intracranial recordings during both normal and aberrant brain states. It has been proposed that the relationship between subclasses of these oscillations can be used to identify epileptic brain. Studies of HFOs in epilepsy have been hampered by selection bias arising primarily out of the need to reduce the volume of data so that clinicians can manually review it. In this study, we introduce an algorithm for detecting and classifying these signals automatically and demonstrate the tractability of analyzing a data set of unprecedented size, over 31,000 channel-hours of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings from micro- and macroelectrodes in humans. Using an unsupervised approach that does not presuppose a specific number of clusters in the data, we show direct evidence for the existence of distinct classes of transient oscillations within the 100- to 500-Hz frequency range in a population of nine neocortical epilepsy patients and two controls. The number of classes we find, four (three plus one putative artifact class), is consistent with prior studies that identify "ripple" and "fast ripple" oscillations using human-intensive methods and, additionally, identifies a less examined class of mixed-frequency events.

This paper describes a real-time detection algorithm for SWDs based on continuous wavelet analyses in rodents. It has been implemented in a commercially available data acquisition system and its performance experimentally verified. ECoG recordings lasting 5-8 h from rats (n = 8) of the WAG/Rij strain were analyzed using the real-time SWD detection system. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to detect SWDs within 1 s with 100% sensitivity and with a precision of 96.6% for the number of SWDs. Similar results are achieved for 24-h ECoG recordings of two rats. The dependence of accuracy and speed of detection on program settings and attributes of ECoG are discussed. It is concluded that the wavelet based real-time detecting algorithm is well suited for automatic, real-time detection of SWDs in rodents. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Theta oscillations in primate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in forewarned reaction time tasks. J Neurophysiol 103: 827-843, 2010. First published December 9, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00358.2009. Previously, we introduced a monkey model for human frontal midline theta oscillations as a possible neural correlate of attention. It was based on homologous theta oscillations found in the monkey's prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices (areas 9 and 32) in a self-initiated hand-movement task. However, it has not been confirmed whether theta activity in the monkey model consistently appears in other situations demanding attention. Here, we examined the detailed properties of theta oscillations in four variations of forewarned reaction time tasks with warning (S1) and imperative (S2) stimuli. We characterized the theta oscillations generated exclusively in areas 9 and 32, as follows: 1) in the S1-S2 interval where movement preparation and reward expectation were presumably involved, the theta power was higher than in the pre-S1 period; 2) in the no-go trials of go/no-go tasks instructed by S1, the theta power in the S1-S2 interval was lower than in the pre-S1 period in an asymmetrical reward condition, whereas it was moderately higher in a symmetrical condition; 3) the theta power after reward delivery was higher than in the unrewarded trials; 4) the theta power in the pre-S1 period was higher than in the resting condition; and 5) when the monkey had to guess the S1-S2 duration internally without seeing S2, the theta power in the pre-S1 period was higher than in the original S1-S2 experiment. These findings suggest that attentional loads associated with different causes can induce the same theta activity, thereby supporting the consistency of attention-dependent theta oscillations in our model.

Until now the sleep-related course of active renin levels is unknown. Furthermore, there are no data on the effects of age and gender on nocturnal renin and the interaction between these variables, sleep, growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Methods: We investigated simultaneously sleep EEG (23:00-07:00 h) and the plasma concentrations (23:00-07:00 h) of active renin (in 10-min intervals) and of GH and cortisol (in 20-min intervals) in 47 healthy volunteers (24 women and 23 men) aged 19-69 years. Results: In the total sample, significant positive correlations were found between renin concentrations and NREM sleep and the sleep efficiency index, whereas a significant negative correlation exists to wakefulness. Renin shows also a positive correlation to GH levels which is restricted to the younger subjects (<40 years) during NREM sleep. No association exists between renin and cortisol. The averaged nocturnal mean renin levels were significantly lower in female than in male subjects, and in subjects older than 40 years than in younger subjects. Oscillations of active renin levels were found with increases during NREM periods and decreases during REM periods. Conclusions: In all, nocturnal averaged renin levels are lower in women than in men, decrease during ageing and correlate positively with GH, whereas the interaction between renin and sleep is independent from age and gender.

The Significance of Frontal Intermittent Rhythmic Delta Activity in Children	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							ACTIVITY FIRDA; EEG; LESIONS; BURSTS; WAVES	Objective: To determine the correlation between frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) and the clinical and radiological correlates in children. Methods: Retrospective review of the EEG and imaging studies of 37 children with documented FIRDA. Results: FIRDA was associated with multiple neurological conditions and not necessarily with midline lesions. Patients with abnormal neurological exam had a longer FIRDA duration (average 9.5 seconds) compared to children with no reported abnormal examination (average of 6.5 seconds). FIRDA ranged from 2 to 2.5 Hz (n=15), 3 Hz (n=17) and from 1.5 to 3 Hz (n=5) and there was a significant association between the duration of FIRDA and abnormal laboratory tests (p. <0.05, Student's T test). Conclusion: FIRDA was not correlated with midline brain lesions in children. FIRDA may be a non specific oscillation of an unhealthy pediatric brain with or without seizures.

Twenty patients with ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, with different disease duration (first episode and duration of more than two years) and 38 healthy people were studied. The presence and intensity of positive and negative symptoms were measured by the PANSS scale and cognitive functions were assessed using neuropsychological tests. Compared to the controls, the gamma-rhythm power was higher in patients with the prevalence of positive symptoms and lower in patients with negative symptoms. The reduced number of coherent relations, in particular, interhemispheric ones, and the absence of gamma-band synchronization in different brain areas were found in patients as well.	[Magomedov, R.

Identical Fits of Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization May Correspond to Different Extracted Event-related Potentials	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; UNINTERRUPTED SOUND PARADIGM; PARALLEL FACTOR-ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; TENSOR FACTORIZATION; MATRIX FACTORIZATION; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; EEG; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS	Nonnegative Matrix 1 Tensor factorization (NMF INTF) have been used in the study of EEG, and the fit (explained variation) is often used to evaluate the performance of a nonnegative decomposition algorithm. However, this parameter only reveals the information derived from the mathematical model and just exhibits the reliability of the algorithms, and the property of EEG can not be reflected. If fits of two algorithms are identical, it is necessary to examine whether the desired components extracted by them are identical too. In order to verify this doubt, we performed NMF and NTF on the same dataset of an auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), and found that the identical fits of NMF and NTF under the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithms corresponded to different desired ERPs extracted by NMF and NTF, moreover, NTF contributed the ERP with much better timing and spectral properties. Such analysis implies that to combine the fit and property of the desired ERP component together helps evaluate the performance of NMF and NTF algorithms in the study of ERPs.

[2009]: Neuroimage 44:1290-1303) have shown that it may be possible to distinguish between different neuronal populations on the basis of their macroscopically measured (EEG/MEG) mean field. We set out to test whether the different orientation columns contributing to a signal at a specific cortical location could be identified based on the measured MEG signal. We used 1.5deg square, static, obliquely oriented grating stimuli to generate sustained gamma oscillations in a focal region of primary visual cortex. We then used multivariate classifier methods to predict the orientation (left or right oblique) of the stimuli based purely on the time-series data from this one location. Both the single trial evoked response (0-300 ms) and induced post-transient power spectra (300-2,300 ms, 20-70 Hz band) due to the different stimuli were classifiable significantly above chance in 11/12 and 10/12 datasets respectively. Interestingly, stimulus-specific information is preserved in the sustained part of the gamma oscillation, long after perception has occurred and all neuronal transients have decayed. Importantly, the classification of this induced oscillation was still possible even when the power spectra were rank-transformed showing that the different underlying networks give rise to different characteristic temporal signatures.

Effects of Parkinson's disease on brain-wave phase synchronisation and cross-modulation	EPL			English	Article							GAIT; EEG; SLEEP; FREQUENCY; MEG	We study the effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on phase synchronisation and cross-modulation of instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies for brain waves during sleep. Analysing data from 40 full-night EEGs (electro-encephalograms) of ten patients with PD and ten age-matched healthy controls we find that phase synchronisation between the left and right hemisphere of the brain is characteristically reduced in patients with PD. Since there is no such difference in phase synchronisation for EEGs from the same hemisphere, our results suggest the possibility of a relation with problems in coordinated motion of left and right limbs in some patients with PD. Using the novel technique of amplitude and frequency cross-modulation analysis, relating oscillations in different EEG bands and distinguishing both positive and negative modulation, we observe an even more significant decrease in patients for several band combinations.

Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that event-related oscillations (EROs) may be good indices of alcoholism risk in humans, however, have not been evaluated for their ability to index the effects of EtOH exposure. The objective of the present study was to characterize EROs generated in hippocampus in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence. Adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to EtOH vapor for 12 h/d for 10 days. A time-frequency representation method was used to determine delta, theta, alpha and beta ERO energy and the degree of phase variation in the hippocampus of adult rats exposed to EtOH and age-matched controls. The present results suggest that the decrease in P3 amplitudes, previously observed in adult rats exposed to EtOH during adolescence, is associated with increases in evoked theta ERO energy. These studies suggest that EROs are suitable for characterizing the long-term effects of adolescent EtOH exposure. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between the mechanisms that regulate these neurophysiological endophenotypes and the consequences of adolescent EtOH exposure.

The effect of a mental task on the synchronization between cardiovascular and respiratory systems was investigated in the article. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signal (RES) were collected from 29 healthy male subjects during the mental arithmetic (MA) task and the synchrogram was used to estimate the strength of cardiorespiratory synchronization. Our results showed that MA task significantly increased the breath rate, the heart rate and the EEG power spectral energy in theta band at FC3, FC4 and C4 electrodes (p < 0.01), decreased the duration of cardiorespiratory synchronization epochs (p < 0.05). Moreover the duration of cardiorespiratory synchronization epochs during MA task was negatively correlated with the EEG power spectral energy in theta band at FC3, FC4 and C4 electrodes and the sympathetic activity (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that ANS and cerebral cortex are implicated in the changes of cardiorespiratory synchronization during MA task. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intracranial recordings of event-related activity, or electrocorticography (ECoG), are based on high density electrode arrays implanted directly over cortex, combining good temporal and spatial resolution. Developing appropriate statistical methods for analyzing event-related responses in these high dimensional ECoG datasets remains a major challenge for clinical and systems neuroscience. We present a novel methodological framework that combines complementary, existing methods adapted for statistical analysis of auditory event-related responses in multichannel ECoG recordings. This analytic framework integrates single-channel (time-domain, time-frequency) and multichannel analyses of event-related ECoG activity to determine statistically significant evoked responses, induced spectral responses, and effective (causal) connectivity. Implementation of this quantitative approach is illustrated using multichannel ECoG data from recent studies of auditory processing in patients with epilepsy. Methods described include a time-frequency matching pursuit algorithm adapted for modeling brief, transient cortical spectral responses to sound, and a recently developed method for estimating effective connectivity using multivariate autoregressive modeling to measure brief event-related changes in multichannel functional interactions. A semi-automated spatial normalization method for comparing intracranial electrode locations across patients is also described. The individual methods presented are published and readily accessible. We discuss the benefits of integrating multiple complementary methods in a unified and comprehensive quantitative approach. Methodological considerations in the analysis of multichannel ECoG data, including corrections for multiple comparisons are discussed, as well as remaining challenges in the development of new statistical approaches.

Antiepileptic drugs modify power of high EEG frequencies and their neural generators	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						anterior temporal cortex; antiepileptic drugs; gamma band; inferior frontal cortex	IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; USE-DEPENDENT MANNER; OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCALIZATION; NEUROBIOLOGY; LAMOTRIGINE	Background: The clinical and molecular effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been extensively investigated. Much less is known about their effects on human electrophysiology. Methods: Topographic analysis in the frequency domain has been used to analyze 104 electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs of 52 patients presenting with first-ever generalized seizure, with normal MRI and EEG. Patients were treated with valproate, carbamazepine, or lamotrigine in monotherapy (each group n = 13). Thirteen patients without medication served as a control group. Results: Carbamazepine and lamotrigine, both sodium-channel modulators, altered brain topography in the gamma range in the same frequency bands (50-60 Hz). Valproate, which has multiple actions on sodium and calcium channels as well as GABA turnover, modified brain topography in the low gamma range (30-40 Hz). No such changes were found in the control group. For all AEDs, the neural generators were shifted more anteriorly in medial temporal through to inferior frontal regions. Conclusion: Decreased gamma-power and anterior shift of neural generators after AED introduction reflect AED influence on human electrophysiology.

Recent work has nevertheless revealed a mechanism by which slow event-related responses are created as a direct consequence of modulations in brain oscillations with nonsinusoidal properties. It remains unknown if this mechanism applies to cognitively relevant event-related responses. Here, we investigated whether sustained event-related fields (ERFs) measured during working memory maintenance can be explained by modulations in oscillatory power. In particular, we focused on contralateral delayed activity (CDA) typically observed in working memory tasks in which hemifield specific attention is manipulated. Using magnetoencephalography, we observed sustained posterior ERFs following the presentation of the memory target. These ERFs were systematically lateralized with respect to the hemisphere in which the target was presented. A strikingly similar pattern emerged for modulations in alpha (9-13 Hz) power. The alpha power and ERF lateralization were strongly correlated over subjects. Based on a mechanistic argument pertaining to the nonsinusoidal properties of the alpha activity, we conclude that the ERFs modulated by working memory are likely to be directly produced by the modulations in oscillatory alpha activity. Given that posterior alpha activity typically reflects disengagement, we conclude that the CDA is not attributable to an additive process reflecting memory maintenance per se but, rather, is a consequence of how attentional resources are allocated.

In many experimental situations, however, neural signals have a broadband character and if oscillatory activity is present, its dynamical origin is unknown. To cope with these problems, a framework for detecting nonlinear oscillatory activity in broadband time series is presented. First, a narrow-band oscillatory mode is extracted from a broadband background. Second, it is tested whether the extracted mode is significantly different from linearly filtered noise, modelled as a linear stochastic process possibly passed through a static nonlinear transformation. If a nonlinear oscillatory mode is positively detected, further analysis using nonlinear approaches such as the phase synchronization analysis can potentially bring new information. For linear processes, however, standard approaches such as the coherence analysis are more appropriate and provide sufficient description of underlying interactions with smaller computational effort. The method is illustrated in a numerical example and applied to analyze experimentally obtained human EEG time series from a sleeping subject.

Functional Disconnection of Frontal Cortex and Visual Cortex in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ADHD; alpha; attentional control; children; disconnection; EEG; theta	TRIAL VARIABILITY; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; GAMMA; TASK; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE; CHILDREN	Background: Current pathophysiologic models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest that impaired functional connectivity within brain attention networks may contribute to the disorder. In this electroencephalographic (EEG) study, we analyzed cross-frequency amplitude correlations to investigate differences in cue-induced functional connectivity in typically developing children and children with ADHD. Methods: Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 25 children aged 8 to 12 years (14 with ADHD) while they performed a cross-modal attention task in which cues signaled the most likely (.75 probability) modality of an upcoming target. The power spectra of the EEG in the theta (3-5 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands were calculated for the 1-sec interval after the cue and before the target while subjects prepared to discriminate the expected target. Results: Both groups showed behavioral benefits of the predictive attentional cues, being faster and more accurate for validly cued targets (e.g., visual target preceded by a cue predicting a visual target) than to invalidly cued targets (e.g., visual target preceded by a cue predicting an auditory target); in addition, independent of cue-target validity, typical children were faster to respond overall. In the typically developing children, the alpha activity was differentially modulated by the two cues and anticorrelated with midfrontal theta activity; these EEG correlates of attentional control were not observed in the children with ADHD. Conclusions: Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for a specific deficit in top-down attentional control in children with ADHD that is manifested as a functional disconnection between frontal and occipital cortex.

More specifically, this study considers children with controlled epilepsy where only a few seizures without complications were noted before starting medication and who showed no clinical or electrophysiological signs of brain dysfunction. We compare EEG recordings from controlled epileptic children with age-matched control children under two different operations, an eyes closed rest condition and a mathematical task. The aim of this study is to develop reliable techniques for the extraction of biomarkers from EEG that indicate the presence of minor neurophysiological signs in cases where no clinical or significant EEG abnormalities are observed. Methods: We compare two different approaches for localizing activity differences and retrieving relevant information for classifying the two groups. The first approach focuses on power spectrum analysis whereas the second approach analyzes the functional coupling of cortical assemblies using linear synchronization techniques. Results: Differences could be detected during the control (rest) task, but not on the more demanding mathematical task. The spectral markers provide better diagnostic ability than their synchronization counterparts, even though a combination (or fusion) of both is needed for efficient classification of subjects. Conclusions: Based on these differences, the study proposes concrete biomarkers that can be used in a decision support system for clinical validation. Fusion of selected biomarkers in the Theta and Alpha bands resulted in an increase of the classification score up to 80% during the rest condition. No significant discrimination was achieved during the performance of a mathematical subtraction task.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are normally used as a supplemental tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy disorders. In this study, mutual information and nonlinear interdependence measures were applied to the EEG recordings in an attempt to identify the effect of treatment on the coupling strength and directionality of mutual information and nonlinear interdependences between different brain cortical regions. Two 1-h EEG recordings were acquired from four ULD subjects; one prior and one after a minimum of 2 months treatment with an add-on AED. Subjects in this study were siblings of same parents and suffered from ULD for approximately 37 years. Our results indicated that the coupling strength was low between different brain cortical regions in the patients with disease of less severity. Adjunctive AED treatment was associated with significant decrease of the coupling strength in all subjects. The mutual information between different brain cortical regions was also reduced after treatment. These findings could provide a new insight for developing a novel surrogate outcome measure for patients with epilepsy when clinical tools or observations could potentially fail to detect a significant difference.

Using EEG to Explore How rTMS Produces Its Effects on Behavior	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						TMS; EEG; Virtual lesion	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL RESPONSES; BRAIN RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; PARIETAL; OSCILLATIONS; FACILITATION; PERFORMANCE; INTENSITY	A commonly held view is that, when delivered during the performance of a task, repetitive TMS (rTMS) influences behavior by producing transient "virtual lesions" in targeted tissue. However, findings of rTMS-related improvements in performance are difficult to reconcile with this assumption. With regard to the mechanism whereby rTMS influences concurrent task performance, a combined rTMS/EEG study conducted in our lab has revealed a complex set of relations between rTMS, EEG activity, and behavioral performance, with the effects of rTMS on power in the alpha band and on alpha:gamma phase synchrony each predicting its effect on behavior. These findings suggest that rTMS influences performance by biasing endogenous task-related oscillatory dynamics, rather than creating a "virtual lesion". To further differentiate these two alternatives, in the present study we compared the effects of 10 Hz rTMS on neural activity with the results of an experiment in which rTMS was replaced with 10 Hz luminance flicker. We reasoned that 10 Hz flicker would produce widespread entrainment of neural activity to the flicker frequency, and comparison of these EEG results with those from the rTMS study would shed light on whether the latter also reflected entrainment to an exogenous stimulus. Results revealed pronounced evidence for "entrainment noise" produced by 10 Hz flicker-increased oscillatory power and inter-trial coherence (ITC) at the driving frequency, and increased alpha:gamma phase synchronization-that were nonetheless largely uncorrelated with behavior. This contrasts markedly with 10-Hz rTMS, for which the only evidence for stimulation-induced noise, elevated ITC at 30 Hz, differed qualitatively from the flicker results. Simultaneous recording of the EEG thus offers an important means of directly testing assumptions about how rTMS exerts its effects on behavior.

EEG theta and alpha responses reveal qualitative differences in processing taxonomic versus thematic semantic relationships	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Taxonomic relationships; Thematic relationships; Semantic relationships; N400; Event-related potentials; Event-related spectral perturbation; Theta; Alpha; Memory; Inhibition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPHERICAL SPLINES; POWER; COMPLEMENTARY; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; MEMORY	Despite the importance of semantic relationships to our understanding of semantic knowledge, the nature of the neural processes underlying these abilities are not well understood. In order to investigate these processes, 20 healthy adults listened to thematically related (e.g., leash-dog), taxonomically related (e.g., horse-dog), or unrelated (e.g., desk-dog) noun pairs as their EEG was recorded. The data were analyzed using both event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The spatiotemporal ERP and ERSP results were analyzed further with principal component analysis (PCA). When comparing unrelated to related word pairs, the expected N400 effect was confirmed, as well as differences in theta and alpha oscillations. When comparing thematically and taxonomically related word pairs, the ERP revealed no significant differences, but the ERSP did. Specifically, theta power increased over right frontal areas for thematic versus taxonomic relationships and alpha power increased over parietal areas for taxonomic versus thematic relationships. The different oscillatory patterns over different brain regions suggest that thematic and taxonomic relationships engage distinct neural processes. Specifically, thematic relationships engage memory processes, while taxonomic relationships may require additional inhibitory or attention processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This finding is termed retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) and is assumed to be the consequence of an inhibitory mechanism resolving retrieval competition. In the present study, we examined brain oscillatory processes related to RIF, as induced by competitive memory retrieval. Contrasting a competitive with a noncompetitive retrieval condition, we found a stronger increase in early evoked theta (4-7 Hz) activity, which specifically predicted RIF, but not retrieval-induced enhancement. Within the cognitive framework of RIF, these findings suggest that theta oscillations reflect arising interference and its resolution during competitive retrieval in episodic memory.

Theta EEG source localization using LORETA in partial epilepsy patients with and without medication	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; LORETA; Theta activity	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL; OSCILLATIONS; LAMOTRIGINE; RHYTHMS	Objective: To investigate and localize the sources of spontaneous, scalp-recorded theta activity in patients with partial epilepsy (PE). Methods: Nine patients with beginning, untreated PE (Group 1), 31 patients with already treated PE (Group 2), and 14 healthy persons were investigated by means of spectral analysis and LORETA, low resolution electromagnetic tomography (1 Hz very narrow band analysis, age-adjusted, Z-scored values). The frequency of main interest was 4-8 Hz. Results: Group analysis: Group 1 displayed bilateral theta maxima in the temporal theta area (TTA), parietal theta area (PTA), and frontal theta area (FTA). In Group 2, theta activity increased all over the scalp as compared to the normative mean (Z = 0) and also to Group 1. Maximum activity was found in the TTA, PTA, and FTA. However, in the PTA and FTA the centers of the abnormality shifted towards the medial cortex. Individual analysis: all the patients showed preferential activation (maximum Z-values) within one of the three theta areas. Conclusions: EEG activity in the theta band is increased in anatomically meaningful patterns in PE patients, which differs from the anatomical distribution of theta in healthy persons. Significance: The findings contribute to our understanding of the sources of theta rhythms and the pathophysiology of PE. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Altered spontaneous low frequency brain activity in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Low frequency oscillation; Direct current EEG; Rest-task attenuation; Default mode; Spontaneous neuronal activity; Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity; Disorder	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; INTRA-SUBJECT VARIABILITY; STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS; DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSE VARIABILITY; RESTING BRAIN; ADHD; CHILDREN; NETWORK	Background: Resting brain activity appears altered in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The default mode interference hypothesis (Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007) postulates that patterns of spontaneous very low frequency brain activity, typical of the resting brain, cause attention lapses in ADHD when they remain unattenuated following the transition from rest to active task performance. Here we test this hypothesis using DC-EEG. Methods: DC-EEG recordings of very low frequency brain activity (<1.5 Hz) were compared for 16 male children with ADHD and 16 healthy controls during both rest and active task performance (two choice reaction time task). Results: A previously identified very low frequency resting network of electrodes was replicated. At rest ADHD children showed less EEG power in very low frequency bands (i.e.,.02-.2 Hz). They also showed less attenuation of power at these frequency bands during rest-to-task transition. Reduced attenuation was associated with a number of measures of performance. Discussion: We confirmed the existence of altered very low frequency brain activity in ADHD. ADHD children may have deficits both in maintaining a resting brain when needed and 'protecting' an active brain from the intrusion of resting state brain activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

MELATONIN, SLEEP AND INSOMNIA	Endocrinology Research and Clinical Developments		English	Article; Book Chapter							SLEEP-ONSET INSOMNIA; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; PRACTICE PARAMETERS; SELF-REGULATION; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSOMNIA; PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES; NEUROFEEDBACK TREATMENT; PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION; BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT	There is already profound knowledge about the evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for the treatment of insomnia (Benca, 2005; Morin et al., 1999; Morin, 2004; Morin et al., 2006). However, the characterization of non-pharmacological treatment effects like CBT on specific sleep parameters (e.g., sleep spindles, sleep architecture, electroencephalographic (EEG) power densities during sleep after CBT) are scarce (Cervena et al., 2004). In our approach we investigated if instrumental conditioning of 12-15Hz EEG oscillations would enhance sleep quality as well as declarative memory performance in healthy subjects. Additionally preliminary data indicating instrumental conditioning of 12-15Hz EEG oscillations as a promising treatment of insomnia will be presented. EEG recordings over the sensorimotor cortex show a very distinctive oscillatory pattern in a frequency range between 12-15Hz termed sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). SMR appears to be dominant during quiet but alert wakefulness, desynchronizes by the execution of movements and synchronizes by the inhibition of motor behavior. This frequency range is also known to be high during light non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and represents the sleep spindle peak frequency. In the early 70ies Sterman, Howe, and MacDonald (1970) could demonstrate in cats that instrumental conditioning of SMR during wakefulness can influence subsequent sleep. Hauri (1981) was then the first to apply effectively a combination of biofeedback and neurofeedback to humans suffering from psychophysiologic insomnia. Results revealed that the patients benefited from the instrumental conditioning protocols. As research surprisingly stopped at that point, we intended to clarify the effects of instrumental SMR conditioning (ISC) on sleep quality as well as on declarative memory performance with today's technologies and by using a well controlled design which included a control group receiving the same amount of attention and training. Our results confirmed that within 10 sessions of ISC it is possible to increase 12-15Hz activity significantly. Interestingly, the increased SMR activity (i) was also expressed during subsequent sleep by eliciting positive changes in various sleep parameters like sleep spindle number or sleep onset latency and (ii) was associated with the enhancement of declarative learning. In addition to these fascinating results, preliminary data from our laboratory point to the possibility that people suffering from primary insomnia could likewise benefit from this conditioning protocol as indicated by improved measures of subjective and objective sleep quality.

Frontal theta and alpha power and coherence changes are modulated by semantic complexity in Go/NoGo tasks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Response inhibition; EEG; Categorization	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SPHERICAL SPLINES; VISUAL-STIMULI; EEG COHERENCE; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; GO; DYNAMICS	To study the interactions between semantic processing and motor response inhibition, we recorded scalp EEG as subjects performed a series of Go/NoGo response inhibition tasks whose response criteria depended on different levels of semantic processing. Three different tasks were used. The first required the subject to make a Go/NoGo decision based on pictures of one particular car or one particular dog. The second used pictures of different types of cars and of dogs, and the final task used stimuli that ranged across multiple types of objects and animals. We found that the theta-band EEG power recorded during the NoGo response was attenuated as a function of semantic complexity while the peak latency was delayed in only the most complex category task. Further, frontal alpha-band desynchronization was strongest for the simplest task and remained close to baseline for the other tasks. Finally, there was significant theta-band coherence between the frontal pole and pre-SMA for the NoGo conditions across tasks, which was not found in the Go trials. These findings provide information about how more rostral frontal regions interact with the pre-SMA during response inhibition across different stimuli and task demands: specifically, level of processing affects latency, difficulty affects amplitude, and coherence is affected by whether the decision is Go or NoGo.

Reduced functional connectivity in visual evoked potentials in children with autism spectrum disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Autism; Coherence; EEG; Power; Synchrony; Connectivity	OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; INDIVIDUALS; STIMULUS; CORTEX; UNDERCONNECTIVITY	Objective: An analysis of EEG synchrony between homologous early visual areas tested the hypothesis that interhemispheric functional connectivity during visual stimulation is reduced in children with autism compared to controls. Methods: EEG power and coherence within and between two homologous regions of the occipital cortex were measured during long latency flash visual evoked potentials. Measures were compared between two groups of children (5.5-8.5 years), one with autism spectrum disorders and the other with typical development. Results: In and below the theta band, interhemispheric synchrony was reduced in autistic subjects compared to typical controls by as much as 50%. Above the theta band interhemispheric synchrony in autistic children became indistinguishable from what would occur for uncorrelated cortical activity. Interhemispheric synchrony in autistic subjects was decreased in spite of bilaterally increased power. Wavelet power showed autistic children had a more rapid initial response to stimulation, a slower recovery, and more modulation at longer latencies. Conclusions: Results suggest that the sensory cortices of autistic children are hypersensitive to stimulation with concurrent diminished functional connectivity between hemispheres. Significance: Simultaneously increased intrahemispheric power and decreased interhemispheric synchronization of elemental visual information suggests either that power increases cause poor interhemispheric connectivity or that processes, such as thalamocortical regulation, impact power and coherence independently.

EEG Spatial Synchronization at Different Set Stages in 8-year-old Children with Different Levels of Selective Attention Fronto-Thalamic System Maturity	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						cognitive set; fronto-thalamic system; EEG-coherence function; EEG; selective attention; set-shifting	OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	Visual cognitive set was studied in two groups of 8-year-old children: with normal development of fronto-thalamic system (FTS) (n = 21) and with functional immaturity of this system (n = 29). In most of the children with the FTS-immaturity a formed visual set was rigid. EEG was recorded from the frontal, central, temporal, parietal and occipital regions, and coherence function in theta-, alpha- and betabands was analyzed. The most vivid differences between two groups of children were revealed at the set actualization stage. If the set was a plastic one, the value of coherence function between frontal and dorsal areas was higher in children with FTS-immaturity, than in "normal" ones. In the group with FTS-immaturity the dependence of coherence function on the set's plasticity was more vivid, than in children without FTS-immaturity. In all children with a rigid set value of coherence function was higher during set formation, actualization and extinction, than at resting condition with eyes opened. In the group with FTS-immaturity the coherence of theta-band considerably increased at the set actualization stage, mainly in the right hemisphere. We consider this to be the evidence of a comparatively bigger role of cortico-hippocampal system and implicit episodic memory the set shifting. Probably these processes compensate the FTS-dysfunction and make a set more plastic.	[Kostandov, E. A.; Cheremushkin, E. A.; Ashkinazi, M.

Patterns of Spontaneous Magnetoencephalographic Activity in Patients With Schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Schizophrenia; Resting state networks; Oscillations; Positive symptoms; Antipsychotic agents	SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS	Magnetoencephalography noninvasively measures the magnetic fields produced by the brain. Pertinent research articles from 1993 to 2009 that measured spontaneous, whole-head magnetoencephalography activity in patients with schizophrenia were reviewed. Data on localization of oscillatory activity and correlation of these findings with psychotic symptoms are summarized. Although the variety of measures used by different research groups makes a quantitative meta-analysis difficult, it appears that magnetoencephalography activity in patients may exhibit identifiable patterns, defined by topographic organization and frequency band. Specifically, 11 of the 12 studies showed increased theta (4-8 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) band oscillations in the temporal lobes of patients; of the 10 studies that examined the relationship between oscillatory activity and symptomatology, 8 found a positive correlation between temporal lobe theta activity and positive schizophrenic symptoms. Abnormally high frontal delta activity was not seen. These findings are analyzed in comparison with the electroencephalogram literature on schizophrenics, and possible confounds (e.g., medication effects) are discussed. In the future, magnetoencephalography might be used to assist in diagnosis or might be fruitfully used in conjunction with new neuroscience research approaches such as computational modeling, which may be able to link oscillatory activity and cellular-level pathology.

Induced cortical gamma-band oscillations reflect cognitive control elicited by implicit probability cues in the preparing-to-overcome-prepotency (POP) task	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; TRANSIENT; RESPONSES; TOOLBOX	Previous research suggests that synchronous cortical gamma-band oscillations reflect the implementation of cognitive control in anticipation of the need to overcome prepotent responses. These studies often require participants to link task instructions with task cues signaling the need (or lack thereof) for cognitive control. Thus, the oscillatory response elicited by these cues may also reflect the implementation of explicit task instructions. The aim of this research was to determine whether gamma-band oscillations would also be increased in preparation for cognitive control when the need for that control was only made implicitly available to the participant. Using a task-ambiguous cue to indicate the position of a subsequent probe stimulus, we manipulated the need for cognitive control by varying the probability of high-and low-control probes appearing in each of two positions. Results show that participants developed the anticipated expectancies regarding probe identity in the two positions and that the anticipation of a high-control probe was associated with an increase in the power of induced cortical gamma band over frontal scalp recording sites.

Wilken and Ma (2004) proposed that this distortion of recall was actually adaptive, with the task-irrelevant information compensating for imperfections of memory. We tested their proposal by using trial-by-trial oscillations in the electroencephalogram's alpha band (8-14 Hz) collected from human subjects as a marker for the strength of visual attention. Subjects' recall of stimulus spatial frequency showed a systematic error, namely a shift toward the prototypical value of previously seen stimuli. The magnitude of this prototype effect was strongly related to the amplitude of alpha band oscillations recorded at posterior sensor locations during the first 100 ms after stimulus onset. Our results support the hypothesis that the prototype effect is compensatory for imprecision in memory. Moreover, the attentional modulation of alpha activity during the encoding of the target stimulus is consistent with the view that attention sharpens the neural responses that are elicited by the task-relevant stimulus.

In order to understand the mechanisms of the central network its sources need to be found. The cortical sources of both the basic and first "harmonic" frequency of essential tremor are addressed in this paper. The power and coherence were estimated using the multitaper method for EEG and EMG data from 6 essential tremor patients. The Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) was used to find the coherent sources in the brain. Before hand this method was validated for the application of finding multiple sources for the same oscillation in the brain by using two model simulations which indicated the accuracy of the method. In all the essential tremor patients the corticomuscular coherence was also present in the basic and the first harmonic frequency of the tremor. The source for the basic frequency and the first harmonic frequency was in the region of primary sensory motor cortex, prefrontal and in the diencephalon on the contralateral side for all the patients. Thus the generation of these two oscillations involves the same cortical areas and indicates the oscillation at double the tremor frequency is a harmonic of the basic tremor frequency.

Two-step theories of memory formation suggest that initial encoding of novel information depends on the induction of rapid plasticity within the hippocampus, and is followed by a second sleep-dependent step of memory consolidation. These theories predict information flow from the neocortex into the hippocampus during waking state and in the reverse direction during sleep. However, experimental evidence that interactions between hippocampus and neocortex have a predominant direction which reverses during sleep rely on cross-correlation analysis of data from animal experiments and yielded inconsistent results. Here, we investigated directional coupling in intracranial EEG data from human subjects using a phase-modeling approach which is well suited to reveal functional interdependencies in oscillatory data. In general, we observed that the anterior hippocampus predominantly drives nearby and remote brain regions. Surprisingly, however, the influence of neocortical regions on the hippocampus significantly increased during sleep as compared to waking state. These results question the standard model of hippocampal-neocortical interactions and suggest that sleep-dependent consolidation is accomplished by an active retrieval of hippocampal information by the neocortex.

Participants engaged in visual inspection of works of art and recalled them immediately afterwards through mental imagery. Meanwhile, we recorded their EEG, and calculated the power of their alpha band and theta band activity afterwards. In accordance with previous studies, theta band and alpha band power differed between artists and non-artists; these differences were found to depend, however, on the abstract or representational character of the paintings. Differences between abstract and representational art, and between inspection and imagery, occurred in alpha band power for non-artists only and in theta band power for artists. These results were taken to suggest that effects in artists reflect sustained focused attention and perceptual flexibility; in non-artists motivation and engagement with the task. The results were essentially whole-head, despite the local character of the measurement.

To examine the neural manifestation of the interplay between semantic and episodic memory, we investigated neuroelectric dynamics during the creation (study) and the retrieval (test) of episodic memories for famous and non-famous faces. Episodic memory effects were evident in several EEG frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (9-13 Hz), and gamma (40-100 Hz). Activity in these bands was differentially modulated by preexisting semantic knowledge and by episodic memory, implicating their different functional roles in memory. More specifically, theta activity and alpha suppression were larger for old compared to new faces at test regardless of fame, but were both larger for famous faces during study. This pattern of selective semantic effects suggests that the theta and alpha responses, which are primarily associated with episodic memory, reflect utilization of semantic information only when it is beneficial for task performance. In contrast, gamma activity decreased between the first (study) and second (test) presentation of a face, but overall was larger for famous than nonfamous faces. Hence, the gamma rhythm seems to be primarily related to activation of preexisting neural representations that may contribute to the formation of new episodic traces. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the complex interaction between semantic and episodic memory for faces and the neural dynamics associated with mnemonic processes.

Evidence for excessive frontal evoked gamma oscillatory activity in schizophrenia during working memory	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Working memory; Gamma oscillations; EEG; Cognition; DLPFC	POTENTIALLY DELETERIOUS IMPACT; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; SYMPTOMS; EEG; NEURONS; OLANZAPINE; CLOZAPINE; DEFICITS	Gamma (gamma) oscillations (30-50 Hz) elicited during working memory (WM) are altered in schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the nature of the relationship between evoked frontal oscillatory activity, WM performance and symptom severity has yet to be ascertained. This study had two objectives. First, to extend previous studies by examining delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) oscillatory activities during the N-back task in SCZ patients compared to healthy subjects; second, to evaluate the relationship between oscillatory activities elicited during the N-back, performance, and clinical symptoms in SCZ patients. Patients with SCZ elicited excessive frontal gamma oscillatory activity that was most pronounced in the 3-back condition compared to healthy subjects. Reduced frontal beta activity at all WM loads was also observed in patients with SCZ compared to healthy subjects. Task performance was inversely correlated with negative symptoms but not with positive symptoms. Our findings suggest that evoked frontal oscillatory activities during WM are selectively altered in the gamma and beta frequency bands that may contribute to WM impairment in SCZ patients. These findings may provide important insights into the pathophysiology underlying WM deficits, its relationship to negative symptoms and may represent a potential neurobiological marker for cognitive enhancing strategies in SCZ.

Here, we report changes in high-density EEG activity during a virtual tunnel passage task in which subjects respond to a postnavigation homing challenge in distinctly different ways-either compatible with a continued experience of the virtual environment from a solely egocentric perspective or as if also maintaining their original entrance orientation, indicating use of a parallel allocentric reference frame. By spatially filtering the EEG data using independent component analysis, we found that these two equal subject subgroups exhibited differences in EEG power spectral modulation during tunnel passages in only a few cortical areas. During tunnel turns, stronger alpha blocking occurred only in or near right primary visual cortex of subjects whose homing responses were compatible with continued use of an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, approaching and during tunnel turns, subjects who responded in a way compatible with use of an allocentric reference frame exhibited stronger alpha blocking of occipitotemporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and retrosplenial cortical areas, all areas implicated by hemodynamic imaging and neuropsychological observation in construction and maintenance of an allocentric reference frame. We conclude that in these subjects, stronger activation of retrosplenial and related cortical areas during turns support a continuous translation of egocentrically experienced visual flow into an allocentric model of their virtual position and movement.

In particular, we aimed to investigate whether the sensory-motor ERD would show a specific modulation during the observation of hand behaviors differing for goal-relatedness (hand grasping of an object and meaningless hand movements) and social relevance (communicative hand gestures and grasping within a social context). Time course analysis of alpha suppression showed that all types of hand behaviors were effective in triggering sensory-motor alpha ERD, but to a different degree depending on the category of observed hand motor acts and gestures. Meaningless gestures and hand grasping were the most effective stimuli, resulting in the strongest ERD. The observation of social hand behaviors such as social grasping and communicative gestures, triggered a more dynamic time course of ERD compared to that driven by the observation of simple grasping and meaningless gestures. These findings indicate that the observation of hand motor acts and gestures evoke the activation of a motor resonance mechanism that differs on the basis of the goal-relatedness and the social relevance of the observed hand behavior.

In the present study, alphanumeric characters rotated in the frontal plane were employed to assess the relationship between rotation ability and EEG oscillatory activity. Response latency, a single valid index of performance in this task, was significantly associated with the amplitude of induced oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and the low beta band (14-20 Hz). In accordance with the neural efficiency hypothesis, less event-related desynchronization (ERD) was related to better (i.e. faster) task performance. The association between response time and ERD was observed earlier (similar to 600-400 ms before the response) over the parietal cortex and later (similar to 400-200 ms before the response) over the frontal cortex. Linear mixed-effect regression analysis confirmed that both early parietal and late frontal alpha/beta power provided significant contribution to prediction of response latency. The result indicates that two distinct serially engaged neurocognitive processes comparably contribute to mental rotation ability. In addition, we found that mental rotation-related negativity, a slow event-related potential recorded over the posterior cortex, was unrelated to the asymmetry of alpha amplitude modulation.

Slow Neuronal Oscillations in the Resting Brain vs Task Execution: A BSS Investigation of EEG Recordings	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORKS; P3A	Spontaneous very low frequency oscillations (<0.5 Hz) occurring within widely distributed neuroanatomical systems have been increasingly analyzed in brain imaging studies. Whilst being more prominent in the resting brain, these slow waves also persist into task sessions and may potentially interfere with active goal-directed attention, leading to periodic lapses in attention during task execution. This work presents a new experimental framework and a multistage signal processing methodology - comprising blind source separation (BSS) coupled with a neural network feature extraction and classification method - developed for assessing variations in the slow wave characteristics in EEG data recorded during periods of quiet wakefulness (termed as "rest"), and during visual tasks of various difficulty levels. Core results demonstrate that the amplitude and phase of the brain sources in the slow wave band share essential similarities during rest and task conditions, but are distinct enough to be classified separately. These slow wave variations are also significantly correlated with the level of cognitive attention assessed by task performance measures (such as reaction times and error rates). Moreover, the power of the brain sources in the slow wave band is attenuated during task, and the level of attenuation drops as the task difficulty level is increased, whilst the slow wave phase undergoes a change in structure ( measured through entropy). The methodology and findings presented here provide a new basis for assessing neural activity during various mental conditions.

The concept of idiopathic generalised seizures has recently been challenged, especially with respect to the absence seizures. Recent studies underline the role of cortically distributed networks in propagating absence spike-wave discharges. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of occurrence of the first spike-wave remain unknown. Our study deals with the characterisation of early cortical activities taking part to the initiation of absences. Therefore, we explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of interactions within and between local cortical neural networks, modelled by widely distributed sources using magnetoencephalographic recordings of spontaneous absence seizures. We then extracted, from their time-frequency analysis, local synchronization of cortical sources and long-range synchronization linking distant sites. Our analyses revealed a reproducible sequence: long-range desynchronisation-increased local synchronisation-increased long-range synchronisation. Although both local and long-range synchronization displayed different spatio-temporal profiles, their cortical projections within an initiation time window overlap and reveal a multifocal fronto-central network. These observations contradict the classical view of sudden generalized synchronous activities in absence epilepsy.

A dynamic causal model study of neuronal population dynamics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural-mass models; Nonlinear; Modelling; Laplace assumption; Mean-field; Neuronal; Bayesian	SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAN NERVE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; DEVIANCE; NETS	In this paper, we compare mean-field and neural-mass models of electrophysiological responses using Bayesian model comparison. In previous work, we presented a mean-field model of neuronal dynamics as observed with magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Unlike neural-mass models, which consider only the mean activity of neuronal populations, mean-field models track the distribution (e.g., mean and dispersion) of population activity. This can be important if the mean affects the dispersion or vice versa. Here, we introduce a dynamical causal model based on mean-field (i.e., population density) models of neuronal activity, and use it to assess the evidence for a coupling between the mean and dispersion of hidden neuronal states using observed electromagnetic responses. We used Bayesian model comparison to compare homologous mean-field and neural-mass models, asking whether empirical responses support a role for population variance in shaping neuronal dynamics. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) as representative neuronal responses in physiological and non-physiological paradigms respectively. Our main conclusion was that although neural-mass models may be sufficient for cognitive paradigms, there is clear evidence for an effect of dispersion at the high levels of depolarization evoked in SEP paradigms. This suggests that (i) the dispersion of neuronal states within populations generating evoked brain signals can be manifest in observed brain signals and that (ii) the evidence for their effects can be accessed with dynamic causal model comparison.

EEG Measures Index Neural and Cognitive Recovery from Sleep Deprivation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RESPONSE-INHIBITION TASK; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; FMRI; OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; HOMEOSTASIS; ACTIVATION; PATTERNS	Sleep deprivation impairs many cognitive abilities, but these impairments can be reversed after a certain quantity and quality of sleep. The ability to inhibit responding is particularly susceptible to disruption after prolonged wakefulness. How recovery sleep (RS) alters brain activity, leading to improved performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, remains unclear. This issue was examined in the current study using spectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) data during sleep. These measures of sleep physiology were acquired after both normal sleep (NS) and RS, and were related to measures of inhibitory control and concurrent brain activity. Subjects were nine young adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging twice, after 9 h of NS and after 10 h of RS that followed 38 h of being awake. A multiple regression model was used to examine differences between conditions in (1) EEG spectral power during sleep, (2) probability of successful inhibition in a go/no-go task, and (3) activation within a region of right prefrontal cortex during the task. Performance recovery, as indexed by reduced performance differences between conditions, was predicted by increased delta power and decreased sigma power in RS compared with NS. These EEG variables predicted most of the variance in inhibitory performance difference between conditions. Regressions also suggested that RS improved performance because of changes in brain function including prefrontal regions that resulted from delta rebound. We thus propose that slow waves, reflected in delta power during RS, act to restore brain function, thereby improving cognitive performance that entails response inhibition.

Robust EMG-fMRI artifact reduction for motion (FARM)	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Co-registered EMG-fMRI; Artifact reduction; Movement artifact	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ANKLE DORSIFLEXION; IMAGING-ARTIFACT; EEG; REMOVAL; RECORDINGS; SIGNALS; MOTOR	Objective: Current template-based artifact reduction methods are inadequate to reduce irregular volume- and slice-artifacts induced by limb motion in combined (surface) EMG-fMRI (electromyography-functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies. In addition, artifacts are not removed adequately for EMG frequencies above 50 Hz. We present a new fMRI artifact reduction algorithm for motion (FARM) and compare it with standard artifact correction as implemented in fMRI artifact slice-template removal (FASTR). Methods: One control subject generated motion artifacts during EMG-fMRI. Low-frequency motion artifacts and volume-artifacts were removed prior to slice-artifact correction. Slice-artifacts were phase-shifted and removed with motion adaptive templates (FARM). EMG data were also corrected applying FASTR. Results: Time traces demonstrate that artifacts related to sudden changes in wire position are contained to shorter time periods. EMG power spectra from neck and arm muscles show that FARM has improved performance at higher frequencies. Conclusions: High-pass filtering, volume-artifact removal, phase-shifting and adaptation of slice-templates to motion improve the quality of artifact-corrected EMG recorded during limb motion. Significance: The improved accuracy at which EMG-fMRI data can be obtained opens up new ways to directly relate self-paced movements to brain activations and to study patients suffering from movement disorders.

In particular, we take into consideration the heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory signals for automatic sleep staging, arousals detection, and apnea recognition. This is particularly useful for wearable or textile devices that could be employed for home monitoring of sleep. The HRV and the respiration were analyzed in the frequency domain, and the statistics on the spectral and cross-spectral parameters put into evidence the possibility of a sleep evaluation on their basis. Comparison with traditional polysomnography (PSG) revealed a classification accuracy of 89.9% in rapid eye movement (REM) non-REM sleep separation and an accuracy of 88% for sleep apnea detection. Additional information can be achieved from the number of microarousals recognized in correspondence of typical modifications in the HRV signal. The obtained results support the idea of automatic sleep evaluation and monitoring through signals that are not traditionally used in clinical PSG, but can be easily recorded at home through wearable devices (for example, a sensorized T-shirt) or systems integrated into the environment (a sensorized bed). This is a first step for the development of systems for sleep screening on large populations that can constitute a complement for the traditional clinical evaluation.

Gamma coherence in response to visual oddball paradigm in ten medication-free, manic patients was studied before and after six weeks of valproate monotherapy in comparison to ten controls. Inter-hemispheric F-3-F-4, C-3-C-4, T-3-T-4, T-5-T-6, P-3-P-4, O-1-O-2 and intra-hemispheric F-3-P-3, F-4-P-4, F-3-T-5, F-4-T-6, F-3-O-1, F-4-O-2, C-3-O-1, C-2-O-4 electrode pairs were included in the analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference between groups with regard to pre-treatment coherence values (p: 0.018). The coherence to the target stimuli at the right fronto-temporal location was significantly reduced by 35.41% in the patients compared to controls (p: 0.003). Patients showed significantly lower pretreatment coherence values in response to non-target stimuli compared to controls at the right frontotemporal (28.51%, p: 0.004), right fronto-occipital (23.71%, p: 0.024), and right centro-occipital (25.69%, p: 0.029) locations. After six weeks of valproate monotherapy, manic symptoms improved significantly. Post-treatment change in target and non-target coherence values was statistically non-significant. EEG coherence is a measure of functional connectivity in the brain. Event-related gamma oscillations are essential for brain electrical activity. The results show that acute mania presents right sided long distance connectivity disturbance, thus pointing to the potential importance of measuring oscillatory responses in the search for consistent neurobiological markers in such a complicated condition as bipolar disorder.

JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						Locomotion; frequency; attractor; exercise; accelerometer	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; INITIAL VALIDATION; VELOCITY; WALKING; LOCOMOTION; MOVEMENTS; VALIDITY; TEMPO; HEAD	The frequency for movements along the longitudinal axis during running peaks at approximately 3Hz. Other physiological systems (e.g. heart rate and brain cortical activity) are known to show a dominant frequency of 3Hz connected to exercise. As recent studies have proposed a clear correlation between musical tempo, mood, and performance output, we wished to ascertain whether peak locomotion frequency of 3Hz during running is synchronized with different intrinsic and extrinsic frequencies. Eighteen healthy regular runners performed three outdoor running sessions at different intensities. Oscillations along the longitudinal axis were recorded using an accelerometer (ActiBelt (R)). Electrocortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography before and after exercise and analysed in the delta frequency range (2-4Hz). In addition, the frequency spectra of the participants' favourite musical pieces were analysed. Data revealed a peak frequency at around 2.7 to 2.8Hz for the vertical acceleration during running. Similar oscillation patterns were found for heart rate and musical pieces. Electroencephalographic delta activity increased after running. Results of this study give reason to speculate that a strong relationship exists between intrinsic and extrinsic oscillation patterns during exercise. A frequency of approximately 3Hz seems to be dominant in different physiological systems and seems to be rated as pleasurable when choosing the appropriate music for exercising. This is in line with previous research showing that an adequate choice of music during exercise enhances performance output and mood.

Cortical oscillations are of central importance in the characterization of neuronal network function in health and disease and are influential in effective drug development. Whilst animal in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology is able to characterize pharmacologically induced modulations in neuronal activity, present human counterparts have spatial and temporal limitations. Consequently, the potential applications for a human equivalent are extensive. Here, we demonstrate a novel implementation of contemporary neuroimaging methods called pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. This approach determines the spatial profile of neuronal network oscillatory power change across the cortex following drug administration and reconstructs the time course of these modulations at focal regions of interest. As a proof of concept, we characterize the nonspecific GABAergic modulator diazepam, which has a broad range of therapeutic applications. We demonstrate that diazepam variously modulates theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-14 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency oscillations in specific regions of the cortex, with a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with that of drug uptake. We examine the relevance of these results with regard to the spatial and temporal observations from other modalities and the various therapeutic consequences of diazepam and discuss the potential applications of such an approach in terms of drug development and translational neuroscience.

Investigation into the efficacy of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, and novel procognitive agents to induce gamma oscillations in rat hippocampal slices	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Aricept; Cognition; Alzheimer's Disease; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; Serotonin; Hippocampus	DECREASED EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RECEPTOR AGONISTS; 5-HT4 RECEPTORS; M1 RECEPTOR; MEMORY; ACTIVATION; INVOLVEMENT; ANTAGONISTS; MODULATION	One of the major neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the loss of cholinergic neurones of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). This consistent finding gave rise to the 'cholinergic' hypothesis of AD and lead to the subsequent development of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors; the first class of drug to be approved for the treatment of AD. However, several studies have questioned the efficacy of using AChE inhibitors in AD. In this study we have investigated the ability of two AChE inhibitors, donepezil (Aricept) and physostigmine, to induce gamma oscillatory activity in rat hippocampal slices; network activity believed to play a role in higher cognitive function. We report here that donepezil is capable of inducing gamma oscillations in region CA3 of rat hippocampal slices, which may contribute to its procognitive action. However, donepezil-induced gamma oscillations are weak in comparison to physostigmine. We also explore the activity of novel agents with known procognitive activity, and show that one such agent, the M-1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, 77-LH-28-1, can significantly enhance donepezil-induced gamma oscillations. These data support the notion that it should be possible to find a more efficacious AChE inhibitor or an adjunctive approach, to provide a better therapeutic intervention in AD.

The experiments were performed on 10 healthy individuals using a fourteen-channel montage. An explanation is offered on the causes of the detected FD changes. FD values of 60 s records belonging to wake (Hori's stage 1) and drowsy (Hori's stages 2-4) states were calculated for each channel and each subject. In 136 out of 140 epochs an increase in FD was obtained. Relationship between signal FD and its relative alpha amplitude was mathematically modeled and we quantitatively demonstrated that the increase in FD was predominantly due to a reduction in alpha activity. The model was generalized to include other EEG oscillations. By averaging FD values for each channel across 10 subjects, four clusters (O2O1; T6P4T5P3; C3F3F4C4F8F7; T4T3) for the wake and two clusters (O2O1P3T6P4T5; C3C4F4F3F8T4T3F7) for the drowsy state were statistically verified. Topographic distribution of FD values in wakefulness showed a lateral symmetry and a partial fronto-occipital gradient. In drowsiness, a reduction in the number of clusters was detected, due to regrouping of channels T3, T4, O1 and O2. Topographic distribution of absolute FD differences revealed largest values at F7, O1 and F3. Reorganization of channel clusters showed that regionalized brain activity, specific for wakefulness, became more global by entering into drowsiness. Since the global increase in FD during wake-to-drowsy transition correlated with the decrease of alpha power, we inferred that increase of EEG complexity may not necessarily be an index of brain activation.

The cellular mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Here we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying the initiation of sharp waves using a hippocampal slice model. To this end, we used a combination of field recordings with planar multielectrode arrays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of individual anatomically identified pyramidal neurons and interneurons. We found that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is necessary for sharp wave generation. Moreover, the activity of individual perisomatic-targeting interneurons can both suppress, and subsequently enhance, the local generation of sharp waves. Finally, we show that this is achieved by the tight control of local excitation and inhibition by perisomatic-targeting interneurons. These results suggest that perisomatic-targeting interneurons assist in selecting the subset of pyramidal neurons that initiate each hippocampal sharp wave-ripple.

Long-range synchronization and local desynchronization of alpha oscillations during visual short-term memory retention in children	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Child development; Functional integration; Connectivity; MEG; Neural synchrony; Oscillatory network dynamics; Alpha	WORKING-MEMORY; OBJECT RECOGNITION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; RESPONSE SYSTEM; EEG; TASK; LOAD; ATTENTION; CORTEX	Local alpha-band synchronization has been associated with both cortical idling and active inhibition. Recent evidence, however, suggests that long-range alpha synchronization increases functional coupling between cortical regions. We demonstrate increased long-range alpha and beta band phase synchronization during short-term memory retention in children 6-10 years of age. Furthermore, whereas alpha-band synchronization between posterior cortex and other regions is increased during retention, local alpha-band synchronization over posterior cortex is reduced. This constitutes a functional dissociation for alpha synchronization across local and long-range cortical scales. We interpret long-range synchronization as reflecting functional integration within a network of frontal and visual cortical regions. Local desynchronization of alpha rhythms over posterior cortex, conversely, likely arises because of increased engagement of visual cortex during retention.

INCREASED VOLUNTARY DRIVE IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN COMMON OSCILLATIONS FROM 13 TO 60 Hz OF INTERFERENCE BUT NOT RECTIFIED ELECTROMYOGRAPHY	MUSCLE & NERVE			English	Article						beta band; cross-wavelet; oscillations; Piper band; rectification	SURFACE EMG; COHERENCE; MUSCLE; FREQUENCY; SIGNALS; RECTIFICATION; MYOCLONUS; PIPER; TASK; EEG	The purpose of this study was to compare the capability of interference and rectified electromyography (EMG) to detect changes in the beta (13-30-Hz) and Piper (30-60-Hz) bands when voluntary force is increased. Twenty adults exerted a constant force abduction of the index finger at 15% and 50% of maximum. The common oscillations at various frequency bands (0-500 Hz) were estimated from the first dorsal interosseous muscle using cross wavelets of interference and rectified EMG. For the interference EMG signals, normalized power significantly (P < 0.01) increased with force in the beta (9.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 15.5 +/- 2.1%) and Piper (13.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 21 +/- 1.7%) bands. For rectified EMG signals, however, the beta and Piper bands remained unchanged (P > 0.4). Although rectified EMG is used in many clinical studies to identify changes in the oscillatory drive to the muscle, our findings suggest that only interference EMG can accurately capture the increase in oscillatory drive from 13 to 60 Hz with voluntary force.

To investigate the role of the motor system in predicting the end state of observed actions, 12-month-old infants were shown movies of ordinary and extraordinary object-directed actions. The stimuli displayed a female actor who picked up an everyday object (a cup or a phone) and brought it to either her mouth or her ear. In this way, a similar movement could be ordinary (e.g., cup to mouth) or extraordinary (e.g., phone to mouth) depending on the object used. Infants' EEG and eye movements were recorded. We found a significantly stronger motor activation, indicated by a stronger desynchronization in the mu-frequency band over fronto-central areas, during observation of extraordinary compared to ordinary actions. This is explained within the computational framework of Kilner, Friston, and Frith (2007), who suggest that the motor system is used to generate predictions about actions we observe. If the observed action deviates from the initially expected path, additional predictions have to be generated, resulting in a stronger motor activation during perception of extraordinary actions. In sum, it appears that from early in life, the motor system is involved in making predictions about how an observed action will end.

Each visual-cue consisted of either a sentence or hand gesture instructing the subject to press or not to press the button. Regardless of the recorded hemisphere, viewing sentence and gesture cues elicited gamma-augmentation sequentially in the lateral-polar occipital and inferior occipital-temporal areas; subsequently, button-press movement elicited gamma-augmentation in the Rolandic area. The magnitudes of gamma-augmentation in the Rolandic and inferior occipital-temporal areas were larger when the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere was used for motor responses. A double dissociation was found in the left inferior occipital-temporal cortex in one subject; the lateral portion had greater gamma-augmentation elicited by a sentence-cue, whereas the medial portion had greater gamma-augmentation elicited by a gesture-cue. The present study has increased our understanding of the physiology of the human visuomotor system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Investigation of an Automatic Sleep Stage Classification by Means of Multiscorer Hypnogram	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation (BSI)	JUN, 2009	Yale Univ, New Haven, CT		Yale Univ	Sleep staging; polysomnogram; linear discriminant analysis; automatic classification	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; RECHTSCHAFFEN; DYNAMICS; KALES	Objectives: Scoring sleep visually based on polysomnography is an important but time-consuming element of sleep medicine. Where-as computer software assists human experts in the assignment of sleep stages to polysomnogram epochs, their performance is usually insufficient. This study evaluates the possibility to fully automatize sleep staging considering the reliability of the sleep stages available from human expert sleep scorers. Methods: We obtain features from EEG, ECG and respiratory signals of polysomnograms from ten healthy subjects. Using the sleep stages provided by three human experts, we evaluate the performance of linear discriminant analysis on the entire polysomnogram and:only on epochs where the three experts agree in their-sleep stage scoring. Results: We show that in polysomnogram intervals, to which all three scorers assign the same sleep stage, our algorithm achieves 90% accuracy. This high rate of agreement with the human experts is accomplished with only a small set of three frequency features from the EEG. We increase-the performance to 93% by including ECG and respiration features. In contrast, on intervals of ambiguous sleep stage, the sleep stage classification obtained from our algorithm, agrees with the human consensus scorer in approximately 61%. Conclusions: These findings suggest that machine classification is highly consistent with human sleep staging and that error in the algorithm's assignments is rather a problem of lack of well-defined criteria for human experts to judge certain polysomnogram epochs than an insufficiency of computational procedures	[Gapelyuk, A.; Riedl, M.; Kurths, J.; Wessel, N.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Helland, V.

Bimodal ultradian seizure periodicity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Mesial temporal lobe; Circadian; Periodicity	PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; SLEEP; FREQUENCY; MELATONIN; MODEL; RAT	Background: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) has been suggested to follow a circadian rhythm. Previous research found an afternoon peak in mTLE seizure occurrence. We evaluated the pattern of seizure occurrence in patients with well-localized mTLE and hypothesized that peak seizure frequency would occur in the afternoon, and that this pattern would not be altered by age, gender, or seizure focus. Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive mTLE patients with a seizure-free outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy from 1993 to 2004 with video-EEG captured seizures. We recorded and plotted the 24-h clock time for each seizure and performed cosinor analysis. SAS Proc GLIMMIX was used to fit the linearized transform of the cosinor model. Negative binomial regression fitted by the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was also performed to estimate and compare the mean seizure rates over a 24-h day. Results: Sixty mTLE patients monitored between 2 and 16 days were analyzed. Mean (standard deviation), median number of seizures per subject were 10.47(7.86), 9.00. Cosinor plots indicated that the function had two modes: 7-8 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. GEE analysis was consistent with peak seizure frequency occurrence at 6-8 a.m. (p < 0.0001) and 3-5 p.m. (p < 0.01). Conclusions: We found a bimodal pattern of seizure occurrence in human mTLE, with peak seizure frequencies occurring between 6-8 a.m. and 3-5 p.m. confirming an afternoon peak, as well as a previously unsuspected morning peak in seizure occurrence that provides rationale for future investigations of antiepileptic drug chronopharmacology and informs patient counseling regarding patterns of seizure occurrence.

Abnormal Long-Range Neural Synchrony in a Maternal Immune Activation Animal Model of Schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DISRUPTED LATENT INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; DOPAMINERGIC HYPERFUNCTION; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; NEURONS; LESIONS; RATS	The synchrony of neural firing is believed to underlie the integration of information between and within neural networks in the brain. Abnormal synchronization of neural activity between distal brain regions has been proposed to underlie the core symptomatology in schizophrenia. This study investigated whether abnormal synchronization occurs between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC), two brain regions implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology, using the maternal immune activation (MIA) animal model in rats. This neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia is induced through a single injection of the synthetic immune system activator polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid, a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, a molecular pattern associated with viral infection, in pregnant rat dams. It is based on epidemiological evidence of increased risk of schizophrenia in adulthood after prenatal exposure to infection. In the present study, EEG coherence and neuronal phase-locking to underlying EEG were measured in freely moving MIA and control offspring. The MIA intervention produced significant reductions in mPFC-HPC EEG coherence that correlated with decreased prepulse inhibition of startle, a measure of sensory gating and a hallmark schizotypal behavioral measure. Furthermore, changes in the synchronization of neuronal firing to the underlying EEG were evident in the theta and low-gamma frequencies. Firing within a putative population of theta-modulated, gamma-entrained mPFC neurons was also reduced in MIA animals. Thus, MIA in rats produces a fundamental disruption in long-range neuronal synchrony in the brains of the adult offspring that models the disruption of synchrony observed in schizophrenia.

The long-term posttetanic potentiation (LTP) of Shaffer collaterals resulted in an increase in the theta-power in hippocampal EEG without change in its frequency. A high correlation was shown between the increase in the theta-power and the amplitude of the local potentials induced by LTP. The mechanisms and the functional role of the observed relations between the LTP and theta activity are discussed.	[Fedotova, I. R.; Uzakov, Sh. S.; Frolov, A. A.; Markevich, V.

Altered evoked gamma-band responses reveal impaired early visual processing in ADHD children	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ADHD; Attention; EEG; Gamma activity; Memory; Visual	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; SOUND; ACTIVATION	Neurophysiological studies yield contrary results whether attentional problems of patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to early visual processing deficits or not. Evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs), being among the first cortical responses occurring as early as 90 ms after visual stimulation in human EEG, have been assigned a pivotal role in early visual processing. In particular, they are involved in memory matching processes and are enhanced when known stimuli are processed. The current study examined whether evoked GBR patterns during early memory matching processes could be indicative of an early visual processing deficit in ADHD patients. EEG was recorded from 13 young ADHD patients as well as 13 age-matched healthy participants. Both groups performed a simple forced choice reaction task employing line drawings of either known real-world items with representations in long-term memory or physically similar unknown items without such representations. Evoked GBRs of ADHD patients did not differentiate between known and unknown items. However, in healthy children, evoked GBRs were enhanced when stimuli matched a representation stored in memory. This finding indicates disadvantages at early visual processing stages in ADHD patients: In contrast to healthy participants, ADHD children lack an early memory based classification, possibly resulting in an impaired ability to rapidly reallocate attentional resources to relevant stimuli. These findings suggest that impaired early automatic stimulus classification in ADHD patients could be involved in deficits of selective and sustained attention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The EEGs from the patients were compared with recordings from 80 dextral healthy female controls. Only those subjects who could provide 20 1-s artefact-free segments of EEG were admitted into the study. The analysis consisted of the identification of the spatial patterns in the EEGs that maximally differentiated the two groups and the estimation of the cortical source distributions underlying these patterns. Spatial patterns were analyzed in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-20 Hz) bands and the source distributions were estimated using the Borgiotti-Kaplan BEAMFORMER algorithm. The results indicate that the spatial patterns identified were effective in separating the two groups, providing a minimum correct retrospective classification rate of 72% in both frequency bands while the subjects were at rest to a maximum of 83% in the alpha band during the verbal cognitive condition. Underlying cortical source distributions showed significant differences between the two groups in both frequency bands and in all cognitive conditions. Lateralized cortical differences were evident between the two groups in the both frequency bands during both the verbal and spatial cognitive conditions. During these active cognitive conditions, the CFS group showed significantly greater source-current activity than the controls in the left frontal-temporal-parietal regions of the cortex.

Electrophysiological effects of guanosine and MK-801 in a quinolinic acid-induced seizure model	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Seizure; Epilepsy; Theta; Gamma; Neuroprotection; AED	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SYNAPTOSOMAL GLUTAMATE RELEASE; ORALLY-ADMINISTERED GUANOSINE; GUANINE-BASED PURINES; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GMP DEPENDS; MOUSE MODEL; BRAIN; RAT	Quinolinic acid (QA) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist that also promotes glutamate release and inhibits glutamate uptake by astrocytes. QA is used in experimental models of seizures studying the effects of overstimulation of the glutamatergic system. The guanine-based purines (GBPs), including the nucleoside guanosine, have been shown to modulate the glutamatergic system when administered extracellularly. GBPs were shown to inhibit the binding of glutamate and analogs, to be neuroprotective under excitotoxic conditions, as well as anticonvulsant against seizures induced by glutamatergic agents, including QA-induced seizure. In this work, we studied the electrophysiological effects of guanosine against QA-induced epileptiform activity in rats at the macroscopic cortical level, as inferred by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded at the epidural surface. We found that QA disrupts a prominent basal theta (4-10 Hz) activity during peri-ictal periods and also promotes a relative increase in gamma (20-50 Hz) oscillations. Guanosine, when successfully preventing seizures, counteracted both these spectral changes. MK-801, an NMDA-antagonist used as positive control, was also able counteract the decrease in theta power; however, we observed an increase in the power of gamma oscillations in rats concurrently treated with MK-801 and QA. Given the distinct spectral signatures, these results suggest that guanosine and MK-801 prevent QA-induced seizures by different network mechanisms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is commonly used to study these changes because it possesses high temporal resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio. However, it provides limited spatial information. Non-invasive fast optical signals (FOS) have been proposed as a neuroimaging tool combining spatial and temporal resolution. Yet, this technique has not been applied to study high frequency brain oscillations because of its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we investigate the sensitivity of FOS to relatively high-frequency brain oscillations. We measured the steady-state optical response elicited in medial and lateral occipital cortex by checkerboard reversals occurring at 4, 6, and 8 Hz in younger and older adults. Stimulus-dependent oscillations were observed at the predicted stimulation frequency. In addition, in the younger adults the FOS steady-state response was smaller in lateral than medial areas, whereas in the older adults it was reversed in these two cortical regions. This may reflect diminished top-down inhibitory control in the older adults. The results indicate that FOS can be used to study the modulation of relatively high-frequency brain oscillations in adjacent cortical regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gutsell, JN; Inzlicht, M				Gutsell, Jennifer N.; Inzlicht, Michael			Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental simulation of actions during observation of outgroups	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Prejudice; Interpersonal sensitivity; Empathy; EEG	RESPONSES; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; ATTITUDES; OTHERS; PAIN	Perception-action-coupling refers to the vicarious activation of the neural system for action during perception of action, and is considered important for forms of interpersonal sensitivity, including empathy. We hypothesize that perception-action-coupling is limited to the ingroup: neural motor networks will fire upon the perception of action, but only when the object-person belongs to the ingroup; if the object-person belongs to an outgroup these motor neurons will not fire. Using electroencephalographic oscillations as an index of perception-action-coupling, we found exactly this: participants displayed activity over motor cortex when acting and when observing ingroups act, but not when observing outgroups - an effect magnified by prejudice and for disliked groups (South-Asians, then Blacks, followed by East Asians). These findings provide evidence from brain activity for yet another detrimental aspect of prejudice: a spontaneous and implicit simulation of others' action states may be limited to close others and, without active effort, may not be available for outgroups.

These provide possible explanations of the relationship between parameters of these two different approaches to modelling neuronal activity. Obtaining a physical interpretation of neural-mass models is of fundamental importance as they could provide direct and accessible tools for use in diagnosing neurological conditions. Detailed consideration of the assumptions required for the validity of each mapping elucidates strengths and weaknesses of each macroscopic model and suggests improvements for future development.

We studied four different types of spindling events analysing the behaviour of 19 brain regions during these events in the intact brain of freely behaving rats hypothesising similar generation with a leading role of thalamus or cortex for the dominant rhythm of the spindles with a hierarchy of time delays for propagation throughout the brain led by these structures. Autoregressive analysis revealed that all structures studied were capable of leading a spindle, although some did so infrequently. The highest incidence of significant leadership was shown by hindlimb cortex with a proportion of 0.38 during picrotoxin spindles. Contra lateral time delays within bilateral structures were extremely small demonstrating synchronous activity with no dominant hemisphere for any of the spindling activities (range: 0.1 +/- 0.4 ms for frontal cortex to 10.0 +/- 1.6 ms for piriform cortex). Between different structures, time delays demonstrated that spindling activity occurred in all structures almost simultaneously (range: 0.2 +/- 1.4 ms between frontal cortex and piriform cortex to 12.3 +/- 1.2 ms between hindlimb cortex and amygdala). We conclude that different spindle types appear to be subtle alterations of a single phenomenon, during which many brain regions briefly synchronise. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that they are part of a memory network. Although memory-modulated interaction between PFC and MTL has been observed at the hemodynamic level, it remains unclear what the neuronal process is that mediates the communication between these 2 areas. Experiments in rodents suggest that field oscillations in the theta band (4-8 Hz) facilitate PFC-MTL interaction. No such evidence has been reported in humans. To address this problem, cortical electrical activity from MTL, PFC, and lateral temporal lobe was recorded from implanted electrode grids in 3 epilepsy patients performing a verbal free recall task. The data were analyzed using a parametric spectral method to obtain estimates of power, coherence, and Granger causality. A task-modulated increase in coherence values between PFC and MTL was seen during free recall as opposed to a baseline condition. Concurrently, the number of coherent PFC-MTL site pairs was significantly increased during recall. Granger causality analysis further revealed that the increased coherence is a consequence of higher bidirectional information flow between the 2 regions, with a generally greater driving from MTL to PFC, namely, (MTL -> PFC) > (PFC -> MTL).

Here the brain is proposed as an isoenergetic structure having little energy barriers that limit the distribution of neuronal information, thereby facilitating unitary brain functioning. Isoenergicity is achieved and maintained by energy metabolism and must be seen as an evolutionary conserved property. Isoenergicity enables efficient coordination of neural activities, thus facilitating, among others, fast access to memory. One implication is the virtual complete dissociation of energy metabolism from higher brain functioning. Another implication is a supervening private space-time configuration that is continuously (re)constructed during life.

Identical dynamic displays were presented and participants were instructed to distinguish the intention, the emotion, or the gender of a moving image of a person, while they performed an adapted odd-ball task. Relative to a baseline presenting a nonbiological but meaningful motion display, all three biological motion conditions reduced the EEG amplitude in the mu/alpha and beta ranges, but not in the low-gamma range. Suppression was larger in the intention than in the emotion and gender conditions, with no difference between the latter two. Moreover, the suppression in the intention condition was negatively correlated with an accepted measure of empathy (EQ), revealing that participants high in empathy scores manifested less suppression. For intention and emotion the suppression was larger at occipital than at central sites, suggesting that factors other than motor system were in play while processing social information embedded in the motion of point-light displays.

We have used simultaneous physiological and anatomical measurements to investigate the issue. Concentrating on neural oscillatory activity in speech-specific frequency bands and exploring interactions between gestural (motor) and auditory-evoked activity, we find, in the absence of language-related processing, that left auditory, somatosensory, articulatory motor, and inferior parietal cortices show specific, lateralized, speech-related physiological properties. With the addition of ecologically valid audiovisual stimulation, activity in auditory cortex synchronizes with left-dominant input from the motor cortex at frequencies corresponding to syllabic, but not phonemic, speech rhythms. Our results support theories of language lateralization that posit a major role for intrinsic, hardwired perceptuomotor processing in syllabic parsing and are compatible both with the evolutionary view that speech arose from a combination of syllable-sized vocalizations and meaningful hand gestures and with developmental observations suggesting phonemic analysis is a developmentally acquired process.

Methods: Ten children with BERS, drug free at the time of the study and 10 age-matched normal controls were included in this study. Sleep was visually scored for sleep architecture and CAP using standard criteria. Results: Sleep architecture in BERS showed only few significant differences vs. controls with a reduction of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM sleep percentage. CAP analysis revealed several significant differences: reduced total CAP rate, mainly in sleep stage 2, and reduced EEG slow oscillations and arousals during stages N1 and N2. Conclusions: Sleep architecture is not importantly affected in BERS but CAP analysis reveals a decrease of NREM instability, mainly in sleep stage 2. Since there is a spindle-related spike activation in BERS, we speculate that the decrease of CAP and of EEG slow oscillations and arousals might be linked with the inhibitory action of spindling activity and spikes on arousals. Significance: CAP analysis discloses sleep structure abnormalities in children with BERS not shown by the classical sleep scoring. Spike activity and CAP A1 subtypes seem to be mutually exclusive probably because centro-temporal spikes disturb the physiological synchronization mechanisms needed for the generation of slow-wave components of CAP.

In the dissimilar-other condition, the hand was assigned to a patient suffering from a neurological disease in which Q-tips inflicted pain, whereas needle pricks did not. In the similar-other condition, the hand was assigned to a patient who responded to stimulation in the same way as the healthy participant. Participants were instructed to imagine the feeling of the person whose hand was shown and to evaluate his or her affective state. Pain conditions elicited greater EEG suppression than did nonpain conditions, particularly over frontocentral regions. Moreover, an interaction between pain and similarity revealed that for similar others, the pain effect was significant, whereas in the dissimilar-other group, suppression was equally large in the pain and no-pain conditions. We conclude that mu/alpha suppression is elicited both automatically, by observing a situation that is potentially painful for the observer, and by empathy for pain, even if the other person is different from oneself.

Brief Reports: The role of temporal predictability in the anticipatory biasing of sensory cortex during visuospatial shifts of attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; EEG; ERP; Normal volunteers	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; TIME; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATIONS; INCREASES	The presentation of an attention-directing cue elicits a lateralized ERP deflection called the late directing attention positivity (LDAP) and lateralized changes in alpha-band elelctroencephalogram oscillations. Both of these electrophysiological responses have been independently linked to biasing of visual cortex in anticipation of an impending target. However, the LDAP is not always observed, and the link between the ERP and alpha-band modulations remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of advance knowledge of the time of target onset on the ERP and alpha-band responses to cues. The LDAP was present only when the attention-directing cues accurately indicated the time of target appearance, whereas two sequential attention-related alpha-band modulations were observed regardless of the temporal information provided by the cues. Thus, alpha-band activity may be a more reliable index of pretarget biasing of visual cortical activity than lateralized ERP effects.

Cholinergic neuromodulation controls directed temporal communication in neocortex in vitro	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						EEG; oscillation; interneuron; coherence; attention; auditory	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL FUNCTION; BETA RHYTHMS; SHORT-TERM; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACETYLCHOLINE; SLEEP; MODULATION; NETWORKS	Acetylcholine is the primary neuromodulator involved in cortical arousal in mammals. Cholinergic modulation is involved in conscious awareness, memory formation and attention-processes that involve intercommunication between different cortical regions. Such communication is achieved in part through temporal structuring of neuronal activity by population rhythms, particularly in the beta and gamma frequency ranges (12-80 Hz). Here we demonstrate, using in vitro and in silico models, that spectrally identical patterns of beta2 and gamma rhythms are generated in primary sensory areas and polymodal association areas by fundamentally different local circuit mechanisms: Glutamatergic excitation induced beta2 frequency population rhythms only in layer 5 association cortex whereas cholinergic neuromodulation induced this rhythm only in layer 5 primary sensory cortex. This region-specific sensitivity of local circuits to cholinergic modulation allowed for control of the extent of cortical temporal interactions. Furthermore, the contrasting mechanisms underlying these beta2 rhythms produced a high degree of directionality, favouring an influence of association cortex over primary auditory cortex.

Theta frequency range (approximately 4-6 Hz) responses were elicited in all memory load conditions. The magnitude and duration of alpha frequency range (approximately 8-12 Hz) responses varied as a function of memory load. Beta frequency range (approximately 15-20 Hz) responses were modulated by both task difficulty and cognitive strategy. The differences between the memory load conditions were most prominent between the 0-back and 1-back conditions in the approximately 10 and 20 Hz electroencephalogram frequencies. Dynamic alpha and beta rhythm brain oscillatory responses are related to the cognitive processes in adolescence.

Data-driven approach to the estimation of connectivity and time delays in the coupling of interacting neuronal subsystems	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; Partial directed coherence; Instantaneous causality test	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; LINEAR-DEPENDENCE; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; CORTICAL AREAS	One of the challenges in neuroscience is the detection of directionality between signals reflecting neural activity. To reveal the directionality of coupling and time delays between interacting multi-scale signals, we use a combination of a data-driven technique called empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and partial directed coherence (PDC) together with the instantaneous causality test (Id). EMD is used to separate multiple processes associated with different frequency bands, while PDC and ICT allow to explore directionality and characteristic time delays, respectively. We computationally validate our approach for the cases of both stochastic and chaotic oscillatory systems with different types of coupling. Moreover, we apply our approach to the analysis of the connectivity in different frequency bands between local field potentials (LFPs) bilaterally recorded from the left and right of subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We reveal a bidirectional coupling between the left and right STN in the betaband (10-30 Hz) for an akinetic PD patient and in the tremor band (3-5 Hz) for a tremor-dominant PD patient. We detect a short time delay, most probably reflecting the inter-hemispheric transmission time. Additionally, in both patients we observe a long time delay of approximately a mean period of the betaband activity in the akinetic PD patient or the tremor band activity in the tremor-dominant PD patient. These long delays may emerge in subcortico-thalamic loops or longer pathways, comprising reflex loops, respectively. We show that the replacement of EMD by conventional bandpass filtering complicates the detection of directionality and leads to a spurious detection of time delays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the exact contribution of each region. The present study benefited from intracerebral EEG recordings in epileptic patients to record directly the neural activity in each of those frontal structures in response to positive and negative feedback. Both types of feedback induced a sequence of high-frequency responses (>40 Hz) in a widespread network involving medial frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and insular cortex. The pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), DLPFC, and lateral OFC showed higher activation in response to negative feedback, while medial OFC and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were more responsive to positive feedback. Responses in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA and dACC) were sustained (lasting more than 1,000 ms), while responses in the DLPFC, insula, and the OFC were short lasting (less than 800 ms). Taken together, our findings show that evaluating the outcome of our actions triggers gamma-range activity modulations in several frontal and insular regions. Moreover, we found that the timing and amplitude of those gamma-band responses reveal fine-scale dissociations between the neural dynamics of positive versus negative feedback processing.

Theoretical work suggests that multiple items are being maintained by neural assemblies synchronized in the gamma frequency range(25-100 Hz) that are locked to consecutive phase ranges of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). Indeed, cross-frequency coupling of the amplitude of high-frequency activity to the phase of slower oscillations has been described both in animals and in humans, but has never been linked to a theoretical model of a cognitive process. Here we used intracranial EEG recordings in human epilepsy patients to test pivotal predictions from theoretical work. First, we show that simultaneous maintenance of multiple items in WM is accompanied by cross-frequency coupling of oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, which is recruited during multi-item WM. Second, maintenance of an increasing number of items is associated with modulation of beta/gamma amplitude with theta band activity of lower frequency, consistent with the idea that longer cycles are required for an increased number of representations by gamma cycles. This effect cannot be explained by a difference in theta or beta/gamma power. Third, we describe how the precision of cross-frequency coupling predicts individual WM performance. These data support the idea that working memory in humans depends on a neural code using phase information.

Surgical outcome for focal cortical dysplasia: an analysis of recent surgical series A review	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Review						focal cortical dysplasia; intractable epilepsy; malformation of cortical development; resection	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY SURGERY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; EEG ACTIVITY; CHILDREN; MALFORMATIONS; PREDICTORS; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; RESECTION	Object. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is an important cause of intractable epilepsy and is at times treatable by resection. The now widespread use of MR imaging and recent advancement of functional imaging have increased the number of patients undergoing surgical treatment for FCD. The objective of this review is to critically examine and to provide a summary of surgical series on FCD published since 2000. Methods. Studies concerning surgery for FCD were identified from MEDLINE and references of selected articles and book chapters. Data from these included studies were summarized and analyzed to identify factors correlated with seizure outcome. Results. Sixteen studies were identified, and 469 patients met our selection criteria. Seizure-free outcome at 1-year postoperatively was achieved in 59.7% of the patients. Children and adults were equally likely to benefit from the surgery. Complete resection (OR 13.7, 95% CI 6.68-28.1; p < 0.0001) and temporal location (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.26-3.69; p = 0.0073) were two positive prognostic indicators of seizure-free outcome. Utilization of invasive monitoring did not affect the chance of seizure remission, but firm conclusions could not be drawn because patients were not randomized. Conclusions. The advancement of modern imaging has transformed the process of surgical candidate selection for partial epilepsy due to FCD. Patients from recent surgical series were more homogeneous in their clinical presentations and might represent FCD as an independent pathological entity. This likely explained the improved surgical outcome for this group of patients. These reports also documented the increased utilization of functional imaging, but their efficacy needs to be verified with further studies.

Gender Differences in Implicit and Explicit Processing of Emotional Facial Expressions as Revealed by Event-Related Theta Synchronization	EMOTION			English	Article						EEG; emotion; gender differences; theta oscillations; unconscious processing	SEX-DIFFERENCES; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; COGNITIVE BIAS; STROOP TASK; AGGRESSION; RECOGNITION; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; FACES; EEG	Emotion information processing may occur in 2 modes that are differently represented in conscious awareness. Fast online processing involves coarse-grained analysis of salient features and is not represented in conscious awareness; offline processing takes hundreds of milliseconds to generate fine-grained analysis and is represented in conscious awareness. These processing modes may be studied using event-related electroencephalogram theta synchronization as a marker of emotion processing. Two experiments were conducted that differed on the mode of emotional information presentation. In the explicit mode, subjects were explicitly instructed to evaluate the emotional content of presented stimuli; in the implicit mode, their attention was directed to other features of the stimulus. In the implicit mode, theta synchronization was most pronounced in the early processing stage, whereas in the explicit mode, it was more pronounced in the late processing stage. The early processing stage was more pronounced in men, whereas the late processing stage was more pronounced in women. Implications of these gender differences in emotion processing for well-documented differences in social behavior are discussed.

Visual P2-N2 Complex and Arousal at the Time of Encoding Predict the Time Domain Characteristics of Amnesia for Multiple Intravenous Anesthetic Drugs in Humans	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PROPOFOL-INDUCED AMNESIA; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; RECOGNITION MEMORY; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG; MIDAZOLAM; SLICES	Background: Intravenous anesthetics have marked effects on memory function, even at subclinical concentrations. Fundamental questions remain in characterizing anesthetic amnesia and identifying affected system-level processes. The authors applied a mathematical model to evaluate time-domain components of anesthetic amnesia in human subjects. Methods: Sixty-one volunteers were randomized to receive propofol (n = 12), thiopental (n = 13), midazolam (n = 12), dexmedetomidine (n = 12), or placebo (n = 12). With drug present, subjects encoded pictures into memory using a 375-item continuous recognition task, with subsequent recognition later probed with drug absent. Memory function was sampled at up to 163 time points and modeled over the time domain using a two-parameter, first-order negative power function. The parietal event-related P2-N2 complex was derived from electroencephalography, and arousal was repeatedly sampled. Each drug was evaluated at two concentrations. Results: The negative power function consistently described the course of amnesia (mean R(2) = 0.854), but there were marked differences between drugs in the modulation of individual components (P < 0.0001). Initial memory strength was a function of arousal (P = 0.005), whereas subsequent decay was related to the reaction time (P < 0.0001) and the P2-N2 complex (P = 0.007/0.002 for discrete components). Conclusions: In humans, the amnesia caused by multiple intravenous anesthetic drugs is characterized by arousal-related effects on initial trace strength, and a subsequent decay predicted by attenuation of the P2-N2 complex at encoding. The authors propose that the failure of normal memory consolidation follows drug-induced disruption of interregional synchrony critical for neuronal plasticity and discuss their findings in the framework of memory systems theory.

We investigated the relationship between visual-evoked hemodynamic responses (HDRs), measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and neuronal activity in humans, approximated with the stimulus train duration or with visual-evoked potentials (VEPs). Concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) in tissue and VEPs were recorded simultaneously over the occipital lobe of ten healthy subjects to 3, 6, and 12 s pattern-reversing checkerboard stimulus trains having a reversal frequency of 2 Hz. We found that the area-under-the-curves (Sigma) of HbO(2) and HbR were linearly correlated with the stimulus train duration and with the Sigma VEP summed over the 3, 6, and 12 s stimulus train durations. The correlation was stronger between the Sigma HbO(2) or the Sigma HbR and the Sigma VEP than between the Sigma HbO(2) or the Sigma HbR and the stimulus train duration. The Sigma VEPs explained 55% of the Sigma HbO(2) and 74% of the Sigma HbR variance, whereas the stimulus train duration explained only 45% of the Sigma HbO(2) and 51% of the Sigma HbR variance. We used Sigma of the NIRS responses and VEPs because we wanted to incorporate all possible processes (e. g., attention, habituation, etc.) affecting the responses. The results indicate that the relationship between brain HDRs and VEPs is approximately linear for 3-12 s long stimulus trains consisting of checkerboard patterns reversing at 2 Hz. To interpret hemodynamic responses, the measurement of evoked potentials is beneficial compared to the use of indirect parameters such as the stimulus duration. In addition, interindividual differences in the HbO(2) and HbR responses may be partly explained with differences in the VEPs.

Periictal heart rate variability analysis suggests long-term postictal autonomic disturbance in epilepsy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						ECG; generalized tonic-clonic seizures; seizure; sudden unexpected death	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; SEIZURES; LOCALIZATION; ARRHYTHMIAS; INTERVAL	Background: One of the possible pathomechanisms of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a postictal dysregulation of autonomic nervous system. We performed a heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of the periictal state to analyze whether a cardiac autonomic disturbance exists after an epileptic seizure. Methods: We included 31 periictal video-EEG-ECG recordings of 31 patients with epilepsy who had consecutively undergone pre-surgical evaluation. Nine generalized tonic-clonic (GTCS), 15 complex partial, and seven simple motor seizures were included. HRV was evaluated by analyzing 5-min-long ECG epochs, sampling from baseline, direct preictal, early-postictal (< 15 min after the seizure), and late-postictal (5-6 h after the seizure) periods. Results: The heart rate was elevated immediately after the seizures, but 5-6 h postictally returned to the baseline level. Time-domain components of HRV decreased after the seizure and this decrease lasted for 5-6 h. Low-frequency power decreased in the early-postictal phase and high-frequency power of HRV dropped in the late-postictal phase. GTCS had an impact on short-term but not on long-term postictal HRV decrease. Conclusions: We found decreased HRV immediately after the seizures, which lasted at least 5-6 h postictally, indicating a long-term postictal disturbance of the autonomous nervous system. GTCS were accompanied by a more decreased HRV than other seizures. Our results may have relevance in explaining pathomechanism of SUDEP.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 16 elite karate athletes, 15 amateur athletes and 17 non-athletes. They observed a series of 120 karate videos. At the end of each video, the subjects had to judge the technical/athletic level of the exercise by a scale from 0 to 10. The mismatch between their judgment and that of the coach indexed the degree of action judgment. The EEG cortical sources were estimated by sLORETA. With reference to a pre-stimulus period, the power decrease of alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms during the video indexed the cortical activation (event-related desynchronization, ERD). Regarding the hypothesis of reduced activity in elite karate athletes, low- and high-frequency alpha ERD was less pronounced in dorsal and "mirror" pathways in the elite karate athletes than in the non-athletes. Regarding the hypothesis of intermediate cortical activity in amateur karate athletes, low- and high-frequency alpha ERD was less pronounced in dorsal pathways across the non-athletes, the amateur karate athletes, and the elite karate athletes. In conclusion, athletes' judgment of observed sporting actions is related to less pronounced alpha ERD, as a possible index of "neural efficiency" in experts engaged in social cognition.

It has been generally accepted that athletes are faster, stronger, able to jump higher, more accurate, more efficient, more consistent, and more automatic in their sports performances than non-athletes. These claims have been substantiated by neuroscientific evidence of the mechanisms underlying the plastic adaptive changes in the neuronal circuits of the brains of athletes. Reinforced neural networks and plastic changes are induced by the acquisition and execution of compound motor skills during extensive daily physical training that requires quick stimulus discrimination, decision making, and specific attention. In addition, it is likely that the manner of neuronal modulation differs among sports. We also discuss several problems that should be addressed in future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional measures of this phenomenon rely on spontaneous activity and typically confound the incidence and amplitude of delta waves. The measurement of evoked K-complexes during sleep, enable separate assessment of incidence and amplitude taken from the averaged K-complex waveform. The present study describes data from 70 normal healthy men and women aged between 19 and 78 years. K-Complexes were evoked using short auditory tones and recorded from a midline array of scalp sites. Significant reductions with age were seen in the amplitude of the N550 component of the averaged waveform, which represents the amplitude of the K-complex, with linear regression analysis indicating approximately 50% of the variance was due to age.

This makes a suitable categorization for scientific use almost impossible. However, empirical data suggest that different forms of meditation show similar steps of development in terms of their neurophysiological correlates. Some electrophysiological alterations can be observed on the beginner/student level, which are closely related to non-meditative processes. Others seem to correspond to an advanced/expert level, and seem to be unique for meditation-related states of consciousness. Meditation is one possibility to specialize brain/mind functions using the brain's immanent neural plasticity. This plasticity is probably recruited by certain EEG patterns observed during or as a result of meditation, for instance, synchronized gamma oscillations. While meditation formerly has been understood to comprise mainly passive relaxation states, recent EEG findings suggest that meditation is associated with active states which involve cognitive restructuring and learning.

Adenosine kinase (ADK) is the primary enzyme metabolizing adenosine in adult brain. To investigate whether adenosine metabolism or clearance affects sleep, we recorded sleep in mice with engineered mutations in Adk. Adk-tg mice overexpress a transgene encoding the cytoplasmic isoform of ADK in the brain but lack the nuclear isoform of the enzyme. Wild-type mice and Adk(+/-) mice that have a 50% reduction of the cytoplasmic and the nuclear isoforms of ADK served as controls. Adk-tg mice showed a remarkable reduction of EEG power in low frequencies in all vigilance states and in theta activity (6.25-11 Hz) in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and waking. Adk-tg mice were awake 58 min more per day than wild-type mice and spent significantly less time in REM sleep (102 +/- 3 vs 128 +/- 3 min in wild type). After sleep deprivation, slow-wave activity (0.75-4 Hz), the intensity component of non-rapid eye movement sleep, increased significantly less in Adk-tg mice and their slow-wave energy was reduced. In contrast, the vigilance states and EEG spectra of Adk(+/-) and wild-type mice did not differ. Our data suggest that overexpression of the cytoplasmic isoform of ADK is sufficient to alter sleep physiology. ADK might orchestrate neurotransmitter pathways involved in the generation of EEG oscillations and regulation of sleep.

It can be observed interictally in epileptic foci and also at the onset of epileptic seizures. There are several hypotheses about how HFA is generated, and it has been suggested that the underlying mechanisms may play an important role in epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. The high specificity of HFA for epileptic foci is now used during presurgical evaluation to help localize epileptic focus. In this article we review the current state of knowledge regarding this phenomenon and challenges for the future studies focusing on HFA. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mapping local network activity according to dipole localization of frequency-selective gamma and beta generators supports the leading role of frontal areas in processes of working memory. The retention of information during the delay interval is presented by joint activity of frequency-selective gamma and beta generators which provide the integration of frontal areas, associative, visual cortex and cerebellum. The joint activity of the gamma- and beta-generators has a wave-like character and is modulated by low-frequency wave activity.

For example, neurophysiological techniques (EEG or MEG), have been widely utilized in the investigation of the most important psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder or obsessive/compulsive disorder. The outcomes of some of those neurophysiological studies have made it possible to develop statistical models having very high sensitivity and specificity, although those models have not been incorporated into the day to day clinical practice. A possible explanation for this situation is that an inadequate analysis procedure which might be missing some important quantums of information contained in brain signals is being used. In this sense, new methods of non-linear analysis have been proposed for the investigation of neurophysiological data. Particularly, the analysis of brain signal complexity has been widely utilized in the investigation of psychiatric disorders. Parameters of EEG or MEG complexity usually estimate the predictability of brain oscillations and/or the number of independent oscillators underlying the observed signals. More importantly, complexity parameters seem to be sensitive to the temporal components of brain activity, and therefore might reflect the dynamical nature of psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews some of the most relevant studies within this field, especially those focusing on the diagnosis, follow-up and prediction of response to treatment.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures A pilot RCT	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HOSPITAL ANXIETY; SYMPTOMS; SCALE	Objective: To compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and standard medical care (SMC) as treatments for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Methods: Our randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared CBT with SMC in an outpatient neuropsychiatric setting. Sixty-six PNES patients were randomized to either CBT (plus SMC) or SMC alone, scheduled to occur over 4 months. PNES diagnosis was established by video-EEG telemetry for most patients. Exclusion criteria included comorbid history of epilepsy, <2 PNES/month, and IQ <70. The primary outcome was seizure frequency at end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included 3 months of seizure freedom at 6-month follow-up, measures of psychosocial functioning, health service use, and employment. Results: In an intention-to-treat analysis, seizure reduction following CBT was superior at treatment end (group x time interaction p < 0.0001; large to medium effect sizes). At follow-up, the CBT group tended to be more likely to have experienced 3 months of seizure freedom (odds ratio 3.125, p = 0.086). Both groups improved in some health service use measures and on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. Mood and employment status showed no change. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective than standard medical care alone in reducing seizure frequency in PNES patients. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that CBT in addition to SMC, as compared to SMC alone, significantly reduces seizure frequency in patients with PNES (change in median monthly seizure frequency: baseline to 6 months follow-up, CBT group, 12 to 1.5; SMC alone group, 8 to 5).

Since a graph is a mathematical representation of a network, the use of a theoretical graph approach would describe concisely the topological features of the functional network estimated from neuroimaging techniques. In particular, by applying the process of coherence analysis to high-density EEG recordings, rich visualizations can be developed that provide a means for spatiotemporal analysis of changes in synchronous brain activity. In the present work, we studied the changes in brain synchronization networks during performance of a complex visuomotor task with strategic components in normal subjects. In particular, we evaluated the differences in the functional network topology associated with human learning by calculating global and local efficiency indexes. Our results suggest that during an initial period of learning, which is probably related to the most significant cognitive processes, the particular organization of functional links in the alpha frequency band (8-12Hz) tends to increase the efficiency of communication within the cerebral network. Such evidence could be interpreted as due to the need for a new strategy formulation. Overall, this approach enabled us to capture a shift in topology made during the process of learning and thus helped us to shed more light on the neural correlates of strategy formulation. Our findings provide strong support for the efficacy of theoretical graph analysis to study complex brain networks.

Our group has investigated brain oscillatory responses in a small group of AD subjects. We found that the de novo (untreated) AD group differs from both the cholinergically-treated AD group and aged-matched healthy controls in theta and delta responses over left frontal-central areas after cognitive stimulation. On the contrary, the difference observed in AD groups upon a sensory visual stimulation includes response increase over primary or secondary visual sensorial areas compared to controls. These findings imply at least two different neural networks, depending on type of stimulation (i.e. cognitive or sensory). The default mode defined as activity in resting state in AD seems to be affected electrophysiologically. Coherences are also very valuable in observing the group differences, especially when a cognitive stimulus is applied. In healthy controls, higher coherence values are elicited after a cognitive stimulus than after a sensory task. Our findings support the notion of disconnectivity of cortico-cortical connections in AD. The differences in comparison of oscillatory responses upon sensory and cognitive stimulations and their role as a biomarker in AD await further investigation in series with a greater number of subjects.

Application of singular spectrum-based change-point analysis to EMG-onset detection	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						EMG-onset detection; Change-point analysis; Wrist EMG; Trunk EMG	SEGMENTATION; MUSCLES; EEG	While many approaches have been proposed to identify the signal onset in EMG recordings, there is no standardized method for performing this task. Here, we propose to use a change-point detection procedure based on singular spectrum analysis to determine the onset of EMG signals. This method is suitable for automated real-time implementation, can be applied directly to the raw signal, and does not require any prior knowledge of the EMG signal's properties. The algorithm proposed by Moskvina and Zhigljavsky (2003) was applied to EMG segments recorded from wrist and trunk muscles. Wrist EMG data was collected from 9 Parkinson's disease patients with and without tremor, while trunk EMG data was collected from 13 healthy able-bodied individuals. Along with the change-point detection analysis, two threshold-based onset detection methods were applied, as well as visual estimates of the EMG onset by trained practitioners. In the case of wrist EMG data without tremor, the change-point analysis showed comparable or superior frequency and quality of detection results, as compared to other automatic detection methods. In the case of wrist EMG data with tremor and trunk EMG data, performance suffered because other changes occurring in these signals caused larger changes in the detection statistic than the changes caused by the initial muscle activation, suggesting that additional criteria are needed to identify the onset from the detection statistic other than its magnitude alone. Once this issue is resolved, change-point detection should provide an effective EMG-onset detection method suitable for automated real-time implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Scalp electroencephalographies (EEGs) were conducted twice in 11 healthy, right-handed males, once before sertraline intake and again 4 hours thereafter. The EEGs included four sessions recorded sequentially while the subjects were resting, watching a music video, resting, and watching an erotic video for 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively. We performed frequency-domain analysis using the EEGs with a distributed model of current-source analysis. The statistical nonparametric maps were obtained from the sessions of watching erotic and music videos (p< 0.05). Results: The erotic stimuli decreased the current-source density of the high beta frequency band in the middle frontal gyrus, the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus of the left cerebral hemisphere in the baseline EEGs taken before sertraline intake (p< 0.05). The erotic stimuli did not induce any changes in current-source distribution of the brain 4 hours after sertraline intake. Conclusions: It is speculated that erotic stimuli may decrease the function of the middle frontal gyrus, the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus of the left cerebral hemisphere in healthy adult males. This change may debase the inhibitory control of the brain against erotic stimuli. Sertraline may reduce the decrement in inhibitory control.

To determine cognitive abnormalities in chronic interictal psychosis (CIP), and to assess whether these abnormalities are distinguishable from those seen in schizophrenia in terms of WM deficits, we used magnetoencephalography during a WM task performed by patients with CIP, nonpsychotic epilepsy, and schizophrenia and by healthy Subjects. Multiple Source Beamformer and Brain-Voyager were used for analysis. In both patients with CIP and those with schizophrenia, we found dorsolateral prefrontal hyperactivation and left inferior temporal hypoactivation, as indicated by alpha event-related desynchronization and synchronization, respectively. Patients with schizophrenia also showed alpha2 event-related desynchronization in the mid-prefrontal cortex relative to healthy controls. Direct comparison of patients with CIP and schizophrenia rendered no difference in source-power changes. Our findings indicate similar functional cognitive abnormalities in CIP and schizophrenia in the prefrontal and left temporal cortex, which supports the possibility that these disorders share common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

The Shannon spectral entropy (SSE), Tsallis spectral entropy (TSE), and Renyi spectral entropy (RSE) were calculated from the normalized power spectral density to evaluate the irregularity patterns. In addition, the Euclidean (ED) and Wootters (WD) distances were computed as disequilibrium measures. Results revealed statistically significant lower SSE and TSE(2) values for MCI patients than for controls (p < 0.05) in the right lateral region of the brain. ED also obtained statistically significant lower values for MCI patients than for controls using the (p < 0.05) in the right lateral region of the brain. These findings suggest that MCI is associated with a significant decrease in irregularity of MEG activity. In addition, the highest accuracy of 64.3% was achieved by the SSE. We conclude that measures from information theory can be useful to both characterize abnormal brain dynamics and help in MCI detection.

With the inclusion of fuzzy sets, the similarity of vectors is fuzzily defined in C-FuzzyEn based on the exponential function and their shapes, rather than on the Heaviside function used in the conventional cross sample entropy (C-SampEn). Tests on simulated data sets and real EEG signals showed that C-FuzzyEn was superior to C-SampEn in several aspects, including giving the entropy definition in the case of small parameters, better relative consistency, and less dependence on record length. The proposed C-FuzzyEn was then applied for the analysis of simultaneously recorded electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG) signals during sustained isometric contraction for monitoring local muscle fatigue. The results showed that the C-FuzzyEn of EMG-MMG signals decreased significantly during the development of muscle fatigue. The C-FuzzyEn showed a similar trend with the mean frequency (MNF) of EMG, the commonly used muscle fatigue indicator. However, C-FuzzyEn of EMG-MMG demonstrated a better robustness to the length of the analysis window in comparison with the MNF of EMG. The results suggested that the proposed C-FuzzyEn of EMG-MMG may potentially become a new reliable method for muscle fatigue assessment. It can also be applied to other bivariate signals extracted from complex systems with short data lengths in noisy backgrounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Seizure severity and duration in the cortical stimulation model of experimental epilepsy in rats: A longitudinal study	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Rat models of epilepsy; Cortical electrical stimulation; Epileptiform afterdischarges	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; AFTERDISCHARGES; THRESHOLD; DEVICES	The aim of this study was to determine the current intensities necessary to elicit three levels of varying EEG and behavioural phenomena with electrical stimulation, and also to determine the consistency of the EEG and behavioural components of the triggered seizures over time. Electrical stimulation of the primary motor/somatosensory cortex was performed in 16 adult rats with multichannel microwire electrode arrays. Stimulation was delivered at a frequency of 60 Hz (1 ms pulse width), for 2s duration, as biphasic rectangular pulses over four of the eight available electrode pairs. Current intensity thresholds for interruption of normal behaviour, epileptiform afterdischarge (EAD) longer than 5s and motor seizures with Racine severity greater than 3 were not correlated to time post-surgery. The Racine threshold was shown to be negatively correlated to the EAD duration and Racine severity of seizures elicited in the following sessions. Seizures were reliably generated in rats through cortical stimulation with microwire electrode arrays and these seizures were not shown to be subject to any kindling type effects up to 53 days post-implantation. Both the electrographic duration and behavioural severity of stimulated seizures remained, on average, constant during this experimental period. Approximately one-third of stimulations did not cause observable motor seizures and of those that did result in seizures, forelimb clonus was the most common manifestation and the mean EAD duration was 18.5s. No damage beyond that caused by surgical implantation of electrodes was observed in the histological analyses of stimulated and non-stimulated tissue. The consistency, duration and severity of seizures within this timeframe make this cortical stimulation model suitable for investigations into novel therapeutic interventions for epilepsy that require a known seizure focus.

Upper alpha activity during working memory processing reflects abnormal inhibition in major depression	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						EEG; Alpha; Major depression; Inhibition; Working memory	EEG-ALPHA; COGNITIVE INHIBITION; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ASYMMETRY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DYSFUNCTION	Background: EEG studies examining 'resting' state (i.e. non-task) state brain activity in major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported numerous abnormalities within the alpha bandwidth. These findings are discussed extensively within affective disorders literature but their relationship to functional aspects of depressive psychopathology remains unclear. Investigating alpha modulation during active cognitive processing may provide a more targeted means of relating aberrant alpha activity to specific aspects of depression symptomatology. Alpha activity is reliably modulated during working memory (WM) processing and WM impairments are a common neuropsychological consequence of MDD. Moreover, it has been suggested that alpha activity reflects internally mediated inhibitory process and attenuated inhibition has been suggested to contribute to WM inefficacy. Aim: The current investigation examined whether alpha was modulated differently in MDD participants during WM processing and whether the pattern of alpha activity was consistent with impairments in inhibitory processes. Method: Event related synchronisation (ERS) within the upper alpha band over the retention interval of a modified Sternberg WM task was examined in 15 acutely depressed and 15 never depressed right-handed female participants. Results: MDD participants displayed greater upper alpha ERS than controls during the online information maintenance component of WM processing. This was evident over left, but not right, parieto-occipital cortex. Conclusion: The results are consistent with increased inhibition of extraneous material during WM processing in depression. This may reflect a neurobiological compensation strategy whereby additional neural resources are required to achieve comparable performance accuracy during effortful cognitive processing in MDD.

Clinically used electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) method shows limits on accuracy, efficiency and reliability. In this study, a cortical function mapping method with 3Dvisualization was implemented by analyzing and projecting the power change of high gamma (HG) oscillation in ECoG on patient's own MRI brain model. The method was tested on epilepsy patients with subdural electrodes for three tasks (hand movement, tongue movement and silent reading). The proposed 3D cortical function mapping on the patient's individual brain structure provides direct and accurate reference for resection surgery planning.

Mean frequency +/- standard deviation (s.d.) was 16.9 +/- 2.1 Hz (range 15-20 Hz) in PT, 17.3 +/- 1.9 Hz (15-20 Hz) in FT and 16.1 +/- 1.6 Hz (14-19 Hz) in PB. Mean power +/- s.d. was 22.9 +/- 6.2 mu V-2 (range 16-39 mu V-2) in PT, 11.9 +/- 4.1 mu V-2 (7-19 mu V-2) in FT and 17.1 +/- 6.2 mu V-2 (9-26 mu V-2) in PB. Power was significantly higher in PT than FT (p < 0.005).

We develop a novel method that can be used to estimate the instantaneous phases and amplitudes of the alpha rhythm with high accuracy by modeling the alpha rhythm phase and amplitude as Markov random field (MRF) models. By using a belief propagation technique, we construct an exact-inference algorithm that can be used to estimate instantaneous phases and amplitudes and calculate the marginal likelihood. Maximizing the marginal likelihood enables us to estimate the hyperparameters on the basis of type-II maximum likelihood estimation. We prove that the instantaneous phase and amplitude estimation by our method is consistent with that by the Hilbert transform, which has been commonly used to estimate instantaneous phases and amplitudes, of a signal filtered from observed data in the limited case that the observed data consist of only one frequency signal whose amplitude is constant and a Gaussian noise. Comparison of the performances of observation noise reduction by our method and by a Gaussian MRF model of alpha rhythm signal indicates that our method reduces observation noise more efficiently. Moreover, the instantaneous phase and amplitude estimates obtained using our method are more accurate than those obtained by the Hilbert transform. Application of our method to experimental EEG data also demonstrates that the relationship between the alpha rhythm phase and the reaction time emerges more clearly by using our method than the Hilbert transform. This indicates our method's practical usefulness. Therefore, applying our method to experimental EEG data will enable us to estimate the instantaneous phases and amplitudes of the alpha rhythm more precisely.

Here, we studied the low- and high-frequency dynamics of neuronal oscillations in a task that involves covert searching and visual perception of an illusory contour figure (Kanisza square). Subjects were cued to a particular region of the space, and then a matrix of illusory contour inductors appeared. Illusory contour could appear at the cued position, in a different position or not appear at all. We analyze the condition in which an illusory contour appears and those in which the illusory borders do not appear. During the visual perception of the illusory contour, we found a significant increase in a narrow and sustained gamma frequency band (55-65 Hz). We also found a transient increase in the theta band (4-10 Hz), 0.3 s after stimuli onset. This low-frequency power increase correlates strongly with the detection of the illusory contour and it is inversely correlated with the gamma-band response. When illusory contours were absent, a sustained low-frequency response in the same frequency range was present until appearance of the motor response. The intensity of this low-frequency power response was also related to the speed of the motor response. We hypothesize that theta and gamma interact to process different aspects of the task. Gamma would be related to perception of the stimuli, while theta would be involved in search mechanisms or the initiation of a motor response. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The changes were more prominent in the frontal cortex areas. The influence of hypnotic state on cortical gamma activity pharmacologically augmented by ketamine injection was analyzed. Administration of subanesthetic ketamine doses led to behavioral locomotor excitation of an animal accompanied by a long-lasting (up to 2 h) increase in the gamma electrical activity. If the animal hypnosis was induced after the ketamine injection, it resulted in an almost instant reorganization of the spectral power. The slow-wave power increased and the gamma-power decreased to the baseline levels. Thus, the animal hypnosis eliminated the reorganization of cortical rhythmicity produced by ketamine, which suggests a stabilizing and, to a certain extent, protective function of this kind of hypnosis in the states of behavioral locomotion and stress.

Neural Time Course of Echo Suppression in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MIDDLE LATENCY COMPONENTS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; DISCRIMINATION SUPPRESSION; PRECEDENCE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; SOUND	In reverberant environments, the brain can suppress echoes so that auditory perception is dominated by the primary or leading sounds. Echo suppression comprises at least two distinct phenomena whose neural bases are unknown: spatial translocation of an echo toward the primary sound, and object capture to combine echo and primary sounds into a single event. In an electroencephalography study, we presented subjects with primary-echo (leading-lagging) click pairs in virtual acoustic space, with interclick delay at the individual's 50% suppression threshold. On each trial, subjects reported both click location (one or both hemifields) and the number of clicks they heard (one or two). Thus, the threshold stimulus led to two common percepts: Suppressed and Not Suppressed. On some trials, a subset of subjects reported an intermediate percept, in which two clicks were perceived in the same hemifield as the leading click, providing a dissociation between spatial translocation and object capture. We conducted time-frequency and event-related potential analyses to examine the time course of the neural mechanisms mediating echo suppression. Enhanced gamma band phase synchronization (peaking at similar to 40 Hz) specific to successful echo suppression was evident from 20 to 60 ms after stimulus onset. N1 latency provided a categorical neural marker of spatial translocation, where as N1 amplitude still reflected the physical presence of a second (lagging) click. These results provide evidence that (1) echo suppression begins early, at the latest when the acoustic signal first reaches cortex, and (2) the brain spatially translocates a perceived echo before the primary sound captures it.

The present investigation deals with time-dependent electrical frequency changes (electropharmacograms) induced by these, as well as by aminoindan, the major metabolite of rasagiline. Method: Adult rats (day-night converted, 1 5 months old) were fitted with 4 bipolar concentric steel electrodes connected to a small base plate, which was positioned stereotactically for insertion of the electrodes into the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation. The plate carried a small plug to receive a telemetric device during the experimental session. Changes in field potentials were recorded during a pre-drug reference period of 45 min, followed by intraperitoneal administration and 5 h of recording thereafter. Data were transmitted wirelessly for frequency analysis. Data from 10 animals treated within a crossover design were averaged. Results: A dose of 0.25 mg/kg i.p. rasagiline produced statistically significant decreases in spectral alpha2 and beta1 power. Higher dosages showed a linear enhancement of this effect. A similar pattern was obtained after administration of aminoindan (2-10 mg/kg), but of shorter duration. Selegiline produced a similar pattern only for the first 1-2 h. After this, statistically significant increases in delta and theta power were observed. Conclusion: Despite the feature of MAO-B inhibition in both drugs and its reflection in the initial changes of the frequency pattern during the first hour, the pharmacological action of selegiline during the following hours differs profoundly from that of rasagiline, presumably due to the toxicity of its major metabolites methamphetamine and amphetamine.

Here we show that positive effects of semantic context on encoding and retrieval of associations are mediated by changes in the coupling pattern between EEG theta sources. During successful encoding of semantically congruent face-location associations, the right superior parietal lobe showed enhanced theta phase synchronization with other regions within the lateral posterior parietal lobe (PPL) and left medial temporal lobe (MTL). However, functional coordination involving the inferior parietal lobe was higher in the incongruent condition. These results suggest a differential engagement of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms during encoding of semantically congruent and incongruent episodic associations, respectively. Although retrieval processes operated on a similar neural network, the main difference with the study phase was the larger amount of functional links shown by the lateral prefrontal cortex with regions of the MTL and PPL. All together, these results suggest that theta oscillations mediate, at least partially, the positive effect of semantic congruence on associative memory by (i) optimizing top-down attentional mechanisms through enhanced theta phase synchronization between dorsal regions of the PPL and MTL and (ii) by adjusting the control of automatic attention to sensory and contextual information reactivated in the MTL through functional connections with the inferior parietal lobe during both encoding and retrieval processes.

Involvement of the human pedunculopontine nucleus region in voluntary movements	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MESENCEPHALIC LOCOMOTOR REGION; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; BLOOD-FLOW CHANGES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; MOTOR AREA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION	Objective: The pedunculopontine nucleus region (PPNR) is being investigated as a target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson disease (PD), particularly for gait and postural impairment. A greater understanding of how PPNR activities and oscillations are modulated with voluntary movements is crucial to the development of neuromodulation strategies. Methods: We studied 7 patients with PD who underwent DBS electrode implantations in the PPNR. PPNR local field potential and EEG were recorded while patients performed self-paced wrist and ankle movements. Results: Back-averaging of the PPNR recording showed movement-related potentials before electromyography onset. Frequency analysis showed 2 discrete movement-related frequency bands in the theta (6- to 10-Hz) and beta (14- to 30-Hz) ranges. The PPNR theta band showed greater event-related desynchronization with movements in the ON than in the OFF medication state and was coupled with the sensorimotor cortices in the ON state only. Beta event-related desynchronization was observed in the PPNR during the premovement and movement execution phases in the OFF state. In contrast, premovement PPNR beta event-related synchronization occurred in the ON state. Moreover, beta band coherence between the PPNR and the midline prefrontal region was observed during movement preparation in the ON but not the OFF state. Conclusions: Activities of PPNR change during movement preparation and execution in patients with PD. Dopaminergic medications modulate PPNR activities and promote the interactions between the cortex and PPNR. Beta oscillations may have different functions in the basal ganglia and PPNR, and may be prokinetic rather than antikinetic in the PPNR. Neurology (R) 2010;75:950-959	[Tsang, E.

In this EEG study we differentiate between perceptual- and motor-related processes during perceptual reversals. Delta- and alpha-band activity was analyzed while participants answered to a perceptual reversal either immediately or with a delay of approximately 1500 ms, thereby separating reversal-related and motor-related activity. On the single sweep level a reversal-related positive delta response and reversal-related desynchronisation of alpha activity could be detected irrespective of the motor response. Both conditions elicited the strongest reversal-related modulations at posterior locations. Contrary, motor-related responses were found predominantly at central locations. These findings were supported by a control experiment, using a slightly modified stimulus that allowed unambiguous perceptual changes to be triggered exogenously. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the brain response to perceptual reversals differs from motor-related processes elicited by the button press indicating the perceptual reversal. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that perceptual- and motor-related processes are achieved in multiple selectively distributed and parallel working oscillatory networks of the brain.

The functional role of motor activation in language processing: Motor cortical oscillations support lexical-semantic retrieval	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PREMOTOR CORTEX; ACTION WORDS; IMPOSSIBLE MOVEMENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; COMPREHENSION; REPRESENTATIONS; RESONANCE; SENTENCE; SYSTEM; EEG	There is increasing experimental evidence that processing action-related language results in the automatic activation of associated regions of the motor and premotor cortex. However, the functional significance of motor activation in language processing is still under debate. In the present EEG study, we set out to investigate if language-induced motor activation primarily reflects the retrieval of lexical-semantic information or post-lexical motor imagery. The processing of action verbs was found accompanied by an early activation of motor-related brain areas, as reflected by a desynchronization in the mu- and beta-frequency bands which was localized to motor and premotor areas. A stronger motor activation was observed for verbs presented in an animal context (e.g. "The deer jumped over the stream") compared to a human context (e.g. "The athlete jumped over the fence") and motor resonance was directly modulated by the cloze probability of the noun-verb pairs. The onset of the motor effects preceded classical measures of semantic integration (i.e. the N400 component) and the strength of motor activation was found inversely related to the size of the N400 effect. These findings support the hypothesis that motor activation in language processing primarily supports the retrieval and integration of lexical-semantic information.

This continuous mutual adaptation results in interactional synchrony to which both members contribute. Freely exchanging the role of imitator and model is a well-framed example of interactional synchrony resulting from a mutual behavioral negotiation. How the participants' brain activity underlies this process is currently a question that hyperscanning recordings allow us to explore. In particular, it remains largely unknown to what extent oscillatory synchronization could emerge between two brains during social interaction. To explore this issue, 18 participants paired as 9 dyads were recorded with dual-video and dual-EEG setups while they were engaged in spontaneous imitation of hand movements. We measured interactional synchrony and the turn-taking between model and imitator. We discovered by the use of nonlinear techniques that states of interactional synchrony correlate with the emergence of an interbrain synchronizing network in the alpha-mu band between the right centroparietal regions. These regions have been suggested to play a pivotal role in social interaction. Here, they acted symmetrically as key functional hubs in the interindividual brainweb. Additionally, neural synchronization became asymmetrical in the higher frequency bands possibly reflecting a top-down modulation of the roles of model and imitator in the ongoing interaction.

However, whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a suitable imaging method for infant and patient populations, can be used to examine RSFC remains elusive. Using an ETG-4000 Optical Topography System, the present study measured 29 adult subjects (14 females) over the sensorimotor and auditory cortexes during a resting session and a motor-localizer task session. The RSFC maps were computed by seed-based correlation analysis and data-driven cluster analysis. The results from both analyses showed robust RSFC maps, which were not only consistent with the localizer task-related activation results, but also those of previous fMRI findings. Moreover. the strong consistency between the seed-based correlation analysis and the data-driven cluster analysis further validated the use of fNIRS to assess RSFC. The potential influence of a specific low-frequency filtering range (0.04-0.15 Hz and 0.01-0.08 Hz) and three fNIRS parameters (oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, and total-Hb) on RSFC results were also examined.

The concept of the default-mode network (DMN) - a set of brain regions in which resting-state activity (RSA) activity is reduced in response to external stimuli recently raised much controversy concerning the psychological correlates of RSA. However, it remains unclear how RSA interacts with stimulus-induced activity. Here we review studies in humans and animals that address how RSA interacts with stimulus-induced activity; we also discuss, conversely, how stimulus-induced activity can modulate RSA. Psychologically, the rest-stimulus interaction is relevant to predicting subsequent behavioral and mental states. We conclude that a better understanding of the rest-stimulus interaction is likely to be crucial to the elucidation of the brain's contribution to mental states.

It is thus of great value to analyze these rhythms and their mutual relationships in large scale models of cortical regions. In the present work, we modified the neural mass model by Wendling et al. (Eur.J. Neurosci. 15 (2002) 1499-1508) by including a new inhibitory self-loop among GABA(A,fast) interneurons. A theoretical analysis was performed to demonstrate that, thanks to this loop, GABA(A,fast) interneurons can produce a gamma rhythm in the power spectral density (PSD) even without the participation of the other neural populations. Then, the model of a whole cortical region, built upon four interconnected neural populations (Pyramidal cells, excitatory, GABA(A,slow) and GABA(A,fast) interneurons) was investigated by changing the internal connectivity parameters. Results show that different rhythm combinations (beta and gamma, alpha and gamma, or a wide spectrum) can be obtained within the same region by simply altering connectivity values, without the need to change synaptic kinetics. Finally, two or three cortical regions were connected by using different topologies of long range connections. Results show that long-range connections directed from pyramidal neurons to GABA(A,fast) interneurons are the most efficient to transmit rhythms from one region to another. In this way, PSD with three or four peaks can be obtained using simple connectivity patterns. The model can be of value to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms involved in the generation of gamma rhythms and provide a better understanding of cortical EEG spectra. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the spatiotemporal scale of focal epilepsy, wide-bandwidth electrophysiological recordings were obtained using clinical macro- and research microelectrodes in patients with epilepsy and control subjects with intractable facial pain. Seizure-like events not detectable on clinical macroelectrodes were observed on isolated microelectrodes. These 'microseizures' were sparsely distributed, more frequent in brain regions that generated seizures, and sporadically evolved into large-scale clinical seizures. Rare microseizures observed in control patients suggest that this phenomenon is ubiquitous, but their density distinguishes normal from epileptic brain. Epileptogenesis may involve the creation of these topographically fractured microdomains and ictogenesis (seizure generation), the dynamics of their interaction and spread.

CORTICO-CEREBELLAR COHERENCE AND CAUSAL CONNECTIVITY DURING SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						rat; deep cerebellar nuclei; cerebral cortex; single unit activity; local field potential; directed transfer function	FIELD POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; MULTIVARIATE AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS/; PERIPHERAL TACTILE STIMULATION; GRANULE CELL LAYER; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZED SLEEP; PASSIVE EXPECTANCY; INFERIOR OLIVE; BASAL GANGLIA	Cerebral cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) is prominent during sleep and also during ketamine-induced anesthesia. SWA in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is closely linked to prominent fluctuations between up- and down-states in the membrane potential of pyramidal neurons. However, little is known about how the cerebellum is linked into SWA and whether slow cortical oscillations influence sensory cerebellar responses. To examine these issues, we simultaneously recorded EEG activity from the cerebral cortex (SI, MI, and supplementary motor area (SMA)), local field potentials at the input stage of cerebellar processing in the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) and inferior olive (IO), and single unit activity at the output stage of the cerebellum in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). We found that in ketamine-anesthetized rats, SWA was synchronized between all recorded cortical areas and was phase locked with local field potentials of the GCL, 10 and single unit activity in the DCN. We also found that cortical up-states are linked to activation of GCL neurons but to inhibition of cerebellar output from the DCN, with the latter an effect likely mediated by Purkinje cells. A partial coherence analysis showed further that a large portion of SWA shared between GCL and DCN was transmitted from the cortex, since the coherence shared between GCL and DCN was diminished when the effect of cortical activity was subtracted. To determine the causal flow of information between structures, a directed transfer function was calculated between the simultaneous activities of SI, MI, SMA, GCL and DCN. This analysis demonstrated that the primary direction of information flow was from cortex to the cerebellum and that SI had a stronger influence than other cortical areas on DCN activity. The strong functional connectivity with SI in particular is in agreement with previous findings of a strong cortical component in cerebellar sensory responses. (C) 2010 IBRO.

Beta oscillations correlate with the probability of perceiving rivalrous visual stimuli	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						illusory motion reversal; binocular rivalry; beta oscillation; neural coalitions	WAGON-WHEEL-ILLUSION; TERM-MEMORY TASK; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; ALPHA BAND; PERCEPTION; MOTION; CONSCIOUSNESS; CORTEX; HZ; SYNCHRONIZATION	Under continuous lighting, moving stimuli such as ceiling fans and car wheels can sporadically appear to move in the reverse direction-this phenomenon is known as illusory motion reversal (IMR). We have previously suggested that IMR results from the spurious activation of motion detectors tuned for the opposite direction of motion, leading to a rivalry between two possible motion percepts. To determine if this hypothesis is supported by evidence from electrophysiology, we used EEG to directly compare neural signatures in IMR and binocular rivalry (BR), a well-studied form of rivalry. We find that both IMR and BR show large changes in power in the beta range (14-30 Hz) at the time of a perceptual switch. More importantly, during a stable perception, beta power correlates with the probability of a perception. Specifically, beta power associated with veridical motion perception (experienced the majority of the time) is higher than the power during illusory motion perception (experienced a minority of the time). The BR percepts, each 50% probable, are associated with an intermediate beta amplitude. We propose that the amplitude of synchronized beta activity reflects the size of currently active neural coalitions, with less likely percepts associated with smaller coalitions.

Recent reports suggest that high-frequency epileptic activity is highly localized to epileptogenic zones. The goal of the present study was to investigate the potential usefulness of noninvasive localization of high-frequency epileptic activity for epilepsy surgery. Methods. Data obtained in 4 patients, who had seizures during routine magnetoencephalography (MEG) tests, were retrospectively studied. The MEG data were digitized at 4000 Hz, and 3D MR images were obtained. The magnetic sources were volumetrically localized with wavelet-based beamformer. The MEG results were subsequently compared with clinical data. Results. The 4 patients had 1-4 high-frequency neuromagnetic components (110-910 Hz) in ictal and interictal activities. The loci of high-frequency activities were concordant with intracranial recordings therein 3 patients, who underwent presurgical evaluation. The loci of high-frequency ictal activities were in line with semiology and neuroimaging in all 4 of the patients. High-frequency epileptic activity was highly localized to the epileptogenic zones. Conclusions. High-frequency epileptic activity can be volumetrically localized with MEG. Source analysis of high-frequency neuromagnetic signals has the potential to determine epileptogenic zones noninvasively and preoperatively for epilepsy surgery.

Developmental Tuning and Decay in Senescence of Oscillations Linking the Corticospinal System	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PRECISION GRIP TASK; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; SPINAL MOTONEURONS; HAND-MUSCLE	There is increasing evidence of the importance of synchronous activity within the corticospinal system for motor control. We compared oscillatory activity in the primary sensorimotor cortex [EEG of sensorimotor cortex (SMC-EEG)] and a motor neuronal pool [surface electromyogram of opponens pollicis (OP-EMG)], and their coherence in children (4-12 years of age), young adults (20-35 years of age), and elderly adults (>55 years of age). The ratio between lower (2-13 Hz) and higher (14-32 Hz) frequencies in both SMC-EEG and OP-EMG decreased with age, correlating inversely with motor performance. There was evidence for larger, more distributed cortical networks in the children and elderly compared with young adults. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) was present in all age groups and shifted between frontal and parietal cortical areas. In children, CMC was smaller and less stationary in amplitude and frequency than in adults. Young adults had single peaks of CMC clustered near the modal frequency (23 Hz); multiple peaks with a broad spread of frequencies occurred in children and the elderly; the further the frequency of the maximum peak CMC was from 23 Hz, the poorer the performance. CMC amplitude was inversely related to performance in young adults but was not modulated in relation to performance in children and the elderly. We propose that progressive fine-tuning of the frequency coding and stabilization of the dynamic properties within and between corticospinal networks occurs during adolescence, refining the capacity for efficient dynamic communication in adulthood. In old age, blurring of the tuning between networks and breakdown in their integration occurs and is likely to contribute to a decrement in motor control.

BRAIN CYTOPLASMIC 1 RNA: LITTLE GUY WITH A BIG ROLE AS A REPRESSOR OF EPILEPTOGENESIS	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Article							DENDRITIC BC1 RNA; MICE	BC1 Regulation of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Mediated Neuronal Excitability. Zhong J, Chuang SC, Bianchi R, Zhao W, Lee H, Fenton AA, Wong RK, Tiedge H. J Neurosci 2009; 29(32): 9977-9986. Regulatory RNAs have been suggested to contribute to the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. Brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs are regulatory RNAs that control translation initiation. We now report that neuronal BC1 RNA plays an instrumental role in the protein-synthesis-dependent implementation of neuronal excitation-repression equilibria. BC1 repression counter-regulates translational stimulation resulting from synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Absence of BC1 RNA precipitates plasticity dysregulation in the form of neuronal hyperexcitability, elicited by group I mGluR-stimulated translation and signaled through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Dysregulation of group I mGluR function in the absence of BC1 RNA gives rise to abnormal brain function. Cortical EEG recordings from freely moving BC1(-/-) animals show that group I mGluR-mediated oscillations in the gamma frequency range are significantly elevated. When subjected to sensory stimulation, these animals display an acute group I mGluR-dependent propensity for convulsive seizures. Inadequate RNA control in neurons is thus causally linked to heightened group I mGluR-stimulated translation, neuronal hyperexcitability, heightened gamma band oscillations, and epileptogenesis. These data highlight the significance of small RNA control in neuronal plasticity.											10	1	1	0	0	WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC	MALDEN	COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA	1535-7597			EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

The early diagnosis of HSE is crucial because the early introduction of antiviral therapy can significantly decrease mortality and morbidity associated with this disease. This study was carried out to determine the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and the outcome of the children admitted due to a presumptive diagnosis of HSE to Amirkola Children Hospital; a referral hospital in the north of Iran, during 2006-2007. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on patients with diagnosis of HSE in Amirkola Hospital, affiliated to the Babol University of Medial Sciences in the north of Iran. All of the children with a diagnosis of encephalitis were enrolled in this study. After admission, a special investigation including CSF analysis, electroencephalogram (EEG), Computerized tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis for herpes virus DNA was done on CSF sample in all patients. All the patients with a clinical diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis were treated with acyclovir at the time of admission but every patient with a positive PCR was assumed as a definite diagnosis of HSE. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and outcome of patients were collected. At the end of the study, frequency of HSE was reported according to the PCR for HSV DNA among the children admitted due to encephalitis. Results: The mean age of the patients was 5.58 +/- 3.46 years. The most common clinical manifestations were fever (70%), nausea, vomiting (54%) and headache (44%). Seizure was more common among girls, and was significantly more prevalent in younger patients. Abnormal EEG was presents in 42%, abnormal CT-scan in 38% and abnormal MRI in 48% of subjects. PCR was positive in 34% of our patients. All patients were discharged from the hospital after treatment with acyclovir. Conclusion: Herpetic encephalitis should be considered in each patient admitted with sudden change in the level of consciousness in a previously healthy child with fever and antecedent viral infection.

J	Jehi, LE; Silveira, DC; Bingaman, W; Najm, I				Jehi, Lara E.; Silveira, Diosely C.; Bingaman, William; Najm, Imad			Temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failures: predictors of seizure recurrence, yield of reevaluation, and outcome following reoperation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; temporal lobectomy; outcome; reoperation	SELECTIVE AMYGDALOHIPPOCAMPECTOMY; FAILED SURGERY; LOBECTOMY; RESECTION; SCLEROSIS	Object. The authors provide a systematic analysis of electroclinical characteristics in patients with persistent seizures following temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery and identify ideal candidates for reoperation. Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 68 adult patients (mean follow-up 8.7 years) who underwent a video electroencephalography evaluation and high-resolution imaging after failed TLE surgery performed between 1990 and 2004 at The Cleveland Clinic. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of the yield of a repeat evaluation, location of the recurrence focus, and outcome following reoperation. Results. Although a focus of recurrence was identified in 44 patients, only 15 underwent reoperation, and only 6 of these became seizure free. Localized foci of recurrence were successfully identified in patients with early (within 1 postoperative year) and frequent (a 4 per month) recurrent seizures (yield of 100% if both conditions were fulfilled). Predictors of contiguity of the focus of recurrence to the initial surgical bed were variable depending on the type of the initial surgery: patients with baseline contralateral temporal spiking were 6 times (OR 6.34, p < 0.05) more likely to experience seizure recurrence from the contralateral temporal lobe after a "standard" temporal lobectomy, while the need to use subdural electrodes and the timing of recurrence were more significant following limited temporal resections. The focus of recurrence was distant to the original surgical bed when subdural electrodes were used prior to first surgery (OR 28.0, p = 0.01) or when seizures recurred early (within < 6 postoperative months; OR 12.5, p = 0.04). With reoperation, only patients with mesial and basal extension of the temporal resections became seizure free. Interestingly, seizure freedom was achieved with medical therapy alone in 42% of patients with a nonidentifiable recurrence focus as opposed to 4% of those with an unoperated identifiable focus. Conclusions. The timing and frequency of recurrent seizures following unsuccessful TLE surgery provide useful guidelines for the yield of a surgical reevaluation, and potentially for the mechanisms of surgical failure.

The behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of the cognitive strategies behind this issue has been studied by our group. Dichotic tone listening task was given to 26 healthy subjects. The EEG was recorded during the task completion using Scan 4.3 system (Neuroscan, USA) from 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes. Analysis of response patterns revealed that in such tasks effect of cognitive strategy use for response choice could prevail over ear advantage effect, expected by dichotic listening paradigm. Neural correlates of strategy-use in response selection were assessed using classic event-related potentials (ERP) and synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) methods. The major results are the following: 1. ERP latencies in Strategy-users group (SU) are shorter in frontal cortex than in Strategy-Non-Users (SNU), while in parietal cortex reactions in SNU are faster than in SU. 2. Beta-ERD values in frontal and parietal areas demonstrate analogous reciprocal interactions related to strategy use: beta-ERD is stronger in frontal area in SU, while in parietal area it is stronger in SNU. 3. Alpha-ERD was stronger in SU than in SNU over right frontal and left temporo-parietal areas. It could correspond to more active processes of encoding and/or verbalizing of stimuli in former group.

In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the genuine and random synchronization indexes in multivariate neural series, denoted as GSI (genuine synchronization index) and RSI (random synchronization index), by means of a correlation matrix analysis and surrogate technique. The performance of the method is evaluated by using a multi-channel neural mass model (MNMM), including the effects of different coupling coefficients, signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and time-window widths on the estimation of the GSI and RSI. Results show that the GSI and the RSI are superior in description of the synchronization in multivariate neural series compared to the S-estimator. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to analyze a 21-channel scalp electroencephalographic recording of a 35 year-old male who suffers from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The GSI and the RSI at different frequency bands during the epileptic seizure are estimated. The present results could be helpful for us to understand the synchronization mechanism of epileptic seizures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To test this, resting alpha activity (8-12 Hz band of the electroencephalogram) was assessed because numerous studies have now reported it to be enhanced by MP exposure. Forty-one 13-15 year olds, forty-two 19-40 year olds, and twenty 55-70 year olds were tested using a double-blind crossover design, where each participant received Sham, 2G and 3G exposures, separated by at least 4 days. Alpha activity, during exposure relative to baseline, was recorded and compared between conditions. Consistent with previous research, the young adults' alpha was greater in the 2G compared to Sham condition, however, no effect was seen in the adolescent or the elderly groups, and no effect of 3G exposures was found in any group. The results provide further support for an effect of 2G exposures on resting alpha activity in young adults, but fail to support a similar enhancement in adolescents or the elderly, or in any age group as a function of 3G exposure.

Methods: Fifty-four unmedicated adolescent males (12-18 years) with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and matched controls performed an auditory oddball task. Theta activity was sub-averaged, and Fourier Integrals with simultaneous measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA) was used to index response to stimulus novelty and routinization. Results: ADHD participants showed an overall increase in theta activity to both novel and routine stimuli relative to controls. While controls showed increased theta activity in response to novel compared to routine targets across the brain, ADHD participants did not show this novelty-related increase in theta activity in the right anterior/frontal brain. Conclusions: The findings of this study are consistent with disturbances in theta activity and the brain substrates of novelty relative to routinization-related processing in ADHD. Significance: These findings show that there are distinct alterations in theta activity related to stimulus novelty and routinization during an auditory oddball task in ADHD, and they highlight the value of using an event-related approach to elucidate the neural substrates of stimulus processing in ADHD.

Direct electrical stimulation (DES) of cortical regions and axonal tracts in those patients elicits a number of very specific perceptual or behavioral responses, but also abnormal responses due to specific configurations of epileptic networks. Here, we review how anatomo-functional brain connectivity and epilepsy network mechanisms can be assessed from DES responses measured in patients. After a brief summary of mechanisms of action of brain electrical stimulation, we recall the conceptual framework for interpreting DES results in the context of brain connectivity and review how DES can be used for the characterization of functional networks, the identification of the seizure onset zone, the study of brain plasticity mechanisms, and the anticipation of epileptic seizures. This pool of exceptional data may be underexploited by fundamental research on brain connectivity and leaves much to be learned.

A Comparison of Sleeplike Slow Oscillations in the Hippocampus Under Ketamine and Urethane Anesthesia	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; SYNAPTIC EVENTS; K-COMPLEX; MEMORY; RAT; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; ORGANIZATION	Sharma AV, Wolansky T, Dickson CT. A comparison of sleeplike slow oscillations in the hippocampus under ketamine and urethane anesthesia. J Neurophysiol 104: 932-939, 2010. First published June 10, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.01065.2009. During sleep and anesthesia, a slow (<= 1 Hz) synchronized rhythmic fluctuation of the network activity in the neocortex (nCTX) is prominent. This rhythm, called the slow oscillation (SO), corresponds to sequences of neuronal activity and inactivity (UP and DOWN states) in local and extended networks. Recently, this network pattern has also been described in the hippocampus (HPC) and, interestingly, it shows a dynamic correlation with ongoing SO in the nCTX. However, because of its transient nature during both sleep and urethane anesthesia, studying the SO in the HPC is difficult. Ketamine anesthesia is known to induce a uniform and continuous SO state in the nCTX, but its effects on HPC activity and HPC-nCTX interplay are unknown. Using multisite local field potential recordings, we investigated the effects of ketamine anesthesia on HPC activity and its relation to concurrent nCTX activity. We directly compared the spectral content and spatial distribution of laminar potentials and current source density (CSD) under ketamine to urethane anesthesia. Ketamine evoked stable bouts of SO in the HPC that had a peak frequency of 1.77 +/- 0.08 Hz, slightly higher than that of urethane: 1.17 +/- 0.07 Hz. Laminar voltage and CSD profiles of SO were highly correlated across ketamine and urethane anesthesia, although a higher degree of HPC-nCTX coherence at SO frequencies appeared under ketamine as opposed to urethane. In addition, activity in the gamma bandwidth (30-40 Hz) made up 4.7% of the power spectrum under ketamine, but accounted for only 2.0% of the power spectrum in urethane. Although some differences exist, the SO under ketamine anesthesia appears highly similar to that under urethane.

Here, we characterize the role of this signaling pathway in the regulation of sleep using electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings in R(AB) transgenic mice that express a dominant negative form of the regulatory subunit of PKA in neurons within cortex and hippocampus. Previous studies have revealed that these mutant mice have reduced PKA activity that results in the impairment of hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-lasting forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Design: PKA assays, in situ hybridization, immunoblots, and sleep studies were performed in R(AB) transgenic mice and wild-type control mice. Measurements and Results: We have found that R(AB) transgenic mice have reduced PKA activity within cortex and reduced Ser845 phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1. R(AB) transgenic mice exhibit non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep fragmentation and increased amounts of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep relative to wild-type mice. Further, R(AB) transgenic mice have more delta power but less sigma power during NREM sleep relative to wild-type mice. After sleep deprivation, the amounts of NREM and REM sleep were comparable between wild-type and R(AB) transgenic mice. However, the homeostatic rebound of sigma power in R(AB) transgenic mice was reduced. Conclusions: Alterations in cortical synaptic receptors, impairments in sleep continuity, and alterations in sleep oscillations in R(AB) mice imply that PKA is involved not only in synaptic plasticity and memory storage but also in the regulation of sleep/wake states.

Effectively monitoring the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is clinically beneficial to both the patient and the physician. An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based level-of-consciousness monitor can help minimize intraoperative awareness as well as the effects of over-sedation. In this study, we compared the SNAP II (Stryker Instruments, Kalamazoo, MI USA) and BIS VISTA (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA USA) monitors' primary metrics (SI and BIS, respectively) in terms of correlation, agreement and responsiveness to return to preoperative baseline in surgical cases involving general anesthesia. Methods. With institutional approval and written informed consent, 33 patients received general anesthesia with isoflurane while undergoing abdominal surgery. We attached both the SNAP II and BIS VISTA electrodes to each patient. We collected data from each monitor simultaneously and continuously, beginning just prior to induction and ending after extubation. Each monitor's level-of-consciousness index is a unit less metric that ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating full consciousness. We performed a Bland-Altman and parameter difference analyses on the data. We calculated the time it took for each monitor to return to preoperative baseline level following cessation of anesthesia. We established an equivalence between the two indices over their entire range for our particular clinical scenario. Result. The indices were correlated (r = 0.736, P < 0.0001, N = 3,706 data point pairs). There was an overall difference between the two indices (median = 16.0, 25th/75th%ile = 10.0/21.1) with BIS lower than SI. A 40-60 BIS range (the typical target range during general anesthesia) was approximately equivalent to a 54-74 SI range. In all 33 subjects, SI reached baseline before BIS at the end of the case (median = 3.3 min, 25th/75th%ile = 1.6 min/8.2 min versus median = 8.9 min, 25th/75th = 3.7 min/14.5 min, P = 0.0200), even though both metrics were equal at the beginning of the case. Discussion. Although the SI and BIS both can assess a patient's level of consciousness and are correlated, they are not in agreement with each other numerically and therefore are not interchangeable. It is difficult to assess each monitor's true responsiveness to acute changes in consciousness level from our study design. The differences between the metrics we observed in this study are most likely due to differences in signal processing methodologies, EEG frequencies employed and signal filtering utilized in the monitors.

We assessed the efficacy of ICT compared with recommended diagnostic standards. METHODS: We studied patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals (controls) who underwent the ICT at 2 centers (center A: n = 51 patients and 41 controls, center B: n = 24 patients and 14 controls). Subjects were evaluated for MHE by psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES). Patients From center B also were assessed For MHE by critical flicker frequency and spectral electroencephalogram analyses. RESULTS: Patients with cirrhosis had higher ICT lures (23.2 +/- 12.8 vs 12.9 +/- 5.8, respectively, P < .01) and lower ICT target accuracy (0.88 +/- 0.17 vs 0.96 +/- 0.03, respectively, P < .01) compared with controls. However, lures were comparable (25.2 +/- 12.5 vs 21.4 +/- 13.9, respectively, P = .32) among patients with/without altered PHES (center A). There was a reverse, U-shaped relationship between ICT lure and target accuracy; a variable adjusting lures was devised based on target accuracy (weighted lures at center B). This variable differed between patients with and without MHE. The variable weighted lures was then validated from data collected at center A by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis; it discriminated between patients with and without PHES alterations (area under the curve = 0.71 +/- 0.07). However, target accuracy alone was as effective as a stand-alone variable (area under the curve = 0.81 +/- 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The ICT is not useful for the diagnosis of MHE, unless adjusted by target accuracy. Testing inhibition (lures) does not seem to be superior to testing attention (target accuracy) for the detection of MHE.

We compared the two populations on the development of a language acquisition landmark, namely, the ability to distinguish the native language from a rhythmically similar one. This ability is attained 4 months after birth in healthy full-term infants. We measured the induced gamma-band power associated with passive listening to (i) the infants' native language (Spanish), (ii) a rhythmically close language (Italian), and (iii) a rhythmically distant language (Japanese) as a marker of gains in language discrimination. Preterm and full-term infants were matched for neural maturation and duration of exposure to broadcast speech. We found that both full-term and preterm infants only display a response to native speech near 6 months after their term age. Neural maturation seems to constrain advances in speech discrimination at early stages of language acquisition.

In the rat, the hippocampal theta rhythm is a well-studied correlate of memory function. This study sought to investigate disturbances in hippocampal theta rhythm following lateral fluid percussion injury in the rat. A total of 13 control rats and 12 TBI rats were used. Electrodes were implanted in bilateral hippocampi and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while the rats explored a new environment, and also while navigating a modified version of the Barnes maze. Theta power and peak theta frequency were significantly attenuated in the injured animals. Further, injured rats were less likely to develop a spatial strategy for Barnes maze navigation compared to control rats. In conclusion, rats sustaining lateral fluid percussion injury demonstrated deficits in hippocampal theta activity. These deficits may contribute to the underlying memory problems seen in chronic TBI.	[Fedor, Mark; Berman, Robert F.; Muizelaar, J.

Single-Trial Speech Suppression of Auditory Cortex Activity in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; LANGUAGE; FEEDBACK; BAND; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; RECORDINGS; RESPONSES; NEURONS	The human auditory cortex is engaged in monitoring the speech of interlocutors as well as self-generated speech. During vocalization, auditory cortex activity is reported to be suppressed, an effect often attributed to the influence of an efference copy from motor cortex. Single-unit studies in non-human primates have demonstrated a rich dynamic range of single-trial auditory responses to self-speech consisting of suppressed, nonsuppressed and excited auditory neurons. However, human research using noninvasive methods has only reported suppression of averaged auditory cortex responses to self-generated speech. We addressed this discrepancy by recording electrocorticographic activity from neurosurgical subjects performing auditory repetition tasks. We observed that the degree of suppression varied across different regions of auditory cortex, revealing a variety of suppressed and nonsuppressed responses during vocalization. Importantly, single-trial high-gamma power (gamma(High), 70-150 Hz) robustly tracked individual auditory events and exhibited stable responses across trials for suppressed and nonsuppressed regions.

J	Engell, AD; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; McCarthy, Gregory			Selective Attention Modulates Face-Specific Induced Gamma Oscillations Recorded from Ventral Occipitotemporal Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; FIELD POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; NEURONS; RESPONSES; N170; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISSOCIATION; MONKEY	EEG studies from subdural electrodes have demonstrated a face-specific event-related potential (face-N200) recorded from human ventral occipitotemporal cortex. The insensitivity of face-N200 to task manipulations has supported the proposal that face-N200 reflects an initial obligatory response to faces. This result stands in striking contrast to results of neuroimaging studies that have demonstrated strong task sensitivity of the fusiform hemodynamic response evoked by faces, and thus has created a paradox in the face perception literature. We recorded field potentials directly from the cortical surface of 16 patients while they selectively attended to faces or houses. Here we report that face-specific gamma activity recorded at face-N200 sites is strongly modulated by selective attention, while face-N200 is not. Our results reconcile prior electrophysiological and hemodynamic studies of face perception, and suggest that attentional modulation of the face response follows an initial phase that is largely insensitive to attention.

This study explored the clinical significance of the GSI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: Electroencephalograms were recorded from 25 AD patients and 22 age-matched healthy normal controls (NC). GSI values were computed both across the entire frequency band and separately in the delta, theta, alpha, beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma bands. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were used to assess the symptom severity. Results: GSI values in the beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma bands were significantly lower in AD patients than in NC. GSI values in the beta and gamma bands were positively correlated with the MMSE scores in all participants (AD and NC). In AD patients, GSI values were negatively correlated with MMSE scores in the delta bands, but positively correlated in the beta1 and gamma band. Also, GSI values were positively correlated with CDR scores in the delta bands, but negatively correlated in the gamma band. Conclusions: GSI values of mainly high-frequency bands were significantly lower in AD patients than in NC, they were significantly correlated with scores on symptom severity scales. Significance: Our results suggest that GSI values are a useful biological correlate of cognitive decline in AD patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

Latency to first seizure after temporal lobectomy predicts long-term outcome	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Seizure recurrence; Seizure remission	RESECTIVE EPILEPSY SURGERY; LOBE EPILEPSY; FOLLOW-UP; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; FAILED SURGERY; RECURRENCE; EEG; REMISSION	P>Purpose: Temporal lobectomy is a well-established treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, yet many patients experience at least one seizure postoperatively. Little is known about the prognostic significance of the time from surgery to first seizure relapse in predicting long-term outcome. Methods: In a retrospective analysis of patients who reported at least one complex partial seizure (CPS) or generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) after anterior temporal lobectomy (n = 268), we used a nominal response logistic model to predict the odds ratio (OR) of a seizure outcome based on length of the latency period from surgery to first postoperative seizure. A modified Engel outcome class scheme was used. We controlled for factors known to influence postoperative outcome, including history of tonic-clonic seizures, intelligence quotient (IQ), preoperative seizure frequency, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and history of febrile convulsions. Results: In the univariate analysis, the latency from surgery to the first postoperative disabling seizure was significantly associated with long-term outcome. Longer latency was associated with higher odds of being seizure-free or improved (modified Engel's classes 1, 2, and 3) relative to the unimproved state (class 4) (p < 0.001, 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Conversely, a shorter latency increased the likelihood of achieving the worst prognosis (class 4) relative to class 1 (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis yielded similar results. Discussion: Latency to the first postoperative seizure predicts long-term outcome, with short latencies portending poor prognosis and long latencies portending a good prognosis. This information can be used for patient counseling and may influence decisions regarding reoperation.

Previously we found that 8-12-Hz cortical rhythms were phase-locked to inspiration onset during the presentation of odor stimuli; this is referred to as inspiration phase-locked alpha band oscillation (I-alpha). Generators of I-alpha estimated with a dipole fitting model were found in the piriform, the entorhinal cortex (ENT), the amygdala (AMG), the hippocampus (HI) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Such olfactory perception is said to occur via the orthonasal olfaction route. Another route is the retronasal olfaction route. In this study, we investigated the link between respiration phase and retronasal olfactory perception. Electroencephalograph (EEG) and respiratory flows (separately measured with mouth and nose) were simultaneously recorded during stimulation of subjects' tongues with liquids of chocolate, sucrose and water. The percentage of subjects correctly identifying the chocolate taste was higher when subjects were asked to breathe through the nose than when they were breathing through the mouth. In the averaged EEGs triggered by the onset of expiration measured from the flow through the nose, a 8-12-Hz oscillation was observed. Generators of this potential were found in the left ENT, HI, AMG and OFC in the order of milliseconds after expiration onset. Perception of retronasal olfaction is dependent on expiration, and combining retronasal olfactory information with gustatory information and somatosensation enable us to identify flavors when drinking and feeding.

Controlling these stimulus-response (SR) mapping rules relies on a cognitive control network comprising the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Single neurons within the ACC convey information about currently relevant SR mapping rules and signal unexpected action outcomes, which can be used to optimize behavioral choices. However, its functional significance and the mechanistic means of interaction with other nodes of the cognitive control network remain elusive and poorly understood. Here, we report that core aspects of cognitive control are encoded by rhythmic theta-band activity within neuronal circuits in the ACC. Throughout task performance, theta-activity predicted which of two SR mapping rules will be established before processing visual target information. Task-selective theta-activity emerged particularly early during those trials, which required the adjustment of SR rules following an erroneous rule representation in the preceding trial. These findings demonstrate a functional correlation of cognitive control processes and oscillatory theta-band activity in macaque ACC. Moreover, we report that spike output of a subset of cells in ACC is synchronized to predictive theta-activity, suggesting that the theta-cycle could serve as a temporal reference for coordinating local task selective computations across a larger network of frontal areas and the hippocampus to optimize and adjust the processing routes of sensory and motor circuits to achieve efficient sensory-motor control.

Methods: ERPs and theta frequency band oscillation (ERD) were recorded from 15 subjects when they were receiving mismatching/matching feedback information. In addition, subjective sensitivity to the external cues was monitored by BIS (Behavioral Inibition System) and BAS (Behavioral Activation System) measures. Results: One negative ERP deflection of higher amplitude was revealed in response to false feedback, peaking at 210 ms post-stimulus, central-posteriorly localized. A specific cortical network, more central-posteriorly distributed, seems to be implicated. Moreover, theta synchronization was observed in response to false feedback within the posterior cortical site. Conclusions: A direct relationship between ERP/theta band oscillation was supposed, as a marker of salient and unattended cues that produce an alerting response. Moreover, BIS showed an enhanced response to external feedback, and specifically to false feedback, with an increased negative deflection and theta frequency band effect. Significance: ERP negativity may represent a monitoring system, comparable with erroneous feedback effect. Moreover, specific motivation towards negative context was related to higher BIS, since they were more sensitive to negative, false outcome.

The patient performed a speeded go/nogo task and made a substantial number of commission errors (false alarms). As predicted, intracranial Local Field Potentials (iLFPs) in dorsal anterior cingulate indexed the detection of errors, showing an early differential activity around motor execution for false alarms, relative to correct responses (either hits or correct inhibitions). More surprisingly, we found that the left amygdala also participated to error monitoring (although no emotional stimuli were used), but with a very different neurophysiological profile as compared with the dorsal cingulate cortex. Amygdala iLFPs showed a precise and reproducible temporal unfolding, characterized by an early monophasic response for correct hits around motor execution, which was delayed by similar to 300 ms for errors (even though actual RTs were almost identical in these two conditions). Moreover, time-frequency analyses demonstrated a reliable and transient coupling in the theta band around motor execution between these two distant regions. Additional fMRI investigation in the same patient confirmed a differential involvement of the dorsal cingulate cortex vs. amygdala in error monitoring during this go/nogo task. Finally, these intracranial results for the left amygdala were replicated in a second patient with intracranial electrodes in the right amygdala. Altogether, these results suggest that the amygdala may register the motivational significance of motor actions on a trial-by-trial basis, while the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may provide signals concerning failures of cognitive control and behavioral adjustment. More generally, these data shed new light on neural mechanisms underlying self-monitoring by showing that even "simple" motor actions recruit not only executive cognitive processes (in dorsal cingulate) but also affective processes (in amygdala).

Influence of the Working Memory Load on the Spatial Synchronization of Prestimulus Cortical Electrical Activity during Recognition of Facial Expression	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						recognition of facial expression; cognitive set; cortico-hippocampal system; fronto-thalamic system; working memory; selective attention; EEG; spatial synchronization; theta-activity; low-frequency alpha rhythm; high-frequency alpha rhythm	OSCILLATIONS; SET; HIPPOCAMPAL; PERFORMANCE	The effect of increased working memory load (introduction of additional cognitive task into the context) was studied in adult healthy subjects (n = 35, 16 men, 19 women) in experiments with cognitive set. The EEG coherence in the frequency bands theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz), as well as alphal (8-10 Hz) and alpha2 (11-13 Hz) was analyzed and compared to the control data obtained in the experiments without additional memory load. Additional memory load was accompanied by an increase in the rigidity of the set to facial expression and substantial change in the pattern of the spatial synchronization of cortical potentials: coherence of potentials in the theta bands increased between the left and right frontal areas and between the frontal and temporal areas. A hypothesis is suggested that the rigidity of the set to emotionally negative facial expression is associated with the activation of the cortico-hippocampal system, which is justified by a substantial increase in coherence in the theta band in the frontal area known as the key structure in the functioning of cognitive sets. Loading the working memory is associated also with substantial weakening of the spatial synchronization of the low-frequency alpha rhythm, which presumably reflects the increase in the role of the fronto-thalamic system of selective attention in the process of recognition due to redistribution of attention induced by the additional cognitive task included in the context of current activity of a subject.

J	Stratton, P; Wiles, J				Stratton, Peter; Wiles, Janet			Self-sustained non-periodic activity in networks of spiking neurons: The contribution of local and long-range connections and dynamic synapses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; MODEL; SYNCHRONIZATION; NEUROANATOMY; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISM	Cortical dynamics show self-sustained activity which is complex and non-periodic. Assemblies of neurons show transient coupling exhibiting both integration and segregation without entering a seizure state. Models to date have demonstrated these properties but have required external input to maintain activity. Here we propose a spiking network model that incorporates a novel combination of both local and long-range connectivity and dynamic synapses (which we call the LLDS network) and we present explorations of the network's micro and macro behaviour. At the micro level, the LLDS network exhibits self-sustained activity which is complex and non-periodic and shows transient coupling between assemblies in different network regions. At the macro level, the power spectrum of the derived EEG, calculated from the summed membrane potentials, shows a power-law-like distribution similar to that recorded from human EEG. We systematically explored parameter combinations to map the variety of behavioural regimes and found that network connectivity and synaptic mechanisms significantly impact the dynamics. The complex sustained behaviour occupies a transition region in parameter space between two types of non-complex activity state, a synchronised high firing rate regime, resembling seizure, for low connectivity, and repetitive activation of a single network assembly for high connectivity. Networks without synaptic dynamics show only transient complex behaviour. We conclude that local and long-range connectivity and short-term synaptic dynamics are together sufficient to support complex persistent activity. The ability to craft such persistent dynamics in a spiking network model creates new opportunities to study neural processing, learning, injury and disease in nervous systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Stan			Kindled seizure in the prefrontal cortex activated behavioral hyperactivity and increase in accumbens gamma oscillations through the hippocampus	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Prefrontal cortex; Hippocampus; Nucleus accumbens; Behavioral hyperactivity; Gamma waves; Seizures; Kindling	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FREELY MOVING RATS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOSIS; MODEL; BRAIN	In previous studies, we reported that a single afterdischarge (AD) or repeated ADs (kindling) in the hippocampus resulted in schizophrenia-like behaviors such as hyperactivity and loss of sensorimotor gating. Given that medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction is also found in models of schizophrenia, we hypothesized that a single AD in the PFC induces postictal hyperactivity, and PFC kindling results in loss in prepulse inhibition (PPI). An AD was induced by stimulating the PFC with a 5s stimulus train of 60 Hz frequency and 600-800 mu A intensity. An initial AD evoked in the PFC was not accompanied by clear postictal behavioral change. After partial kindling (11 +/- 2 ADs) of the PFC, the PFC-AD propagated into the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens (NAC) and postictal hyperactivity lasted >5 min. The postictal hyperactivity was accompanied by increased gamma EEG oscillations in both PFC and NAC. A single AD in hippocampal CA1 also induced >5 min of postictal hyperactivity and increased gamma oscillations in the NAC and the PFC, with a transient increase in hippocampus-NAC gamma coherence occurring 2-3 min after a hippocampal AD. Electrolytic lesion or inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus abolished the behavioral hyperactivity and the NAC/PFC gamma wave increase induced by a PFC-AD. Kindling of the PFC (21 ADs) but not of the lateral frontal cortex resulted in a deficit of PPI to the acoustic startle response tested 3 days after the last AD. In summary, gamma waves in the NAC were found to accompany postictal hyperactivity induced by an AD in the PFC. Postictal gamma and hyperactivity required an intact hippocampus, perhaps through the hippocampal-NAC pathway. PFC kindling, similar to hippocampal CA1 kindling, resulted in a prolonged deficit in PPI. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ma, Jingyi; Leung, L.

Circadian Control of Mouse Heart Rate and Blood Pressure by the Suprachiasmatic Nuclei: Behavioral Effects Are More Significant than Direct Outputs	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VPAC(2) RECEPTOR; CLOCK GENE; SLEEP; RHYTHMICITY; MICE; VARIABILITY; ONSET; RESPONSIVENESS; ASSOCIATION; HOMEOSTASIS	Background: Diurnal variations in the incidence of events such as heart attack and stroke suggest a role for circadian rhythms in the etiology of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock on cardiovascular function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and locomotor activity (LA) were measured in circadian mutant (Vipr2(-/-)) mice and wild type littermates, using implanted radio-telemetry devices. Sleep and wakefulness were studied in similar mice implanted with electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes. There was less diurnal variation in the frequency and duration of bouts of rest/activity and sleep/wake in Vipr2(-/-) mice than in wild type (WT) and short "ultradian" episodes of arousal were more prominent, especially in constant conditions (DD). Activity was an important determinant of circadian variation in BP and HR in animals of both genotypes; altered timing of episodes of activity and rest (as well as sleep and wakefulness) across the day accounted for most of the difference between Vipr2(-/-) mice and WT. However, there was also a modest circadian rhythm of resting HR and BP that was independent of LA. Conclusions/Significance: If appropriate methods of analysis are used that take into account sleep and locomotor activity level, mice are a good model for understanding the contribution of circadian timing to cardiovascular function. Future studies of the influence of sleep and wakefulness on cardiovascular physiology may help to explain accumulating evidence linking disrupted sleep with cardiovascular disease in man.

The current status of research on the structure of evaluative space	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						Positivity; Negativity; Depression; Ambivalence	EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS SHELL; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; NEURAL RESPONSES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; NEGATIVITY BIAS; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	The structure of evaluative space shapes emotional life and must be capable of an astonishing range of emotional experience and expression. In this article, we outline the current status of research on the Evaluative Space Model (ESM; Cacioppo et al., 1997, 1999), which proposes that behavioral predispositions (e.g., approach, withdrawal) are the ultimate output of the affect system, which is defined by operating characteristics that differ for positivity and negativity, and across levels of the nervous system. First, we summarize the tenets of the model, as well as counterarguments raised by other theorists. To address these counterarguments, we discuss the postulates of affective oscillation and calibration, two features of the affect system proposed to underlie the durability and adaptability of affect. Finally, we consider the implications of disorder in the structure of evaluative space for the comprehension and treatment of depression and anxiety. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Endogenous control of waking brain rhythms induces neuroplasticity in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalogram (EEG); neurofeedback; neuroplasticity; primary motor cortex (M1); transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ALPHA-BAND; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PLASTICITY; NEUROFEEDBACK; INHIBITION; FREQUENCY	This study explores the possibility of noninvasively inducing long-term changes in human corticomotor excitability by means of a brain-computer interface, which enables users to exert internal control over the cortical rhythms recorded from the scalp. We demonstrate that self-regulation of electroencephalogram rhythms in quietly sitting, naive humans significantly affects the subsequent corticomotor response to transcranial magnetic stimulation, producing durable and correlated changes in neurotransmission. Specifically, we show that the intrinsic suppression of alpha cortical rhythms can in itself produce robust increases in corticospinal excitability and decreases in intracortical inhibition of up to 150%, which last for at least 20 min. Our observations may have important implications for therapies of brain disorders associated with abnormal cortical rhythms, and support the use of electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback as a noninvasive tool for establishing a causal link between rhythmic cortical activities and their functions.

Ketamine Modulates Theta and Gamma Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; NMDA RECEPTOR CHANNELS; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VITRO; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; ANIMAL-MODELS; GLUTAMATERGIC MECHANISMS	Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glutamatergic antagonist, has been studied as a model of schizophrenia when applied in subanesthetic doses. In EEG studies, ketamine affects sensory gating and alters the oscillatory characteristics of neuronal signals in a complex manner. We investigated the effects of ketamine on in vivo recordings from the CA3 region of mouse hippocampus referenced to the ipsilateral frontal sinus using a paired-click auditory gating paradigm. One issue of particular interest was elucidating the effect of ketamine on background net-work activity, poststimulus evoked and induced activity. We find that ketamine attenuates the theta frequency band in both background activity and in poststimulus evoked activity. Ketamine also disrupts a late, poststimulus theta power reduction seen in control recordings. In the gamma frequency range, ketamine enhances both background and evoked power, but decreases relative induced power. These findings support a role for NMDA receptors inmediating the balance between theta and gamma responses to sensory stimuli, with possible implications for dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Previous studies have shown that these cortical UP/DOWN states affect the excitability of individual neurons in response to sensory stimuli, indicating that a significant amount of the trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses can be attributed to ongoing fluctuations in network activity However, as intracellular recordings are frequently not available, it is important to be able to estimate their occurrence purely from extracellular data. Here, we combine in vivo whole cell recordings from single neurons with multi-site extracellular microelectrode recordings, to quantify the performance of various approaches to predicting UP/DOWN states from the deep-layer local field potential (LFP).

Pain processing can be separated into two major components: a sensory-discriminative component, which reflects the location and intensity of a painful event, and an affective-motivational component that reflects the unpleasantness of pain. The differentiation between these components and the effects of additional sensory inputs on them becomes apparent if you watch a needle penetrating your skin: On the one hand, it may be somewhat reassuring to know precisely when and where to expect the pinprick, on the other hand, you eye-witness damage inflicted on your body, which can increase personal distress. Here we review recent studies, which demonstrate that a host of variables like onset timing, spatial alignment, semantic meaning, and attention differentially affect how visual inputs influence pain processing. These studies also indicate that there is some truth in the opening statement.

We investigated this problem by analyzing nonlinear dynamics of repetitive movements in 21 control subjects, 33 mild-moderate PD patients, and 18 ET patients. Accelerometer signals were recorded during finger tapping and unbounded forearm movements between two points, and processed with moving average filtering to generate a new signal consisting of the temporal distance between consecutive cycles. We calculated: mean interpeak interval (slowness), interpeak interval variability (irregularity), and beat decay (BD) of the auto mutual information (AMI) value, which estimates signal predictability by measuring the loss of signal information over a timescale. Both PD and ET had longer interpeak interval (except for finger tapping), higher interpeak interval variability, and higher BD-AMI values than controls (P <= 0.007, all comparisons). ET patients had higher BD-AMI values than PD (P = 0.003). BD-AMI was the parameter that discriminated better between subjects (diagnosis accuracies about 80%). No differences existed between PD patients with and without tremor or between PD or ET patients with different disease stages, for any parameter. Evaluation of nonlinear dynamics of oscillatory repetitive movements is a feasible and promising tool for studying movement physiology. Movement performance is more predictable in PD and ET than in controls, even in early disease stages. Slowness and irregularity of movement in PD and ET cannot be fully explained by tremor. Some common pathogenic mechanisms leading to bradykinesia may contribute to this impairment.

These interneurons are critically involved in generating neural activity in the gamma-band (30 - 100 Hz) of the electroencephalogram. One example of such gamma oscillations is the early auditory evoked gamma-band response (GBR). Although auditory processing is obviously disturbed in schizophrenia, there is no direct evidence providing a reduced early auditory evoked GBR so far. We addressed two questions: 1) Is the early auditory evoked GBR decreased regarding power and phase-locking in schizophrenic patients?; and 2) Is this possible decrease a result of reduced activity in the auditory cortex and/or the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which were identified as sources of the GBR previously? Methods: We investigated the early auditory evoked GBR and its sources in the ACC and the auditory cortex in 90 medicated patients with schizophrenia and in age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy control subjects with an auditory reaction task. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed a significant reduction of power and phase-locking of the early auditory evoked GBR. This effect was due to a reduced activity in the auditory cortex and the ACC/medial frontal gyrus region (low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analysis). Conclusions: Generally, these findings are in line with earlier reports on the impaired ability of schizophrenic patients in generating gamma activity. In addition, this is the first study to demonstrate disturbance of gamma activity in auditory processing as assessed by the early auditory GBR power.

Subjects and methods: Fifteen healthy subjects underwent one night of uninterrupted and two sequential nights of experimental sleep fragmentation achieved by auditory and mechanical stimuli. Eight subjects were re-examined using a similar paradigm with three nights of uninterrupted sleep. Sleep was polygraphically recorded and CAP analysis was performed for all recordings. A battery of neurocognitive tests was performed for spatial attention, inhibition of return, mental rotation, and Stroop color word test in the afternoon following the first and third night of sleep under fragmented and non-fragmented conditions. Results: With sleep fragmentation, the percentage of slow-wave sleep was dramatically reduced and there was a twofold increase in total CAP rate across all NREM sleep stages. Moreover, the number of all CAP A subtypes/hour of sleep ( index) was significantly increased. Total CAP rate during the non-fragmented night correlated with reaction times. Similarly, the percentages of A1 and A3 subtypes were negatively and positively correlated with reaction times, respectively. Of the neurocognitive test battery, however, only values obtained from some subtests of the mental rotation test showed a significant improvement after sleep fragmentation, Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that CAP A1 subtypes are associated with higher cognitive functioning, whereas CAP A3 subtypes are associated with lower cognitive functioning in young healthy subjects. The lack of cognitive functioning impairment after sleep fragmentation may be due to persistence and even enhancement of transient slow-wave activity contained in CAP A1 subtypes which also caused a significant enhancement of the EEG power spectrum in the lower frequencies.

Local haemodynamic changes preceding interictal spikes: A simultaneous electrocorticography (ECoG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis in rats	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bicuculline methiodide; Interictal spike; Haemodynamic changes; NIRS; ECoG	TRIGGERED FUNCTIONAL MRI; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; COMBINING EEG; GLIAL-CELLS; MODULATION; DISCHARGES; POTASSIUM; EPILEPSY	The mechanisms that drive neurons to synchronize in epileptic spikes are still subject to debate. In the present study, we used a combination of electrocorticography and near-infrared spectroscopy (ECoG/NIRS) to evaluate haemodynamic changes before, during and after epileptic spikes induced by administration of bicuculline methiodide (BM) onto the sensorimotor cortex in 8 adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Simultaneous ECoG/NIRS signals were recorded during an initial reference period (to measure spontaneous bioelectrical/metabolic activities) and then again 60 min after BM administration. Spikes in the ECoG were detected by an in-house program based on MatLab 7.0. The appearance times of the P1 peaks were used to determine corresponding time periods in the NIRS for further analysis. We observed a pronounced pre-spike modification in the haemodynamics, which became visible latest 5 s before the spike, achieving after some oscillations its minimum at round about the PI appearance time. The post-spike period was characterized by an initial increase in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) and total haemoglobin (HbT) to a maximum at about 2 s after the spike followed by a phase of declining oscillations disappearing after 10 to 15 s after the spike. We discuss the mechanisms underlying the haemodynamic and electrical changes that occur before, during and after epileptiform spikes. The haemodynamic changes observed with NIRS and occurring before the spikes constitute a haemodynamic predictor of electrical synchronization of spikes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Event-related potential (ERP) analysis has also indicated sequential information changes during the calculation process. However, little is known about the dynamic properties of oscillatory networks in this process. In the present study, we applied both ERP and event-related (de-)synchronization (ERS/ERD) analyses to EEG data recorded from normal human subjects performing tasks for sequential visual/auditory mental addition. Results in the study indicate that the late positive components (LPCs) can be decomposed into two separate parts. The earlier element LPC1 (around 360 ms) reflects the computing attribute and is more prominent in calculation tasks. The later element LPC2 (around 590 ms) indicates an effect of number size and appears larger only in a more complex 2-digit addition task. The theta ERS and alpha ERD show modality-independent frontal and parietal differential patterns between the mental addition and control groups, and discrepancies are noted in the beta ERD between the 2-digit and 1-digit mental addition groups. The 2-digit addition (both visual and auditory) results in similar beta ERD patterns to the auditory control, which may indicate a reliance on auditory-related resources in mental arithmetic, especially with increasing task difficulty. These results coincide with the theory of simple calculation relying on the visuospatial process and complex calculation depending on the phonological process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Theta Oscillations Reflect the Dynamics of Interference in Episodic Memory Retrieval	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ITEM STRENGTH; HUMAN-BRAIN; TASK; INHIBITION; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS	Selectively retrieving episodic information from a cue often induces interference from related episodes. To promote successful retrieval of the target episode, such interference is resolved by inhibition, causing retrieval-induced forgetting of the related but irrelevant information. Passively studying the episodic information again (reexposure) does not show this effect. This study examined the hypothesis that brain oscillations in the theta band (5-9 Hz) reflect the dynamics of interference in selective memory retrieval, analyzing EEG data from 24 healthy human subjects (21 women, 3 men). High versus low levels of interference were investigated by comparing the effects of selective retrieval with the effects of reexposure of material, with the former, but not the latter, inducing interference. Moreover, we analyzed repeated cycles of selective retrieval and reexposure, assuming that interference is reduced by inhibition across retrieval cycles, but not across reexposure cycles. We found greater theta band activity in selective retrieval than in reexposure, and a reduction in theta amplitude from the first to the second cycle of retrieval predicting the amount of retrieval-induced forgetting; the sources of theta amplitude reduction across retrieval cycles were located in the anterior cingulate cortex. No difference in theta activity was found across repeated cycles of reexposure. The results suggest that higher levels of interference in episodic memory are indexed by more theta band activity, and that successful interference resolution via inhibition causes a reduction in theta amplitude. Thus, theta band activity can serve as a neural marker of the dynamics of interference in selective episodic retrieval.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Enhances Individual Alpha Activity in Human EEG	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; STATE; NEUROFEEDBACK; EXCITABILITY	Non-invasive electrical stimulation of the human cortex by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been instrumental in a number of important discoveries in the field of human cortical function and has become a well-established method for evaluating brain function in healthy human participants. Recently, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been introduced to directly modulate the ongoing rhythmic brain activity by the application of oscillatory currents on the human scalp. Until now the efficiency of tACS in modulating rhythmic brain activity has been indicated only by inference from perceptual and behavioural consequences of electrical stimulation. No direct electrophysiological evidence of tACS has been reported. We delivered tACS over the occipital cortex of 10 healthy participants to entrain the neuronal oscillatory activity in their individual alpha frequency range and compared results with those from a separate group of participants receiving sham stimulation. The tACS but not the sham stimulation elevated the endogenous alpha power in parieto-central electrodes of the electroencephalogram. Additionally, in a network of spiking neurons, we simulated how tACS can be affected even after the end of stimulation. The results show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) selectively modulates synapses depending on the resonance frequencies of the neural circuits that they belong to. Thus, tACS influences STDP which in turn results in aftereffects upon neural activity. The present findings are the first direct electrophysiological evidence of an interaction of tACS and ongoing oscillatory activity in the human cortex. The data demonstrate the ability of tACS to specifically modulate oscillatory brain activity and show its potential both at fostering knowledge on the functional significance of brain oscillations and for therapeutic application.

Anatomical and neurophysiologic evidence indicates that the rat PPC is part of a network of brain areas involved in directed attention, specifically when new task parameters or conditions are introduced. Here, we test the hypothesis that changes in the local field potential (LFP) of the PPC of rats performing a sustained attention task reflect aspects of detection. Two event-related potentials were observed during detection: the P300 response and the contingent negative variation (CNV). Spectrogram analysis also indicated a detection-specific increase in alpha power in the retention interval of this task. This is consistent with observations from human studies, which indicate that tasks requiring a subject to withhold a response produced a pronounced synchronization of alpha rhythms during the delay, and desynchronization during retrieval. We also found cycles of alpha synchrony and desynchrony in response to a periodic distractor. These cycles were most pronounced in the initial trial block of the distractor when the false alarm rate was highest, and as task performance improved these cycles significantly diminished. This result suggests that alpha cycling in the PPC represent neural activity critical for learning to inhibit distractors. The occurrence of alpha synchronization and desynchronization to attention-demanding stimuli, in addition to the P300 and CNV responses observed during detection, is evidence that rat PPC is involved in sustained attention, particularly in the presence of distractors.

Finding a solution for this problem, the use of a BCI will be open not only for people who have no choice, e. g., persons in a locked-in state, or suffering from a degenerating nerve disease. By reducing the training time to a minimum, also healthy persons will make use of the system, e. g., for using this kind of control for games. For realizing such a control, the post-movement beta rebound occurring after brisk feet movement was used to set up a classifier. This classifier was then used in a cue-based motor imagery system.

This study examined coherence changes during the learning of two tasks, a word association task and a figure association task. Although learning curves were similar for both tasks, distinct patterns of coherence change were observed. Coherence tended to increase as learning progressed in the figure association task. In contrast, coherence tended to decrease in the word association task, especially within hemisphere. Word learning was coupled with negative intrahemispheric and positive interhemispheric performance-coherence relations in the gamma frequency. Unique to the figure learning task was an increase in the number of positive coherence-performance relations in both delta and theta frequencies across blocks. Results are discussed in light of ongoing efforts to identify the mechanisms that coordinate distributed brain activities during the process of learning. Further research is needed to define patterns of coherence change for different tasks, goals, and brain regions.

However, to date studies allowing a functional interpretation of neuroimaging data are still scarce. In the current study we aimed at evaluating the functional involvement of left inferior parietal cortex areas in the implicit retrieval of multiplication fact knowledge in a number bisection task by examining event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the upper alpha band. Upper alpha ERD is generally agreed to be modulated by processes of memory retrieval. It was observed that upper alpha ERD decreased for multiplicative triplets (e.g. 3_6_9) but not for non-multiplicative (e.g. 2_5_8) triplets at left parietal electrodes but increased at left prefrontal electrodes. These results are interpreted to suggest that after multiplicativity has been recognized further magnitude evaluations in the left hemisphere may be abated by prefrontal processes of executive control.

However, certain amnesic drugs, exemplified by propofol or midazolam, produce dense amnesia at low drug concentrations while a person is still awake. This chapter reviews human memory systems, with a focus on episodic memory. This memory system is the one most affected by amnesic drugs. It is also the one most difficult to define and study in animal models. Potential mechanisms by which amnesia is produced in humans are defined in this chapter using propofol as an exemplar drug. Episodic memory is considered in terms of information flow from the outside world into long-term memory. Propofol has little effect on encoding, thus permitting memories to be formed in its presence. However, these memories are quickly forgotten, and electrophysiologic measures (event-related potentials, ERPs) of recognition memory reveal effects of propofol on memory within seconds of encoding. Potential targets for propofol's amnesic actions on the chain of physiologic events activated by learning, termed consolidation, are discussed.

The MEG inverse problem is to quantitatively model the underlying neuronal current sources by estimating their locations and orientations using MEG measurements. Many of the methods involve explicit preferences toward either spatially focal or diffused estimates of neuronal currents. However, considering a scenario that both focal and distributed current sources are simultaneously presented in the measurement, neither focal nor diffused bias is appropriate to reveal the underlying current sources. To address this challenge, we propose the Compressible Estimate (CE) based on the hypothesis that the current sources are sparse after a spatial transformation. CE promotes the compressibility of current sources by minimizing the l(1)-norm of transformed estimated current sources and avoids overly diffused source estimates by minimizing the l(1)-norm of estimated current sources. In this study we select the Laplacian and spherical wavelet as the spatial transformation. As demonstrated by the simulations and in vivo somatosensory and auditory experiments, CE provides the improved accuracy of the source localization involving both spatially focal and diffused neuronal currents.

How to detect and reduce movement artifacts in near-infrared imaging using moving standard deviation and spline interpolation	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						movement artifacts; near-infrared spectroscopy; moving standard deviation; spline-interpolation; signal denoising	LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; SPECTROSCOPY NIRS; TISSUE; BRAIN; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION	Near-infrared imaging (NIRI) is a neuroimaging technique which enables us to non-invasively measure hemodynamic changes in the human brain. Since the technique is very sensitive, the movement of a subject can cause movement artifacts (MAs), which affect the signal quality and results to a high degree. No general method is yet available to reduce these MAs effectively. The aim was to develop a new MA reduction method. A method based on moving standard deviation and spline interpolation was developed. It enables the semi-automatic detection and reduction of MAs in the data. It was validated using simulated and real NIRI signals. The results show that a significant reduction of MAs and an increase in signal quality are achieved. The effectiveness and usability of the method is demonstrated by the improved detection of evoked hemodynamic responses. The present method can not only be used in the postprocessing of NIRI signals but also for other kinds of data containing artifacts, for example ECG or EEG signals.

In the present study we used electrophysiological measures to investigate brain mechanisms of observational learning. Analysis investigated the possible functional coupling between occipital (alpha) and motor (mu) rhythms operating in the 10Hz frequency range for translating "seeing" into "doing". Subjects observed movement sequences consisting of six consecutive left or right hand button presses directed at one of two target-buttons for subsequent imitation. Each movement sequence was presented four times, intervened by short pause intervals for sequence rehearsal. During a control task subjects observed the same movement sequences without a requirement for subsequent reproduction. Although both alpha and mu rhythms desynchronized during the imitation task relative to the control task, modulations in alpha and mu power were found to be largely independent from each other over time, arguing against a functional coupling of alpha and mu generators during observational learning. This independence was furthermore reflected in the absence of coherence between occipital and motor electrodes overlaying alpha and mu generators. Instead, coherence analysis revealed a pair of symmetric fronto-parietal networks, one over the left and one over the right hemisphere, reflecting stronger coherence during observation of movements than during pauses. Individual differences in fronto-parietal coherence were furthermore found to predict imitation accuracy. The properties of these networks, i.e. their fronto-parietal distribution, their ipsilateral organization and their sensitivity to the observation of movements, match closely with the known properties of the mirror neuron system (MNS) as studied in the macaque brain. These results indicate a functional dissociation between higher order areas for observational learning (i.e. parts of the MNS as reflected in 10Hz coherence measures) and peripheral structures (i.e. lateral occipital gyrus for alpha; central sulcus for mu) that provide low-level support for observation and motor imagery of action sequences.

Recent evidence suggests that sleep slow waves may mediate several beneficial effects of sleep on performance, from the prevention of cognitive impairments to memory consolidation. However, slow waves are also triggered by low doses of many anesthetics, but very few reports have examined whether anesthesia-mediated slow waves affect the homeostatic regulation of sleep. Moreover, no study has examined how sleep is affected by higher doses of anesthetics, which lead to a predominantly "isoelectric" EEG tracing without slow waves. Design: We studied in rats whether 1 hour of a dose of isoflurane or desflurane able to induce almost continuous slow waves (ISO-sw, DES-sw), and of a dose of desflurane resulting in a predominantly isoelectric EEG (DES-iso) reduces the sleep pressure caused by 4 h of sleep deprivation. Anesthesia was compared to a mock condition in which rats were only anesthetized for 2-3 min. Setting: Basic sleep research laboratory. Patients or Participants: Male WKY rats (n = 31). Interventions: Total sleep deprivation by exposure to novel objects starting at light onset, followed by one hour of anesthesia or mock anesthesia. Measurements and Results: One hour of anesthesia (sw or iso) did not affect either sleep duration or the overall sleep pattern. Anesthesia with ISO-sw or DES-sw, both associated with the occurrence of almost continuous slow waves, reduced the SWA rebound expected following 4 h of sleep deprivation. One hour of anesthesia with DES-iso, associated with isoelectric EEG and few slow waves, also reduced the SWA rebound after sleep deprivation, and did so to an extent similar to that observed after DES-sw. However, in contrast to DES-sw, SWA after DES-iso remained chronically lower than in baseline, resulting in reduced slow wave energy (SWE, SWA x time) for at least 2 days. Conclusion: The blunted SWA rebound after ISO-sw and DES-sw suggests that anesthesia slow waves may substitute for sleep slow waves. The reduced SWA rebound after DES-iso may reflect a pathological condition that results in a chronic decrease in SWA, or may suggest that anesthesia slow waves are not an absolute requirement to discharge sleep pressure.

Changes in the pattern of neural oscillations have recently been recognized to be largely due to the impact of GABAergic regulation. Inhibitory interneurons are the main players in sculpting neuronal rhythms, controlling spike timing, selecting network assemblies and implementing brain states. A rich diversity of GABAergic interneurons imprints its activity, mediated through a comparably rich diversity of GABA(A) receptors. Pharmacologically, there is a clear division of labor among GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Sedation, a common denominator of GABA(A) receptor-related hypnotics, is mediated via alpha(1)GABA(A) receptors. However, the hypnotic EEG finger print of diazepam is largely linked to alpha(2)GABA(A) receptors, pointing to two distinct receptor systems for sleep regulation. Anxiety is a major impairment of sleep, which can be selectively controlled by alpha(2) GABA(A) receptor modulators. Chronic pain, another frequent sleep impediment can be alleviated by alpha(2)/GABA(A) receptor modulators. Chronic pain, another frequent sleep impediment can be alleviated by alpha(2)/alpha(3)GABA(A) receptor modulators. Finally, cognitive deficits can be pharmacologically addressed by partial inverse agonists of alpha(5)GABA(A) receptors. Thus, in the future, it is conceivable that disease-specific hypnotics could be developed by combining the modulation of suitable GABA(A) receptor subtypes. GABA(B) receptors play a pharmacological role as target of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which is frequently used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Thus, as our understanding of GABAergic deficits in sleep disturbances increases, the strategic targeting of GABA receptor subtypes may represent a new approach for the personalized pharmacological management of sleep disorders.

On the one hand, REM sleep has been associated with the activation of the pons, thalamus, limbic areas, and temporo-occipital cortices, and the deactivation of prefrontal areas, in line with theories of REM sleep generation and dreaming properties. On the other hand, during non-REM (NREM) sleep, decreases in brain activity have been consistently found in the brainstem, thalamus, and in several cortical areas including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), in agreement with a homeostatic need for brain energy recovery. Benefiting from a better temporal resolution, more recent studies have characterized the brain activations related to phasic events within specific sleep stages. In particular, they have demonstrated that NREM sleep oscillations (spindles and slow waves) are indeed associated with increases in brain activity in specific subcortical and cortical areas involved in the generation or modulation of these waves. These data highlight that, even during NREM sleep, brain activity is increased, yet regionally specific and transient. Besides refining the understanding of sleep mechanisms, functional brain imaging has also advanced the description of the functional properties of sleep. For instance, it has been shown that the sleeping brain is still able to process external information and even detect the pertinence of its content. The relationship between sleep and memory has also been refined using neuroimaging, demonstrating post-learning reactivation during sleep, as well as the reorganization of memory representation on the systems level, sometimes with long-lasting effects on subsequent memory performance. Further imaging studies should focus on clarifying the role of specific sleep patterns for the processing of external stimuli, as well as the consolidation of freshly encoded information during sleep.

Investigation of Linear Coupling Between Single-Event Blood Flow Responses and Interictal Discharges in a Model of Experimental Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; EEG-FMRI; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; BOLD; OXYGENATION; PERFUSION	A successful outcome of epilepsy neurosurgery relies on an accurate delineation of the epileptogenic region to be resected. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) would allow doing this noninvasively at high spatial resolution. However, a clear, quantitative description of the relationship between hemodynamic changes and the underlying epileptiform neuronal activity is still missing, thereby preventing the systematic use of fMRI for routine epilepsy surgery planning. To this aim, we used a local epilepsy model to record simultaneously cerebral blood flow (CBF) with laser Doppler (LD) and local field potentials (LFP) in rat frontal cortex. CBF responses to individual interictal-like spikes were large and robust. Their amplitude correlated linearly with spike amplitude. Moreover, the CBF response added linearly in time over a large range of spiking rates. CBF responses could thus be predicted by a linear model of the kind currently used for the interpretation of fMRI data, but including also the spikes' amplitudes as additional information. Predicted and measured CBF responses matched accurately. For high spiking frequencies (above similar to 0.2 Hz), the responses saturated but could eventually recover, indicating the presence of multiple neurovascular coupling mechanisms, which might act at different spatio-temporal scales. Spatially, CBF responses peaked at the center of epileptic activity and displayed a spatial specificity at least as good as the millimeter. These results suggest that simultaneous electroencephalographic and blood flow-based fMRI recordings should be suitable for the noninvasive precise localization of hyperexcitable regions in epileptic patients candidate for neurosurgery.

Methods: A continuous visuomotor tracking task was used to assess visuomotor learning; the underlying neuronal correlates were measured by means of EEG. The massed practice group completed a continuous training of 60 minutes, while the distributed practice group completed four 15 minutes practice blocks separated by rest intervals. Results: While the massed and the distributed practice group did not differ in performance, effects of practice distribution were evident in the regional oscillatory activity. In the course of practice, the massed training group showed a higher task-related theta power and a strong task-related power decrease in the upper alpha frequency over the sensorimotor cortex compared to the distributed practice group. Conclusions: These differences in the regional oscillatory activity indicate a higher cognitive effort and higher attention demands in the massed practice group. The results of this study support the hypothesis, that a distributed practice is superior to a massed practice in visuomotor learning.

One goal was to examine the effect of feedback on the ability of the user to manipulate his mental state of relaxation. This was done by having one condition in which the subject played the game with real feedback, and another with sham feedback. The feedback did not seem to affect the game experience (such as sense of control and tension) or the objective indicators of relaxation, alpha activity and heart rate. The results are discussed with regard to clinical neurofeedback studies. The second goal was to look into possible interactions between the two BCI paradigms used in the game: steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) as an indicator of concentration, and alpha activity as a measure of relaxation. SSVEP stimulation activates the cortex and can thus block the alpha rhythm. Despite this effect, subjects were able to keep their alpha power up, in compliance with the instructed relaxation task. In addition to the main goals, a new SSVEP detection algorithm was developed and evaluated.

J	Ward, LM; MacLean, SE; Kirschner, A				Ward, Lawrence M.; MacLean, Shannon E.; Kirschner, Aaron			Stochastic Resonance Modulates Neural Synchronization within and between Cortical Sources	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BLIND SEPARATION; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; COMPONENTS; MECHANISM; AROUSAL	Neural synchronization is a mechanism whereby functionally specific brain regions establish transient networks for perception, cognition, and action. Direct addition of weak noise (fast random fluctuations) to various neural systems enhances synchronization through the mechanism of stochastic resonance (SR). Moreover, SR also occurs in human perception, cognition, and action. Perception, cognition, and action are closely correlated with, and may depend upon, synchronized oscillations within specialized brain networks. We tested the hypothesis that SR-mediated neural synchronization occurs within and between functionally relevant brain areas and thus could be responsible for behavioral SR. We measured the 40-Hz transient response of the human auditory cortex to brief pure tones. This response arises when the ongoing, random-phase, 40-Hz activity of a group of tuned neurons in the auditory cortex becomes synchronized in response to the onset of an above-threshold sound at its "preferred" frequency. We presented a stream of near-threshold standard sounds in various levels of added broadband noise and measured subjects' 40-Hz response to the standards in a deviant-detection paradigm using high-density EEG. We used independent component analysis and dipole fitting to locate neural sources of the 40-Hz response in bilateral auditory cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex and left superior frontal gyrus. We found that added noise enhanced the 40-Hz response in all these areas. Moreover, added noise also increased the synchronization between these regions in alpha and gamma frequency bands both during and after the 40-Hz response. Our results demonstrate neural SR in several functionally specific brain regions, including areas not traditionally thought to contribute to the auditory 40-Hz transient response. In addition, we demonstrated SR in the synchronization between these brain regions. Thus, both intra-and inter-regional synchronization of neural activity are facilitated by the addition of moderate amounts of random noise. Because the noise levels in the brain fluctuate with arousal system activity, particularly across sleep-wake cycles, optimal neural noise levels, and thus SR, could be involved in optimizing the formation of task-relevant brain networks at several scales under normal conditions.

Recent electrophysiological evidence indicates that the brain systems for visual encoding are especially impaired. However, patients still achieve performance levels clearly above chance, which indicates the existence of residual mechanisms supporting WM encoding. The present study presents evidence that alpha phase locking of the electroencephalogram is a marker for such residual cognitive mechanisms. Methods: Alpha phase locking during encoding into WM was compared between 17 patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 healthy control subjects. Results of phase locking were correlated with accuracy. A median split based on alpha phase locking in patients was used to compare accuracy between control subjects and patients with high and low alpha phase locking. Results: Alpha phase locking increased with WM memory load in both EOS and control subjects, although alpha phase locking was generally reduced in EOS. Furthermore, for EOS, a positive correlation between alpha phase locking and performance was obtained. Additionally, patients exhibiting high phase locking did not differ in performance from control subjects. Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence for a relationship between alpha phase locking and visual WM encoding. This neural mechanism seems to be preserved in some patients with schizophrenia and then allows them to attain normal performance levels.

However, motor associated functional cortical changes mirror the changes of cognitive network in AD patients. The movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) can be used to investigate the cognitive processes prior to voluntary movement. The neuropsychological deficits that implicate disruption of involving frontal motor network in early AD would also cause alterations in all phases of MRCP. The present study aimed to investigate whether such changes occur in MRCPs of AD patients. Methods: MRCP of twenty-three mild probable AD and twenty healthy, education-, gender-and age-matched control subjects were studied. Results: AD patients differed from healthy control subjects on mini mental state examination (MMSE), both verbal and visual memory, verbal fluency, executive function and visuo-spatial test scores. AD patients showed significant changes in both early and late phases of Bereitshaftspotential (BP) than controls. Diminished amplitude and less preparation time for movement in MRCP recordings along with executive dysfunction were found. Conclusion: These findings seem to reflect the disruption of frontal motor network during movement preparation in AD and may correspond to a loss of motor preplanning caused by deranged neuronal input into supplementary motor area (SMA).

Sleep disorders were described as a common feature of adult LS patients, while no data are available in children. Bi-directional interactions between human sleep and the somatotropic system were previously described, mainly between slow wave sleep and the nocturnal GH surge. Aims: To analyze the sleep macro- and microstructure in LS and to evaluate the influence of substitutive insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) therapy on it. Methods: Two young LS females underwent polysomnography; the first study was performed during IGF-1 therapy, the second one after a 3-month wash-out period. Results: In both patients, the sleep macrostructure showed that time in bed, sleep period time, total sleep time, sleep efficiency and rapid eye movement ( REM) percentage were all increased during wash-out. The sleep microstructure ( cyclic alternating pattern: CAP) showed significantly higher EEG slow oscillations (A1%) in NREM sleep, both during IGF-1 therapy and wash-out. Conclusions: Sleep macrostructure in LS children is slightly affected by substitutive IGF-1 therapy. Sleep microstructure shows an increase of A1%, probably related to abnormally high hypothalamic GHRH secretion, due to GH insensitivity. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

High-Frequency Network Activity, Global Increase in Neuronal Activity, and Synchrony Expansion Precede Epileptic Seizures In Vitro	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MAMMALIAN HIPPOCAMPUS INVITRO; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NONSYNAPTIC EPILEPTOGENESIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; AFTER-DISCHARGES; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; OSCILLATIONS; RAT; CALCIUM; SLICE	How seizures start is a major question in epilepsy research. Preictal EEG changes occur in both human patients and animal models, but their underlying mechanisms and relationship with seizure initiation remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the existence, in the hippocampal CA1 region, of a preictal state characterized by the progressive and global increase in neuronal activity associated with a widespread buildup of low-amplitude high-frequency activity (HFA) (> 100 Hz) and reduction in system complexity. HFA is generated by the firing of neurons, mainly pyramidal cells, at much lower frequencies. Individual cycles of HFA are generated by the near-synchronous (within similar to 5 ms) firing of small numbers of pyramidal cells. The presence of HFA in the low-calcium model implicates nonsynaptic synchronization; the presence of very similar HFA in the high-potassium model shows that it does not depend on an absence of synaptic transmission. Immediately before seizure onset, CA1 is in a state of high sensitivity in which weak depolarizing or synchronizing perturbations can trigger seizures. Transition to seizure is characterized by a rapid expansion and fusion of the neuronal populations responsible for HFA, associated with a progressive slowing of HFA, leading to a single, massive, hypersynchronous cluster generating the high-amplitude low-frequency activity of the seizure.

There is no accepted and efficient rehabilitation strategy to reduce focal impairments for patients with chronic stroke who lack residual movements. Methods. A 67-year-old hemiplegic patient with no active finger extension was trained with a brain-computer interface (BCI) combined with a specific daily life-oriented physiotherapy. The BCI used electrical brain activity (EEG) and magnetic brain activity (MEG) to drive an orthosis and a robot affixed to the patient's affected upper extremity, which enabled him to move the paralyzed arm and hand driven by voluntary modulation of m-rhythm activity. In addition, the patient practiced goal-directed physiotherapy training. Over 1 year, he completed 3 training blocks. Arm motor function, gait capacities (using Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Modified Ashworth Scale, 10-m walk speed, and goal attainment score), and brain reorganization (functional MRI, MEG) were repeatedly assessed. Results. The ability of hand and arm movements as well as speed and safety of gait improved significantly (mean 46.6%). Improvement of motor function was associated with increased mu-oscillations in the ipsilesional motor cortex. Conclusion. This proof-of-principle study suggests that the combination of BCI training with goal-directed, active physical therapy may improve the motor abilities of chronic stroke patients despite apparent initial paralysis.

Fluctuation of gamma-band phase synchronization within the auditory cortex in schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Gamma; Auditory evoked response; Steady state response; Synchronization; Complexity	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; COHERENCE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; AMPLITUDE; NEURONS; MODEL; SPECIFICITY; POTENTIALS	Objective: To study the phase stability of the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) in Sz, and in addition, to investigate inter-hemispheric phase synchronization using ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere gamma band ASSRs. Methods: Whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to detect ASSR from both hemispheres in Sz patients and their control counterparts. Source localization, spatial and temporal filtering were performed to infer gamma band activity from the neural generators of the ASSR. The response gamma band phase stability relative to a reference signal was quantified using the phase synchronization index (PSI). Results: Results indicated reduced phase synchronization of the ASSR and the stimulus reference signal in Sz patients compared to control subjects, in addition to reduced inter-hemispheric phase synchronization between contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheric responses in Sz patients. Conclusions: Greater intra and inter hemispheric fluctuations of ASSR gamma band phase synchronization in Sz add to previous studies suggesting timing deficiencies within neural populations, possibly caused by impairments of neural network parameters. Significance: This study provides experimental support that may aid in understanding the dynamics of neural phase synchrony caused by modifications of underlying neurotransmitter systems, as reflected in disease states such as schizophrenia.

It has also been demonstrated that phase of firing, with respect to the theta oscillation that dominates the hippocampal EEG during stereotype learning behaviour, correlates with an animal's spatial location. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the hippocampus operates using a dual (rate and temporal) coding system. To investigate the phenomenon of dual coding in the hippocampus, we examine a spiking recurrent network model with theta coded neural dynamics and an STDP rule that mediates rate-coded Hebbian learning when pre- and post-synaptic firing is stochastic. We demonstrate that this plasticity rule can generate both symmetric and asymmetric connections between neurons that fire at concurrent or successive theta phase, respectively, and subsequently produce both pattern completion and sequence prediction from partial cues. This unifies previously disparate auto- and hetero-associative network models of hippocampal function and provides them with a firmer basis in modern neurobiology. Furthermore, the encoding and reactivation of activity in mutually exciting Hebbian cell assemblies demonstrated here is believed to represent a fundamental mechanism of cognitive processing in the brain.

Alpha band activity is strongly modulated in visual working memory tasks and it has been proposed to subserve resource allocation by disengaging task-irrelevant regions. It remains unknown if alpha band activity plays a similar role during auditory working memory processing. In this study we applied whole-head magnetoencephalography to investigate brain activity in a delayed-match-to-sample task including pure tones, non-harmonic complex tones and harmonic tones. The paradigm included a control condition in which no active auditory maintenance was required. We observed a bilateral increase in 5-12 Hz power during the perception of harmonic and non-harmonic complex tones compared with the control tone. During the maintenance period a left-lateralized increase in 5-12 Hz was found for all stimuli compared with the control condition. Using a beam-forming approach we identified the sources in left temporal regions. Given that functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and lesion studies have identified right hemisphere regions to be engaged in memory of pitch, we propose that the 5-12 Hz activity serves to functionally disengage left temporal regions. Our findings support the notion that alpha activity is a general mechanism for disengaging task-irrelevant regions.	[van Dijk, Hanneke; Nieuwenhuis, Ingrid L.

J	Shin, J				Shin, Jonghan			Passive Rotation-Induced Theta Rhythm and Orientation Homeostasis Response	SYNAPSE			English	Article						atropine sensitive Type 2 theta rhythm; cholinergic; vestibular; spatial disorientation; head direction cell	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEDIAL SEPTUM; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; NOVELTY; RATS; TASK; EEG	Rhythmic oscillatory activities at the theta frequency (3-12 Hz) have long attracted attention, as they have been implicated in diverse brain functions. There are two kinds of hippocampal theta rhythms: Type 1 is an atropine-resistant noncholinergic theta rhythm, and Type 2 is an atropine-sensitive cholinergic theta rhythm. However, it has not yet been determined whether the theta rhythm generated during passive whole-body rotation is of Type 1 or 2. To clarify this issue, we investigated passive whole-body rotation-induced theta rhythm using C57BL/6J normal and atropine-treated mice. The results demonstrated that atropine [50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)], a cholinergic antagonist, abolished the theta rhythm generated during passive whole-body rotation. Therefore, the passive whole-body rotation-induced theta rhythm is an atropine-sensitive Type 2 theta rhythm. In addition, we found that blocking cholinergic receptors using atropine resulted in the loss of the orientation homeostasis response, which is a circling behavior in the direction opposite to that of the rotating circular treadmill that is generated to maintain a constant orientation. These results suggest that atropine-sensitive Type 2 theta rhythm can be generated by a passive rotation-induced vestibular sensory signal and may be necessary for spatial orientation homeostasis response behavior.

Quantitative assessment of somatosensory-evoked potentials after cardiac arrest in rats: Prognostication of functional outcomes	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						cardiac arrest; prognosis; functional outcomes; somatosensory evoked potentials; eectrophysiology; quantitative neural monitoring	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; RESUSCITATIVE HYPOTHERMIA; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; RECOVERY; BRAIN; EEG; INJURY; MODEL; PREDICTION; THALAMUS	Objective: High incidence of poor neurologic sequelae after resuscitation from cardiac arrest underscores the need for objective electrophysiological markers for assessment and prognosis. This study aims to develop a novel marker based on somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). Normal SSEPs involve thalamocortical circuits suggested to play a role in arousal. Due to the vulnerability of these circuits to hypoxic-ischemic insults, we hypothesize that quantitative SSEP markers may indicate future neurologic status. Design: Laboratory investigation. Setting: University Medical School and Animal Research Facility. Subjects: Sixteen adult male Wistar rats. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: SSEPs were recorded during baseline, during the first 4 hrs, and at 24, 48, and 72 hrs postasphyxia from animals subjected to asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest for 7 or 9 mins (n = 8/group). Functional evaluation was performed using the Neurologic Deficit Score (NDS). For quantitative analysis, the phase space representation of the SSEPs-a plot of the signal vs. its slope-was used to compute the phase space area bounded by the waveforms recorded after injury and recovery. Phase space areas during the first 85-190 mins postasphyxia were significantly different between rats with good (72 hr NDS >= 50) and poor (72 hr NDS <50) outcomes (p = .02). Phase space area not only had a high outcome prediction accuracy (80-93%, p < .05) during 85-190 mins postasphyxia but also offered 78% sensitivity to good outcomes without compromising specificity (83-100%). A very early peak of SSEPs that precedes the primary somatosensory response was found to have a modest correlation with the 72 hr NDS subscores for thalamic and brainstem function (p = .066) and not with sensory-motor function (p = .30). Conclusions: Phase space area, a quantitative measure of the entire SSEP morphology, was shown to robustly track neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest. SSEPs are among the most reliable predictors of poor outcome after cardiac arrest; however, phase space area values early after resuscitation can enhance the ability to prognosticate not only poor but also good long-term neurologic outcomes.

However, the interpretation of fMRI images rests on assumptions about the relationship between neuronal firing and hemodynamic response that are not firmly grounded in rigorous theory or experimental evidence. Further, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent effect, which correlates an MRI observable to neuronal firing, evolves over a period that is 2 orders of magnitude longer than the underlying processes that are thought to cause it. Here, we instead demonstrate experiments to directly image oscillating currents by MRI. The approach rests on a resonant interaction between an applied rf field and an oscillating magnetic field in the sample and, as such, permits quantitative, frequency-selective measurements of current density without spatial or temporal cancellation. We apply this method in a current loop phantom, mapping its magnetic field and achieving a detection sensitivity near the threshold required for the detection of neuronal currents. Because the contrast mechanism is under spectroscopic control, we are able to demonstrate how ramped and phase-modulated spin-lock radiation can enhance the sensitivity and robustness of the experiment. We further demonstrate the combination of these methods with remote detection, a technique in which the encoding and detection of an MRI experiment are separated by sample flow or translation. We illustrate that remotely detected MRI permits the measurement of currents in small volumes of flowing water with high sensitivity and spatial resolution.

The role of perioral afferentation in the occurrence of spike-wave discharges in the WAG/Rij model of absence epilepsy	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Cortical focus; WAG/Rij rat strain; Genetic model; Absence epilepsy; Novocain; Nervus trigeminus; Nervus facialis	RETICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEUS; VIBRISSAL INFORMATION; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICAL-NEURONS; GENETIC MODEL; SEIZURES; BASALIS; OSCILLATIONS; MEYNERT; STRAIN	According to the focal cortical theory of absence epilepsy, spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) have a cortical focal origin in the perioral region of the somatosensory cortex in rats. In the present study the role of peripheral afferents of the perioral (snout) region in the occurrence of spontaneous SWDs was investigated in the WAG/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk) rat model of absence epilepsy in order to examine whether an input from peripheral sources is imperative for the occurrence of SWDs. Twelve male WAG/Rij rats were chronically equipped with cortical EEG electrodes. Peripheral afferents of the perioral region of the snout nervus trigeminus were pharmacologically blocked with a local injection of 2% Novocain, a blockade of nervus facialis and saline injections were used as controls. ECoGs were recorded before and after bilateral injection of the drug. Blockade of the n. trigeminus decreased the incidence and duration of SWD, while similar injections with Novocain near the n. facialis had no effect. Injections with saline were also not effective. Our data demonstrate that intact peripheral afferent input may be primarily involved in the initiation of SWDs. It suggests that the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits need the peripheral stimulations from the snout and vibrissae for an initiation of the spontaneous SWDs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dietrich, A; Kanso, R				Dietrich, Arne; Kanso, Riam			A Review of EEG, ERP, and Neuroimaging Studies of Creativity and Insight	PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Review						art; divergent thinking; music; right brain; prefrontal cortex	DIVERGENT-THINKING; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VERBAL CREATIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION; FMRI	Creativity is a cornerstone of what makes us human, yet the neural mechanisms underlying creative thinking are poorly understood. A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight. Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation. These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity. A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance, except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal areas. Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated with specific neurocognitive processes.

GABAergic modulation of the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response in a rat model of schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory steady-state responses; GABA; 40 Hz; neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion; schizophrenia	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; ANIMAL-MODELS; OSCILLATIONS; EXPRESSION; STIMULATION; DYSFUNCTION; DOPAMINE; DISORDER; EEG	Auditory steady-state auditory responses (ASSRs), in which the evoked potential entrains to stimulus frequency and phase, are reduced in magnitude in patients with schizophrenia, particularly at 40 Hz. While the neural mechanisms responsible for ASSR generation and its perturbation in schizophrenia are unknown, it has been hypothesized that the GABA(A) receptor subtype may have an important role. Using an established rat model of schizophrenia, the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) model, 40-Hz ASSRs were elicited from NVHL and sham rats to determine if NVHL rats show deficits comparable to schizophrenia, and to examine the role of GABA(A) receptors in ASSR generation. ASSR parameters were found to be stable across time in both NVHL and sham rats. Manipulation of the GABA(A) receptor by muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist, yielded a strong lesion x drug interaction, with ASSR magnitude and synchronization decreased in NVHL and increased in sham rats. The lesion x muscimol interaction was blocked by a GABA(A) receptor antagonist when given prior to muscimol administration, confirming the observed interaction was GABA(A) mediated. Together, these data suggest an alteration involving GABA(A) receptor function, and hence inhibitory transmission, in the neuronal networks responsible for ASSR generation in NVHL rats. These findings are consistent with prior evidence for alterations in GABA neurotransmitter systems in the NVHL model and suggest the utility of this animal modelling approach for exploring neurobiological mechanisms that generate or modulate ASSRs.

Development of auditory phase-locked activity for music sounds. J Neurophysiol 103: 218-229, 2010. First published October 28, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00402.2009. The auditory cortex undergoes functional and anatomical development that reflects specialization for learned sounds. In humans, auditory maturation is evident in transient auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) elicited by speech or music. However, neural oscillations at specific frequencies are also known to play an important role in perceptual processing. We hypothesized that, if oscillatory activity in different frequency bands reflects different aspects of sound processing, the development of phase-locking to stimulus attributes at these frequencies may have different trajectories. We examined the development of phase-locking of oscillatory responses to music sounds and to pure tones matched to the fundamental frequency of the music sounds. Phase-locking for theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz), lower-to-mid beta (14-25 Hz), and upper-beta and gamma (25-70 Hz) bands strengthened with age. Phase-locking in the upper-beta and gamma range matured later than in lower frequencies and was stronger for music sounds than for pure tones, likely reflecting the maturation of neural networks that code spectral complexity. Phase-locking for theta, alpha, and lower-to-mid beta was sensitive to temporal onset (rise time) sound characteristics. The data were also consistent with phase-locked oscillatory effects of acoustic (spectro-temporal) complexity and timbre familiarity. Future studies are called for to evaluate developmental trajectories for oscillatory activity, using stimuli selected to address hypotheses related to familiarity and spectral and temporal encoding suggested by the current findings.

J	Fisher, SP; Sugden, D				Fisher, Simon P.; Sugden, David			Endogenous Melatonin is Not Obligatory for the Regulation of the Rat Sleep-Wake Cycle	SLEEP			English	Article						Pinealectomy; sleep; rat; radiotelemetry; melatonin	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PINEALECTOMY; RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPUS; EFFICACY; AGONIST; RHYTHMS; DEPRIVATION; TEMPERATURE; CREATININE	Study Objectives: Though melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists are in clinical use and under development for treating insomnia, the role of endogenous melatonin in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle remains uncertain. Some clinical case reports suggest that reduced nocturnal melatonin secretion is linked to sleep disruption, but pineal-gland removal in experimental animals has given variable results. Design: The present study examined the effects of pinealectomy on the diurnal sleep-wake cycle of rats implanted with a radiotransmitter to allow continuous measurement of cortical electroencephalogram, electromyogram, and core temperature (Tc) without restraint in their home cages. Measurements and Results: Tc was slightly (0.2 degrees C) but significantly lower after pineal removal. The total amount and diurnal distribution of locomotor activity, wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were unaltered in pinealectomized rats compared to sham-operated controls. Sleep consolidation measured by determining wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep bout length and frequency was also unchanged. The EEG power spectrum during NREM sleep was unchanged, but a significant decrease in theta power (5-8 Hz) during REM sleep episodes was found. Conclusions: Our data provide no evidence that endogenous circulating melatonin plays a role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle in rats. However, because cortical theta oscillations are generated in the CA1-3 layer of the hippocampus, neurons known to express melatonin receptors, this suggests that a lack of melatonin following pineal removal influences the function of these neurons and is consistent with previous work suggesting that endogenous melatonin is an important regulator of hippocampal physiology.

In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A Strong negative Correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400-450 ms), (ii) beta band (14-30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.

The early damage in anatomical connectivity and progressive loss of synapses that characterize early Alzheimer's disease suggest that MCI could also be a disconnection syndrome. Here, we compare the degree of synchronization of brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography from patients (22) with MCI with that of healthy controls (19) during a memory task. Synchronization Likelihood, an index based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, was used to measure functional connectivity. During the memory task patients showed higher interhemispheric synchronization than healthy controls between left and right -anterior temporo-frontal regions (in all studied frequency bands) and in posterior regions in the gamma band. On the other hand, the connectivity pattern from healthy controls indicated two clusters of higher synchronization, one among left temporal sensors and another one among central channels. Both of them were found in all frequency bands. In the gamma band, controls showed higher Synchronization Likelihood values than MCI patients between central-posterior and frontal-posterior channels and a high synchronization in posterior regions. The inter-hemispheric increased synchronization values could reflect a compensatory mechanism for the lack of efficiency of the memory networks in MCI patients. Therefore, these connectivity profiles support only partially the idea of MCI as a disconnection syndrome, as patients showed increased long distance inter-hemispheric connections but a decrease in antero-posterior functional connectivity.

Frontal theta links prediction errors to behavioral adaptation in reinforcement learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						FRN; Reinforcement learning; Prediction error; Theta; Anterior cingulate	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING	Investigations into action monitoring have consistently detailed a frontocentral voltage deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) following the presentation of negatively valenced feedback, sometimes termed the feed back-related negativity (FRN). The FRN has been proposed to reflect a neural response to prediction errors during reinforcement learning, yet the single-trial relationship between neural activity and the quanta of expectation violation remains untested. Although ERP methods are not well suited to single-trial analyses, the FRN has been associated with theta band oscillatory perturbations in the medial prefrontal cortex. Mediofrontal theta oscillations have been previously associated with expectation violation and behavioral adaptation and are well suited to single-trial analysis. Here, we recorded EEG activity during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task and fit the performance data to an abstract computational model (Q-learning) for calculation of single-trial reward prediction errors. Single-trial theta oscillatory activities following feedback were investigated within the context of expectation (prediction error) and adaptation (subsequent reaction time change). Results indicate that interactive medial and lateral frontal theta activities reflect the degree of negative and positive reward prediction error in the service of behavioral adaptation. These different brain areas use prediction error calculations for different behavioral adaptations, with medial frontal theta reflecting the utilization of prediction errors for reaction time slowing (specifically following errors), but lateral frontal theta reflecting prediction errors leading to working memory-related reaction time speeding for the correct choice.

Solving the MEG inverse problem requires reconstructing the locations and orientations of the underlying neuronal current sources based on the extracranial measurements. Most inverse problem solvers explicitly favor either spatially more focal or diffuse current source patterns. Naturally, in a situation where both focal and spatially extended sources are present, such reconstruction methods may yield inaccurate estimates. To address this problem, we propose a novel ComprEssive Neuromagnetic Tomography (CENT) method based on the assumption that the current sources are compressible. The compressibility is quantified by the joint sparsity of the source representation in the standard source space and in a transformed domain. The purpose of the transformation sparsity constraint is to incorporate local spatial structure adaptively by exploiting the natural redundancy of the source configurations in the transform domain. By combining these complementary constraints of standard and transformed domain sparsity we obtain source estimates, which are not only locally smooth and regular but also form globally separable clusters. In this work, we use the l(1)-norm as a measure of sparsity and convex optimization to yield compressive estimates in a computationally tractable manner. We study the Laplacian matrix (CENTL) and spherical wavelets (CENTW) as alternatives for the transformation in the compression constraint. In addition to the two prior constraints on the sources, we control the discrepancy between the modeled and measured data by restricting the power of residual error below a specified value. The results show that both CENTL and CENTW are capable of producing robust spatially regular source estimates with high computational efficiency. For simulated sources of focal, diffuse, or combined types, the CENT method shows better accuracy on estimating the source locations and spatial extents than the minimum l(1)-norm or minimum l(2)-norm constrained inverse solutions. Different transformations yield different benefits: By utilizing CENT with the Laplacian matrix it is possible to suppress physiologically atypical activations extending across two opposite banks of a deep sulcus. With the spherical wavelet transform CENT can improve the detection of two nearby yet not directly connected sources. As demonstrated by simulations, CENT is capable of reflecting the spatial extent for both focal and spatially extended current sources. The analysis of in vivo MEG data by CENT produces less physiologically inconsistent "clutter" current sources in somatosensory and auditory MEG measurements. Overall, the CENT method is demonstrated to be a promising tool for adaptive modeling of distributed neuronal currents associated with cognitive tasks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AGING EFFECTS ON SELECTIVE ATTENTION-RELATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC PATTERNS DURING FACE ENCODING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual attention; face processing; aging; event-related potentials; N170; alpha activity	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; TOP-DOWN SUPPRESSION; IRRELEVANT INFORMATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN; MEMORY; ERP; PERCEPTION	Previous electrophysiological studies revealed that human faces elicit an early visual event-related potential (ERP) within the occipito-temporal cortex, the N170 component. Although face perception has been proposed to rely on automatic processing, the impact of selective attention on N170 remains controversial both in young and elderly individuals. Using early visual ERP and alpha power analysis, we assessed the influence of aging on selective attention to faces during delayed-recognition tasks for face and letter stimuli, examining 36 elderly and 20 young adults with preserved cognition. Face recognition performance worsened with age. Aging induced a latency delay of the N1 component for faces and letters, as well as of the face N170 component. Contrasting with letters, ignored faces elicited larger N1 and N170 components than attended faces in both age groups. This counterintuitive attention effect on face processing persisted when scenes replaced letters. In contrast with young, elderly subjects failed to suppress irrelevant letters when attending faces. Whereas attended stimuli induced a parietal alpha band desynchronization within 300-1000 ms post-stimulus with bilateral-to-right distribution for faces and left lateralization for letters, ignored and passively viewed stimuli elicited a central alpha synchronization larger on the right hemisphere. Aging delayed the latency of this alpha synchronization for both face and letter stimuli, and reduced its amplitude for ignored letters. These results suggest that due to their social relevance, human faces may cause paradoxical attention effects cm early visual ERP components, but they still undergo classical top down control as a function of endogenous selective attention. Aging does not affect the face bottom up alerting mechanism but reduces the top down suppression of distracting letters, possibly impinging upon face recognition, and more generally delays the top down suppression of task-irrelevant information.

Transformations in oscillatory activity and evoked responses in primary somatosensory cortex in middle age: A combined computational neural modeling and MEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; SCALP TOPOGRAPHY; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EEG; POTENTIALS; BRAIN; ADULTS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; STIMULATION	Oscillatory brain rhythms and evoked responses are widely believed to impact cognition, but relatively little is known about how these measures are affected by healthy aging. The present study used MEG to examine age-related changes in spontaneous oscillations and tactile evoked responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in healthy young (YA) and middle-aged (MA) adults. To make specific predictions about neurophysiological changes that mediate age-related MEG changes, we applied a biophysically realistic model of SI that accurately reproduces SI MEG mu rhythms, containing alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) components, and evoked responses. Analyses of MEG data revealed a significant increase in prestimulus mu power in SI, driven predominately by greater mu-beta dominance, and a larger and delayed M70 peak in the SI evoked response in MA. Previous analysis with our computational model showed that the SI mu rhythm could be reproduced with a stochastic sequence of rhythmic similar to 10 Hz feedforward (FF) input to the granular layers of SI (representative of lemniscal thalamic input) followed nearly simultaneously by similar to 10 Hz feedback (FB) input to the supragranular layers (representative of input from high order cortical or non-specific thalamic sources) (Jones et al., 2009). In the present study, the model further predicted that the rhythmic FF and FB inputs become stronger with age. Further, the FB input is predicted to arrive more synchronously to SI on each cycle of the 10 Hz input in MA. The simulated neurophysiological changes are sufficient to account for the age-related differences in both prestimulus mu rhythms and evoked responses. Thus, the model predicts that a single set of neurophysiological changes intimately links these age-related changes in neural dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such cognitive deficit correlates with neuronal network dysfunction that is reflected as alterations in the electroencephalogram of both Alzheimer patients and transgenic murine models of such disease. Correspondingly, recent studies have demonstrated that chronic exposure to beta AP affects hippocampal oscillatory properties. However, it is still unclear if such neuronal network dysfunction results from a direct action of beta AP on the hippocampal circuit or it is secondary to the chronic presence of the protein in the brain. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of acute exposure to beta AP(25-35) on hippocampal network activity both in vitro and in vivo, as well as on intrinsic and synaptic properties of hippocampal neurons. We found that beta AP(25-35), reversibly, affects spontaneous hippocampal population activity in vitro. Such effect is not produced by the inverse sequence beta AP(35-25) and is reproduced by the full-length peptide beta AP(1-42). Correspondingly beta AP(25-35), but not the inverse sequence beta AP(35-25), reduces theta-like activity recorded from the hippocampus in vivo. The beta AP(25-35)-induced disruption in hippocampal network activity correlates with a reduction in spontaneous neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, as well as with an inhibition in the subthreshold oscillations produced by pyramidal neurons in vitro. Finally, we studied the involvement of Fyn-kinase on the beta AP(25-35)-induced disruption in hippocampal network activity in vitro. Interestingly, we found that such phenomenon is not observed in slices obtained from Fyn-knockout mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that beta AP acutely affects proper hippocampal function through a Fyn-dependent mechanism. We propose that such alteration might be related to the cognitive impairment observed, at least, during the early phases of Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Rectification of the EMG Signal Impairs the Identification of Oscillatory Input to the Muscle	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MOTOR UNIT SYNCHRONIZATION; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTIONS; SURFACE EMG; HUMAN HAND; COHERENCE; FORCE; MYOCLONUS; HZ; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES	Neto OP, Christou EA. Rectification of the EMG signal impairs the identification of oscillatory input to the muscle. J Neurophysiol 103: 1093-1103, 2010. First published December 23, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00792.2009. Rectification of EMG signals is a common processing step used when performing electroencephalographic-electromyographic (EEG-EMG) coherence and EMG-EMG coherence. It is well known, however, that EMG rectification alters the power spectrum of the recorded EMG signal (interference EMG). The purpose of this study was to determine whether rectification of the EMG signal influences the capability of capturing the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillations between two EMG signals. Several EMG signals were reconstructed from experimentally recorded EMG signals from the surface of the first dorsal interosseus muscle and were manipulated to have an oscillatory input or common input (for pairs of reconstructed EMG signals) at various frequency bands (in Hz: 0-12, 12-30, 30-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300, and 300-400), one at a time. The absolute integral and normalized integral of power, peak power, and peak coherence (for pairs of EMG signals) were quantified from each frequency band. The power spectrum of the interference EMG accurately detected the changes to the oscillatory input to the reconstructed EMG signal, whereas the power spectrum of the rectified EMG did not. Similarly, the EMG-EMG coherence between two interference EMG signals accurately detected the common input to the pairs of reconstructed EMG signals, whereas the EMG-EMG coherence between two rectified EMG signals did not. The frequency band from 12 to 30 Hz in the power spectrum of the rectified EMG and the EMG-EMG coherence between two rectified signals was influenced by the input from 100 to 150 Hz but not from the input from 12 to 30 Hz. The study concludes that the power spectrum of the EMG and EMG-EMG coherence should be performed on interference EMG signals and not on rectified EMG signals because rectification impairs the identification of the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillatory input between two EMG signals.

Sleep: Learning and Memory	ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, VOL 3: P-Z			English	Article; Book Chapter							REM-SLEEP; PLASTICITY; ACTIVATION	Dendritic spines - Dendritic spines are contiguous with dendrites and continuously sense the local dendritic membrane potential. Majority of synapses in the central nervous system and almost all excitatory synapses in the hippocampus are at this specialized structure. These spines are small well-circumscribed biochemical compartments that localize proteins and signaling molecules to a specific postsynaptic compartment. Hippocampal theta rhythm - The theta rhythm consists of regular, sinusoidal oscillations of waves in the range of 5-8 Hz that normally appear in the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG). The appearance of the hippocampal theta rhythm in the EEG is one of the most prominent electrophysiological characteristics of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in mammals. Theta rhythm could also occur in the wake state when animals perform ecologically relevant species-specific behaviors. Theta waves are involved in the acquisition and processing of meaningful environmental information. Learning - Learning is an altered behavioral and/or individual neuronal response produced by the individual's experience with a novel environmental stimulus. Normally, to assess learning, participants are exposed to repeated acquisition experiences and progressive changes in performance are observed. This activity provides an acquisition curve - an assessment of learning as a function of acquisition trials and time. Traditionally, measuring behavioral performance has been a gauge of learning. More recently, evaluation of learning has been possible by direct examination of physiological and cellular changes in the brain (neuronal plasticity). The term learning has thus taken on a broader meaning that now includes observed cellular changes that can also be used as indices of learning. Such changes include any number of cellular and/or subcellular neuronal alterations that result in improved performance. Long-term potentiation (LTP) - LTP is an increase in synaptic excitability that persists for hours or more than days after the delivery of a few seconds of brief tetanic stimulus (100-500 Hz) to certain afferent pathways. LTP is now widely accepted as a neuronal model of memory. Memory - In the experimental neuroscience literature, a concept related to learning is memory (the ability of the organism to retain acquired information over a period of time). Learning is believed to include the process of forming memory (memory consolidation). Memory is believed to be a store of acquired information made more or less permanent by plastic changes in the brain's cellular structure at some level. In contrast, the philosopher and psychologist William James believed that there is a fine distinction between learning (explained as habits) and memory. He viewed memory as the conscious recollection of events and facts and this definition of memory still remains popular with many contemporary scientists and philosophers. There are different taxonomies for the classification of human and animal memory types. The most widely accepted taxonomy divides human memories first into declarative and nondeclarative, based on their accessibility to conscious recall, and then into finer and finer subdivisions of these categories. Memory trace - A subset of neuronal elements that exhibit the learning-training-induced plasticity essential for such learned behavior. P-wave generator - The P-wave generator is a collection of glutamatergic cells in the pons. P-wave generating cells discharge high-frequency (>500 Hz) spike bursts (3-5 spikes/burst) in the background of tonically increased firing rates (30-40 Hz) during the transition between nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep. These cells remain silent during wake and NREM sleep. P-wave generating cells project to the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, visual cortex, and many other regions of the brain known to be involved in memory processing. The P-wave in the rat is equivalent to the pontine component of the pontoeniculo-occipital (PGO) waves in other mammals.

J	Szirmai, I				Szirmai, Imre			HOW DOES THE BRAIN CREATE RHYTHMS?	IDEGGYOGYASZATI SZEMLE-CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						neural rhythms; cortico-muscular interaction; finger movements; music	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPINAL-CORD; MOTOR; MOVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; COORDINATION; OSCILLATIONS	Connection was found between rhythmic cortical activity and motor control. The 10 Hz mu-rhythm and the 20-30 Hz bursts represent two functional states of the somatomotor system. A correspondence of the central mu-rhythm of the motor cortex and the physiological hand tremor (8-12 Hz) is presumed. The precise tuning of the motor system can be estimated by the frequency of repetitive finger movements. In complex tapping exercise, the index finger is the most skillful, the 3rd, 4th and 5th fingers keep rhythm with less precision. It was found that the organization of mirror movements depends on the cortical representation of fingers. Mirror finger movements are more regular if the subject begins the motor action with the 5th (small) finger. Concerning cortical regulation of finger movements, it was suggested that there are two time-keeping systems in the brain; one with a sensitivity above and another with a sensitivity below the critical frequency of 3 Hz. The preferred meter which helps to maintain synchronous finger movements is the cadence of 4/4 and 8/8. We observed that the unlearned inward-outward sequential finger movement was equally impaired in nonmusician controls and patients with Parkinson-disease. In movement disorders, the ability of movement and the "clock-mechanism" are equally involved. The polyrhythmic finger movement is not our inborn ability, it has to be learned. The "timer" function, which regulates the rhythmic movement, is presumably localised in the basal ganglia or in the cerebellum. The meter of the music is built on the reciprocal values of 2 raised to the second to fifth power (1/1(2), 1/2(2), 1/2(3), 1/2(4), 1/2(5)). The EEG frequencies that we consider important in the regulation of cons-cious motor actions are approximately in the same domain (4, 8, 16, 32, 64 Hz). During music performance, an important neural process is the coupling of distant brain areas. Concerning melody, the musical taste of Europeans is octave-based. Musical ornaments also follow the rule of the gothic construction, that is: pursuit of harmony towards the single one rising from the unification of 8-4-2 classes. Leibnitz concerned music as the unconscious mathematics of the soul. Movement-initiating effect of music is used in rehabilitation of patients with movement disorders. The meter and rhythm have superiority over the melody. It is possible that rhythmic movements can be generated also in the absence of sensory input and the central oscillators can produce "fictive motor patterns".

J	Vasquez, RMZ; Saracco-Alvarez, RA; Olvera, JG				Zelaya Vasquez, Rina Maria; Saracco-Alvarez, Ricardo A.; Olvera, Jorge Gonzalez			The transcraneal magnetic stimulation for the negative symptoms in schizofrenia: a review	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						Schizophrenia; negative symptoms; transcraneal; magnetic stimulation; prefrontal cortex	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOUBLE-BLIND; DOPAMINE RELEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RTMS; HYPOFRONTALITY; INCREASES; CATATONIA; TMS	Schizophrenia is one of the most studied diseases in psychiatry and different dysfunctions of thinking, emotions, perception, movement, and behavior converge in it. These dysfunctions affect the quality of life of the patients in different ways. It is a disease that has been observed in the whole world, with a 0.5 to 1.5% prevalence among adults. Although the biological basis of schizophrenia is not clear enough, the dopaminergic hypothesis is preponderant in our understanding of the symptoms of the disease. A mesolimbic pathway hyperactivity is related to a positive symptomathology, while a prefrontal dopaminergic hypofunction relates to negative symptoms. It has been observed that using serotoninergic antagonists, which promote dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex, translates in to a reduction of the intensity of negative symptoms. This negative syndrome includes a difficulty to initiate new activities (apathy), speech and creativity impoverishment (alogia), alterations in emotional expression, and a lack of capacity to experiment joy. Patients with negative symptoms present gray and white matter loss in left-sided cerebral structures, including temporal lobe, anterior cingulated, and medial frontal cortex. Such a loss seems to be more evident in prefrontal regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal region, which connects with anterior temporal structures. Persistent negative symptomathology is a concept proposed by Buchanan, which must fulfill the following criteria: symptoms are primary to the disease or secondary but have not responded to current treatment; interfere with the patient's capacity to accomplish normal functioning; persist during periods of clinical stability, and represent an unresolved therapeutic need. They must be measurable by clinical scales and persist, at least, six months. The Food and Drug Administration has recently considered negative symptoms as an investigation target or new treatments due to their prevalence and high negative impact in the life of the schizophrenic population. Nowadays, the current treatments available for such an entity are second generation antipshycotics and glutamatergic agents -such as d-cycloserine and glicine-, amisulpiride and seleginine, even though their efficacy is limited. Dysfunction of the human prefrontal cortex is considered to be implicated in the pathophisiology of negative symptoms. This cerebral region is essential in the regulation of emotions and cognition. Multiple neural networks begin in the prefrontal cortex and go towards other cortical association areas, to insular region, thalamic structures, basal ganglia and limbic system. It regulates dopaminergic mesencephalic activity through activating and inhibitory pathways, allowing a precise regulation of dopaminergic activity. This double modulation model of dopaminergic pathways has been recently sustained by studies which prove that extracellular dopaminergic concentration in nucleus accumbens increases or reduces after a high or low frequency stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, respectively. A prefrontal cortex lesion causes a syndrome similar to the negative symptomathology in schizophrenia. Transcraneal magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be effective in the treatment of negative symptoms by activating the prefrontal cortex, maybe by stimulating the liberation of dopamine in the mesolimbic and mesoestriatal pathways which have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of negative symptoms such as apathy and anhedonia. TMS was introduced in 1985 and since the early 90's its potential as a treatment has been tested in numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions. It is a noninvasive means of stimulating nervous cells in superficial areas of the brain. During a TMS procedure, an electrical current passes through a wire coil placed over the scalp. This induces a magnetic field that can produce a substantive electrical field in the brain. This electrical field produces in turn a depolarization of nervous cells resulting in the stimulation or disruption of brain activity. TMS may be applied as a single stimulus or repeated many times per second (repetitive TMS), with variations in the intensity, site, and orientation of the magnetic field. Most research and interest has focused on the potential application of repetitive TMS (rTMS) in the treatment of depression. In addition, in recent years an increasing number of open and double-blinded studies of rTMS were conducted in patients with schizophrenia. Most investigators have chosen to focus on the treatment of specific refractory symptoms or syndromes within the disorder such as refractory auditory hallucinations or persistent negative symptoms. TMS has become widely used in research, especially as a method to probe normal and abnormal brain function, motor cortical physiology, and cognition. Regarding negative symptoms in schizophrenia, eleven studies using TMS were carried out until 2006, with a total of 172 patients studied. These studies are difficult to compare because they used different stimulation parameters and the symptoms described were heterogenic. Six studies were blind and five were open, using high frequency TMS in all of them (frequencies above 1 Hz), which is the type of stimulation most commonly used in treatment studies. Six of these studies found a reduction in the severity of the symptoms, but the reduction was not significant in two of them. Ten were the maximum number of sessions included in every study, except for one, in which 20 sessions of TMS were given. In this study, the score of negative subscale of the PANSS was reduced in 33%, which is considered a significant response, and this result was sustained within the next month. In one of these studies, researchers compared 3- and 20-Hz stimulation with sham stimulation and stimulation provided at the patient's individual alpha frequency. Alpha-frequency stimulation was calculated as the patient's peak alpha frequency from five frontal EEG leads. Stimulation of alpha frequency resulted in a significantly greater reduction in negative symptoms than the other conditions. This finding could suggest that negative symptoms may specifically relate to alpha EEG oscillations, which is interesting and requires further exploration and confirmation. Another two studies were conducted in 2007; in the first one, no improvement in negative, positive of affective symptoms was found. The second one, which was a double-blinded clinical trial, found a significant reduction in the intensity of negative, positive, and general symptoms with the active TMS. We should remark that TMS produces changes in the cortical activity in ventral and dorsoestratial regions, but other cerebral regions could be stimulated too, since some activation abnormalities in the left globus palidus, bilateral caudate nucleus, prefrontal, and temporal right cortex have been found and are associated with the etiology of the negative syndrome. In addition, it will be interesting to see whether changes in subcortical dopamine release, which were shown with rTMS in normal volunteers, can be demonstrated in clinical populations, such as patients with schizophrenia, and how this may relate to response to treatment. There is still a need for a larger number of controlled studies, with larger samples, longer periods of evaluation, and constant stimulation parameters, so they can be compared between them and the exact efficacy of TMS as a treatment for negative symptoms can be established.
