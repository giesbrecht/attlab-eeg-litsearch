An efficient separation of oscillation from transient signals in EEG is important not only for detection of oscillations, but also for advanced signal processing such as source localization. A major difficulty lies in the fact that filtering transient phenomena can lead to spurious oscillatory activity. Therefore, in the presence of a mixture of transient and oscillatory events, it is not clear to which extent filtering methods are able to separate them efficiently. The objective of this study was to evaluate methods for separating oscillations from transients. We compared three methods: finite impulse response (FIR) filtering, wavelet analysis with stationary wavelet transform (SWT), time-frequency sparse decomposition with Matching Pursuit (MP). We evaluated the quality of reconstruction and the results of automatic detection of oscillations intermingled with transients. The emphasis of our study was on epileptic signals and single channel processing. In both simulations and on real data, FIR performed generally worse than the time-frequency methods. Both SWT and MP showed good results in separation and detection, each method having its advantages and its limitations. The SWT had good results in separation and detection of transients due to the time invariance property, but still did not completely resolve the frequency overlap for the oscillation during the time-frequency thresholding. The MP provides a sparse representation, and gave good results for simulated data. However, in the real data, we observed distortions introduced by the subtractive approach, and departure from dictionary waveforms. Future directions are proposed for overcoming these limitations.

The interactions among neural oscillations are known to be nonlinear and non-stationary. Classical measures for quantifying these interactions only capture the linear relationships, are mostly defined in either the time or frequency domain, and are limited to pairwise relationships. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale multi-information measure to quantify the interdependencies among multiple variables in both time and frequency domains. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is employed to decompose signals into different frequency bands and multi-information is used to quantify the dependencies between these signals across time and frequency. The proposed measure is applied to both simulated data and EEG data to evaluate its effectiveness.

Modeling electroencephalography waveforms with semi-supervised deep belief nets: fast classification and anomaly measurement	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE ONSET; AUTOMATED DETECTION; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; SPIKE DETECTION; CRITICALLY-ILL; EEG PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION; FEATURES	Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) records vast amounts of human complex data yet is still reviewed primarily by human readers. Deep belief nets (DBNs) are a relatively new type of multi-layer neural network commonly tested on two-dimensional image data but are rarely applied to times-series data such as EEG. We apply DBNs in a semi-supervised paradigm to model EEG waveforms for classification and anomaly detection. DBN performance was comparable to standard classifiers on our EEG dataset, and classification time was found to be 1.7-103.7 times faster than the other high-performing classifiers. We demonstrate how the unsupervised step of DBN learning produces an autoencoder that can naturally be used in anomaly measurement. We compare the use of raw, unprocessed data-a rarity in automated physiological waveform analysis-with hand-chosen features and find that raw data produce comparable classification and better anomaly measurement performance. These results indicate that DBNs and raw data inputs may be more effective for online automated EEG waveform recognition than other common techniques.	[Wulsin, D. F.; Gupta, J. R.; Blanco, J.

With flicker frequencies in the region of the individual alpha band frequency, the dynamics of the entrainment process of the alpha oscillation, as well as the dynamics of the accompanying gamma oscillations and the coupling between the oscillations, are investigated by means of an appropriate combination of time-variant analysis methods. The Hilbert and the Gabor transformation reveal time-variant properties (frequency entrainment, phase locking, and n:m synchronization) of the entrainment process in the whole frequency range. Additionally, time-variant partial directed coherence is applied to identify ocular saccadic interferences and to study the directed information transfer between the recording sites of the simultaneously derived MEG/EEG data during the entrainment. The MEG data is the focus of this methodological study as the entrainment effects of the alpha oscillation are stronger in MEG than in the EEG. The occipital brain region (visual cortex) was mainly investigated and the dynamics of the alpha entrainment quantified. It can be shown that at the beginning of this entrainment, a transient, strongly phase-locked "40-Hz" gamma oscillation occurs.

Moreover, theta always modulated gamma activity by phase-amplitude coupling in event-related oscillations. Whether theta modulate gamma by phase-amplitude coupling in pain processing is of interest. In the present study, using EEG of rats after laser nociceptive stimulation, we investigated gamma activity and phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma. It was found that induced gamma power increased starting 200 ms after nociceptive stimulation onset. Moreover, significant coupling between theta phase and gamma amplitude was found over frontal and parietal region after nociceptive stimulation. Our results for the first time suggest that coupling between theta and gamma is involved in nociception processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The subjects were 45 patients, including 32 with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) and 13 with Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS). A total of 136 EEG records were investigated through temporal expansion and filtering of traces and time-frequency spectral analysis. Key Findings: HFOs with frequency of 93.8-152.3 Hz (mean 126.2 +/- 13.6 Hz) in the band of ripples were detected in association with spikes in 97 records (71.3%). Time from last seizure to the EEG recording was significantly shorter in those with spike-related HFOs than in the EEG recordings with spikes without HFOs (p = 0.006). Although time from last seizure reflects age, age at the time of recording was not significantly different between EEG studies with and without HFOs. Peak-power values of the high-frequency spots in time-frequency spectra were significantly negatively correlated with time from last seizure (R-2 = 0.122, p < 0.001) but not with age at the time of recording. Peak frequencies of the high-frequency spectral spots were not significantly correlated with age at the time of recording or with time from last seizure. Significance: The close relationship between the generation of spike-related HFOs and the period of active seizure occurrence indicated that HFOs may tell us more about epileptogenicity in IPE than the spikes themselves. Because there is a spectrum of pediatric epileptic disorders extending from the benign end of BCECTS to the encephalopathic end of epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS), and HFOs that have already been detected in association with CSWS were more prominent than HFOs in IPE, intense spike-related HFOs may indicate poor prognosis.

The proposed system is based on an EEG-based dynamic neuroimaging system, which is capable of monitoring spatiotemporal changes of cortical rhythmic activity at a specific frequency band by conducting real-time cortical source imaging. To verify the implemented system, we performed three test experiments in which we monitored temporal changes in cortical functional connectivity patterns in various frequency bands during structural face processing, finger movements, and working memory task. We also traced the changes in the number of connections between all possible pairs of ROIs whose correlations exceeded a predetermined threshold. The quantitative analysis results were consistent with those of previous off-line studies, thereby demonstrating the possibility of imaging cortical functional connectivity in real-time. We expect our system to be applicable to various potential applications, including real-time diagnosis of psychiatric diseases and EEG neurofeedback.

Thus, a tool to decompose TMS-evoked oscillations in the time-frequency domain on a millisecond timescale and on a broadband frequency range may help to understand information transfer across cortical oscillators. Some recent studies have employed algorithms based on the Wavelet Transform (WT) to study TMS-evoked EEG oscillations in healthy and pathological conditions. However, these Methods do not allow to describe TMS-evoked EEG oscillations with high resolution in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Here, we first develop an algorithm based on Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) to compute statistically significant time-frequency spectra of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations on a single trial basis. Then, we compared the performances of the HHT-based algorithm with the WT-based one by applying both of them to a set of simulated signals. Finally, we applied both algorithms to real TMS-evoked potentials recorded in healthy or schizophrenic subjects. We found that the HHT-based algorithm outperforms the WT-based one in detecting the time onset of TMS-evoked oscillations in the classical EEG bands. These results suggest that the HHT-based algorithm may be used to study the communication between different cortical oscillators on a fine time scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High Frequency Oscillation (> 80 Hz) as Markers of Epileptogenicity	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Review						epilepsy; ripple; fast ripple; high frequency oscillations	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTERICTAL SPIKES; FAST RIPPLES; EEG; SCALP; HIPPOCAMPAL; SURGERY; PREDICTORS	Frequencies above 80 Hz have gained importance in the analysis of EEG over the past few years. Especially in the presurgical evaluation of patients with refractory epilepsy, the analysis of physiological as well as pathological high frequency oscillations (HFO) may lead to improved diagnos tic possibilities. Pathological HFOs recorded for intracranial EEG are distinct from other EEG markers, have been clearly linked to epileptogenicity and may improve the predictability of the postsurgical outcome patients with epilepsy. Moreover most of the analysis can be done from 5 min of interictal intracranial EEG and even intraoperative ECOG recordings. Thus the time needed for an investigation may be reduced in comparison to classical chronic EEG analysis. First studies discuss high frequency fi ndings in the surface EEG which may allow extending the method to patients with less severe epilepsy and long- term studies. This review provides an overview over the knowledge of pathological and physiological HFOs in the fi eld of epilepsy as well as discusses possible future clinical applications and methodological challenges of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity.

Time-Frequency Analysis of EEG Asymmetry Using Bivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Asymmetry ratio; bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD); cognitive task; electroencephalography (EEG); empirical mode decomposition (EMD)	PERFORMANCE	A novel method is introduced to determine asymmetry, the lateralization of brain activity, using extension of the algorithm empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The localized and adaptive nature of EMD make it highly suitable for estimating amplitude information across frequency for nonlinear and nonstationary data. Analysis illustrates how bivariate extension of EMD (BEMD) facilitates enhanced spectrum estimation for multichannel recordings that contain similar signal components, a realistic assumption in electroencephalography (EEG). It is shown how this property can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the marginalized spectrum, critical for the localized calculation of amplitude asymmetry in frequency. Simulations on synthetic data sets and feature estimation for a brain-computer interface (BCI) application are used to validate the proposed asymmetry estimation methodology.

Time-variant analysis of phase couplings and amplitude-frequency dependencies of and between frequency components of EEG burst patterns in full-term newborns	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG burst patterns; Full-term neonates; Oscillatory frequency components; Phase-locking; Synchronization; Quadratic phase coupling; Amplitude-frequency correlations; Oscillator model	TRACE ALTERNANT EEG; CORTICOTHALAMIC SYSTEMS; SUPPRESSION PERIOD; QUIET SLEEP; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; QUANTIFICATION; INTERRELATIONS	Objective: Burst activity of the 'trace alternant' (TA) EEG pattern in the quiet sleep of full-term newborns is investigated to explore the timing and the time-variant coupling characteristics of and between a burst's oscillatory components. The working hypothesis is that signal properties provide information about the neuronal initiation processes of the burst, and about the coupling and interrelation dynamics between cortical low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency spindles in thalamic structures which substantially contribute to the burst pattern. Methods: For time-variant phase-locking index (PLI), phase-synchronization index (PSI), quadratic phase coupling (QPC) measures, and amplitude-frequency dependency analyses the Gabor and the Hilbert transformation, both implemented as fast Fourier transformation-based approaches, were used. Additionally, models of mutually coupled Duffing oscillators were adapted to the burst data derived from the neonates ('measured bursts'), and the corresponding 'modeled burst' simulations were analyzed in comparison to the measured bursts. Results: A strong phase-locking of the high-frequency oscillations and synchronization between low-and high-frequency oscillatory activity at burst onset can be observed. The QPC courses and the amplitude of all oscillations rise slightly before or at the burst onset and reach their maximum within the following 1-3 s after onset. Additionally, correlative envelope-envelope and envelope-frequency couplings within and between the burst oscillations can be demonstrated. All theses time-variant signal properties can be simulated by the model. Conclusions: The amplitude-independent phase measures point to a phase stabilization of high-frequency oscillatory activity which occurs before the initiation of the low-frequency oscillation. This finding points to a trigger process in which the thalamus is initially involved. After burst onset the cortical low-frequency oscillation modulates the high-frequency oscillatory activities, where modulation and additional coupling effects can be explained by three mutually coupled oscillators. Significance: The model-based analysis strategy offers an up-to-date methodological guideline and sets a new standard of analysis for the investigation of EEG patterns and event-related potentials.

Over the years, the main underlying mechanisms have been partially unveiled thanks to standard functional neuroimaging techniques as well as electroencephalography (EEG). However, a complete picture is still lacking to date, due to particularly challenging experimental difficulties arising on top of the inherent complexity of the involved mechanisms. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the EEG dynamics associated to the production of voluntary rhythmic foot movements only. We used an experimental protocol limiting drastically the presence of movement artifacts in the EEG signals compared to real walk on a treadmill. A time-frequency analysis was performed, based on a time-warping method allowing an ensemble averaging of the data of 3 subjects. Characteristic alternation of power increases and decreases in the alpha, beta and gamma bands during the movement cycle is demonstrated as well as the emergence of two different neural coordination schemes related to in-phase and anti-phase foot movements.

While time-frequency analysis is often used in the field, it is not commonly employed in the context of the ill-posed inverse problem that maps the MEG and EEG measurements to the source space in the brain. In this work, we detail how convex structured sparsity can be exploited to achieve a principled and more accurate functional imaging approach. Importantly, time-frequency dictionaries can capture the non-stationary nature of brain signals and state-of-the-art convex optimization procedures based on proximal operators allow the derivation of a fast estimation algorithm. We compare the accuracy of our new method to recently proposed inverse solvers with help of simulations and analysis of real MEG data.

J	Nikulin, VV; Nolte, G; Curio, G				Nikulin, Vadim V.; Nolte, Guido; Curio, Gabriel			A novel method for reliable and fast extraction of neuronal EEG/MEG oscillations on the basis of spatio-spectral decomposition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillations; Synchronization; EEG; MEG; Alpha	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG DATA; SYNCHRONIZATION	Neuronal oscillations have been shown to underlie various cognitive, perceptual and motor functions in the brain. However, studying these oscillations is notoriously difficult with EEG/MEG recordings due to a massive overlap of activity from multiple sources and also due to the strong background noise. Here we present a novel method for the reliable and fast extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel EEG/MEG/LFP recordings. The method is based on a linear decomposition of recordings: it maximizes the signal power at a peak frequency while simultaneously minimizing it at the neighboring, surrounding frequency bins. Such procedure leads to the optimization of signal-to-noise ratio and allows extraction of components with a characteristic "peaky" spectral profile, which is typical for oscillatory processes. We refer to this method as spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD). Our simulations demonstrate that the method allows extraction of oscillatory signals even with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 1:10. The SSD also outperformed conventional approaches based on independent component analysis. Using real EEG data we also show that SSD allows extraction of neuronal oscillations (e.g., in alpha frequency range) with high signal-to-noise ratio and with the spatial patterns corresponding to central and occipito-parietal sources. Importantly, running time for SSD is only a few milliseconds, which clearly distinguishes it from other extraction techniques usually requiring minutes or even hours of computational time. Due to the high accuracy and speed, we suggest that SSD can be used as a reliable method for the extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel electrophysiological recordings.

Indexing the graded allocation of visuospatial attention using anticipatory alpha oscillations. J Neurophysiol 105: 1318-1326, 2011. First published January 12, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00653.2010.-Lateralization in the desynchronization of anticipatory occipitoparietal alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations has been implicated in the allocation of selective visuospatial attention. Previous studies have demonstrated that small changes in the lateralization of alpha-band activity are predictive of behavioral performance but have not directly investigated how flexibly alpha lateralization is linked to top-down attentional goals. To address this question, we presented participants with cues providing varying degrees of spatial certainty about the location at which a target would appear. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data demonstrated that manipulating spatial certainty led to graded changes in the extent to which alpha oscillations were lateralized over the occipitoparietal cortex during the cue-target interval. We found that individual differences in alpha desynchronization contralateral to attention predicted reaction times, event-related potential measures of perceptual processing of targets, and beta-band (15-25 Hz) activity typically associated with response preparation. These results support the hypothesis that anticipatory alpha modulation is a plausible neural mechanism underlying the allocation of visuospatial attention and is under flexible top-down control.

In particular, the field of brain signal analysis has witnessed a strong trend towards multidimensional analysis of large data sets, for example, single-trial time-frequency analysis of high spatiotemporal resolution recordings. Here, we describe the freely available ELAN software package which provides a wide range of signal analysis tools for electrophysiological data including scalp electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), intracranial EEG, and local field potentials (LFPs). The ELAN toolbox is based on 25 years of methodological developments at the Brain Dynamics and Cognition Laboratory in Lyon and was used in many papers including the very first studies of time-frequency analysis of EEG data exploring evoked and induced oscillatory activities in humans. This paper provides an overview of the concepts and functionalities of ELAN, highlights its specificities, and describes its complementarity and interoperability with other toolboxes.

Much of research on alpha oscillations in human EEG has focused on pen-stimulus amplitude dynamics, which phenomenologically support an idea of alpha oscillations being negatively correlated with local cortical excitability and having a role in the suppression of task-irrelevant neuronal processing. This kind of an inhibitory role for alpha oscillations is also supported by several functional magnetic resonance imaging and trans-cranial magnetic stimulation studies. Nevertheless, investigations of local and inter-areal alpha phase dynamics suggest that the alpha frequency band rhythmicity may play a role also in active task-relevant neuronal processing. These data imply that inter-areal alpha phase synchronization could support attentional, executive, and contextual functions. In this review, we outline evidence supporting different views on the roles of alpha oscillations in cortical networks and unresolved issues that should be addressed to resolve or reconcile these apparently contrasting hypotheses.

Usually Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used for different frequency domain measures and Digital Filtering (FIR or IIR) for time domain measurement. Here we demonstrate potential usefulness of using modified inverse DFT as a step for time domain feature calculation. Analytical formulas are shown for calculating interpolation, velocity and acceleration of filtered signals. Preliminary examples of electro-oculography (EOG) signal analysis during sleep are presented. Although same results could be obtained with conventional filtering followed by numerical differentiation the presented could be useful in some cases.

Specifically, EEG signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands, and the most relevant of them are employed for the detection of epilepsy seizures. Since the computation of oscillation modes is carried out based on Time-Variant Autoregressive model parameters, both approaches for searching an optimal order are studied: estimation over the entire database, and over each database recording. The feature set appraises parametric power spectral density in each frequency band of the Time-Variant Autoregressive models. Developed dimension reduction approach of high dimensional spectral space that is based on principal component analysis searches for frequency bands holding the higher values of relevance, in terms of performed accuracy of detection. Attained outcomes for k-nn classifier over 29 epilepsy patients reach a performed accuracy as high as 95% As a result, the proposed methodology provides a higher performance when is used a optimal order for each signal. The advantage of the proposed methodology is the interpretations that may lead to the data, since each oscillation mode can be associated with one of the eeg rhythms.

The aim of this study is to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) -based brain dynamics in response to driving distraction. To study human cognition under specific driving tasks in a simulated driving experiment, this study utilized two simulated events including unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions. The raw data were first separated into independent brain sources by Independent Component Analysis. Then, the EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the time-frequency brain dynamics. Results showed that increases of theta band and beta band power were observed in the frontal cortex. Further analysis demonstrated that reaction time and multiple cortical EEG power had high correlation. Thus, this study suggested that the features extracted by EEG signal processing, which were the theta power increases in frontal area, could be used as the distracted indexes for early detection of driver inattention in real driving.

Unraveling superimposed EEG rhythms with multi-dimensional decomposition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; MEG; MDD; PARAFAC; Coherence; Alpha rhythm	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TRAVELING ALPHA-WAVES; SUBJECTIVE PREFERENCE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; MULTIWAY ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS	Scalp-recorded EEG activity reflects a number of oscillatory phenomena, many of which are generated by coupled brain sources or behave as travelling waves. Decomposition of EEG oscillations into sets of coherent processes may help investigation of the underlying functional brain networks. Traditional decomposition methods, such as ICA and PCA, cannot satisfactorily characterize coherent EEG oscillations. Moreover, these methods impose non-physiological constraints (orthogonality, maximal time independence) on the solutions. We introduce the (CR)-R-3-MDD method, that is based on recursive multi-dimensional decomposition (R-MOD). The method allows separation of ongoing EEG into a pre-defined number of coherent oscillatory processes. Applied to a multichannel complex cross-correlation array (C-3), the method extracts oscillatory processes characterized by a dominant frequency, spatial amplitude-phase distribution, and stability in time. Introduction of an additional dimension of experimental conditions allows characterization of condition-related dynamics of the processes. In this study, we first used (CR)-R-3-MDD to decompose a simulated signal created by superposition of components with known properties. Meaningful solutions were obtained even with a suboptimal number of components in the model. Second, we applied the method to decompose rhythmic processes in ongoing low- and high-frequency EEG records of two subjects and demonstrated good reproducibility of the components obtained with different solutions, two halves of the EEG record, and different experimental sessions. The (CR)-R-3-MDD method is compared with other types of signal decomposition: real-numbers ICA and real-numbers MDD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of intravenous sodium salicylate administration prior to castration on plasma cortisol and electroencephalography parameters in calves	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							LOCAL-ANESTHESIA; RETICULAR STIMULATION; POWER SPECTRUM; BRAIN MEASURES; EEG CHANGES; RESPONSES; PAIN; FREQUENCY; HORSES; GROWTH	Nociception is an unavoidable consequence of many routine management procedures such as castration in cattle. This study investigated electroencephalography (EEG) parameters and cortisol levels in calves receiving intravenous sodium salicylate in response to a castration model. Twelve Holstein calves were randomly assigned to the following groups: (i) castrated, untreated controls, (ii) 50 mg/kg sodium salicylate IV precastration, were blood sampled at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 360, and 480 min postcastration. The EEG recording included baseline, castration, immediate recovery (0-5 min after castration), middle recovery (5-10 min after castration), and late recovery (1020 min after castration). Samples were analyzed by competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay and fluorescence polarization immunoassay for cortisol and salicylate, respectively. EEG visual inspection and spectral analysis were performed. Statistical analyses included ANOVA repeated measures and correlations between response variable. No treatment effect was noted between the two groups for cortisol and EEG measurements, namely an attenuation of acute cortisol response and EEG desynchronization in sodium salicylate group. Time effects were noted for EEG measurements, cortisol and salicylates levels. Significant correlations between cortisol and EEG parameters were noted. These findings have implications for designing effective analgesic regimens, and they suggest that EEG can be useful to monitor pain attributable to castration.	[Bergamasco, L.; Coetzee, J.

A better oscillation detection method robustly extracts EEG rhythms across brain state changes: The human alpha rhythm as a test case	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Alpha; Brain rhythm; Human; Oscillation	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MEMORY TASK; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Oscillatory activity is a principal mode of operation in the brain. Despite an intense resurgence of interest in the mechanisms and functions of brain rhythms, methods for the detection and analysis of oscillatory activity in neurophysiological recordings are still highly variable across studies. We recently proposed a method for detecting oscillatory activity from time series data, which we call the BOSC (Better OSCillation detection) method. This method produces systematic, objective, and consistent results across frequencies, brain regions and tasks. It does so by modeling the functional form of the background spectrum by fitting the empirically observed spectrum at the recording site. This minimizes bias in oscillation detection across frequency, region and task. Here we show that the method is also robust to dramatic changes in state that are known to influence the shape of the power spectrum, namely, the presence versus absence of the alpha rhythm, and can be applied to independent components, which are thought to reflect underlying sources, in addition to individual raw signals. This suggests that the BOSC method is an effective tool for measuring changes in rhythmic activity in the more common research scenario wherein state is unknown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The hierarchical coupling of slow and fast oscillations is crucial for the rehearsal of sensory inputs for short-term storage, as well as for binding sensory inputs that are represented in spatially segregated cortical areas. However, no experimental evidence for the binding of spatially segregated information has yet been presented for memory maintenance in humans. In the present study, we actively manipulated memory maintenance performance with an attentional blink procedure during human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and identified that slow oscillations are enhanced when memory maintenance is successful. These slow oscillations accompanied fast oscillations in the gamma frequency range that appeared at spatially segregated scalp sites. The amplitude of the gamma oscillation at these scalp sites was simultaneously enhanced at an EEG phase of the slow oscillation. Successful memory maintenance appears to be achieved by a rehearsal of sensory inputs together with a coordination of distributed fast oscillations at a preferred timing of the slow oscillations.

The reproducible pattern of the frequency characteristics of SSVEPs shows a global amplitude maximum around 10 Hz and additional local maxima around 20 and 40 Hz, which have been argued to represent resonant behavior of damped neuronal oscillators. Simultaneous electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) measurement allows testing of the resonance hypothesis about the frequency-selective increases in SSVEP amplitudes in human subjects, because the total synaptic activity that is represented in the fMRI-Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (fMRI-BOLD) response would not increase but get synchronized at the resonance frequency. For this purpose, 40 healthy volunteers were visually stimulated with flickering light at systematically varying frequencies between 6 and 46 Hz, and the correlations between SSVEP amplitudes and the BOLD responses were computed. The SSVEP frequency characteristics of all subjects showed 3 frequency ranges with an amplitude maximum in each of them, which roughly correspond to alpha, beta and gamma bands of the EEG. The correlation maps between BOLD responses and SSVEP amplitude changes across the different stimulation frequencies within each frequency band showed no significant correlation in the alpha range, while significant correlations were obtained in the primary visual area for the beta and gamma bands. This non-linear relationship between the surface recorded SSVEP amplitudes and the BOLD responses of the visual cortex at stimulation frequencies around the alpha band supports the view that a resonance at the tuning frequency of the thalamo-cortical alpha oscillator in the visual system is responsible for the global amplitude maximum of the SSVEP around 10 Hz. Information gained from the SSVEP/fMRI analyses in the present study might be extrapolated to the EEG/fMRI analysis of the transient event-related potentials (ERPs) in terms of expecting more reliable and consistent correlations between EEG and fMRI responses, when the analyses are carried out on evoked or induced oscillations (spectral perturbations) in separate frequency bands instead of the time-domain ERP peaks.

Five persons with temporal lobe epilepsy who were candidates for surgery had diagonal depth electrodes implanted in the basal ganglia: four of them in the putamen, and one in the pallidum and caudate. Time-frequency and power spectral analyses were used to analyze the EEG. Significant frequency components of 2-10 Hz were consistently observed in the basal ganglia. The frequency of this component slowed during seizures. There was a significant ictal increase in power spectral density in all frequency ranges. The changes in the basal ganglia were consistent while seizure activity spread over the cortex, and partially persisted after the clinical seizure ended. They were inconsistent in the period after seizure onset. Seizures originating in the mesiotemporal structures can affect physiological rhythms in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia did not generate epileptiform EEG activity. An inhibitory role for the basal ganglia during temporal lobe seizures is suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, its ability to localize seizure onset zones (SOZ) has been significantly restricted by its low spatial resolution and indirect correlation with underlying brain activities. Here we report a novel non-invasive dynamic seizure imaging (DSI) approach based upon high-density EEG recordings. This novel approach was particularly designed to image the dynamic changes of ictal rhythmic discharges that evolve through time, space and frequency. This method was evaluated in a group of 8 epilepsy patients and results were rigorously validated using intracranial EEG (iEEG) (n=3) and surgical outcome (n=7). The DSI localized the ictal activity in concordance with surgically resected zones and ictal iEEG recordings in the cohort of patients. The present promising results support the ability to precisely and accurately image dynamic seizure activity from non-invasive measurements. The successful establishment of such a non-invasive seizure imaging modality for surgical evaluation will have a significant impact in the management of medically intractable epilepsy.

The key feature of epilepsy is the apparently unexpected occurrence of seizures, accompanied by typical high-amplitude synchronised oscillations recorded with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), or occasionally with intracranial EEG in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A wide variety of theoretical and computational models of epilepsy has provided some insights into how seizures might emerge. However, these models have mostly been based on classical EEG phenomena and experimental animal models, and may not capture all the relevant features of human epilepsy. In particular, evidence has accumulated showing that very localised high-frequency oscillations may be characteristic of seizure onsets, and that seizure susceptibility fluctuates at long timescales of hours or days. These aspects are discussed from a cross-disciplinary perspective, with the aim that future collaborations between theoreticians, experimentalists and clinicians may greatly improve seizure models and the future treatment of this devastating disorder.

Time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation to assist delineation of epileptogenic cortex	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; electrocorticography; single pulse electrical stimulation; high-frequency oscillations; time-frequency analysis	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HZ; IDENTIFICATION; SURGERY; BRAIN	Epilepsy surgery depends on reliable pre-surgical markers of epileptogenic tissue. The current gold standard is the seizure onset zone in ictal, i.e. chronic, electrocorticography recordings. Single pulse electrical stimulation can evoke epileptic, spike-like responses in areas of seizure onset also recorded by electrocorticography. Recently, spontaneous pathological high-frequency oscillations (80-520 Hz) have been observed in the electrocorticogram that are related to epileptic spikes, but seem more specific for epileptogenic cortex. We wanted to see whether a quantitative electroencephalography analysis using time-frequency information including the higher frequency range could be applied to evoked responses by single pulse electrical stimulation, to enhance its specificity and clinical use. Electrocorticography data were recorded at a 2048-Hz sampling rate from 13 patients. Single pulse electrical stimulation (10 stimuli, 1 ms, 8 mA, 0.2 Hz) was performed stimulating pairs of adjacent electrodes. A time-frequency analysis based on Morlet wavelet transformation was performed in a [-1 s : 1 s] time interval around the stimulus and a frequency range of 10-520 Hz. Significant (P = 0.05) changes in power spectra averaged for 10 epochs were computed, resulting in event-related spectral perturbation images. In these images, time-frequency analysis of single pulse-evoked responses, in the range of 10-80 Hz for spikes, 80-250 Hz for ripples and 250-520 Hz for fast ripples, were scored by two observers independently. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of time-frequency single pulse-evoked responses in the three frequency ranges were compared with seizure onset zone and post-surgical outcome. In all patients, evoked responses included spikes, ripples and fast ripples. For the seizure onset zone, the median sensitivity of time-frequency single pulse-evoked responses decreased from 100% for spikes to 67% for fast ripples and the median specificity increased from 17% for spikes to 79% for fast ripples. A median positive predictive value for the evoked responses in the seizure onset zone of 17% was found for spikes, 26% for ripples and 37% for fast ripples. Five out of seven patients with < 50% of fast ripples removed by resection had a poor outcome. A wavelet transform-based time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation reveals evoked responses in the frequency range of spikes, ripples and fast ripples. We demonstrate that time-frequency analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation can assist in delineation of the epileptogenic cortex using time-frequency single pulse-evoked fast ripples as a potential new marker.

It provides a good visual way to separate the frequency contents of a multi-component signal, and display the changes of these components with respect to time. This paper outlines investigative work on neonatal EEG signals using time-frequency analysis. The Cohen's class distributions are discussed, and kernel optimisation for the Cohen's class distributions is outlined. Segments of EEG with different background continuity states are analysed using a Cohen's class distribution, and their characteristics are discussed.

Features in the time domain are extracted using the cross correlation (CC) method. Features related to the frequency domain are extracted by calculating the power spectral density (PSD). In the study, these individual time and frequency features are considered to carry complementary information about the nature of the EEG itself. By using divergence analysis, distributions of the feature vectors in the feature space are quantitatively measured. As a result, using the combination rather than individual feature vectors is suggested for classification. In order to show the efficiency of this approach, first of all, the classification performances of the time and frequency based feature vectors in terms of overall accuracy are analyzed individually. Afterwards, the feature vectors obtained by the combination of the individual feature vectors are used in classification. The results achieved by different classifier structures are given. Obtained performances in the study are comparatively evaluated by the help of the other studies for the same dataset in advance. Results show that the combination of the features derived from cross correlation and PSD is very promising in discriminating between epileptic and healthy EEG segments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamics of directed interactions between brain regions during interburst-burst EEG patterns in quiet sleep of full-term neonates	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						EEG burst pattern; Directed interactions; Phase-locking; Quiet sleep; Full-term neonates	COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; COUPLINGS; NEWBORNS; SYSTEMS	The study investigates time-variant directed interactions between brain regions during the interburst-burst EEG pattern (trace alternant) characteristic of quiet sleep in healthy neonates. The transition from interburst to burst is of particular interest as the generation of the EEG characteristics at burst onset reflects timing and time-variant interplay between the cortical and the thalamo-cortical brain structures. To study the dynamics of the interactions, time-variant partial directed coherence (PDC), a measure of effective connectivity, was used which allows analysis in the time-frequency range. The main results of the grand mean PDC analysis are: (1) PDC time-frequency patterns are frequently associated with phase-locked oscillations. (2) Interhemispheric interactions are dominant between frontal, central and occipital electrodes and intrahemispheric interactions are much less substantial. (3) An interaction breakdown for the frequency ranges 1-4 Hz (Fp(1) double right arrow Fp(2)) and 0.5-3 Hz (Fp(2) double right arrow Fp(1)) exists which lasts about 2.5 s and which is located at about burst onset. (4) Strong interactions in the high-frequency range 3.5-4.5 Hz between the frontal electrodes can be observed for both directions at the burst onset. It can be concluded that the evolution of strong interactions in the high-frequency range, which starts shortly before or at the burst onset from frontal regions to anteroposterior directions as well as the frontal interhemispheric interactions, are associated with the burst onset generation. Additionally, the collapsing of the interactions before burst onset and after the burst are indicative of neuronal reorganisation processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we statistically evaluated whole-brain connectivity using the measurement of linear correlation coefficients (CCs) between EEG channel pairs instead of using conventional spectral analysis. We showed distinct patterns of temporal variations of CCs of all channel pairs and significant channel connections for four motor imageries, including left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue, in two subjects. Contralateral connectivity was observed in the motor imagery of left and right hands, whereas central connectivity was observed in the motor imagery of both feet. Our results suggest to the implementation of the state-of-the-art BCIs based on whole-brain channel connectivity in motor imagery.

This paper presents the results of comparative analysis of qEEG variables as reliable markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared the sensitivity and specificity between spectral analysis (spectA) and coherence (Coh) within the same group of AD patients. SpectA and Coh were calculated from EEGs of 40 patients with mild to moderate AD and 40 healthy elderly controls. The peak of spectA was smaller in the AD group than in controls. AD group showed predominance of slow spectA in theta and delta bands and a significant reduction of inter-hemispheric Coh for occipital alpha 2 and beta 1 and for frontal delta sub-band. ROC curve supported that alpha band spectA was more sensitive than coherence to differentiate controls from AD.

Resting posterior minus frontal EEG slow oscillations is associated with extraversion and DRD2 genotype	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Extraversion; Personality; NEO-PI-R; Electroencephalography; EEG; Resting state; Eyes-closed resting condition; Slow oscillations; Dopamine receptor; Genetic polymorphism; DRD2; TAQ1A (rs1800497); SNP19 (rs1076560); -141C Ins/Del (rs1799732)	DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; PROMOTER REGION; A1 ALLELE; GENE; POLYMORPHISMS; PERSONALITY; BRAIN; DENSITY; VARIANT; D-2	The agency facet of extraversion has been hypothesized to be based on individual differences in dopamine activity. Recent work suggests that resting posterior minus frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) slow oscillations (delta, theta) is both consistently associated with extraversion and sensitive to dopamine D2 receptor antagonist-induced changes in dopaminergic activity. Here we examine for the first time the interrelations between polymorphisms of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene (rs1800497 [previously termed TAQ1A], rs1076560, rs1799732 [-141C Ins/Del]), extraversion and resting posterior minus frontal (Pz-Fz) slow oscillations. As predicted, we found an association between DRD2 and resting Pz-Fz slow oscillations in a sample of 141 individuals participating in an eyes-closed resting EEG session. Moreover, we replicated the association between extraversion and Pz-Fz slow oscillations. Our findings strongly suggest that the posterior-frontal distribution of slow oscillations constitutes a useful brain-based intermediate phenotype for investigating the dopaminergic basis of extraversion.

J	Wacker, M; Witte, H				Wacker, Matthias; Witte, Herbert			On the Stability of the n:m Phase Synchronization Index	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Frequency tiling; n:m synchronization; stability; time-frequency analysis	FREQUENCY	Synchronization analysis of multitrial EEG or (magneto encephalogram) MEG signals is an excellent approach to detect functional connectivity between different neuronal oscillators. In our current research, the n:m phase synchronization index (n:m PSI) is of special interest. We prove the existence of stable and unstable synchronies dependent upon the analysis frequencies and show that they lie closely together in the frequency domain. Thus, a plot of the time-frequency plane of the n:m PSI automatically violates the sampling theorem and accordingly, the method cannot be considered as a black box. A frequency-tiling approach is presented that can detect robust synchronies while ignoring the unstable ones. The improved synchrony detection is evaluated in numerical experiments on using both simulated and real-life data. It can be demonstrated that the transient synchronization events between MEG oscillations in distant frequency ranges can be detected and that compactly textured EEG synchronization patterns can be reliably characterized.

Functionality is demonstrated by tuning the four bands to important frequency bands used by ECoG/EEG applications: alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (18-26 Hz), low-gamma (30-50 Hz), and gamma (70-100 Hz).

Resting EEG theta power correlates with cognitive performance in healthy older adults	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Aged/Demented; EEG/ERP	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE EEG; IMPAIRMENT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; DEMENTIA; PREDICTION; COHERENCE	We address the degree to which resting EEG bandpower is associated with cognitive performance in 73 healthy older adults (aged 56-70). Relative theta (4-6.5 Hz) power was significantly correlated with immediate and delayed verbal recall, attention, and executive function measures. Relative delta and alpha power and peak alpha frequency did not correlate with any cognitive measures. These data indicate that high resting theta power in healthy older adults is associated with better cognitive function and may be a marker of healthy neurocognitive aging. Comparison of these with previous findings suggests that two forms of theta-frequency oscillations may exist; one indicative of healthy neurocognitive function and the other, EEG/alpha slowing linked to (future) substantial cognitive decline. Future EEG investigations of cognitive aging or decline should analyze both relative theta power and degree of EEG/alpha slowing so as not to confound these.

There is an increasing body of work on mathematical and computational models addressing these different dynamics, however, usually considering only processes on a single time scale. In this paper, we review and present a new analysis of the dynamics of human sleep EEG at the different time scales and relate the findings to recent modelling efforts pointing out both the achievements and remaining challenges.

The modulation spectrum, a function of acoustic frequency and modulation frequency, has been proposed and widely used in the speech processing community. However, modulation spectrum, much like time-frequency distribution is a representation of an individual signal and does not quantify the modulation effects between two signals. In this paper, we introduce cross frequency-spectral lag representation based on the Wigner distribution to represent the modulation relationships between two signals. The performance of the proposed distribution is illustrated for simulated signals as well as for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

The relationship between the visual evoked potential and the gamma band investigated by blind and semi-blind methods	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual Evoked Potential (VEP); Electroencephalography (EEG); Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Functional Source Separation (FSS); Induced Visual Gamma (IVG); Gamma Band Activity (GBA)	FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; EEG; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION	Gamma Band Activity (GBA) is increasingly studied for its relation with attention, change detection, maintenance of working memory and the processing of sensory stimuli. Activity around the gamma range has also been linked with early visual processing, although the relationship between this activity and the low frequency visual evoked potential (VEP) remains unclear. This study examined the ability of blind and semi-blind source separation techniques to extract sources specifically related to the VEP and GBA in order to shed light on the relationship between them. Blind (Independent Component Analysis-ICA) and semi-Blind (Functional Source Separation-FSS) methods were applied to dense array EEG data recorded during checkerboard stimulation. FSS was performed with both temporal and spectral constraints to identify specifically the generators of the main peak of the VEP (P100) and of the GBA. Source localisation and time-frequency analyses were then used to investigate the properties and co-dependencies between VEP/P100 and GBA. Analysis of the VEP extracted using the different methods demonstrated very similar morphology and localisation of the generators. Single trial time frequency analysis showed higher GBA when a larger amplitude VEP/P100 occurred. Further examination indicated that the evoked (phase-locked) component of the GBA was more related to the P100, whilst the induced component correlated with the VEP as a whole. The results suggest that the VEP and GBA may be generated by the same neuronal populations, and implicate this relationship as a potential mediator of the correlation between the VEP and the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect measured with fMRI.

This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the degree of enhancement and suppression of alpha waves in the eye opening and closure test. EEG was measured with eyes open and shut three times at 10-second intervals. Frequency analysis of the EEG was performed by Fourier transform, and the amplitude at the alpha peak frequency (8 similar to 13Hz) was obtained. We calculated a relative statistical value (Z-value) for the two states, allowing normalization of the data to the individual. We then introduced a simple evaluation index derived from the average and standard deviation of Z-values and evaluated our method in data from 120 healthy subjects and 59 patients that were divided into four groups: awake/drowsy and patients/healthy subjects. By using two indices, we recognized a statistically significant difference between the average of the healthy awake group and other groups. We also recognized a significant difference between the standard deviation of the healthy drowsy group and other groups. Therefore, these indices can be used to quantitatively evaluate eye opening and closure in routine EEG examinations.

Automated EEG analysis: Characterizing the posterior dominant rhythm	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Posterior dominant rhythm; Electroencephalography; Computerized interpretation; Certainty	ALPHA-RHYTHMS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS	Automated interpretation of clinical EEG recordings will reduce subjectivity and visual bias from analysis and can reduce the time required for interpretation. As a first step in the design of a fully automated system, a method is presented to characterize the main properties of the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), in particular its frequency, symmetry and reactivity. The presented method searches for dominant peaks in the EEG spectra during eyes-closed states with a three-component curve-fitting technique. From the fitted curve, the frequency and amplitude are estimated. The symmetry and the reactivity are found using the spectral power at the PDR frequencies. In addition, a certainty value is introduced as a measure of confidence for each estimate. The method was evaluated on a test set of 1215 clinical EEG recordings and compared to the PDR frequencies obtained from the visual analysis, as reported in the diagnostic reports. The calculated PDR frequencies were within 1.2 Hz of the visual estimates in 92.5% of the cases. Even higher accuracies were reached when estimates with low certainty values were discarded. The presented method quantifies essential features of the PDR with a matched accuracy to visual inspection, making it a feasible contribution to the design of a fully automated interpretation system.

Contributions of descending and ascending pathways to corticomuscular coherence in humans	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; DISYNAPTIC PYRAMIDAL EXCITATION; SLOW FINGER MOVEMENTS; MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES; PROPRIOSPINAL NEURONS; RETICULOSPINAL TRACT; FORELIMB MOTONEURONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; LINEAR-DEPENDENCE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY	Corticomuscular coherence in the beta frequency band (15-30 Hz) has been demonstrated in both humans and monkeys, but its origin and functional role are still unclear. Phase-frequency plots produced by traditional coherence analysis are often complex. Some subjects show a clear linear phase-frequency relationship (indicative of a fixed delay) but give shorter delays than expected; others show a constant phase across frequencies. Recent evidence suggests that oscillations may be travelling around a peripheral sensorimotor loop. We recorded sensorimotor EEGs and EMGs from three intrinsic hand muscles in human subjects performing a precision grip task, and applied directed coherence (Granger causality) analysis to explore this system. Directed coherence was significant in both descending (EEG -> EMG) and ascending (EMG -> EEG) directions at beta frequencies. Average phase delays of 26.4 ms for the EEG -> EMG direction and 29.5 ms for the EMG -> EEG direction were closer to the expected conduction times for these pathways than the average delays estimated from coherence phase (7.9 ms). Subjects were sub-divided into different groups, based on the sign of the slope of the linear relation between corticomuscular coherence phase and frequency (positive, negative or zero). Analysis separated by these groups suggested that different relative magnitudes of EEG -> EMG and EMG -> EEG directed coherence might underlie the observed inter-individual differences in coherence phase. These results confirm the complex nature of corticomuscular coherence with contributions from both descending and ascending pathways.

Penicillin G induced epileptic discharges (EDs) and increased high frequency EEG bands. Use of a cooling device suppressed EDs with an effect that depended on the brain temperature. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis indicated that cooling to 25 degrees C terminated the higher frequency EEG activity in Beta bands, cooling to 20 degrees C suppressed the power spectra for both Alpha and Beta waves, and cooling to 15 degrees C completely suppressed all spectral bands. These results suggest that a focal cooling device can terminate EDs and suppress EEG frequency bands in a manner that is dependent on the brain temperature. These findings contribute to development of clinical treatment for patients with EDs.

Analysis of changes in rhythmical activity and interstructural relations was carried out at different stages of epileptogenesis. Increased frequency of rhythmic activity in delta, theta, and alphabands was observed during epileptogenesis. Correlation relations between the activities of the medical septum with the piriform cortex and amigdala clearly decreased to 5 months after development of status epilepticus. Changes in the frequency of oscillations and structural correlations developed in time from two months on and reached a maximum 5 months after the status epilepticus development. It point to intensification of the pathological changes during formation of the epileptic focus. A possible role of the observed EEG changes in the formation of a pathological centre is discussed.

It also sought to determine whether sex differences in the EEG power spectra reflect differential patterns of maturation. A group of 56 adolescents were tested at age 10 years and then at two further time-points approximately 18 months apart. The EEG was recorded during both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions and Fourier transformed to provide estimates of absolute and relative spectral power at 0.5 Hz intervals from 0.5 to 40 Hz. The peak alpha frequency for each individual at each time-point was also determined for relative spectral power. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was used to determine the combination of electrodes and frequencies that showed developmental change, or differed between the sexes. As a function of age, absolute delta and theta frequencies power decreased, and relative alpha2 and beta frequencies increased, replicating the standard findings of a decrease in lower, and increase in higher, frequencies with age. A small but significant increase in peak alpha frequency with age was detected. Moreover PLS analysis performed with individual alpha frequencies aligned to 10 Hz suggested that the age-related increase seen in alpha2 relative power was driven by changes in the peak frequency. Although males demonstrated higher alpha power than females, there were no sex differences in peak frequency, suggesting that there may be more to sex differences in EEG power than simply different rates of maturation between the two sexes.

During a focal seizure, the abnormal synchronous activity starts in a specific brain region and rapidly propagates to neighboring regions. Intracranial ElectroEncephaloGraphy (IEEG) is the recording of brain activity at a high temporal resolution through electrodes placed within different brain regions. Intracranial electrodes are used to access structures deep within the brain and to reveal brain activity that cannot be observed with scalp EEG recordings. In order to identify the pattern of propagation across brain areas, a connectivity measure named the Adapted Directed Transfer Function (ADTF) has been developed. This measure reveals connections between different regions by exploiting statistical dependencies within multichannel recordings. The ADTF can be derived from the coefficients of a time-variant multivariate autoregressive (WAR) model fitted to the data. In this paper the applicability to locate the epileptogenic focus by time-variant connectivity analysis of seizure onsets based on the ADTF is shown. Furthermore, different normalizations of the ADTF (the integrated ADTF, the masked ADTF and the full frequency ADTF) are compared to investigate whether one is more suitable to describe the spreading of epileptic activity during an epileptic seizure. We quantified the performance of different connectivity measures during simulations of an epileptic seizure onset. The full frequency ADTF outperforms the integrated ADTF and masked ADTF. Accordingly, we applied this full frequency ADIF to 4 seizure onset and 29 subclinical seizure [EEG recordings of a patient with refractory epilepsy. Hereby, we showed that connectivity patterns derived from IEEG recordings can provide useful information about seizure propagation and may improve the accuracy of the pre-surgical evaluation in patients with refractory epilepsy.

Event-related delta and theta brain oscillations reflect age-related changes in both a general and a specific neuronal inhibitory mechanism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; ERP; Intraindividual variability; Time-frequency analysis; Response inhibition; Go/NoGo	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; LIFE-SPAN CHANGES; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; GO NOGO TASKS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP COMPONENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	Objective: ERPs may be limited in validity when investigating inhibitory functions in later adulthood, as age-related increases in intraindividual variability and changes in EEG-oscillations are not considered. The present study compared averaged ERP peak and single trial time-frequency (TF) data analysis. Methods: Go/NoGo ERP waves amplitude/latency measures were compared with a TF analysis estimating single trial event-related EEG spectral power enhancement and intertrial phase-locking (ITC) in delta and theta band. Results: Age-related larger ITC was found for theta oscillations in the N2-P3 time range during NoGo, only. Discrepancies between N1/N2 ERP and TF results were obtained. Go/NoGo-P3 amplitude reductions in elderly were not related to an increased delta latency jitter. Conclusions: Discrepancies between ERPs and TF results challenge conclusions made about age-related changes in Go/NoGo-N2. Earlier reports of age-related changes in P3 are supported by the present results. The study implies age-related impairments in a general neuronal inhibition mechanism and a specific response inhibition mechanism. Significance: The study indicates long-range communication impairments in the aged brain and the results are discussed considering hypotheses on increases in neural noise.

However, animal studies of EEG pathology in the context of TBI are surprisingly sparse, largely because of the lack of real-time continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring in animal TBI models. Here, we performed long-term EEG monitoring to study nonconvulsive seizures (NCS), periodic epileptiform discharges (FED), and EEG power spectra following three injury severity levels in a rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). EEG signals were recorded continuously from bilateral hemispheres of freely behaving rats for 72 h and for 2 h on days 7 and 14 after the injury. We report that the incidence of NCS and FED positively correlated with the injury severity, where 13%, 39%, and 59% of the animals exhibited NCS, and 0%, 30%, and 65% of the animals exhibited PED following 5%, 10% and 12.5% PBBI, respectively. Similar correlations existed for the number of NCS and FED events and their duration. NCS and FED occurred either independently or in tandem. Longer NCS durations were associated with larger lesion volumes. Significant EEG slowing evidenced by the EEG power shift toward the frequency band (0.5-4 Hz) occurred within 2 h after PBBI, which resolved over time but persisted longer after greater injury severity. In contrast, decreases in higher frequency power (i.e., 30-35 Hz) remained depressed throughout 14 days. This is the first long-term cEEG study of the acute injury phase in a rat model of severe TBI, demonstrating common occurrences of clinically observed electrocortical pathology, such as NCS, FED, and cortical slowing. These EEG pathologies may serve as critical care biomarkers of brain injury, and offer clinically relevant metrics for studying acute therapeutic interventions.

Since the first report on high frequency oscillatory synchrony between V1 neurons belonging to the same orientation column (Gray and Singer, 1989, PNAS, 86, 1698-1702), the role of such oscillations in visual perception has been extensively researched. Visual stimuli elicit an early, evoked gamma-band response and a later, induced (neither time nor phase-locked) response. An abundance of experimental evidence now links both evoked and induced high frequency oscillations to a range of visual stimulus properties. On the basis of early studies into gamma-band oscillations in vision, induced high frequency oscillatory activity has been proposed as a putative cortical mechanism of coherent percept formation and object representation while evoked high frequency activity was related to the processing of image features. Recent studies demonstrate that both evoked and induced gamma-band activity are correlated with the speed and accuracy of visual detection and discrimination. Furthermore, induced gamma-band oscillations in the visual cortex are also correlated with fixational eye movement patterns. These direct relations between gamma-band activity and the efficacy of visual perception strongly suggest that cortical high frequency synchronisations constitute a neural mechanism that subserves processes essential for the organised intake and analysis of visual information.

Slow spontaneous hemodynamic oscillations during sleep measured with near-infrared spectroscopy	DIFFUSE OPTICAL IMAGING III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Diffuse Optical Imaging III	MAY 22-24, 2011	Munich, GERMANY	SPIE, Opt Soc Amer		Near-infrared spectroscopy; hemodynamic oscillations; sleep	LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; RHYTHMIC OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS; OXYGENATION; SENSITIVITY; INSIGHTS; TISSUE	Spontaneous cerebral hemodynamic oscillations below 100 mHz reflect the level of cerebral activity, modulate hemodynamic responses to tasks and stimuli, and may aid in detecting various pathologies of the brain. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is ideally suited for both measuring spontaneous hemodynamic oscillations and monitoring sleep, but little research has been performed to combine these two applications. We analyzed 30 all-night NIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) sleep recordings to investigate spontaneous hemodynamic activity relative to sleep stages determined by polysomnography. Signal power of hemodynamic oscillations in the low-frequency (LF, 40-150 mHz) and very-low-frequency (VLF, 3-40 mHz) bands decreased in slow-wave sleep (SWS) compared to light sleep (LS) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. No statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in oscillation power between LS and REM were observed. However, the period of VLF oscillations around 8 mHz increased in REM sleep in line with earlier studies with other modalities. These results increase our knowledge of the physiology of sleep, complement EEG data, and demonstrate the applicability of NIRS to studying spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations during sleep.

High frequency EEG activity associated with ictal events in an animal model of infantile spasms	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Spasms; Tetrodotoxin; High frequency oscillations; EEG	NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; EPILEPTIC SPASMS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; WEST-SYNDROME; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; SEIZURES; GENERATION; CORTEX; PLASTICITY	P>Purpose: To describe high frequency (HF) electrographic activity accompanying ictal discharges in the tetrodotoxin (TTX) model of infantile spasms. Previous studies of HF oscillations in humans and animals suggest that they arise at sites of seizure onset. We compared HF oscillations at several cortical sites to determine regional differences. Methods: TTX was infused for 4 weeks into the neocortex of rats beginning on postnatal days 11 or 12. Electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were implanted 2 weeks later and video-EEG recordings were analyzed between postnatal days 31 and 47. EEG recordings were digitally sampled at 2,048 Hz. HF EEG activity (20-900 Hz) was quantified using compressed spectral arrays and band-pass filtering. Key Findings: Multiple seizures were analyzed in 10 rats. Ictal onset was associated with multiple bands of rhythmic HF activity that could extend to 700 Hz. The earliest and most intense discharging typically occurred contralaterally to where TTX was infused. HF activity continued to occur throughout the seizure (even during the electrodecrement that is recorded with more traditional filter settings), although there was a gradual decrease of the intensity of the highest frequency components as the amplitude of lower frequency oscillations increased. Higher frequencies sometimes reappeared in association with spike/sharp-waves at seizure termination. Significance: The findings show that HF EEG activity accompanies ictal events in the TTX model. Results also suggest that the seizures in this model do not originate from the TTX infusion site. Instead HF discharges are usually most intense and occur earliest contralaterally, suggesting that these homologous regions may be involved in seizure generation.

Here we assess whether valid localizations of coherent cortical networks can also be obtained from high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Methods: EEG was recorded from healthy subjects and from patients with ischemic brain lesions during a tonic hand muscle contraction task and during continuous visual stimulation with an alternating checkerboard. These tasks induce oscillations in the primary hand motor area or in the primary visual cortex, respectively, which are coherent with extracerebral signals (hand muscle electromyogram or visual stimulation frequency). Cortical oscillations were reconstructed with different inverse solutions and the coherence between oscillations at each cortical voxel and the extracerebral signals was calculated. Moreover, simulations of coherent point sources were performed. Results: Cortico-muscular coherence was correctly localized to the primary hand motor area and the steady-state visual evoked potentials to the primary visual cortex in all subjects and patients. Sophisticated head models tended to yield better localization accuracy than a single sphere model. A Minimum Variance Beamformer (MVBF) provided more accurate and focal localizations of simulated point sources than an L2 Minimum Norm (MN) inverse solution. In the real datasets, the MN maps had less localization error but were less focal than MVBF maps. Conclusions: EEG can localize coherent cortical networks with sufficient accuracy.

J	Qin, JG; Perdoni, C; He, B				Qin, Jungang; Perdoni, Christopher; He, Bin			Dissociation of Subjectively Reported and Behaviorally Indexed Mind Wandering by EEG Rhythmic Activity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS; WORKING-MEMORY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; DEFAULT NETWORK; RESTING STATE; ATTENTION; FREQUENCY; BRAIN; SIGNATURES; RELEVANT	Inattention to current activity is ubiquitous in everyday situations. Mind wandering is an example of such a state, and its related brain areas have been examined in the literature. However, there is no clear evidence regarding neural rhythmic activities linked to mind wandering. Using a vigilance task with thought sampling and electroencephalography recording, the current study simultaneously examined neural oscillatory activities related to subjectively reported and behaviorally indexed mind wandering. By implementing time-frequency analysis, we found that subjectively reported mind wandering, relative to behaviorally indexed, showed increased gamma band activity at bilateral frontal-central areas. By means of beamformer source imaging, we found subjectively reported mind wandering within the gamma band to be characterized by increased activation in bilateral frontal cortices, supplemental motor area, paracentral cortex and right inferior temporal cortex in comparison to behaviorally indexed mind wandering.

Local Polynomial Modeling of Time-Varying Autoregressive Models With Application to Time-Frequency Analysis of Event-Related EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; event-related potential; local polynomial modeling (LPM); time-frequency analysis (TFA); time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model	KALMAN SMOOTHER APPROACH; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; PARAMETERS; DYNAMICS; EEG/MEG; SERIES	This paper proposes a new local polynomial modeling (LPM) method for identification of time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models and applies it to time-frequency analysis (TFA) of event-related electroencephalogram (ER-EEG). The LPM method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates the polynomial coefficients using weighted least-squares with a window having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to determine the optimal bandwidth that minimizes the mean squared error. The resultant time-varying power spectral density estimation of the signal is capable of achieving both high time resolution and high frequency resolution in the time-frequency domain, making it a powerful TFA technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like ER-EEG. Experimental results on synthesized signals and real EEG data show that the LPM method can achieve a more accurate and complete time-frequency representation of the signal.	[Zhang, Z. G.; Hung, Y.

The aim of this study is to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics in relation to distraction during driving. To study human cognition under a specific driving task, simulated real driving using virtual reality (VR)-based simulation and designed dual-task events are built, which include unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions. Methods: We designed five cases with different stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) to investigate the distraction effects between the deviations and equations. The EEG channel signals are first converted into separated brain sources by independent component analysis (ICA). Then, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) changes of the EEG power spectrum are used to evaluate brain dynamics in time-frequency domains. Results: Power increases in the theta and beta bands are observed in relation with distraction effects in the frontal cortex. In the motor area, alpha and beta power suppressions are also observed. All of the above results are consistently observed across 15 subjects. Additionally, further analysis demonstrates that response time and multiple cortical EEG power both changed significantly with different SOA. Conclusions: This study suggests that theta power increases in the frontal area is related to driver distraction and represents the strength of distraction in real-life situations.

J	Aviyente, S; Mutlu, AY				Aviyente, Selin; Mutlu, Ali Yener			A Time-Frequency-Based Approach to Phase and Phase Synchrony Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Phase estimation; phase synchrony; time-frequency analysis; Rihaczek distribution	RECURRENCE PLOTS; KURAMOTO MODEL; SIGNALS; SERIES; DECOMPOSITION; BIAS; EEG	Time-varying phase synchrony is an important bivariate measure that quantifies the dynamics between nonstationary signals and has been widely used in many applications including chaotic oscillators in physics and multichannel electroencephalography recordings in neuroscience. Current state-of-the-art in time-varying phase estimation uses either the Hilbert transform or the complex wavelet transform of the signals. Both of these methods have some major drawbacks such as the assumption that the signals are narrowband for the Hilbert transform and the nonuniform time-frequency resolution inherent to the wavelet analysis. In this paper, a new phase estimation method based on the Rihaczek distribution and Reduced Interference Rihaczek distribution belonging to Cohen's class is proposed. These distributions offer phase estimates with uniformly high time-frequency resolution which can be used for defining time and frequency dependent phase synchrony. Properties of the phase estimator and the corresponding phase synchrony measure are evaluated both analytically and through simulations showing the effectiveness of the new measures compared to existing methods.

These features which characterize the non-stationary nature and the multi-component characteristic of EEG signals, are extracted from the T-F representation of the signals. The signal related features are derived from the T-F representation of EEG signals and include the instantaneous frequency, singular value decomposition, and energy based features. The image related features are extracted from the T-F representation considered as an image, using T-F image processing techniques. These combined signal and image features allow to extract more information from a signal. The results obtained on newborn and adult EEG data, show that the image related features improve the performance of the EEG seizure detection in classification systems based on multi-SVM classifier.

The fundamental and so far unresolved problem for neuroscience remains to understand how oscillatory activity in the brain codes information for human cognition. In a biologically relevant cognitive task, we instructed six human observers to categorize facial expressions of emotion while we measured the observers' EEG. We combined state-of-the-art stimulus control with statistical information theory analysis to quantify how the three parameters of oscillations (i.e., power, phase, and frequency) code the visual information relevant for behavior in a cognitive task. We make three points: First, we demonstrate that phase codes considerably more information (2.4 times) relating to the cognitive task than power. Second, we show that the conjunction of power and phase coding reflects detailed visual features relevant for behavioral response-that is, features of facial expressions predicted by behavior. Third, we demonstrate, in analogy to communication technology, that oscillatory frequencies in the brain multiplex the coding of visual features, increasing coding capacity. Together, our findings about the fundamental coding properties of neural oscillations will redirect the research agenda in neuroscience by establishing the differential role of frequency, phase, and amplitude in coding behaviorally relevant information in the brain.

Study design Experimental study. Animals Eight healthy adult Huntaway dogs. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with halothane (0.85-0.95 end-tidal volume %) in oxygen. Animals were ventilated to maintain stable end-tidal CO2 and halothane concentrations. Following a 30 minute stabilisation period, alfaxalone (0.5 mg kg(-1)) was infused intravenously over a 5 minute period. The electroencephalogram was recorded from the beginning of the stabilisation period until 60 minutes following the start of alfaxalone treatment. Data were subjected to fast Fourier transformation, and median frequency, 95% spectral edge frequency and total EEG power were calculated. Two-factorial repeated measures ANOVA (time and EEG channels were factors) was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). Results A shift in the dominant frequency band from beta to delta after alfaxalone treatment and occasional burst suppression were observed. Median frequency decreased significantly below baseline (9.2 +/- 1.4 Hz) (mean +/- SD) during alfaxalone infusion. The lowest value (4.8 +/- 1.2 Hz) was recorded 5 minutes after the start of infusion. Spectral edge frequency also decreased below baseline (26.2 +/- 1.5 Hz) and the lowest value (22.6 +/- 1.5 Hz) also was detected at 5 minutes after the start of infusion. Total EEG power did not change significantly. In some frequencies EEG power increased soon after the start of alfaxalone infusion, then decreased below baseline later (biphasic pattern). Conclusions and clinical relevance Alfaxalone induced biphasic changes on EEG and decreased F-50 and F-95 in halothane anaesthetized dogs.

The concept of an epileptogenicity index has been proposed recently to represent the likelihood of various regions being part of the seizure onset zone. It quantifies low-voltage fast activity, the electrophysiological signature of seizure onset usually assessed visually by neurologists. Here, we revisit epileptogenicity in light of neuroimaging tools such as those provided in statistical parametric mapping software. Our goal is to propose a robust approach, allowing easy exploration of patients' brains in time and space. The procedure is based upon statistical parametric mapping, which is an established framework for comparing multi-dimensional image data that allows one to correct for inherent multiple comparisons. Statistics can also be performed at the group level, between seizures in the same patient or between patients suffering from the same type of epilepsy using normalization of brains to a common anatomic atlas. Results are obtained from three case studies (insular reflex epilepsy, cryptogenic frontal epilepsy and lesional occipital epilepsy) where tailored resection was performed, and from a group of 10 patients suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. They illustrate the basics of the technique and demonstrate its very good reproducibility and specificity. Most importantly, the proposed approach to the quantification of the seizure onset zone allows one to summarize complex signals in terms of a time-series of statistical parametric maps that can support clinical decisions. Quantitative neuroimaging of stereo-electroencephalographic features of seizures might thus help to provide better pre-surgical assessment of patients undergoing resective surgery.

The purpose of our study is to clarify the relationship between slow shift, HFO and conventional electrocorticographic (ECoG) change. Methods: A patient with right temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation with subdural electrodes was studied. Slow shift and HFO were evaluated in 16 habitual seizures with wideband EEG technique (bandpass filter of 0.016-600 Hz). Results: Upon seizure occurrence in wideband ECoG, negative slow shifts coexisted with HFO (100300 Hz) in the ictal onset zone in all investigated seizures. The former always preceded HFO and conventional initial EEG changes by mean value of 1.6 and 20.4 s, respectively. The slow shifts and HFOs were observed only in the restricted ictal onset zone. Conclusions: In this particular patient, wideband EEG could delineate both ictal slow shift and HFO to define ictal onset zone, and the earliest occurrence of slow shifts may suggest an early role of glia in slow EEG shift generation than neurons.

This work is an attempt to understand this subtle phenomenon of the brain and the process of attaining higher state of cognition followed by consciousness. From the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, it was observed that with the increase in Pranayama practices, the frequency of oscillation shifts from lower-frequency range to higher-frequency range with the significant rise of gamma power (>40 Hz) in frontal, central and also some part of temporal region of the brain. This frequency shifts count for attaining higher cognitive states leading to consciousness of human brain.

Frequency-specific electrocorticographic correlates of working memory delay period fMRI activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Working memory; Delay activity; Gamma; Theta; Electrocorticography; fMRI; BOLD; Oscillations; Intracranial EEG	HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; UNIT-ACTIVITY; STIMULUS ATTRIBUTES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BOLD FMRI; NEURONS; REPRESENTATION	Electrocorticography (ECoG) and functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) have been used previously to measure brain activity during working memory delay periods. These studies have separately reported oscillation changes in the theta (4-8 Hz) band and BOLD-fMRI increases during delay periods when information is maintained in memory. However, it is not known how intracranial cortical field potential (CFP) changes relate to BOLD-fMRI responses during delay periods. To answer this question, fMRI was obtained from six epilepsy patients during a visual working memory task. Then, following subdural macroelectrode implant, continuous ECoG was used to record CFPs during the same task. Time-frequency analyses showed delay period gamma band oscillation amplitude increases on electrodes located near fMRI activity, while in the theta band changes were higher for electrodes located away from fMRI activation. The amplitude of the ECoG gamma band response was significantly positively correlated with the fMRI response, while a negative correlation was found for the theta band. The findings are consistent with previous reports of local field potential (LFP) coupling in the gamma band with BOLD-fMRI responses during visual stimulation in monkeys, but are novel in that the relationship reported here persists after the disappearance of visual stimuli while information is being maintained in memory. We conclude that there is a relationship between BOLD-fMRI increases and human working memory delay period gamma oscillation increases and theta decreases. The spectral profile change provides a basis for comparison of working memory delay period BOLD-fMRI with field potential recordings in animals and other human intracranial EEG studies.

We review the literature on working memory deficits, particularly in the visual domain, and changes in oscillatory neural activity as measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We argue that recent results suggest a link between these two phenomena, in that altered oscillations underlie some of the working memory deficits. We furthermore argue that early sensory mechanisms contribute more to working memory (and other) deficits than previously thought. The final part of our review suggests links between working memory, oscillations, and their alterations in schizophrenia and the dopamine, GABA, glutamate and acetylcholine system. These links have already resulted in the development of new remediation strategies, which have some translational potential. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of these BCIs used different flickering frequencies to evoke SSVEP with different frequency components that were used as control commands. In this paper, a novel method combining the time phase and EEG frequency components is presented and validated with nine healthy subjects. In this method, four different frequency components of EEG were classified out from four time phases. When the SSVEP is evoked and what is the frequency of the SSVEP is determined by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier in the same time to locate the target image. The results from offline analysis show that this method yields good performance both in classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR).

To suppress this type of spatially coloured noise, source estimation is often performed with spatial whitening based on a measured or estimated noise covariance matrix. However, artifacts that span relatively small noise subspaces, such as cardiac, ocular, and muscle artifacts, are often explicitly removed by a variety of denoising methods (e.g., signal space projection) before source imaging. Here, we introduce a new approach, the spectral signal space projection ((SP)-P-3) algorithm, in which time-frequency (TF)-specific spatial projectors are designed and applied to the noisy TF-transformed data, and whitened source estimation is performed in the TF domain. The approach can be used to derive spectral variants of all linear time domain whitened source estimation algorithms. The denoised sensor and source time series are obtained by the corresponding inverse IF-transform. The method is evaluated and compared with existing subspace projection and signal separation techniques using experimental data. Altogether, S3P provides an expanded framework for MEG/EEG data denoising and whitened source imaging in both the time and frequency/scale domains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we explored a patient having seizures triggered by syrup intake. From intracranial electroencephalography combined with functional MRI, the overlap of the gustatory cortex and of the preictal and ictal onset zones, as defined by early gamma changes, motivated the successful resective surgery of the middle short gyrus of the right insula. This case provides a rare demonstration from human gamma activity that the route to seizure may be supported by the interplay between physiological and epileptogenic networks.

Behavioral assessment remains the gold standard for assessing consciousness but previous studies have shown a high rate of misdiagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) entropy measurements in differentiating unconscious (coma or vegetative) from minimally conscious patients. Left fronto-temporal EEG recordings (10-minute resting state epochs) were prospectively obtained in 56 patients and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers. Patients were assessed in the acute (<= 1 month post-injury; n=29) or chronic (>1 month post-injury; n=27) stage. The etiology was traumatic in 23 patients. Automated online EEG entropy calculations (providing an arbitrary value ranging from 0 to 91) were compared with behavioral assessments (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised) and outcome. EEG entropy correlated with Coma Recovery Scale total scores (r=0.49). Mean EEG entropy values were higher in minimally conscious (73 +/- 19; mean and standard deviation) than in vegetative/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients (45 +/- 28). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an entropy cut-off value of 52 differentiating acute unconscious from minimally conscious patients (sensitivity 89% and specificity 90%). In chronic patients, entropy measurements offered no reliable diagnostic information. EEG entropy measurements did not allow prediction of outcome. User-independent time-frequency balanced spectral EEG entropy measurements seem to constitute an interesting diagnostic - albeit not prognostic - tool for assessing neural network complexity in disorders of consciousness in the acute setting.

J	Jacobs, J; Kobayashi, K; Gotman, J				Jacobs, Julia; Kobayashi, Katsuhiro; Gotman, Jean			High-frequency changes during interictal spikes detected by time-frequency analysis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spikes-slow wave; Ripples; Fast ripples; Epilepsy; Seizure onset zone	HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; TEMPORAL-LOBE; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FAST RIPPLES; 100-500 HZ; OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES; GENESIS	Objective: High-frequency (HF) changes were analysed in relation to anatomical origin of spikes, shape and occurrence within the seizure onset zone (SOZ). We evaluated whether HF changes are linked to the SOZ, as established for distinct high-frequency oscillations. Methods: SEEG was filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2000 Hz. Spikes were selected by shape (spike/spike-slow wave) and location (SOZ/non-SOZ and neocortex/amygdala/hippocampus) in 15 patients. About 50 spikes were averaged for each set. Changes compared to baseline were quantified with false discovery rate controlled t-statistics using time-frequency spectra. Counts of increased or decreased time-frequency values were compared across spike categories in the 80-250 and 250-500 Hz bands. Results: Seventy-seven spike types were analysed. Differences between spike categories were most prominent between 250 and 500 Hz. HF changes were more frequent and larger in mesial temporal than in neocortical spikes and for spikes with slow waves than spikes alone. HF changes above 250 Hz were more frequent in spikes within than outside the SOZ. Conclusions: HF increases above 250 Hz show regional differences and are very prominent in the SOZ. Hippocampal spikes have the strongest HF components. Significance: Analysis of HF changes during spikes may provide information on differing pathophysiological mechanisms of spikes and on epileptogenicity of the tissue.

A User Study of Visualization Effectiveness Using EEG and Cognitive Load	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; ACTIVATION; MODEL; TASK; BOX	Effectively evaluating visualization techniques is a difficult task often assessed through feedback from user studies and expert evaluations. This work presents an alternative approach to visualization evaluation in which brain activity is passively recorded using electroencephalography ( EEG). These measurements are used to compare different visualization techniques in terms of the burden they place on a viewer's cognitive resources. In this paper, EEG signals and response times are recorded while users interpret different representations of data distributions. This information is processed to provide insight into the cognitive load imposed on the viewer. This paper describes the design of the user study performed, the extraction of cognitive load measures from EEG data, and how those measures are used to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations.

Planning and performing a complex movement (e.g., reaching and grasping) requires the coordination of muscles by electrical activity that can be recorded with scalp EEG from relevant regions of the cortex. Prior studies, utilizing motion capture and kinematic measures, have shown that an augmented reality feedback system for rehabilitation of stroke patients can help patients develop new motor plans and perform reaching tasks more accurately. Historically, traditional signal analysis techniques have been utilized to quantify changes in EEG when subjects perform common, simple movements. These techniques have included measures of event-related potentials in the time and frequency domains (e.g., energy and coherence measures). In this study, a more advanced, nonlinear, analysis technique, mutual information (MI), is applied to the EEG to capture the dynamics of functional connections between brain sites. In particular, the cortical activity that results from the planning and execution of novel reach trajectories by normal subjects in an augmented reality system was quantified by using statistically significant MI interactions between brain sites over time. The results show that, during the preparation for as well as the execution of a reach, the functional connectivity of the brain changes in a consistent manner over time, in terms of both the number and strength of cortical connections. A similar analysis of EEG from stroke patients may provide new insights into the functional deficiencies developed in the brain after stroke, and contribute to evaluation, and possibly the design, of novel therapeutic schemes within the framework of rehabilitation and BMI (brain machine interface).

Directed transfer function (DTF) was applied to cortical signals recorded from electroencephalography (EEG) in order to obtain connectivity patterns. Flow gain was proposed to assess the role of the specific brain region involved in the information transmission process. We found network connections exist in many regions beyond occipital region. Flow gain mapping both in 8-12 Hz and 13-30 Hz showed that parietal region seemed to serve as the sole hub of information transmission. Further studies of flow gain obtained from channel Pz showed two distinct peaks centered at about 12 Hz low frequency and 20 Hz medium frequency respectively. The low frequency region had a larger value of flow gain. The present study introduced functional connectivity into SSVEP. Furthermore, we put forward the concept of flow gain for the first time to explore the exchange and processing of brain information during SSVEP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analyses of behavioral measurements locomotion and sensorimotor gating - and the pharmacokinetics of ketamine and norketamine were also conducted. Methods: Ketamine and norketamine levels in rat sera and brains were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after ketamine 30 mg/kg (i.p.). Ketamine 9 and 30 mg/kg (i.p.) were used in the behavioral and EEG experiments. Locomotor effects in an open field test and deficits in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle reaction (PPI ASR) were evaluated in the behavioral experiments. EEG signals were simultaneously recorded from 12 implanted active electrodes; subsequently, an EEG power spectral and coherence analysis was performed. Results: Ketamine had a rapid penetration into the brain; the peak concentrations of the drug were reached within 15 min after administration. Ketamine induced marked hyperlocomotion and deficits in the PPI ASR. EEG spectral analysis mainly showed increases in EEG power as well as coherence. These were most robust at 10-15 min after the administration and influenced all parts of the spectrum with ketamine 30 mg/kg. Conclusions: Ketamine at behaviorally active doses induces a robust increase in EEG power spectra and coherence. The maximum levels of change correlated with the kinetics of ketamine.

Methods: We quantified a dynamic repertoire of EEG oscillations in resting condition with eyes closed in patients in VS and MCS. The exact composition of EEG oscillations was assessed by analysing the probability-classification of short-term EEG spectral patterns. Results: Results demonstrated that (a) the diversity and the variability of EEG for Non-Survivors were significantly lower than for Survivors; and (b) a higher probability of mostly delta and slow-theta oscillations occurring either alone or in combination were found during the first assessment for patients with a bad outcome (i.e., those who died) within six months of an injury compared to patients who survived. At the same time, patients with a good outcome (i.e., those who survived) after six months post-injury had a higher probability of mostly fast-theta and alpha oscillations occurring either alone or in combination during the first assessment when compared to patients who died within six months of an injury. Conclusions: Resting state EEGs properly analysed may have a potentially prognostic value with regards to the outcome from VS or MCS in terms of survival six months after a brain injury. Significance: This work may have implications for clinical care, rehabilitative programmes and medical-legal decisions for patients with impaired consciousness states after being in a coma due to acute brain injuries.

On the basis of their spatiotemporal characteristics, delta BROs have been proposed as being involved in an automatic mechanism of maintaining awareness in a visuo-spatial context. The aim of the present study was: a) to investigate whether spontaneous blinking was also able to modulate alpha oscillations and, if so, b) whether this modulation was consistent with delta BROs, in order c) to acquire additional information for a better understanding of the cognitive phenomena underlying blinking. Using a broadband (0.5-100 Hz) continuous wavelet transform (CWT), we analysed a total of 189 three-second EEG epochs time-locked to the blinks of seven healthy volunteers. The EEG signals were submitted both to band-pass filtered cross-trial averaging (to obtain frequency-specific BROs) and to alpha event-related synchronization/desynchronization (i.e., blink-related synchronization/desynchronization, BRS/BRD). The alpha oscillations showed: a) an early BRS; b) a BRD in the same temporal window of the delta BROs and, c) a late BRS. We postulate that: a) the early BRS represents the short-term memory maintenance of the last visually perceived trace of the surroundings; b) the alpha BRD is associated with the comparison between the newly perceived image of the environment and its mnestic representation, and, lastly, c) the late BRS is connected with neuronal recovery phenomena.

Alterations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been reported in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, previous methods have not assessed transient phenomena in the EEG signal (dynamics) and associations to psychometric test performance have in general been poor. The aims were to quantify spectral and dynamic EEG abnormalities in patients with HE and to correlate putative findings to psychometric test performances. Methods. Multichannel EEG (64 electrodes) was recorded in 24 cirrhotic patients with various grades of HE and 26 healthy volunteers. Spectral and dynamic EEG indices were quantified by continues wavelet analysis. In addition, the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), continues reaction time, and biochemical profile were assessed. Results. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients had progressively slowing of the EEG (all p <= 0.004) (spectral EEG indices) and increased variability in the alpha [7.5-13.5 Hz] (p = 0.001) and beta bands [13.5-32 Hz] (p = 0.02) (dynamic EEG indices). In addition, anteriorization and dissociation of the basic posterior alpha rhythm, along with dissociation of frontal delta activities [1-3.5 Hz] were seen with worsening of HE. Spectral EEG indices (all frequency bands) as well as dynamic EEG indices (alpha and beta bands) were correlated to PHES scores (all p < 0.05). Conclusion. EEG analysis, based on continues wavelet transform, provides quantifiable information on static as well as dynamic features of the EEG in patients with HE. EEG abnormalities were correlated to psychometric test performance and may provide valuable clinical biomarkers for surveillance, prognostication and treatment of this entity.

In this paper, the effect of the window functions in SSVEP based BCIs is discussed. EEC signal is a typical color noise with a high energy of the low frequency component. The main findings are that (I) The spectral leakage for EEC signals has some regular patterns. An obvious oscillation with the corresponding frequency can be observed. The amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the growth of the frequency. A short analysis is also given for the leakage. (2) The leakage from the low frequency component can be effectively suppressed by the using of some windows, such as Hamming, Hann and triangle window; (3) By removing the influence of the leakage from the low frequency component with high pass filter, the classification results are mainly determined by the width of the main lobe. The rectangle window would have a better accuracy than Hamming. Hann and triangle window. Some windows constructed with a narrower main lobe width have a potential use in SSVEP based BCIs.

Stimulation for few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be caused by stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function through functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis. Single recordings in healthy volunteers with 62 electroencephalography channels were acquired before and after 10 min of facilitatory anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1), combined with inhibitory cathodal tDCS of the contralateral frontopolar cortex, in resting state and during voluntary hand movements. Correlation matrices containing all 62 pairwise electrode combinations were calculated with the synchronization likelihood (SL) method and thresholded to construct undirected graphs for the 0, alpha, beta, low-gamma and high-gamma frequency bands. SL matrices and undirected graphs were compared before and after tDCS. Functional connectivity patterns significantly increased within premotor, motor, and sensorimotor areas of the stimulated hemisphere during motor activity in the 60-90 Hz frequency range. Additionally, tDCS-induced significant intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity changes in all the studied frequency bands. In summary, we show for the first time evidence for tDCS-induced changes in brain synchronization and topological functional organization. Hum Brain Mapp 32:1236-1249, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Cohen, MX				Cohen, Michael X.			Hippocampal-Prefrontal Connectivity Predicts Midfrontal Oscillations and Long-Term Memory Performance	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; GABA CONCENTRATION; GAMMA-FREQUENCY; CORTEX; THETA; MAINTENANCE; DYNAMICS; TIME; EEG; MICROSTRUCTURE	The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex interact to support working memory (WM) and long-term memory [1-3]. Neuro-physiologically, WM is thought to be subserved by reverberatory activity of distributed networks within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [2, 4-8], which become synchronized with reverberatory activity in the hippocampus [1, 4]. This electrophysiological synchronization is difficult to study in humans because noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) cannot measure hippocampus activity. Here, using a novel integration of EEG and diffusion-weighted imaging, it is shown that individuals with relatively stronger anatomical connectivity linking the hippocampus to the right ventrolateral PFC (ventral Brodmann area 46) exhibited slower frequency neuronal oscillations during a WM task. Furthermore, subjects with stronger hippocampus-PFC connectivity were better able to encode the complex pictures used in the WM task into long-term memory. These findings are consistent with models suggesting that electrophysiological oscillations provide a mechanism of long-range interactions [9] and link hippocampus-PFC structural connectivity to PFC rhythmic electrical dynamics and memory performance. More generally, these results highlight the importance of incorporating individual differences when linking structure and function to cognition.

Dynamics underlying spontaneous human alpha oscillations: A data-driven approach	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STATE; MODEL; DRIFT	Although the cognitive and clinical correlates of spontaneous human alpha oscillations as recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) are well documented, the dynamics underlying these oscillations is still a matter of debate. This study proposes a data-driven method to reveal the dynamics of these oscillations. It demonstrates that spontaneous human alpha oscillations as recorded with MEG can be viewed as noise-perturbed damped harmonic oscillations. This provides evidence for the hypothesis that these oscillations reflect filtered noise and hence do not possess limit-cycle dynamics. To illustrate the use of the model, we apply it to two data-sets in which a decrease in alpha power can be observed across conditions. The associated differences in the estimated model parameters show that observed decreases in alpha power are associated with different kinds of changes in the dynamics. Thus, the model parameters are useful dynamical biomarkers for spontaneous human alpha oscillations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Hindriks, R.; Bijma, F.; van der Vaart, A.

J	Hassler, U; Barreto, NT; Gruber, T				Hassler, Uwe; Trujillo Barreto, Nelson; Gruber, Thomas			Induced gamma band responses in human EEG after the control of miniature saccadic artifacts	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; BRAIN DYNAMICS; NEURON 58; ET-AL.; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; MANIFESTATION; FREQUENCY	Induced gamma band responses (iGBRs) in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) have been ascribed to the activation of cortical object representations. Recently, this claim was challenged and it was stated that iGBRs occurring in the time window between 200 and 350 ms after stimulus onset are, to a great extent, generated by an electromyogenic artifact caused by miniature saccades (MS). In the present paper we focus on the characterization of iGBRs during the activation of cortical object representations, when recordings have been controlled for saccade-related transient potentials. For this we present an algorithm for the correction of saccade-related transient potentials (COSTRAP) which identifies and notably suppresses transient spike potentials (TSPs) that are likely to be linked to MSs. Furthermore, we conducted an EEG study to demonstrate (1) the feasibility of the algorithm, (2) the cortical origin iGBRs and (3) their relation to cortical object representations. Our results revealed that (i) it is possible to isolate TSPs, (ii) the morphology of the cleansed iGBR cannot be explained by an underlying myogenic artifact and (iii) the remaining iGBRs are sensitive to object recognition. Therefore we conclude that, with saccadic artifacts being controlled, high-frequency oscillations in human EEG are reliable electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processes.

This task may require intracerebral encephalography (EEG) monitoring, the results of which are usually interpreted by visual presurgical inspection. A computer-assisted method for rapidly identifying reproducible ictal patterns based on the analysis of time, frequency, and spatial domains of stereo-EEG (SEEG) signals is described here. Methods: A new method for EZ detection was tested on SEEG recordings performed by intracerebral electrodes in eight patients with pharmacoresistant partial epilepsy. SEEG data were exported to a program developed in LabView. Key Findings: Prevalent frequencies during seizure events were evaluated by Fourier transform and further integral algorithms. Different frequencies and the relative powers were simultaneously evaluated in all recording leads. Patterns characterized by specific and prevalent frequencies were identified in a subset of recording sites during both seizure onset and seizure development. Three-dimensional (3D) maps of the measurements obtained from each recording channel were reconstructed on magnetic resonance coordinates to visualize the spatial distribution of the EZ. With this method, the reproducibility of ictal patterns in the same patient was characterized. The boundaries of the EZ identified with this algorithm correlated well with the EZ recognized with the traditional approach (n = 8). The spatial distribution of specific SEEG signals associated with different types of seizures was also analyzed in two patients. Significance: We describe a computer-assisted method to acquire information on EZ boundaries and to verify reproducibility of seizure patterns from intracerebral recordings performed in patients with pharmacoresistant partial epilepsies.

Although many studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of item maintenance, little is known about the neural mechanisms of temporal order maintenance in WM. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare neural oscillations during WM tasks that required maintenance of item or temporal order information. Behavioral results revealed that accuracy and reaction times were comparable between the two conditions, suggesting that task difficulty was matched between the item and temporal order WM tasks. EEG analyses indicated that theta (5-7 Hz) oscillations over prefrontal sites were increased during temporal order maintenance, whereas alpha oscillations (9-12 Hz) over posterior parietal and lateral occipital sites were increased during item maintenance. The frontal theta enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the order WM task, whereas the posterior alpha enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the item WM task. These results support the idea that frontal theta and posterior alpha oscillations are differentially related to maintenance of item and temporal order information.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that individual sleep EEG patterns in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep are heritable traits. More specifically, multiple recordings in the same individuals, as well as studies in monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggest that a very high percentage of the robust interindividual variation and the high intraindividual stability of sleep EEG profiles can be explained by genetic factors (>90% in distinct frequency bands). Still little is known about which genes contribute to different sleep EEG phenotypes in healthy humans. The genetic variations that have been identified to date include functional polymorphisms of the clock gene PER3 and of genes contributing to signal transduction pathways involving adenosine (ADA, ADORA2A), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dopamine (COMT), and prion protein (PRNP). Some of these polymorphisms profoundly modulate sleep EEG profiles; their effects are reviewed here. It is concluded that the search for genetic contributions to slow sleep EEG oscillations constitutes a promising avenue to identify molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-wake regulation in humans.

Methods: Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals were sampled from 104-148 cortical sites per child, and the dynamic changes of ictal HFOs were animated on each individual's three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) image surface. Key Findings: Visual assessment of ictal ECoG recordings revealed that each spasm event was characterized by augmentation of HFOs. Time-frequency analysis demonstrated that ictal augmentation of HFOs at 80-200 Hz was most prominent and generally preceded those at 210-300 Hz and at 70 Hz and slower. Recruitment of HFOs in the rolandic cortex preceded the clinical onset objectively visualized as electromyographic deflection. The presence or absence of ictal motor symptoms was related more to the amplitude of HFOs in the Rolandic cortex than in the seizure-onset zone. In a substantial proportion of epileptic spasms, seizure termination began at the seizure-onset zone and propagated to the surrounding areas; we referred to this observation as the "ictal doughnut phenomenon." Univariate analysis suggested that complete resection of the sites showing the earliest augmentation of ictal HFOs was associated with a good surgical outcome. Significance: Recruitment of HFOs at 80-200 Hz in the rolandic area may play a role in determining seizure semiology in epileptic spasms. Our study using macroelectrodes demonstrated that ictal HFOs at 80-200 Hz preceded those at 210-300 Hz.

During the anesthesia, the brain activity level changed dramatically, so we could get the depth of anesthesia estimation from EEG recording. In previous research, most achievements were in the frequency-domain. In this paper, besides the frequency-domain features extraction, we have introduced the concept of "Entropy" as well as nonlinear feature. The results show that, with the deepening of anesthesia degree, approximate entropy(ApEn), Shannon entropy(SSE) and Lempel-Ziv complexity from EEG signal decrease gradually. Centre frequency towards to low frequency, total power shows a rising trend. Largest Lyapunov index also decreases, while the correlation dimension has no clear trend.

Recently, evidence has begun to accumulate in support of a role for alpha oscillations in attention selection and control. Here we first review evidence that 8-12 Hz oscillations in the brain have a general inhibitory role in cognitive processing, with an emphasis on their role in visual processing. Then, we summarize the evidence in support of our recent proposal that alpha represents a pulsed-inhibition of ongoing neural activity. The phase of the ongoing electroencephalography can influence evoked activity and subsequent processing, and we propose that alpha exerts its inhibitory role through alternating microstates of inhibition and excitation. Finally, we discuss evidence that this pulsed-inhibition can be entrained to rhythmic stimuli in the environment, such that preferential processing occurs for stimuli at predictable moments. The entrainment of preferential phase may provide a mechanism for temporal attention in the brain. This pulsed inhibitory account of alpha has important implications for many common cognitive phenomena, such as the attentional blink, and seems to indicate that our visual experience may at least some times be coming through in waves.

However, the logistics of real time EEG interpretation is challenging for the neurophysiology and critical care medicine teams. This study evaluated factors affecting the utility of digital trend analysis (DTA) for rapid seizure identification in children. Methods: Digital EEG files of seizures in critically ill children were retrieved for DTA. The envelop trend (ET) and compressed spectral array (CSA) were applied to the raw EEG data and presented to an experienced and inexperienced user for interpretation who were blinded to conventional EEG findings. The EEG findings with and without presence of seizures and features of seizures were analyzed. Results: We found that a number of factors affected accurate seizure detection including factors related to interpreter's experiences, display size and type of DTA methods used for analysis in addition to baseline EEG findings. ET was more dependent on user experience, furthermore, display size and multimodal DTA application (CSA and ET combined) increased the sensitivity of seizure detection for the experienced user compared to inexperience users. The artifacts were reported as seizures regardless of experience without presence of conventional EEG recording. The maximum spike amplitude, seizure duration, and seizure frequency were other important determinants for accuracy. Electrographic seizures with shorter duration were better detected by ET, and the maximum spike amplitude was important for both the ET and CSA. Repetitive seizures are readily detected by both digital trending methods. Artifacts may be reported as seizures regardless of experience if conventional EEG recording is not available for the interpretation. Conclusion: DTA applied to the raw EEG data does produce a graphic display that facilitates identification of seizures. The actual characteristics of the electrographic seizure may predict which DTA method is better and the overall accuracy of seizure detection may increase when multimodal trending is used simultaneously. Application of DTA alone with display of conventional EEG is beneficial for rapid interpretation of EEG findings regardless of experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study evaluated 2D-TCA's ability to detect various forms of both simulated epileptic activity and EEG-fMRI activity detected in patients. When applied to simulated data, 20-TCA consistently detected activity in 6 min runs containing 5 spikes/run, 10 spikes/run, and one 5s long event with hemodynamic response function amplitudes of at least 1.5%, 1.25%, and 1% above baseline respectively. When applied to patient data, while detection of interictal spikes was inconsistent, 2D-TCA consistently produced results similar to those obtained by EEG-fMRI when at least 2 prolonged interictal events (a few seconds each) occurred during the run. However, even for such cases it was determined that 2D-TCA can only be used to validate localization by other means or to create hypotheses as to where activity may occur, as it also detects changes not caused by epileptic activity.

High Frequency Oscillations Evoked by Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			POTENTIALS	The analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and / or fields (SEF) is a well-established and important tool for investigating the functioning of the peripheral and central human nervous system. A standard technique to evoke SEPs / SEFs is the stimulation of the median nerve by using a bipolar electrical stimulus. We aim at an alternative stimulation technique enabling stimulation of deep nerve structures while reducing patient stress and error susceptibility. In the current study, we apply a commercial transcranial magnetic stimulation system for peripheral magnetic stimulation of the median nerve. We compare the results of simultaneously recorded EEG signals to prove applicability of our technique to evoke SEPs including low frequency components (LFC) as well as high frequency oscillations (HFO). Therefore, we compare amplitude, latency and time-frequency characteristics of the SEP of 14 healthy volunteers after electric and magnetic stimulation. Both low frequency components and high frequency oscillations were detected. The HFOs were superimposed onto the primary cortical response N20. Statistical analysis revealed significantly lower amplitudes and increased latencies for LFC and HFO components after magnetic stimulation. The differences indicate the inability of magnetic stimulation to elicit supramaximal responses. A psycho-perceptual evaluation showed that magnetic stimulation was less unpleasant for 12 out of the 14 volunteers. In conclusion, we showed that LFC and HFO components related to median nerve stimulation can be evoked by peripheral magnetic stimulation.

This study examined the modulatory effects of COMT Val158Met on neural interactions, indicated by connectivity strengths. Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed EEG signals were collected in 254 healthy young females. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism was decoded into 3 groups: Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met. The values of mutual information of 20 frontal-related channel pairs across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were analyzed based on the time-frequency mutual information method. Our one-way ANOVA analyses revealed that the significant connection-frequency pairs were relatively left lateralized (P<0.01) and included F7-T3 and F7-C3 at delta frequency, and F3-F4, F7-T3, F7-C3, F7-P3, F3-C3, F3-F7 and F4-F8 at theta frequency. The F-test at F7-T3 and F7-C3 theta surpassed the statistical threshold of P<0.003 (after Bonferroni correction). For all the above connection-frequency pairs, there was a dose-dependent trend in the connectivity strengths of the alleles as follows: VaVVal>VaVMet>Met/Met. Our analyses complemented previous literature regarding neural modulation by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. The implication to the pathogenesis in schizophrenia was also discussed. Further studies are needed to clarify whether there is gender difference on this gene-brain interaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seventy-nine subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent EEG recording and MRI scan.. Three groups of AHC growing atrophy were obtained. The groups were characterized by the performance to cognitive tests and theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 relative power ratio. AHC atrophy is associated with memory deficits as well as with increase of theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 ratio. Moreover, when the amygdalar and hippocampal volume are separately considered, within AHC, the increase of theta/gamma ratio is best associated with amygdalar atrophy whereas alpha3/alpha2 ratio is best associated with hippocampal atrophy. AHC atrophy is associated with memory deficits and EEG markers of cognitive decline. So far, these EEG markers could have a prospective value in differential diagnosis between MCI who will convert in in Alzheimer's disease (AD), MCI converting in non-AD dementias and MCI non-converters. The alterations of the functional connections, inducing global network pathological changes, in the whole AHC could better explain MCI state.

This applies particularly to the perception of pain, which, in the brain, is associated with neuronal responses at different frequencies. Here, we show how these different neuronal responses subserve interindividual and intraindividual variations in the perception of identical painful stimuli. A time-frequency analysis of single trial electroencephalographic data indicates that pain-related responses in the theta frequency range but not at higher gamma frequencies code for interindividual variations in the perception of pain. In contrast, both pain-related theta and gamma responses provide different and complementary information on intraindividual variations in the pain experience. We conclude that theta responses reflect rather constant physiological and psychological traits of the individual, whereas gamma responses relate to short-term modulations of the individual's state. These findings reveal how neuronal responses at different frequencies differentially contribute to the translation of sensory information into a subjective percept.

Somatosensory gamma activity has not previously been examined. It has been suggested that a dysfunction basic to schizophrenia spectrum traits would involve proprioceptive information processing and this has recently been supported by the finding of diminished latency of early proprioceptive evoked potentials in a sample of chronic schizophrenia patients. The proprioceptive stimulus used previously, and presently, consisted of an abrupt increase of weight on a hand-held load. Eighteen first-time admitted schizophrenia spectrum patients and 18 healthy matched comparison subjects were included. Proprioceptive evoked potentials were recorded as 64-channels EEG for 120 trials in two runs differing in sequence. Contra-lateral evoked beta (latency 90 ms, frequency 21 Hz) and gamma (latency 70 ms, frequency 32 Hz) oscillations were attenuated in the patient group. The healthy comparison subjects had increased gamma amplitude in the left hemisphere in the regular sequence, a phenomenon not seen in the patients. The deviant findings were unexpectedly more circumscribed in the schizophrenia than in the schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) patients. Future studies should include several concurrent psychophysiological measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Infraslow EEG oscillations organize large-scale cortical-subcortical interactions during sleep: A combined EEG/fMRI study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Biological rhythms and sleep; Cortical oscillations; EEG; fMRI; Systems consolidation	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; RESTING HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE; ALPHA-RHYTHM; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; POWER-DENSITY; FMRI; NETWORK; MRI	Infraslow (<0.1 Hz) oscillations of brain activity, measured by EEG and other methods, have become a subject of increasing interest. While their prominence during sleep has been established, the functional significance of these oscillations for sleep physiology is unknown. To clarify this role, we examined correlations between infraslow EEG oscillations and BOLD fMRI during the course of natural sleep in healthy volunteers. Infraslow EEG oscillations appear to organize a broad dissociation of activity in cortical and subcortical regions: in general, correlations between power in the infraslow EEG band and BOLD were positive in subcortical regions and negative in the cortex. Robust negative correlations were found principally in paramedian heteromodal cortices whereas positive correlations were seen in cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia, lateral neocortices and hippocampus. This pattern of correlations suggests a mechanism by which infraslow oscillations may organize sleep-dependent neuroplastic processes including consolidation of episodic memory.

The data were analyzed using the event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) method. VD patients, compared with controls, showed decreased ERS effects in the delta frequency band (0.5-3.5Hz) of EEG after the target stimulus appeared in frontal, central and parietal regions. Similarly, elderly controls also showed a decreased ERS compared with young controls only in central and parietal regions. As part of this analysis, we introduce a novel quantitative index, the Event-related Energy Change Progression (EECP), which provides a reliable measure that distinguishes these groups and thereby provides a promising marker for early diagnosis of VD.

Recently, graph theory has been introduced to model connectivity in the brain. Small-world networks, such as the brain, combine optimal properties of both ordered and random networks, i.e., high clustering and short path lengths. We used graph theoretical concepts to examine changes in functional brain networks during normal development in young children. Resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded (14 channels) from 227 children twice at 5 and 7 years of age. Synchronization likelihood (SL) was calculated in three different frequency bands and between each pair of electrodes to obtain SL-weighted graphs. Mean normalized clustering index, average path length and weight dispersion were calculated to characterize network organization. Repeated measures analysis of variance tested for time and gender effects. For all frequency bands mean SL decreased from 5 to 7 years. Clustering coefficient increased in the alpha band. Path length increased in all frequency bands. Mean normalized weight dispersion decreased in beta band. Girls showed higher synchronization for all frequency bands and a higher mean clustering in alpha and beta bands. The overall decrease in functional connectivity (SL) might reflect pruning of unused synapses and preservation of strong connections resulting in more cost-effective networks. Accordingly, we found increases in average clustering and path length and decreased weight dispersion indicating that normal brain maturation is characterized by a shift from random to more organized small-world functional networks. This developmental process is influenced by gender differences early in development. Hum Brain Mapp 32:413-425, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The observed clinical effects are in the moderate range and it has been suggested that the efficiency of brain stimulation depends on the underlying cortical state. Objective To isolate and manipulate brain rhythms associated with cortical excitability. Methods In the first experiment electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were interleaved to study associations between brain oscillations and the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) during isometric contraction. Results of the first experiment were used in a second experiment to selectively modulate cortical excitability levels by applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Results A linear regression showed that MEP amplitude could be modeled by theta (4-7 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations recorded over the left and right MI. Significant increases in cortical excitability were found after theta (5 Hz)-beta (20 Hz) tACS as compared with baseline and alpha (10 Hz) tACS. Conclusions Scalp-recorded brain oscillations can serve as a proxy for the effective modulation of cortical excitability by mimicking natural brain rhythms using weak electric currents.

The neuronal mechanisms for sustaining coherent visual information and the mechanisms for limited VWM capacity have remained uncharacterized. Although numerous studies have utilized behavioral accuracy, neural activity, and connectivity to explore the mechanism of VWM retention, little is known about the load-related changes in functional connectivity for hemi-field VWM retention. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 14 normal young adults while they performed a bilateral visual field memory task. Subjects had more rapid and accurate responses to the left visual field (LVF) memory condition. The difference in mean amplitude between the ipsilateral and contralateral event-related potential (ERP) at parietal-occipital electrodes in retention interval period was obtained with six different memory loads. Functional connectivity between 128 scalp regions was measured by EEG phase synchronization in the theta-(4-8 Hz), alpha-(8-12 Hz), beta-(12-32 Hz), and gamma-(32-40 Hz) frequency bands. The resulting matrices were converted to graphs, and mean degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path length was computed as a function of memory load. The results showed that brain networks of theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency bands were load-dependent and visual-field dependent. The networks of theta-and alpha-bands phase synchrony were most predominant in retention period for right visual field (RVF) WM than for LVF WM. Furthermore, only for RVF memory condition, brain network density of theta-band during the retention interval were linked to the delay of behavior reaction time, and the topological property of alpha-band network was negative correlation with behavior accuracy. Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that the differences in theta-and alpha-bands between LVF and RVF conditions in functional connectivity and topological properties during retention period may result in the decline of behavioral performance in RVF task.

High-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during eyes-open resting and CPT performance in 16 right-handed children meeting the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and 16 age-matched controls. Significant CPT vs. eyes-open differences in EEG activities was observed in children with ADHD. In particular, switching to CPT induced an alpha power increase in children with ADHD and an alpha power decrease in controls. This may reflect a primary deficit associated with cortical hypoarousal in ADHD. These EEG results agree with behavioral findings leading the authors to suggest that dynamic changes in neural network activities are impaired in children with ADHD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Stability of Clinical Condition in Mild Cognitive Impairment is Related to Cortical Sources of Alpha Rhythms: An Electroencephalographic Study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; electroencephalography; alpha rhythms; low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; cognitive decline	BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VASCULAR-LESIONS; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CEREBROVASCULAR LESIONS; CHOLINERGIC FIBERS; SPECTRAL POWER; NORMATIVE DATA; EEG	Previous evidence has shown that resting eyes-closed cortical alpha rhythms are higher in amplitude in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects (Babiloni et al. [2006a]: Human Brain Mapp 27:162-172; [2006b]: Clin Neurophysiol 117:252-268; [2006c]: Neuroimage 29:948-964; [2006d]: Ann Neurol 59:323-334; [2006e]: Clin Neurophysiol 117:1113-1129; [2006f]: Neuroimage 31:1650-1665). This study tested the hypothesis that, in amnesic MCI subjects, high amplitude of baseline cortical alpha rhythms is related to long-term stability of global cognition on clinical follow-up. Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 100 amnesic MCI subjects during eyes-closed condition. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), and beta2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical EEG sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Global cognition was indexed by mini mental state evaluation (MMSE) score at the time of EEG recordings (baseline) and about after 1 year. Based on the MMSE percentage difference between baseline and 1-year follow-up (MMSEvar), the MCI subjects were retrospectively divided into three arbitrary groups: DECREASED (MMSEvar <= -4%; N = 43), STABLE (MMSEvar approximate to 0; N = 27), and INCREASED (MMSEvar >= +4%; N = 30). Subjects' age, education, individual alpha frequency, gender, and MMSE scores were used as covariates for statistical analysis. Baseline posterior cortical sources of alpha 1 rhythms were higher in amplitude in the STABLE than in the DECREASED and INCREASED groups. These results suggest that preserved resting cortical neural synchronization at alpha frequency is related to a long-term (1 year) stable cognitive function in MCI subjects. Future studies should use serial MMSE measurements to confirm and refine the present results. Hum Brain Mapp 32:1916-1931, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The symptoms of N-REM stage 2 are sleep spindle and K-complex and here sleep spindles are automatically recognized by using time and frequency domain features belonging to EEG (Electroencephalograph) signals obtained from three patient subjects. In this study, the proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, six time domain features have been extracted from raw EEG signals. As for the extraction of frequency domain features from raw EEG signals, Welch spectral analysis has been used and applied to raw EEG signals. By this way, 65 frequency domain features have been extracted and reduced from 65 to 4 features by using statistical measures including minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and mean values. Three feature sets including only time domain, only frequency domain, and both time and frequency domain features have been used and the numbers of these feature sets are 6, 4, and 10, respectively. In the second step, artificial neural network (ANN) with LM (Levenberg-Marquardt) has been used to classify the sleep spindles evaluated beforehand by sleep expert physicians. The obtained classification accuracies for three features sets in the classification of sleep spindles are 100%, 56.86%, and 93.84% by using LM-ANN (for ten node in hidden layer). The obtained results have presented that the proposed recognition system could be confidently used in the automatic classification of sleep spindles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigated the specific involvement of each primary motor cortex (M1) during a bimanual load-lifting task in which subjects were required to maintain a stable forearm position during voluntary unloading. Kinematics, electromyographic, and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in eight right-handed healthy subjects lifting a load placed on their left forearm. Two EEG analyses were performed: a time-frequency (TF) analysis and an event-related potential (ERP) analysis. The TF analysis revealed a mean power decrease in the mu rhythm over the left and right M1 concomitant with lifting onset. Each decrease showed specific features: over the right M1, contralateral to the postural forearm, there was a steeper slope and a greater amplitude than over the left M1. Although a mu rhythm desynchronization has until now been the signature of cortical activity related to a motor component, we show that it can also be related to postural stabilization. We discuss the involvement of the mu rhythm desynchronization over the postural M1 in the high temporal precision enabling efficient APAs. ERP analysis showed a negative wave over the left M1 and a concomitant positive wave over the right M1. While the negative wave classically reflects M1 recruitment related to the forthcoming lifting, the novelty here is that the positive wave reflects the transmission of inhibitory commands toward the postural forearm.

EPILAB: A software package for studies on the prediction of epileptic seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure prediction; EEG/ECG processing; Artificial neural networks; Support vector machines; Seizure prediction characteristic	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; OPEN SOURCE TOOLBOX; NON-PHASE-COHERENT; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTION; LONG	A Matlab (R)-based software package, EPILAB, was developed for supporting researchers in performing studies on the prediction of epileptic seizures. It provides an intuitive and convenient graphical user interface. Fundamental concepts that are crucial for epileptic seizure prediction studies were implemented. This includes, for example, the development and statistical validation of prediction methodologies in long-term continuous recordings. Seizure prediction is usually based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals. EPILAB is able to process both EEG and ECG data stored in different formats. More than 35 time and frequency domain measures (features) can be extracted based on univariate and multivariate data analysis. These features can be post-processed and used for prediction purposes. The predictions may be conducted based on optimized thresholds or by applying classifications methods such as artificial neural networks, cellular neuronal networks, and support vector machines. EPILAB proved to be an efficient tool for seizure prediction, and aims to be a way to communicate, evaluate, and compare results and data among the seizure prediction community.

Three feature extraction techniques were developed to capture temporal, morphological, and time-frequency (wavelet) characteristics of EEG data. Two most commonly used data mining techniques, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), were employed to classify EEG samples associated with correct and erroneous keystrokes. The leave-one-error-pattern-out and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation methods were designed to evaluate the in-and cross-subject classification performances, respectively. For the in-subject classification, the best testing performance had a sensitivity of 62.20% and a specificity of 51.68%, which were achieved by SVM using morphological features. For the cross-subject classification, the best testing performance was achieved by LDA using temporal features, based on which it had a sensitivity of 68.72% and a specificity of 49.45%. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the averaged values of the area under ROC curves of LDA and SVM for the in- and cross-subject classifications were both greater than 0.60 using the EEG 300 ms prior to the keystrokes. The classification results of this study indicated that the EEG patterns of erroneous keystrokes might be different from those of the correct ones. As a result, it may be possible to predict erroneous keystrokes prior to error occurrence. The classification problem addressed in this study is extremely challenging due to the very limited number of erroneous keystrokes made by each subject and the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the EEG data. However, the outcome of this study is quite encouraging, and it is promising to develop a prospective early detection system for erroneous keystrokes based on brain-wave signals.

Single-trial regression elucidates the role of prefrontal theta oscillations in response conflict	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; oscillations; response conflict; cognitive control; single trial; regression; theta; medial frontal cortex	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; ERROR; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; VARIABILITY; INHIBITION; ADAPTATION; ACTIVATION	In most cognitive neuroscience experiments there are many behavioral and experimental dynamics, and many indices of brain activity, that vary from trial to trial. For example, in studies of response conflict, conflict is usually treated as a binary variable (i.e., response conflict exists or does not in any given trial), whereas some evidence and intuition suggests that conflict may vary in intensity from trial to trial. Here we demonstrate that single-trial multiple regression of time-frequency electrophysiological activity reveals neural mechanisms of cognitive control that are not apparent in cross-trial averages. We also introduce a novel extension to oscillation phase coherence and synchronization analyses, based on "weighted" phase modulation, that has advantages over standard coherence measures in terms of linking electrophysiological dynamics to trial-varying behavior and experimental variables. After replicating previous response conflict findings using trial-averaged data, we extend these findings using single-trial analytic methods to provide novel evidence for the role of medial frontal-lateral prefrontal theta-band synchronization in conflict-induced response time dynamics, including a role for lateral prefrontal theta-band activity in biasing response times according to perceptual conflict. Given that these methods shed new light on the prefrontal mechanisms of response conflict, they are also likely to be useful for investigating other neurocognitive processes.

For the first time the complexity parameter of EEG is extracted by order recurrence plot and correlation dimension method, which reflects the functional state of the brain under acupuncture. The effects of acupuncture on the functional region of brain and correlation among different acupuncture frequencies and the complexity of EEG are investigated. The results show that the complexity of EEG during acupuncture is higher than that before acupuncture and especially during acupuncture at a frequency of 100 times/min. Furthermore, the determinism (HET) extracted from EEG signals of electrodes FP2, F7 and T3 can be used as a characteristic parameter of distinction between the state during acupuncture and the state before acupuncture.

Cortical oscillatory activity and the induction of plasticity in the human motor cortex	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; theta burst stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION; THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PERIPHERAL-NERVE STIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SKILL ACQUISITION; MUSCLE RESPONSES; REPETITIVE TMS	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms such as continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) induce long-term potentiation- and long-term depression-like plasticity in the human motor cortex. However, responses to cTBS are highly variable and may depend on the activity of the cortex at the time of stimulation. We investigated whether power in different electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands predicted the response to subsequent cTBS, and conversely whether cTBS had after-effects on the EEG. cTBS may utilize similar mechanisms of plasticity to motor learning; thus, we conducted a parallel set of experiments to test whether ongoing electroencephalography could predict performance of a visuomotor training task, and whether training itself had effects on the EEG. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) provided an index of cortical excitability pre- and post-intervention. The EEG was recorded over the motor cortex pre- and post-intervention, and power spectra were computed. cTBS reduced MEP amplitudes; however, baseline power in the delta, theta, alpha or beta frequencies did not predict responses to cTBS or learning of the visuomotor training task. cTBS had no effect on delta, theta, alpha or beta power. In contrast, there was an increase in alpha power following visuomotor training that was positively correlated with changes in MEP amplitude post-training. The results suggest that the EEG is not a useful state-marker for predicting responses to plasticity-inducing paradigms. The correlation between alpha power and changes in corticospinal excitability following visuomotor training requires further investigation, but may be related to disengagement of the somatosensory system important for motor memory consolidation.

Common time-frequency analysis of local field potential and pyramidal cell activity in seizure-like events of the rat hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; NEURONS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; EPILEPSY; GAMMA; EEG; CA1	To study cell-field dynamics, physiologists simultaneously record local field potentials and the activity of individual cells from animals performing cognitive tasks, during various brain states or under pathological conditions. However, apart from spike shape and spike timing analyses, few studies have focused on elucidating the common time-frequency structure of local field activity relative to surrounding cells across different periods of phenomena. We have used two algorithms, multi-window time frequency analysis and wavelet phase coherence (WPC), to study common intracellular-extracellular (I-E) spectral features in spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs) from rat hippocampal slices in a low magnesium epilepsy model. Both algorithms were applied to 'pairs' of simultaneously observed I-E signals from slices in the CA1 hippocampal region. Analyses were performed over a frequency range of 1-100 Hz. I-E spectral commonality varied in frequency and time. Higher commonality was observed from 1 to 15 Hz, and lower commonality was observed in the 15-100 Hz frequency range. WPC was lower in the non-SLE region compared to SLE activity; however, there was no statistical difference in the 30-45 Hz band between SLE and non-SLE modes. This work provides evidence of strong commonality in various frequency bands of I-E SLEs in the rat hippocampus, not only during SLEs but also immediately before and after.	[Cotic, M.; Bardakjian, B.

We showed that RS can be also triggered by internal processes alone. When individuals perform repetitive covert movements, that is, motor imagery or quasi-movements, both of which are associated with pericentral cortical activity without muscle activations, there was a significant recovery of electroencephalographic oscillations over sensorimotor cortices back to resting baseline level. After 58s of task performance only 20% of alpha and 5% of beta suppressions remained (overt movements: 34% remaining in alpha, complete recovery in b). This result suggests that various, possibly all, repeated cerebral activations are associated with RS, presumably reflecting the adaptation to stereotyped activation in neural networks.

We evaluated the relationship of the resection of focal brain regions containing high-rate interictal HFOs and the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) determined by visual EEG analysis with the postsurgical seizure outcome, using extraoperative intracranial EEG monitoring in pediatric patients and automated HFO detection. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 28 pediatric epilepsy patients who underwent extraoperative intracranial video-EEG monitoring prior to focal resection. Utilizing the automated analysis, we identified interictal HFOs during 20 min of sleep EEG and determined the brain regions containing high-rate HFOs. We investigated spatial relationships between regions with high-rate HFOs and SOZs. We compared the size of these regions, the surgical resection, and the amount of the regions with high-rate HFOs/SOZs within the resection area with seizure outcome. Key Findings: Ten patients were completely seizure-free and 18 were not at 2 years after surgery. The brain regions with high-rate ripples were larger than those with high-rate FRs (p = 0.0011) with partial overlap. More complete resection of the regions with high-rate FRs significantly correlated with a better seizure outcome (p = 0.046). More complete resection of the regions with high-rate ripples tended to improve seizure outcome (p = 0.091); however, the resection of SOZ did not influence seizure outcome (p = 0.18). The size of surgical resection was not associated with seizure outcome (p = 0.22-0.39). Significance: The interictal high-rate FRs are a possible surrogate marker of the epileptogenic zone. Interictal ripples are not as specific a marker of the epileptogenic zone as interictal FRs. Resection of the brain regions with high-rate interictal FRs in addition to the SOZ may achieve a better seizure outcome.

Methods: We studied six patients with focal epilepsy who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) recording. Patients were asked to overtly name images presented sequentially in the picture naming task and to overtly read written words in the reading task. Results: Both tasks commonly elicited gamma-augmentation (maximally at 80-100 Hz) on ECoG in the occipital, inferior-occipital-temporal and inferior-Rolandic areas, bilaterally. Picture naming, compared to reading task, elicited greater gamma-augmentation in portions of pre-motor areas as well as occipital and inferior-occipital-temporal areas, bilaterally. In contrast, word reading elicited greater gamma-augmentation in portions of bilateral occipital, left occipital-temporal and left superior-posterior-parietal areas. Gamma-attenuation was elicited by both tasks in portions of posterior cingulate and ventral pre-motor-prefrontal areas bilaterally. The number of letters in a presented word was positively correlated to the degree of gamma-augmentation in the medial occipital areas. Conclusions: Gamma-augmentation measured on ECoG identified cortical areas commonly and differentially involved in picture naming and reading tasks. Longer words may activate the primary visual cortex for the more peripheral field. Significance: The present study increases our understanding of the visual-language pathways.

J	Cao, C; Slobounov, S				Cao, Cheng; Slobounov, Semyon			Application of a novel measure of EEG non-stationarity as 'Shannon-entropy of the peak frequency shifting' for detecting residual abnormalities in concussed individuals	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Non-stationarity; Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)	POSTURAL CONTROL; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-INJURY; COLLEGIATE; DEFICITS	Objective: The aim of this report was to propose a novel measure of non-stationarity of EEG signals, named Shannon-entropy of the peak frequency shifting (SEPFS). The feasibility of this method was documented comparing this measure with traditional time domain assessment of non-stationarity and its application to EEG data sets obtained from student-athletes before and after suffering a single episode of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with age-matched normal controls. Methods: Instead of assessing the power density distribution on the time-frequency plane, like previously proposed measures of signal non-stationarity, this new measure is based on the shift of the dominant frequency of the EEG signal over time. We applied SEPFS measure to assess the properties of EEG non-stationarity in subjects before and shortly after they suffered mTBI. Student-athletes at high risk for mTBI (n = 265) were tested prior to concussive episodes as a baseline. From this subject pool, 30 athletes who suffered from mTBI were retested on day 30 post-injury. Additional subjects pool (student-athletes without history of concussion, n = 30) were recruited and test-re-tested within the same 30 day interval. Thirty-two channels EEG signals were acquired in sitting eyes closed condition. Results: The results showed that the SEPFS values significantly decreased in subjects suffering from mTBI. Specifically, reduced EEG non-stationarity was observed in occipital, temporal and central brain areas, indicating the possibility of residual brain dysfunctions in concussed individuals. A similar but less statistically significant trend was observed using traditional time domain analysis of EEG non-stationarity. Conclusions: The proposed measure has at least two merits of interest: (1) it is less affected by the limited resolution of time-frequency representation of the EEG signal; (2) it takes into account the neural characteristics of the EEG signal that have not been considered in previously proposed measures of non-stationarity. Significance: This new method may potentially be used as a complementary tool to assess the alteration of brain functions as a result of mTBI.

Gamma in motion: Pattern reversal elicits stronger gamma-band responses than motion	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Gamma-band oscillations; 40 Hz; Motion; Contrast; Fixational eye movements	EARLY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS; DEPENDENT NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MEMORY; EEG; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; MICROSACCADES	Previous studies showed higher gamma-band responses (GBRs, approximate to 40 Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) for moving compared to stationary stimuli. However, it is unclear whether this modulation by motion reflects a special responsiveness of the GBR to the stimulus feature "motion," or whether GBR enhancements of similar magnitude can be elicited also by a salient change within a static stimulus that does not include motion. Therefore, we measured the EEG of healthy subjects watching stationary square wave gratings of high contrast that either started to move or reversed their black and white pattern shortly after their onset. The strong contrast change of the pattern reversal represented a salient but motionless change within the grating that was compared to the onset of the stationary grating and the motion onset. Induced and evoked GBRs were analyzed for all three display conditions. In order to assess the influenceof fixational eye movements on the induced GBRs, we also examined the time courses of microsaccade rates during the three display conditions. Amplitudes of both evoked and induced GBRs were stronger for pattern reversal than for motion onset. There was no significant amplitude difference between the onsets of the stationary and moving gratings. However, mean frequencies of the induced GBR were similar to 10 Hz higher in response to the onsets of moving compared to stationary gratings. Furthermore, the modulations of the induced GBR did not parallel the modulations of microsaccade rate, indicating that our induced GBRs reflect neuronal processes. These results suggest that, within the gamma-band range, the encoding of moving gratings in early visual cortex is primarily based on an upward frequency shift, whereas contrast changes within static gratings are reflected by amplitude enhancement.

We have explored the quantitative relationship between the mean FDs and EEG wide range high frequency (8-50 Hz) activity during ketamine/xylazine versus nembutal anesthesia at surgical plane. Using FD we detected distinct inter-structure complexity pattern and uncovered for the first time that the polygraphically and behaviorally defined anesthetized state at surgical plane as equal during experiment in two anesthetic regimens, is not the same with respect to the degree of neuronal activity (degree of generalized neuronal inhibition achieved) at different brain levels. Using the correlation of certain brain structure EEG spectral characteristics with their corresponding FDs, and the surrogate data modeling, we determined what particular frequency band contributes to EEG complexities in ketamine/xylazine versus nembutal anesthesia. In this study we have shown that the quantitative relationship between higher frequency EEG amplitude and EEG complexity is the best-modeled by surrogate data as a 3rd order polynomial. On the base of our EEG amplitude/EEG complexity relationship model, and the evidenced spectral differences in ketamine versus nembutal anesthesia we have proved that higher amplitudes of sigma, beta, and gamma frequency in ketamine anesthesia yields to higher FDs.

We introduce the more principled connectivity terminology developed recently in neuroimaging and review some of the key concepts related to the characterization of propagation of epileptic activity using what may be called traditional correlation-based studies based on EEG. We then show how essentially similar methodologies, and more recently models addressing causality, have been used to characterize whole-brain and regional networks using functional MRI data.

Four professional saxophonists wore pre-wired EEG caps (30 electrodes placed according to an augmented 10-20 system; cephalic reference and ground). Each cap was connected to a single multi-channel amplifier box [Brain Explorer (BE), EB-Neuro (c)]. The four boxes converged to a single workstation equipped with a software (GALILEO NT, EB-Neuro (c)) allowing the simultaneous recording of sounds, digital trigger, and EEG-electrooculographic (EOG)-electromyographic (EMG) data, and providing a separate output file for each individual. Noteworthy, the subjects were electrically decoupled to satisfy international safety guidelines. The quality of the EEG data was confirmed by the rate of artifact-free EEG epochs (about 80%) and by EEG spectral features. During the resting state, dominant EEG power density values were observed at alpha band (8-12 Hz) in posterior cortex. The quality of EMG can be used to identify "on" and "off" states of the musicians' motor performance, thus potentially allowing the investigation of the relationships between EEG dynamics and different characteristics of the specific performance. During the music performance, alpha power density values decreased in amplitude in several cortical regions, whereas power density values enhanced within narrow high-frequency bands. In conclusion, the present methodological approach appeared to be suitable for simultaneous EEG recordings in musicians playing in ensemble. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.

Abnormalities of Neuronal Oscillations and Temporal Integration to Low- and High-Frequency Auditory Stimulation in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory steady-state; gamma; M100; magnetoencephalography; schizophrenia; theta	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INTERNEURON NETWORKS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; GABA NEURONS; IN-VIVO; MECHANISMS; CORTEX	Background: Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies indicate among schizophrenia patients (SZ) abnormal, often reduced, entrained steady-state (aSSR) and transient (N100/M100) neural responses to auditory stimuli. We complement this literature by focusing analyses on auditory cortices, assessing a wide range of stimulation frequencies with long driving periods and evaluating relationships between aSSR and M100 reductions in SZ. Methods: Seventeen SZ and 17 healthy subjects (H) participated. Stimuli were 1500 msec binaural broadband noise sequences modulated at 5, 20, 40, 80, or 160 Hz. Magnetoencephalography data were collected and co-registered with structural magnetic resonance images. The aSSRs and M100s projected into brain space were analyzed as a function of hemisphere, stimulus density, and time. Results: For aSSR, SZ displayed weaker entrainment bilaterally at low (5-Hz) and high (80-Hz) modulation frequencies. To 40-Hz stimuli, SZ showed weaker entrainment only in right auditory cortex. For M100, while responses for H increased linearly with stimulus density, this effect was weaker or absent in SZ. A principal components analysis of SZ deficits identified low (5-Hz entrainment and M100) and high (40- to 80-Hz entrainment) frequency components. Discriminant analysis indicated that the low-frequency component uniquely differentiated SZ from H. The high-frequency component correlated with negative symptoms among SZ. Conclusions: The SZ auditory cortices were unable to 1) generate healthy levels of theta and high gamma band (80-Hz) entrainment (aSSR), and 2) augment transient responses (M100s) to rapidly presented auditory information (an index of temporal integration). Only the latter was most apparent in left hemisphere and may reflect a prominent neurophysiological deficit in schizophrenia.	[Hamm, Jordan P.; Picchetti, Natalie A.

Considering that the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is nonstationarity, a method of wavelet analysis is proposed to extract EEG based left and right hand motor imagery. First of all, the instantaneous average power of EEG was calculated. Then, a wavelet decomposing for five layers proceeded to EEG's average power by using db5 wavelet. Finally, the feature of motor imagery EEG was extracted by reconstructing the approximation coefficients and the detail coefficients. The results have shown that this method can effectively extract the signals of event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS / ERD) based on left and right hand motor imagery task. Meanwhile, we also obtain the time when the features change. Therefore, this method can extract the EEG's time-frequency information which can not be obtained by the conventional EEG analysis, and make a foundation for the classification of motor imagery tasks.

Few studies addressed brain electric activity changes after on-pump operations. Eyes closed EEG was performed in 22 patients (mean age: 45.2 +/- 11.2) before and two weeks after valve replacement. Spouses of patients were invited to participate as controls. Generalized increase of beta power most prominent in beta-1 band was an unambiguous pathological sign of postoperative cortex dysfunction, probably, manifesting due to gamma-activity slowing ("beta buzz" symptom). Generalized postoperative increase of delta-1 mean frequency along with increase of slow-wave activity in right posterior region may be hypothesized to be a consequence of intraoperative ischemia as well. At the same time, significant changes of alpha activity were observed in both patient and control groups, and, therefore, may be considered as physiological. Unexpectedly, controls showed prominent increase of electric activity in left temporal region whereas patients were deficient in left hemisphere activity in comparison with controls at postoperative followup. Further research is needed in order to determine the true neurological meaning of the EEG findings after on-pump operations.

Information contained in these signals varies as a function of the spatial scale at which recordings are done: from single cell recording to large scale macroscopic fields, e.g., scalp EEG. Microscopic and macroscopic measurements and models in Neuroscience are often in conflict. Solving this conflict might require the developments of a sort of bio-statistical physics, a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual cells to the macroscopic or bulk properties of neural circuits. Such a framework can only emerge in Neuroscience from the systematic analysis and modeling of the diverse recording scales from simultaneous measurements. In this article we briefly review the different measurement scales and models in modern neuroscience to try to identify the sources of conflict that might ultimately help to create a unified theory of brain electromagnetic fields. We argue that seen the different recording scales, from the single cell to the large scale fields measured by the scalp electroencephalogram, as derived from a unique physical magnitude-the electric potential that is measured in all cases-might help to conciliate microscopic and macroscopic models of neural function as well as the animal and human neuroscience literature.

Methods: Forty-one AD, 38 aMCI, and 39 HC subjects underwent quantitative EEG and comprehensive neuropsychological tests. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to identify differences in EEG spectral power among the three groups by scalp region and EEG frequency. Correlations between region and frequency specific spectral powers and neuropsychological test scores were evaluated. Results: Temporal and parieto-occipital theta band powers were highest in AD. Whereas, parieto-occipital alpha and frontal and temporal beta 2 band powers were highest in HC and lowest in AD (p < 0.05). Temporal and parieto-occipital theta powers negatively correlated with verbal and visuospatial memory recall, while parieto-occipital alpha and temporal beta 2 powers positively correlated with verbal memory recall (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Region and frequency specific oscillatory characteristics of EEG reflect domain-specific cognitive function in patients with aMCI and AD. Significance: Region and frequency specific spectral powers have clinical implications as additional markers differentiating AD, aMCI, and HC.

Analysis of Electrical Brain Waves in Neurotoxicology: Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate	CURRENT NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Domoic acid; ibogaine; cocaine; gamma hydroxybutyrate; cerebral cortex; electrocorticogram; power spectra	RAT; ACID; RECEPTOR; GABA; EEG	Advances in computer technology have allowed quantification of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and expansion of quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis in neurophysiology, as well as clinical neurology, with great success. Among the variety of techniques in this field, frequency (spectral) analysis using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) provides a sensitive tool for time-course studies of different compounds acting on particular neurotransmitter systems. Studies presented here include Electrocorticogram (ECoG) analysis following exposure to a glutamic acid analogue-domoic acid (DOM), psychoactive indole alkaloid-ibogaine, as well as cocaine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The ECoG was recorded in conscious rats via a tether and swivel system. The EEG signal frequency analysis revealed an association between slow-wave EEG activity delta and theta and the type of behavioral seizures following DOM administration. Analyses of power spectra obtained in rats exposed to cocaine alone or after pretreatment with ibogaine indicated the contribution of the serotonergic system in ibogaine mediated response to cocaine (increased power in alpha 1 band). Ibogaine also lowered the threshold for cocaine-induced electrographic seizures (increased power in the low-frequency bands, delta and theta). Daily intraperitoneal administration of cocaine for two weeks was associated with a reduction in slow-wave ECoG activity 24 hrs following the last injection when compared with controls. Similar decreased cortical activity in low-frequency bands observed in chronic cocaine users has been associated with reduced metabolic activity in the frontal cortex. The FFT analyses of power spectra relative to baseline indicated a significant energy increase over all except beta 2 frequency bands following exposure to 400 and 800 mg/kg GHB. The EEG alterations detected in rats following exposure to GHB resemble absence seizures observed in human petit mal epilepsy. Spectral analysis of the EEG signals combined with behavioral observations may prove to be a useful approach in studying chronic exposure to drugs of abuse and treatment of drug dependence.

Between this meeting and the inaugural 2009 event, a much clearer picture has been emerging of cortical ECoG physiology and its relationship to local field potentials and single-cell recordings. Innovations in material engineering are advancing the goal of a stable long-term recording interface. Continued evolution of ECoG-driven brain-computer interface technology is determining innovation in neuroprosthetics. Improvements in instrumentation and statistical methodologies continue to elucidate ECoG correlates of normal human function as well as the ictal state. This proceedings document summarizes the current status of this rapidly evolving field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Schaefer, RS; Vlek, RJ; Desain, P				Schaefer, Rebecca S.; Vlek, Rutger J.; Desain, Peter			Music perception and imagery in EEG: Alpha band effects of task and stimulus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mental imagery; Music perception; Electroencephalography	OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION	Previous work has shown that mental imagination of sound generally elicits an increase of alpha band activity (8-12 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). In addition, alpha activity has been shown to be related to aspects of music processing. In the current study, EEG signatures were investigated for perception and imagery of two different natural musical phrases. The responses are compared between tasks and between stimuli. For all tasks and stimuli, posterior alpha band activity was seen, but differences are shown in the power of this response. As expected, imagery resulted in a significantly stronger alpha activation than perception. The comparison of the averaged responses to the stimuli also showed a difference in alpha power, although this effect is seen in different directions. These results are interpreted to indicate that both the tasks and the stimuli modulate an attentional network, which may relate to the inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas, as well as engagement with the music.

During NREM sleep, cortical neurons oscillate approximately once every second between a depolarized upstate, when cortical neurons are actively firing, and a hyperpolarized downstate, when cortical neurons are virtually silent (Destexhe et al., 1999; Steriade et al., 1993a, 2001). Intracellular recordings indicate that the origins of the slow oscillation are cortical and that corticocortical connections are necessary for their synchronization (Amzica and Steriade, 1995; Steriade et al., 1993b; Timofeev and Steriade, 1996; Timofeev et al., 2000). The currents produced by the near-synchronous slow oscillation of large populations of neurons appear on the scalp as electroencephalogram (EEG) slow waves (Amzica and Steriade, 1997). Despite this cellular understanding, questions remain about the role of specific cortical structures in individual slow waves. Early EEG studies of slow waves in humans were limited by the small number of derivations employed and by the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to underlying brain activity (Brazier, 1949; Roth et al., 1956). Functional neuroimaging methods offer exceptional spatial resolution, but lack the temporal resolution to track individual slow waves (Dang-Vu et al., 2008; Maquet, 2000). Intracranial recordings in patient populations are limited by the availability of medically necessary electrode placements and can be confounded by pathology and medications (Cash et al., 2009; Nir et al., 2011; Wenneberg 2010). Source modeling of high-density EEG recordings offers a unique opportunity for neuroimaging sleep slow waves. So far, the results have challenged several of the influential topographic observations about slow waves that had persisted since the original EEG recordings of sleep. These recent analyses revealed that individual slow waves are idiosyncratic cortical events and that the negative peak of the EEG slow wave often involves cortical structures not necessarily apparent from the scalp, like the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus (Murphy et al., 2009). In addition, not only do slow waves travel (Massimini et al., 2004), but they often do so preferentially through the areas comprising the major connectional backbone of the human cortex (Hagmann et al., 2008). In this chapter, we will review the cellular, intracranial recording, and neuroimaging results concerning EEG slow waves. We will also confront a long held belief about peripherally evoked slow waves, also known as K-complexes, namely that they are modality independent and do not involve cortical sensory pathways. The analysis included here is the first to directly compare K-complexes evoked with three different stimulation modalities within the same subject on the same night using high-density EEG.

Ischemic stroke selectively inhibits REM sleep of rats	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Stroke; Sleep; Animal models; Rat; EEG; REM; NREM; Ischemia; Physiological monitoring	HEMISPHERIC STROKE; EEG; RISK; COHERENCE; CYTOKINES; PATTERNS; WAKING; APNEA	Sleep disorders are important risk factors for stroke; conversely, stroke patients suffer from sleep disturbances including disruptions of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and a decrease in total sleep. This study was performed to characterize the effect of stroke on sleep architecture of rats using continuous electroencephalography (EEG) and activity monitoring. Rats were implanted with transmitters which enabled continuous real time recording of EEG, electromyography (EMG), and locomotor activity. Baseline recordings were performed prior to induction of either transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion or sham surgery. Sleep recordings were obtained for 60 h after surgery to identify periods of wakefulness. NREM, and REM sleep before and after stroke. Spectral analysis was performed to assess the effects of stroke on state-dependent EEG. Finally, we quantified the time in wake. NREM, and REM sleep before and after stroke. Delta power, a measure of NREM sleep depth, was increased the day following stroke. At the same time, there was a significant shift in theta rhythms to a lower frequency during REM and wake periods. The awake EEG slowed after stroke over both hemispheres. The EEG of the ischemic hemisphere demonstrated diminished theta power specific to REM in excess of the slowing seen over the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to rats exposed to sham surgery which had slightly increased total sleep, rats undergoing stroke experienced decreased total sleep. The decrease in total sleep after stroke was the result of dramatic reduction in the amount of REM sleep after ischemia. The suppression of REM after stroke was due to a decrease in the number of REM bouts; the length of the average REM bout did not change. We conclude that after stroke in this experimental model, REM sleep of rats is specifically and profoundly suppressed. Further experiments using this experimental model should be performed to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of REM suppression after stroke. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ictal high-frequency oscillations in neocortical epilepsy: implications for seizure localization and surgical resection	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; High frequency oscillations; Intracranial EEG; Seizure	HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; ONSET; NETWORK; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; BRAIN; HZ	Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of intracranial ictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). Methods: Among neocortical epilepsy patients who underwent intracranial monitoring and surgery, we studied patients with well-defined, unifocal seizure onsets characterized by discrete HFOs (>= 70 Hz). Patients with multifocal or bilateral independent seizure onsets, electroencephalography (EEG) acquired at <1,000 Hz sampling rate, and nonresective surgery were excluded. Based on a prospectively defined protocol, we defined the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) presurgically to include only those channels with HFOs that showed subsequent sustained evolution (HFOs+ channels) but not the channels that lacked evolution (HFOs- channels). We then resected the SOZ as defined above, 1 cm of the surrounding cortex, and immediate spread area, modified by the presence of eloquent cortex in the vicinity. For purposes of this study, we also defined the SOZ based on the conventional frequency activity (CFA, <70 Hz) at seizure onset, although that information was not considered for preoperative determination of the surgical boundary. We investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ictal HFOs post hoc by visual and spectral methods, and also compared them to the seizure onset defined by the CFA. Key Findings: Of 14 consecutive neocortical epilepsy patients, six patients met the inclusion criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal or showed heterotopia. All had subdural electrodes, with additional intracerebral depth electrodes in some. Electrode coverage was extensive (median 94 channels), including limited contralateral coverage. Seizure onsets were lobar or multilobar. Resections were performed per protocol, except in two patients where complete resection of the SOZ could not be done due to overlap with speech area. Histology was abnormal in all patients. Postoperative outcome was class I/II (n = 5, 83%) or class III over a mean follow-up of 27 months. Post hoc analysis of 15 representative seizures showed that the ictal HFOs were widespread at seizure onset but evolved subsequently with different characteristics. In contrast to HFOs-, the HFOs+ were significantly higher in peak frequency (97.1 vs. 89.1 Hz, p = 0.001), more robust (nearly twofold higher peak power, p < 0.0001), and spatially restricted [mean 12.2 vs. 22.4 channels; odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.62; p < 0.0001]. The seizure onset defined by HFOs+ was earlier (by an average of 0.41 s), and occurred in a significantly different and smaller distribution (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.21-0.34, p < 0.0001), than the seizure onset defined by the CFA. As intended, the HFOs+ channels were 10 times more likely to have been resected than the HFOs- channels (OR 9.7, 95% CI 5-17, p < 0.0001). Significance: Our study demonstrates the widespread occurrence of ictal HFOs at seizure onset, outlines a practical method to localize the SOZ based on their restricted pattern of evolution, and highlights the differences between the SOZs defined by HFOs and CFA. We show that smaller resections, restricted mainly to the HFOs channels with evolution, can lead to favorable seizure outcome. Our findings support the notion of widespread epileptic networks underlying neocortical epilepsy.

The most utilized clinical test for epilepsy diagnose is the electroencephalogram (EEG). For this reason, nowadays are being developed multiple tools devised for automatic seizure detection on EEG signals. In this work, several approaches of TFR estimation for detection of epileptic events in EEG recordings are compared. Parametric (stochastic evolving and local estimation) TFR estimators as well as non-parametric (STFT, SPWV and CWT) are under study. Comparison is made according with the achieved performance using a recently proposed methodology for TFR based classification. Results show similar outcomings with all approaches for TFR estimation, achieving accuracy rates from 96 to 99%. Best performance was found for STFT and STTVAR approaches for TFR estimation.

Recent research using wide bandwidth intracranial EEG has demonstrated that interictal high-frequency oscillations are preferentially localized to the brain region generating spontaneous seizures, and are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic brain. The existence of an interictal, electrophysiological biomarker of epileptogenic brain has the potential to significantly advance epilepsy surgery by improving outcomes through improved localization and potentially eliminating the reliance on chronic intracranial EEG monitoring.

Besides classical signal analysis tools such as adaptive supervised filtering, parametric or non-parametric spectral estimation, time-frequency analysis, the proposed ICA technique can be used for detection of a wide group of artifacts from EEG data. In this paper a new form of nonlinearity implemented in the infomax approach is presented. As it has been proven experimentally, the proposed new sigmoidal function can effectively detect the selected group of artifacts from EEGs and is an useful approach to speed up computations.

It is unknown whether slow oscillations are synchronous across the majority or the minority of brain regions-are they a global or local phenomenon? To examine this, we recorded simultaneously scalp EEG, intracerebral EEG, and unit firing in multiple brain regions of neurosurgical patients. We find that most sleep slow waves and the underlying active and inactive neuronal states occur locally. Thus, especially in late sleep, some regions can be active while others are silent. We also find that slow waves can propagate, usually from medial prefrontal cortex to the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. Sleep spindles, the other hallmark of NREM sleep EEG, are likewise predominantly local. Thus, intracerebral communication during sleep is constrained because slow and spindle oscillations often occur out-of-phase in different brain regions.

Sounds often follow a visible action or event. Here we present behaviorally relevant evidence from the human EEG that visual input prepares the auditory system for subsequent auditory processing by resetting the phase of neuronal oscillatory activity in auditory cortex. Subjects performed a simple auditory frequency discrimination task using paired but asynchronous auditory and visual stimuli. Auditory cortex activity was modeled from the scalp-recorded EEG using spatiotemporal dipole source analysis. Phase resetting activity was assessed using time-frequency analysis of the source waveforms. Significant cross-modal phase resetting was observed in auditory cortex at low alpha frequencies (8-10 Hz) peaking 80 ms after auditory onset, at high alpha frequencies (10-12 Hz) peaking at 88 ms, and at high theta frequencies (similar to 7 Hz) peaking at 156 ms. Importantly, significant effects were only evident when visual input preceded auditory by between 30 and 75 ms. Behaviorally, cross-modal phase resetting accounted for 18% of the variability in response speed in the auditory task, with stronger resetting overall leading to significantly faster responses. A direct link was thus shown between visual-induced modulations of auditory cortex activity and performance in an auditory task. The results are consistent with a model in which the efficiency of auditory processing is improved when natural associations between visual and auditory inputs allow one input to reliably predict the next.

Methods traditionally used to study ERPs measure the amplitude and duration of the waveform in order to quantify the changes, being signal morphology dependent. However, the frequency characteristics of those events remain uncovered. The aim of this work was the study of new measures to characterize, by means of time-frequency representation (TFR) techniques, the ERPs recorded while subjects conducted a choice reaction time task (Ericksen flanker task) following the administration of different alprazolam doses. Several measures defined from energy, instantaneous frequency and group delay functions were obtained by means of TFR techniques applied to the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) of EEG signals. These measures, which are signal morphology independent, were studied in four frequency bands, delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-15 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), and for certain time periods. Based on these measures, differences between ERPs were analyzed by comparing the different response types (successes or successfully corrected failures) of the subject performing the task, and comparing the applied drug doses. For each subject, the CWD of EEG signals was applied in two different ways: (a) all ERPs were averaged per channel, and then the CWD was applied; (b) the CWD was applied to each one of the ERPs. When the CWD was applied to each ERP, the energy measures in the delta, theta and beta bands, the instantaneous frequency measures in the alpha and beta bands, and the group delay measures in the delta, theta and alpha bands showed a statistically significant level p < 0.0005 in the analysis of the response type. Also, the energy measures in the theta and beta bands and the instantaneous frequency measures in the alpha band showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.0005) between placebo and low and high drug doses. In contrast, poor results were obtained when all epochs of each subject were averaged per channel. Finally, it was concluded that these results showed that the new proposed measures based on the energy offered a new and more robust way to characterize ERP signals.

When using long-term recordings, a more realistic view emerged which suggests that statistically significant predictions might be possible from surface and intracranial EEG, but no algorithm has yet demonstrated performance allowing for clinical application. Here, progress in EEG recording techniques, EEG analysis, and requirements for proper statistical validation of results are reported and discussed as they pertain to clinical implementation.

We review here how these methods have been used at the Laboratoire d'Electroencephalographie Cl de Neurophysiologie Appliquee (LENA) to develop a general tool for the real time analysis of functional brain signals. We then give some perspectives on how these tools can help understanding the biological mechanisms of information processing. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

We applied this technique to Jacksonian seizures to demonstrate ictal HFO propagation along the homunculus in the primary sensory-motor cortex to visualize the underlying epileptic network. Methods: We analyzed intracranial ictal EEGs from two patients with intractable Jacksonian seizures who underwent epilepsy surgery. We calculated the degrees of increase in amplitude within 40-80, 80-200, and 200-300 Hz frequency bands compared to the interictal period and converted them into topographic movies projected onto the brain surface picture. We combined these data with the ictal EEGs and video of the patient demonstrating ictal semiology. Key Findings: The ictal HFOs began in the sensory cortex and appeared concomitantly with the sensory aura. They then propagated to the motor cortex at the same time that focal motor symptoms evolved. As the seizure progressed, the ictal HFOs spread or reverberated in the rolandic region. However, even when the seizure became secondarily generalized, the ictal HFOs were confined to the rolandic region. In both cases, there was increased amplitude of higher frequency bands during seizure initiation compared to seizure progression. Significance: This combined movie showed the ictal HFO propagation corresponding to the ictal semiology in Jacksonian seizures and revealed the epileptic network involved in seizure initiation and progression. This method may advance understanding of neural network activities relating to clinical seizure generation and propagation.

The increase in theta/beta ratio on resting-state EEG in boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is mediated by slow alpha peak frequency	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Alpha peak frequency; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Electroencephalography (EEG); IntegNeuro; Theta/beta ratio	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ADHD; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SUBTYPES; BATTERY; MEMORY; POWER; METHYLPHENIDATE; METAANALYSIS	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was found to be characterized by a deviant pattern of electrocortical activity during resting state, particularly increased theta and decreased beta activity. The first objective of the present study is to confirm whether individuals with slow alpha peak frequency contribute to the finding of increased theta activity in ADHD. The second objective is to explore the relation between resting-state brain oscillations and specific cognitive functions. From 49 boys with ADHD and 49 healthy control boys, resting-state EEG during eyes open and eyes closed was recorded, and a variety of cognitive tasks were administered. Theta and beta power and theta/beta ratio were calculated using both fixed frequency bands and individualized frequency bands. As expected, theta/beta ratio, calculated using fixed frequency bands, was significantly higher in ADHD children than control children. However, this group effect was not significant when theta/beta ratio was assessed using individualized frequency bands. No consistent relation was found between resting-state brain oscillations and cognition. The present results suggest that previous findings of increased theta/beta ratio in ADHD may reflect individuals with slow alpha peak frequencies in addition to individuals with true increased theta activity. Therefore, the often reported theta/beta ratio in ADHD can be considered a non-specific measure combining several distinct neurophysiological subgroups such as frontal theta and slowed alpha peak frequencies. Future research should elucidate the functional role of resting-state brain oscillations by investigating neurophysiological subgroups, which may have a clearer relation to cognitive functions than single frequency bands.

We used high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) and source modeling to investigate the cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep. Design: 256-channel EEG recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia. Setting: Hospital operating room. Patients or Participants: 8 healthy subjects (4 males) Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Initially, propofol induced increases in EEG power from 12-25 Hz. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was accompanied by the appearance of EEG slow waves that resembled the slow waves of NREM sleep. We compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. However, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. Propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 Hz) power that persisted throughout LOC. Source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. During LOC, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness. Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.

When accounting for intrinsic coupling of alpha amplitude and occipital fMRI signal by modeling and subtracting pseudo-trials, no significant effect of prestimulus alpha amplitude on the evoked fMRI response could be demonstrated. Regarding the effect of alpha phase, we found that stimuli arriving at the peak of the alpha cycle yielded a lower blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI response in early visual cortex (V1/V2) than stimuli presented at the trough of the cycle. Our results therefore show that phase of occipital alpha oscillations impacts the overall strength of a visually evoked response, as indexed by the BOLD signal. This observation complements existing evidence that alpha oscillations reflect periodic variations in cortical excitability and suggests that the phase of oscillations in postsynaptic potentials can serve as a mechanism of gain control for incoming neural activity. Finally, our findings provide a putative neural basis for observations of alpha phase dependence of visual perceptual performance.

Interictal scalp fast oscillations as a marker of the seizure onset zone	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PAROXYSMAL FAST ACTIVITY; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 100-500 HZ; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; INTRACRANIAL EEG; IN-VIVO	Objective: This study aims to identify if oscillations at frequencies higher than the traditional EEG can be recorded on the scalp EEG of patients with focal epilepsy and to analyze the association of these oscillations with interictal discharges and the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Methods: The scalp EEG of 15 patients with focal epilepsy was studied. We analyzed the rates of gamma (40-80 Hz) and ripple (>80 Hz) oscillations, their co-occurrence with spikes, the number of channels with fast oscillations inside and outside the SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of gamma, ripples, and spikes to determine the SOZ. Results: Gamma and ripples frequently co-occurred with spikes (77.5% and 63% of cases). For all events, the proportion of channels with events was consistently higher inside than outside the SOZ: spikes (100% vs 70%), gamma (82% vs 33%), and ripples (48% vs 11%); p < 0.0001. The mean rates (events/min) were higher inside than outside the SOZ: spikes (2.64 +/- 1.70 vs 0.69 +/- 0.26, p = 0.02), gamma (0.77 +/- 0.71 vs 0.20 +/- 0.25, p = 0.02), and ripples (0.08 +/- 0.12 vs 0.04 +/- 0.09, p = 0.04). The sensitivity to identify the SOZ was spikes 100%, gamma 82%, and ripples 48%; the specificity was spikes 30%, gamma 68%, and ripples 89%; and the accuracy was spikes 43%, gamma 70%, and ripples 81%. Conclusion: The rates and the proportion of channels with gamma and ripple fast oscillations are higher inside the SOZ, indicating that they can be used as interictal scalp EEG markers for the SOZ. These fast oscillations are less sensitive but much more specific and accurate than spikes to delineate the SOZ. Neurology (R) 2011;77:524-531	[Andrade-Valenca, L.

Methods: An algorithm for the identification of alpha spindles is described. The performance of the algorithm is tested based on simulated data. The method is applied to real data recorded under real traffic conditions and compared with the performance of traditional EEG fatigue measures, i.e. alpha-band power. As a highly valid fatigue reference, the last 20 min of driving from participants who aborted the drive due to heavy fatigue were used in contrast to the initial 20 min of driving. Results: Statistical analysis revealed significant increases from the first to the last driving section of several alpha spindle parameters and among all traditional EEG frequency bands, only of alpha-band power; with larger effect sizes for the alpha spindle based measures. An increased level of fatigue over the same time periods for drop-outs, as compared to participants who did not abort the drive, was observed only by means of alpha spindle parameters. Conclusions: EEG alpha spindle parameters increase both fatigue detection sensitivity and specificity as compared to EEG alpha-band power. Significance: It is demonstrated that alpha spindles are superior to EEG band power measures for assessing driver fatigue under real traffic conditions.

Alpha and Theta Rhythm Abnormality in Alzheimer's Disease: A Study Using a Computational Model	FROM BRAINS TO SYSTEMS: BRAIN-INSPIRED COGNITIVE SYSTEMS 2010	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Brain-inspired Cognitive Systems Conference (BICS 2010)	JUL, 2010	Madrid, SPAIN				FUNCTIONAL DYNAMICS; DEPRESSED SUBJECTS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; DEMENTIA; THALAMUS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; NUCLEUS	Electroencephalography (EEG) studies in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients show an attenuation of average power within the alpha band (7.5-13 Hz) and an increase of power in the theta band (4-7 Hz). Significant body of evidence suggest that thalamocortical circuitry underpin the generation and modulation of alpha and theta rhythms. The research presented in this chapter is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying EEG band power changes in AD which may in the future provide useful biomarkers towards early detection of the disease and for neuropharmaceutical investigations. The study is based on a classic computational model of the thalamocortical circuitry which exhibits oscillation within the theta and the alpha bands. We are interested in the change in model oscillatory behaviour corresponding with changes in the connectivity parameters in the thalamocortical as well as sensory input pathways. The synaptic organisation as well as the connectivity parameter values in the model are modified based on recent experimental data from the cat thalamus. We observe that the inhibitory population in the model plays a crucial role in mediating the oscillatory behaviour of the model output. Further, increase in connectivity parameters in the afferent and efferent pathways of the inhibitory population induces a slowing of the output power spectra. These observations may have implications for extending the model for further AD research.

AEGR) and target detection (auditory event-related gamma responses. AERGR) in healthy controls (n = 10) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 10) using both single-trial and averaged time-frequency data analysis. The results show that single-trial gamma responses in patients were altered in magnitude and topographic pattern for both the AEGR and the AERGR experimental conditions, whereas no differences were found for the averaged evoked gamma response. At the single-trial level, auditory stimuli elicited higher gamma responses at both anterior and occipital sites in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Furthermore, in patients with schizophrenia target detection compared to passive listening to stimuli was related to increased single-trial gamma power at frontal sites. In controls enhancement of the gamma response was only apparent for the averaged gamma response, with a distribution largely restricted to anterior sites. The differences in oscillatory activity between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia were not reflected in the behavioral measure (i.e., counting targets). We conclude that gamma activity triggered by auditory stimuli in schizophrenic patients might have less selectivity in timing and alterations in topography and may show changes in amplitude modulation with task demands. The present study may indicate that in patients with schizophrenia neuronal information is not adequately transferred, possibly due to an over-excitability of neuronal networks and excessive pruning of local connections in association cortex.

It can be recorded in many brain areas such as somotosensory cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. The gamma band oscillation can be detected at different levels such as microscopic (spikes), mesoscopic (local field potentials, LFP) and macroscopic (electroencephalogram, EEG) level. GABAergic inhibitory interneuron network is considered as the main source of the gamma oscillation generation, and the cortical gamma oscillation is also related with the interaction of thalamo-cortical system. Gamma band oscillation is associated with sensory and cognition functions, in particular the feature binding, selective attention and memory processing.

Materials and methods: The model of parametric excitation based on polarization of water molecules was proposed and experimental results compared to the model. The experiments were carried out on 28 human volunteers. The 450 MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 14, 21, 40 and 70 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density 0.16 mW/cm(2). The resting EEG was recorded in 8 channels and EEG power at selected frequencies was analyzed. A relative change in the EEG power during 10 cycles with and without radiation was used as a quantitative measure. Results: Microwave radiation caused an increase in the average EEG power in all selected EEG frequency bands. Increase in the EEG power was statistically significant only at the EEG frequency f(0) to modulation frequency F ratios f(0)/F = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. Conclusions: Results of the experimental study are in accordance with the proposed model of parametric excitation of the brain neural oscillations and demonstrate that modulated microwave radiation causes excitation of the brain EEG rhythms at the frequencies predicted by the non-linear model.

However, current EEG-databases are primarily based on standardized frequency bands which disregard age-related changes in alpha peak frequency (PF) and therefore complicate the interpretation of spectral estimates in the theta and alpha range. Methods: We used a two point longitudinal design in order to analyze intraindividual changes in 40 healthy children and adolescents with age (T(1) : 6-18 years; interval approximately 4 years). Using a 64-channel eyes closed resting EEG we calculated absolute/relative power in individualized frequency bands (IFB: delta, theta, alphaip and beta) based on PF. Results: PF increased with age, with changes being larger for children than adolescents. Controlling for changes in PF, changes in absolute/relative alpha(1/2) power and in absolute beta power were minor. Relative beta power, however, increased while absolute/relative delta and theta power decreased massively. Sex-differences in PF did not reach significance. However, boys exhibited larger changes during adolescence than girls for all absolute power measures except alpha. Conclusion: Normal EEG development during school-age is mainly based on an absolute decrease of slow frequency activity and increases of PF which may be interpreted in terms of a reorganization of the EEG towards a higher frequency oscillatory scale rather than a maturation of the theta-alpha(1/2) band power sequence. Age-related changes differed between boys and girls suggesting a different developmental timing for the sexes. In future studies a combined analysis of PF and IFB may help to specify deviations in developmental disorders. (C) 2010 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cho, W; Hwang, SH; Choi, H				Cho, Wonhak; Hwang, Sung-Ho; Choi, Hyeonki			An investigation of the influences of noise on EEG power bands and visual cognitive responses for human-oriented product design	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Human-oriented product design; Noise; Pupil response time; Visual cognitive responses		Various different human-oriented approaches are required in industrial activities. Noise is one of the most widespread sources of environmental stress. So, is important to consider noise when we design human-oriented products. This study investigates the responses of EEG and eye movement data in order to evaluate the direct effects of low, middle, and high frequency noise on the two main physiological stress aspects: the EEG band power (alpha and beta frequency bands) and pupil response time (PRT) for a human-oriented product design. Fifteen subjects were exposed to low (100 Hz), middle (1000 Hz), and high frequency (10000 Hz) noise while awake. EEG and eye movement data were collected during noise exposure. Alpha band activity in low and high frequency noise ranges was smaller than that in no sound. Alpha band activity decreased 19.3 +/- 4.5 % in the low frequency noise range. Additionally, alpha band decreased 19.5 +/- 5.4% in high frequency noise range. On the other hand, Beta band activity in low and high frequency noise ranges was greater than that in no sound. Beta band activity increased 26.9 +/- 7.9 % in the low frequency noise range and increased 30.6 +/- 6.1% in high frequency noise range. The PRT, or visual cognitive responses, in low or high frequency noise was greater than that in no sound. PRT increased 15.3 +/- 3.0% in low frequency noise range. Alternatively, PRT increased 18.1 +/- 3.2% in high frequency noise range. And results of EEG and eye movement were statistically significant in low and high frequency noise (r > 0.92, p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicate that the stress induced by low frequency noise is as stressful as the stress induced by high frequency noise. Additionally, utilizing eye movement data and acquiring the PRT is useful in the analysis of human stress responses during various stressful situations in addition to the analysis of human stress responses during noise exposure.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						biomarker; chronic pain; chronic pancreatitis; electroencephalography (EEG); neuropathic pain; pain; spectral analysis	TISSUE-FLUID PRESSURE; REORGANIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; NEUROPATHY	Background and aim Intractable pain usually dominates the clinical presentation of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Slowing of electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythmicity has been associated with abnormal cortical pain processing in other chronic pain disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the spectral distribution of EEG rhythmicity in patients with CP. Patients and methods Thirty-one patients with painful CP (mean age 52 years, 19 male) and 15 healthy volunteers (mean age 49, nine male) were included. A multichannel EEG was recorded from 62 surface electrodes. Amplitude strengths of the resting EEG were retrieved based on wavelet frequency analysis and summarized in frequency bands with corresponding topographic mapping. Results Patients with CP had slowed EEG rhythmicity compared with healthy volunteers. This was evident as increased activity in the lower frequency bands delta (1-3.5 Hz) (P=0.05), theta (3.5-7.5 Hz) (P<0.001) and alpha (7.5-13.5 Hz) (P<0.001). Due to normalization a reciprocal relationship was observed for the high frequency band beta (13.5-32 Hz). In a sub-analysis, delta band activity was modified by diabetes, opioid treatment and alcohol aetiology of CP. However, no effect modification was seen for the theta or alpha bands. Differences in theta activity were located over centro-frontal brain regions, whereas differences in delta, alpha and beta band activity were located in frontal regions. Conclusion Slowed EEG rhythmicity was evident in patients with CP. This possibly mirrors abnormal central pain processing and may serve as a clinically useful biomarker of abnormal central pain processing.

Emergence of Persistent Networks in Long-Term Intracranial EEG Recordings	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SMALL-WORLD; DEFAULT MODE; HUMAN BRAIN; MEASURING SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; RESTING BRAIN; CORTEX	Over the past two decades, the increased ability to analyze network relationships among neural structures has provided novel insights into brain function. Most network approaches, however, focus on static representations of the brain's physical or statistical connectivity. Few studies have examined how brain functional networks evolve spontaneously over long epochs of continuous time. To address this, we examine functional connectivity networks deduced from continuous long-term electrocorticogram recordings. For a population of six human patients, we identify a persistent pattern of connections that form a frequency-band-dependent network template, and a set of core connections that appear frequently and together. These structures are robust, emerging from brief time intervals (similar to 100 s) regardless of cognitive state. These results suggest that a metastable, frequency-band-dependent scaffold of brain connectivity exists from which transient activity emerges and recedes.

Methods: Routine EEGs were obtained prior to KD initiation, then one month and three months later. Changes in EEG background slowing and frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were evaluated using power spectrum analysis and manual determination of spike index. KD responders were compared to non-responders to determine if baseline or early EEG characteristics predicted treatment response (>50% seizure reduction) at three months. Results: Thirty-seven patients were evaluated. No differences in baseline EEG features were found between responder groups. Frequency of IEDs declined in 65% of patients as early as one month, by a median of 13.6% (IQR 2-33). Those with a ten percent or greater improvement in IED frequency at one month were greater than six times more likely to be KD responders (OR 6.5 95% CI 0.85-75 p=0.03). Qualitative and quantitative measures of EEG background slowing improved in the whole cohort, but did not predict responder status. Conclusion: Baseline predictors of KD response remain elusive. Most patients experienced a reduction in IEDs and improvement in EEG background slowing after KD initiation. Reduction of IEDs at one month strongly predicted KD responder status at three months.

Methods: After a night of total sleep deprivation, 12 healthy young subjects underwent a MWT whilst being instructed to communicate the experience of subjective sleepiness by pressing a button. EEG analysis consisted of average relative power and correlation between EEG signals. Results: A comparison of the 30 s before microsleep (MS) with 30 s before subjects communicated experience of sleepiness (PB) showed increased beta correlation as well as increased power in the beta band (13-20 Hz) whereas power in the theta (4.5-7.5 Hz) and alpha (8-12.5 Hz) band was significantly decreased. When subjects later failed to communicate the experience of subjective sleepiness before (micro-) sleep occurred, average relative power and EEG correlation were significantly higher during 30 s following lights off in the delta (1-4 Hz) band and power in the alpha and beta bands was decreased. Conclusions: EEG spectral power and correlation change significantly in specific frequency bands between different time periods of MWT. Failure to communicate sleepiness is associated with certain precursors of EEG power and correlation. Significance: This study demonstrates that there are specific EEG characteristics associated with impending failure to communicate sleepiness.

It includes the fast Fourier transform between two hidden layers to switch the signal analysis from the time domain to the frequency domain inside the network. This technique allows the signal classification without any special pre-processing and uses knowledge from the problem in the network topology. The first step allows the creation of different spatial and time filters. The second step is dedicated to the signal transformation in the frequency domain. The last step is the classification. The system is tested offline on the classification of EEG signals that contain steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses. The mean recognition rate of the classification of five different types of SSVEP response is 95.61% on a time segment length of 1 s. The proposed strategy outperforms other classical neural network architecures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, ZE; Kuo, CC; Chou, CH; Yen, CT; Chang, F				Yu, Zong-En; Kuo, Chung-Chih; Chou, Chien-Hsing; Yen, Chen-Tung; Chang, Fu			A machine learning approach to classify vigilance states in rats	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Vigilance stages; Pattern classification; EEG; Machine learning; PCA; k-NN	SLEEP; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; DISCHARGES; TRANSITION; ALGORITHM; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Identifying mammalian vigilance states has recently become an important topic in biological science research. The vigilance states are usually categorized in at least three states, including slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and awakening. To identify different vigilance states, even a well-trained expert must spend a lot of time analyzing a mass of physiological recording data. This study proposes an automatic vigilance stages classification method for analyzing EEG signals in rats. The EEG signals were transferred by fast Fourier transform before extracting features. These extracted features were then used as training patterns to construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two functional units. The first unit is principle component analysis (PCA) method, which is used to project the high dimensional features into the lower dimensional subspace. The second unit is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, which identifies the physiological state in each EEG signal epoch. Based on the results of analyzing 810 epochs of EEG signal, the proposed classification method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy for vigilance states. Based on machine-learning algorithms, the classifier learns to approach the configuration that best fits the categorization task. Therefore, additional training in searching best parameters and thresholds can be avoided. Moreover, the PCA algorithm projects data instances into a 3-D space, making it possible to visualize state-changing dynamics. Experimental results show that the proposed machine-learning based classifier performs better than conventional vigilance state classification algorithms. The results also suggest that it is possible to identify the vigilance states with only EEG signals using the proposed pattern recognition technique.

Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to recognize the mental tasks, and the feature extraction uses the Power Spectral Density. The choice of EEG channel and frequency uses the Kullback-Leibler symmetric divergence and a reclassification model is proposed to stabilize the classifier. Finally, it is expected that the proposed method can be implemented in a Brain-Computer Interface associated with a robotic wheelchair.

This research study describes a new approach based on i) build reference models from a set of time series, based on the analysis of the events that they contain, is suitable for domains where the relevant information is concentrated in specific regions of the time series, known as events.

Evaluation of the electroencephalogram in young cats	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article							DEXMEDETOMIDINE; MEDETOMIDINE; KITTEN; EEG	Objective-To characterize the electroencephalogram (EEG) in young cats. Animals-23 clinically normal cats. Procedures-Cats were sedated with medetomidine hydrochloride and butorphanol tartrate at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of age, and an EEG was recorded at each time point. Recordings were visually inspected for electrical continuity, interhemispheric synchrony, amplitude and frequency of background electrical activity, and frequency of transient activity. Computer-aided analysis was used to perform frequency spectral analysis and to calculate absolute and relative power of the background activity at each age. Results-Electrical continuity was evident in cats 4 weeks old, and interhemispheric synchrony was evident in cats at all ages evaluated. Analysis of amplitude of background activity and absolute power revealed significant elevations in 6-week-old cats, compared with results for 2-, 20-, and 24-week-old cats. No association between age and relative power or frequency was identified. Transient activity, which consisted of sleep spindles and K complexes, was evident at all ages, but spike and spike-and-wave discharges were observed in cats at 2 weeks of age. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Medetomidine and butorphanol were administered in accordance with a sedation protocol that allowed investigators to repeatedly obtain EEG data from cats. Age was an important consideration when interpreting EEG data. These data on EEG development in clinically normal cats may be used for comparison in future studies conducted to examine EEGs in young cats with diseases that affect the cerebral cortex.

Cortical gamma responses: Searching high and low	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Gamma band; High gamma; Oscillations; Electrocorticography; Electroencephalography; Functional mapping; Induced responses; ERD/ERS	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; FREQUENCY	In this paper, a brief, preliminary attempt is made to frame a scientific debate about how functional responses at gamma frequencies in electrophysiological recordings (EEG, MEG, ECoG, and LFP) should be classified and interpreted. In general, are all gamma responses the same, or should they be divided into different classes according to criteria such as their spectral characteristics (frequency range and/or shape), their spatial-temporal patterns of occurrence, and/or their responsiveness under different task conditions? In particular, are the responses observed in intracranial EEG at a broad range of "high gamma" frequencies (similar to 60-200 Hz) different from gamma responses observed at lower frequencies (similar to 30-80 Hz), typically in narrower bands? And if they are different, how should they be interpreted? Does the broad spectral shape of high gamma responses arise from the summation of many different narrow-band oscillations, or does it reflect something completely different? If we are not sure, should we refer to high gamma activity as oscillations? A variety of theories have posited a mechanistic role for gamma activity in cortical function, often assuming narrow-band oscillations. These theories continue to influence the design of experiments and the interpretation of their results. Do these theories apply to all electrophysiological responses at gamma frequencies? Although no definitive answers to these questions are immediately anticipated, this paper will attempt to review the rationale for why they are worth asking and to point to some of the possible answers that have been proposed.

J	Putman, P				Putman, Peter			Resting state EEG delta-beta coherence in relation to anxiety, behavioral inhibition, and selective attentional processing of threatening stimuli	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Delta-beta coherence; Cross-talk; Selective attention; Anxiety; Behavioral inhibition	PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVATION; ANGRY FACES; CORTISOL; STRESS; BIAS; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; REWARD; TRAIT; HYDROCORTISONE	Variability in human resting state electroencephalography (EEG) may reflect emotion regulation processes (for a review, see Knyazev, 2007). For instance, it has been suggested that correlation between slow (1-3 Hz) and fast (13-30 Hz) activity (or delta-beta coherence) may reflect functional synchronization between limbic and cortical brain systems. Indirect support comes from several studies reporting relationships between delta-beta coherence and subjectively reported behavioral inhibition and state anxiety. The present study sought to extend this work and tested the prediction that objectively, experimentally, measured threat-selective attention should also be related to delta-beta coherence. EEG frequency band power and dot probe task performance were assessed in forty healthy women and results demonstrated a negative association between delta-beta coherence and automatic, anxiety-driven attentional avoidance of threatening pictorial stimuli. These first reported objective measures for cognitive-emotional behavior obtained in relation to delta-beta coherence provide additional support for the hypothesis that this EEG parameter may reflect emotion regulation processes and supports suggestions that delta-beta coherence may be a useful tool in the experimental study of affect and psychopathology. In addition, results showed an unexpected negative association between delta-beta coherence and self-reported trait anxiety (but no association with behavioral inhibition). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although there is broad knowledge about the interaction of cortical arousal and activity of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) during different sleep stages, the association and temporal interaction between fine-graded EEG-vigilance stages and markers of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity during the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset warrants more detailed exploration and was focus of the presented study. A 15-min resting-EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded from 54 healthy subjects. Using an EEG-algorithm (VIGALL), 1-s segments were classified into seven different vigilance stages. Associations and temporal interactions between EEG-vigilance stages and heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR), and SCL were computed using correlation analysis, regression analysis, and cross-correlations of EEG-vigilance and ANS time series. EEG-vigilance stages and ANS activity showed a significant association between increased HRV parameters including total and (normalized) very low frequency power and low vigilance stages. Regression analysis revealed significantly increased values of SCL and HR for high vigilance stages in comparison to lower ones. In these relationships, for SCL but not HR most of the covariance was explained by the effect of time. Phasic increases in EEG-vigilance were paralleled by significant increases of HR but not of SCL. Cross-correlations between EEG-vigilance and ANS time series yielded highest correlations when there was no or only a minimal temporal lag. ANS activity during the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset gradually changes along with different fine-graded EEG-vigilance stages. Associations between cortical and autonomic activity are better reflected by HR than by SCL.

Such activity is often highly stereotypical, is invariably rhythmic, and can occur with periodicities ranging from a few milliseconds to several minutes. Recently, there has been a particular resurgence of interest in fluctuations in brain activity occurring at <0.1 Hz, commonly referred to as very slow or infraslow oscillations (ISOs). Whilst this is primarily due to the emergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a technique which has revolutionized the study of human brain dynamics, it is also a consequence of the application of full band electroencephalography (fbEEG). Despite these technical advances, the precise mechanisms which lead to ISOs in the brain remain unclear. In a host of animal studies, one brain region that consistently shows oscillations at <0.1 Hz is the thalamus. Importantly, similar oscillations can also be observed in slices of isolated thalamic relay nuclei maintained in vitro. Here, we discuss the nature and mechanisms of these oscillations, paying particular attention to a potential role for astrocytes in their genesis. We also highlight the relationship between this activity and ongoing local network oscillations in the alpha (alpha; similar to 8-13 Hz) band, drawing clear parallels with observations made in vivo. Last, we consider the relevance of these thalamic ISOs to the pathological activity that occurs in certain types of epilepsy.

The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies.

This is, however, not the case in newborns as the nature of the transient changes in the newborn EEG is different from that of adults. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of the time-varying versions of the two popular Granger causality measures, namely Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF). The parameters of the time-varying AR, that models the inter-channel interactions, are estimated using Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) as it accounts for both non-stationarity and non-linearity behaviors of the EEG. Using simulated data, we show that fast changing cortical connectivity between channels can be measured more accurately using the time-varying PDC. The performance of the time-varying PDC is also tested on a neonatal EEG exhibiting seizure.	[Omidvarnia, A. H.; Mesbah, M.; Khlif, M. S.; Colditz, P.

Combining Discriminant and Topographic Information in BCI: Preliminary Results on Stroke Patients	2011 5TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS) Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 27-MAY 01, 2011	Cancun, MEXICO	Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), IEEE				Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) convey a great potential in the field of stroke rehabilitation, where the continuous monitoring of mental tasks execution could support the positive effects of standard therapies. In this paper we combine time-frequency analysis of EEG with the topographic analysis to identify and track task-related patterns of brain activity emerging during a single BCI session. 6 Stroke patients executed Motor Imagery of the affected and unaffected hands: EEG sites were ranked depending on their discriminant power (DP) at different time instants and the resulting discriminant periods were used as a prior to extract EEG Microstates. Results show that the combination of these two techniques can provide insights about specific motor-related processes happening at a fine grain temporal resolution. Such events, represented by EEG microstates, can be tracked and used both to quantify changes of underlying neural structures and to provide feedback to patients and therapists.

This variability is generally discarded as a reflection of intrinsic noise in neuronal systems. However, part of this variability may be accounted for by trial-by-trial fluctuations of the phase of ongoing oscillations at the moment of stimulus presentation. For example, the phase of an electro-encephalogram (EEG) oscillation reflecting the rapid waxing and waning of sustained attention can predict the perception of a subsequent visual stimulus at threshold. Similar ongoing periodicities account for a portion of the trial-by-trial variability of visual reaction times. We review the available experimental evidence linking ongoing EEG phase to perceptual and attentional variability, and the corresponding methodology. We propose future tests of this relation, and discuss the theoretical implications for understanding the neuronal dynamics of sensory perception.

Setting: A 4-bed sleep laboratory. Participants: Fourteen adolescents (5 boys) were studied at ages 15 or 16 (initial) and again at ages 17 to 19 (follow-up). Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: All-night polysomnography was recorded at each assessment and scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales. A 27% decline in duration of slow wave sleep, and a 22% increase of stage 2 sleep was observed from the initial to the follow-up session. All-night spectral analysis of 2 central and 2 occipital leads revealed a significant decline of NREM and REM sleep EEG power with increasing age across frequencies in both states. Time-frequency analysis revealed that the decline in power was consistent across the night for all bands except the delta band. The decreases in power were most pronounced over the left central (C3/A2) and right occipital (O2/A1) derivations. Conclusions: Using longitudinal data, we show that the developmental changes to the sleeping EEG that begin in early adolescence continue into late adolescence. As with early adolescents, we observed hemispheric asymmetry in the decline of sleep EEG power. This decline was state and frequency nonspecific, suggesting that it may be due to the pruning of synapses known to occur during adolescence.

Conversion rates to dementia are greater in multi-than in single-domain aMCI, but it remains unclear whether md-aMCI is a mere progression of sd-aMCI or represents a distinct clinical entity. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an easily accessible modality particularly powerful to investigate the functional activation of neocortical circuits. Sensitive attention-and working memory-related EEG indices have been identified in MCI, providing valuable insight on the underlying cerebral alterations. The present study examined the patterns of EEG activity during the encoding and retrieval phases of working memory in md-and sd-aMCI, with the purpose to identify early differences in neural activation between the two subtypes. Continuous EEG was recorded in 43 aMCI patients, whose 16 sd-aMCI and 27 md-aMCI, and 36 age-matched controls (EC) during delayed match-to-sample tasks for face and letter stimuli. At encoding, attended stimuli elicited parietal alpha (8-12 Hz) power decrease (desynchronization), whereas distracting stimuli were associated with alpha power increase (synchronization) over right central sites. No difference was observed in parietal alpha desynchronization among the three groups, suggesting similar attention-related activation of cortical circuits. For attended faces, the alpha synchronization underlying suppression of distracting letters was reduced in both aMCI subgroups, but more severely in md-aMCI cases that differed significantly from EC. At retrieval, the early N250r recognition effect was significantly reduced for faces in md-aMCI as compared to both sd-aMCI and EC. The results suggest the differential alteration of working memory cerebral processes for faces in the two aMCI subtypes. Whereas a progressive impairment of the cerebral activity related to distracter suppression at encoding is already present in sd-aMCI, md-aMCI is characterized by a specific deterioration of face covert recognition process at retrieval.

Two NIRS detection methods based on the General Linear Model (GLM) respectively in the time domain and in the time-frequency domain are investigated in this study using realistic simulations of spontaneous interictal epileptic activity. We evaluated the sensitivity at different Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR), the effect of either a large or a small number of discharges and the impact of model misspecification (e.g. omission or false detection of epileptic discharges). We also explored the effect on the estimation of key parameters, which set the model order. Simulations showed that both methods become inaccurate in lower SNR conditions, leading to many false positive detections. However, the time-frequency estimator showed better performance than the time-domain one. Key parameters for each algorithm were identified and results suggest to model confounds in the GLM differently for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. We also demonstrated that an inaccurate marking of epileptic events has a small impact on the detection statistics whereas an inaccurate specification of the hemodynamic response function delay decreases drastically the detection abilities. Finally, we illustrated the two methods on clinical EEG/NIRS data of one patient with focal epilepsy, showing an increase of regional Cerebral Blood Volume (rCBV) spatially concordant with the presumed epileptogenic focus.

Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), Hilbert-Hough spectrum (HHS) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) time frequency distributions were used to represent the EEG signal from which features were extracted using time frequency entropy. The classification of features was done using feed forward back-propagation ANN. The system was trained and tested using data taken from neonates of post-conceptual age of 40 weeks for both preterm (14 recordings) and fullterm (15 recordings). The identification of sleep stages was successfully implemented and the classification based on the WVD outperformed the approaches based on CWT and HHS. The accuracy and kappa coefficient were found to be 0.84 and 0.65 respectively for the fullterm neonates' recordings and 0.74 and 0.50 respectively for preterm neonates' recordings.

The SSVEP manifests as oscillatory components at the stimulation frequency or harmonics in brain signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram. Analysis of the dynamics of the SSVEP permits to characterize the neurophysiological basis of visual processing. Classical SSVEP analysis is restricted to the study of the EEC power at the stimulation frequency. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of the alpha peak frequency under flicker stimulation. The alpha peak frequency is person specific and plays an important role on mental load. High :resolution time-frequency methods are necessary to precisely identify the alpha peak frequency. We utilize therefore matching pursuit methods using stochastic dictionaries. We show that the alpha peak frequency decreases during flicker stimulation. We argue that this phenomenon can partially explain the relative fast habituation of the SSVFP, i.e. the strength of the SSVFP decreases after few seconds of continuous flicker stimulation.

Cognitive processes in disorders of consciousness as revealed by EEG time-frequency analyses	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Frontal theta; Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state; Awareness	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; LOCKED-IN SYNDROME; VEGETATIVE STATE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SEMANTIC MEMORY; BRAIN RESPONSE	Objective: Although behavioral evaluation of awareness in disorders of consciousness is difficult it remains the clinical standard. We believe that the refinement of EEG and analyses techniques would improve our characterization of those patients. Methods: We focused on cognitive processing in a sample of 12 control subjects, eight vegetative-state patients, and 13 patients in the minimally consciousness state using EEG. We used an 'active paradigm' which asks subjects to follow instructions, specifically to actively count own or other names as compared to passively listening to them. EEG data was then analyzed using an advanced EEG analysis technique. Results: Results revealed that all groups exhibit a stronger theta-synchronization to their own names when forced to count them. We also observed a delay in theta power in response to targets relative to non-targets when participants were instructed to count their own name. Conclusion: Active paradigms are able to induce a different oscillatory activity compared to passive paradigms. Differences between controls and the pathologic groups are prominent in the theta-and alpha-band.

We assume a piecewise stationary model for the signal where the changes affect the power spectrum. Such a model is particularly relevant for analyzing Alzheimer disease (AD) dataset as the disease leads to variation of the frequency rhythms. Our method is devoted to the estimation of the partition. We define a criterion based on a regularized periodogram to estimate the spectrum and on the power spectrum on predefined frequency bands to estimate the change points. The method produces new markers designed to be used for the discrimination between control and AD patients.

People tend to get motion sickness on a moving boat, train, airplane, car, or amusement park rides. Although many motion sickness-related biomarkers have been identified, but how to estimate human's motion sickness level (MSL) is a big challenge in the operational environment. Traditionally, questionnaire and physical check are the common ways to passively evaluate subject's sickness level. Our past studies had investigated the EEG activities correlated with motion sickness in a virtual-reality based driving simulator. The driving simulator comprised an actual automobile mounted on a Stewart motion platform with six degrees of freedom, providing both visual and vestibular stimulations to induce motion-sickness in a manner that is close to that in daily life. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using a 32-channel EEG system. The acquired EEG signals were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency analysis to assess EEG correlates of motion sickness. Subject's degree of motion-sickness was simultaneously and continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing non-stop psychophysical references to the recorded EEG changes. We found that the parietal, motor, occipital brain regions exhibited significant EEG power changes in response to vestibular and visual stimuli. Based on these findings and experimental results, this study aims to develop an EEG-based system to estimate subject's motion sickness level upon the EEG power spectra from motion-sickness related brain areas. The MS evaluation system can be applied to early detection of the subject's motion sickness and prevent its uncomfortable syndromes in our daily life. Furthermore, the experiment results could also lead to a practical human-machine interface for noninvasive monitoring of motion sickness of drivers or passengers in real-world environments.

Deeper coma generally displays a burst-suppression pattern characterized by alternating episodes of isoelectric (flat) EEG and bursting slow waves. The latter are the result of cortical hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings in anesthetized animals. Further deepening of the coma yields to continuous isoelectric EEG and eventually results in a newly discovered type of spiky waves that have been termed m-complexes. They originate in the hippocampus as a result of intrinsically generated oscillations (ripples) in the delta range.

Based on the non-stationary and nonlinearity of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, a method of wavelet analysis is adopted to extract P300 feature from visual evoked EEG. Firstly, the imperative pretreatment for EEG signals is performed. Secondly, the approximate and detail coefficients are gotten by decomposing EEG signals for two layers using wavelet transform. Finally, the approximate coefficients of the second layer are reconstructed to extract P300 feature. The results have shown that the method can accurately extract the P300 feature for visual evoked EEG, and simultaneously, obtain time-frequency information which traditional methods can not do. Therefore, wavelet transform provides an effective method to feature extraction for EEG mental tasks.

J	Turnip, A; Hong, KS; Jeong, MY				Turnip, Arjon; Hong, Keum-Shik; Jeong, Myung-Yung			Real-time feature extraction of P300 component using adaptive nonlinear principal component analysis	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SEPARATION; PEAK	Background: The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are known to involve the firings of neurons in the brain. The P300 wave is a high potential caused by an event-related stimulus. The detection of P300s included in the measured EEG signals is widely investigated. The difficulties in detecting them are that they are mixed with other signals generated over a large brain area and their amplitudes are very small due to the distance and resistivity differences in their transmittance. Methods: A novel real-time feature extraction method for detecting P300 waves by combining an adaptive nonlinear principal component analysis (ANPCA) and a multilayer neural network is proposed. The measured EEG signals are first filtered using a sixth-order band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 1 Hz and 12 Hz. The proposed ANPCA scheme consists of four steps: pre-separation, whitening, separation, and estimation. In the experiment, four different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) are utilized: 325 ms, 350 ms, 375 ms, and 400 ms. Results: The developed multi-stage principal component analysis method applied at the pre-separation step has reduced the external noises and artifacts significantly. The introduced adaptive law in the whitening step has made the subsequent algorithm in the separation step to converge fast. The separation performance index has varied from -20 dB to -33 dB due to randomness of source signals. The robustness of the ANPCA against background noises has been evaluated by comparing the separation performance indices of the ANPCA with four algorithms (NPCA, NSS-JD, JADE, and SOBI), in which the ANPCA algorithm demonstrated the shortest iteration time with performance index about 0.03. Upon this, it is asserted that the ANPCA algorithm successfully separates mixed source signals. Conclusions: The independent components produced from the observed data using the proposed method illustrated that the extracted signals were clearly the P300 components elicited by task-related stimuli. The experiment using 350 ms ISI showed the best performance. Since the proposed method does not use down-sampling and averaging, it can be used as a viable tool for real-time clinical applications.

In this work, we extend Grimbert and Faugeras's work to study the dynamical behavior caused by interaction of cortical areas. The model is developed with the coupling of two neural populations. We show that various attractors, including equilibrium points, periodic solutions and chaotic strange attractors, could coexist in different ways with different value of the connectivity parameters. The main findings are that: (1) The stable equilibrium points only appear with a small value of the parameter. (2) While the alpha activities always exist for both two populations with proper initial conditions. Interestingly, the coexistence of the multiple alpha-to-epileptic activities implies the multiple coupling ways for these activities in phase. Two neuronal populations with epileptic activities could interact with multiple rhythms depending on their connectivity. (3) For particular interest, chaotic behaviors are identified in four regions divided by the connectivity parameter with the positive maximal Lyapunov exponent. The four types of chaotic attractors have their own structures, but all of them are related to the epileptic activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An audio-visual (video clips) induction-based protocol was designed for evoking discrete emotions. The raw EEG signals were preprocessed through surface Laplacian filtering method and decomposed into five different EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) using WT. In this work, we used three different wavelet functions, namely. "db8", "sym8" and "coif5", for extracting the statistical features from EEG signal for classifying the emotions. In order to evaluate the efficacy of emotion classification under different sets of EEG channels, we compared the classification accuracy of the original set of channels (62 channels) with that of a reduced set of channels (24 channels). The validation of statistical features was performed using 5-fold cross validation. In this work, K nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by offering a maximum average classification rate of 83.04% on 62 channels and 79.17% on 24 channels, respectively Finally, we present the average classification accuracy and individual classification accuracy of two different classifiers for justifying the performance of our emotion recognition system.

The detection unit, upon detecting a seizure, enables an analysis circuit that locally processes and transmits energy and frequency contents of the EEG data. Transmission tra ffi c reduction of 256x is achieved by locally processing data and transmitting relevant information about the EEG rather than transmitting the raw EEG data itself. Multichannel detection is accomplished by replicating an ultra-low power single-channel detection unit 16 times, each for a distinct EEG channel. These detection units pass their output into a multi-channel detection block that, when multiple channels flag a seizure, enables the analysis circuit. The proposed detection architecture removes false positives and reduces detection delays by as much as 16 sec when compared to the current method. The platform is implemented in 65 nm CMOS which contains 16 seizure detection modules with a seizure analysis unit and occupies 0.43 mm2. When simulated at 1.3 V, the seizure detection unit runs continuously and dissipates 0.04 mu W at 256 Hz. The analysis unit consumes 0.36 mu W at 1.85 KHz when powered on after a seizure detection.

Fifteen undergraduates participated in the experiment and middle-frequency double-character Chinese words were used as stimuli in two types of study-test tasks (context recall and context recognition tests). Significant differences between item+context and item in the encoding phase were observed at the electrodes in the frontal region at 600-800 ms by time frequency analysis. Further differences were observed at 800 ms by independent component analysis: the frontal component and the coherent component of the triangle phase locking structure among the prefrontal, right parietal and left parietal-occipital regions. In the retrieval phase, differences between item+context and item were found on the electrodes at the central parietal and parietal-occipital regions at 400 ms by time frequency analysis, on the parietal-occipital component at 800 ms by independent component analysis and on the coherence component of the anterior right hemisphere and parietal-occipital regions at 1400 ms. In conclusion, the different effects of encoding and retrieval processing on 'binding' are reflected by the differing extents that brain regions engaged in cognitive operations. In the retrieval phase in particular, activities of the parietal-occipital region were specifically associated with 'binding', and coherence between frontal and temporal-parietal regions is a common brain activity in episodic memory.

General anaesthesia and electroencephalographic spindles	TRENDS IN ANAESTHESIA AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Review						EEG; Depth of anaesthesia; Thalamus; Nociception		During both non-rapid-eye movement sleep and general anaesthesia, it is common for the electroencephalogram (EEG) to show waxing and waning bursts of oscillations in the alpha (7-14 Hz) band commonly referred to as EEG 'spindles'. These usually occur on a background of slow EEG oscillations. This 'delta-spindle' pattern is an indication that the cortex and thalamus are hyperpolarised, which would block the transfer of sensory information to the cortex; and a low frequency oscillation involving large cortical areas that would block transfer from one area of the cortex to another. Thus widespread spindle activity during anaesthesia would indicate a thalamocortical functional state that is not compatible with awareness during surgery - and is therefore a useful target in the titration of anaesthetic drugs. This pattern is also an indication of acceptable suppression of nociceptive input. However we acknowledge that, to date, no large scale trial has been done to confirm this definitively.

In the present study we focused on time-locked activity by means of phasic (event-related) EEG analysis during a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) over the course of sleep deprivation. Twenty healthy subjects (10 male; mean age +/- SD: 23.45 +/- 1.97 years) underwent sleep deprivation for 24 h. Subjects had to rate their sleepiness hourly (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and to perform a PVT while EEG was recorded simultaneously. Tonic EEG changes in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range were investigated by power spectral analyses. Single-trial (phase-locking index, PLI) and event-related potential (ERP) analyses (P1, N1) were used to examine event-related changes in EEG activity. Subjective sleepiness, PVT reaction times and tonic EEG activity (delta and theta spectral power) significantly increased over the night. In contrast, event-related EEG parameters decreased throughout sleep deprivation. Specifically, the ERP component P1 diminished in amplitude, and delta and theta PLI estimates decreased progressively over the night. It is suggested that event-related EEG measures (such as the amplitude of the P1 and especially delta / theta phase-locking) serve as a complimentary method to track the deterioration of attention and performance during sleep loss. As these measures actually reflect the impaired response to specific events rather than tonic changes during sleep deprivation they are a promising tool for future sleep research.

Spatiotemporal Analysis of Multichannel EEG: CARTOOL	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							SOURCE LOCALIZATION; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; REFERENCE ELECTRODE; BRAIN DYNAMICS; TOPOGRAPHY; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS; ORIGINS; PHASE	This paper describes methods to analyze the brain's electric fields recorded with multichannel Electroencephalogram ( EEG) and demonstrates their implementation in the software CARTOOL. It focuses on the analysis of the spatial properties of these fields and on quantitative assessment of changes of field topographies across time, experimental conditions, or populations. Topographic analyses are advantageous because they are reference independents and thus render statistically unambiguous results. Neurophysiologically, differences in topography directly indicate changes in the configuration of the active neuronal sources in the brain. We describe global measures of field strength and field similarities, temporal segmentation based on topographic variations, topographic analysis in the frequency domain, topographic statistical analysis, and source imaging based on distributed inverse solutions. All analysis methods are implemented in a freely available academic software package called CARTOOL. Besides providing these analysis tools, CARTOOL is particularly designed to visualize the data and the analysis results using 3-dimensional display routines that allow rapid manipulation and animation of 3D images. CARTOOL therefore is a helpful tool for researchers as well as for clinicians to interpret multichannel EEG and evoked potentials in a global, comprehensive, and unambiguous way.

The Relationship between Brain Oscillations and BOLD Signal during Memory Formation: A Combined EEG-fMRI Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; BINDING; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXPERIENCES	Previous studies demonstrated that increases in the theta frequency band with concomitant decreases in the alpha/beta frequency band indicate successful memory formation. However, little is known about the brain regions and the cognitive processes that underlie these encoding-related oscillatory memory effects. We investigated this relationship using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in humans during long-term memory encoding. In line with prior studies, we demonstrate that a decrease in beta power and an increase in theta power positively predict subsequent recall. In fMRI, stronger activity in the left inferior prefrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus correlated with successful memory formation. EEG source localization revealed that the subsequent memory effect in the beta band was localized in the left inferior prefrontal cortex, whereas the effect in the theta band was localized in medial temporal lobe regions. Trial-by-trial correlations between EEG and BOLD activity showed that beta power correlated negatively with left inferior prefrontal cortex activity. This correlation was more pronounced for items that could later be successfully recalled compared to items later forgotten. Based on these findings, we suggest that beta oscillations in the left inferior prefrontal cortex indicate semantic encoding processes, whereas theta oscillations in the medial temporal lobe reflect the binding of an item to its spatiotemporal context.

Parallels in Stimulus-Driven Oscillatory Brain Responses to Numerosity Changes in Adults and Seven-Month-Old Infants	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							LARGE-NUMBER DISCRIMINATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL BINDING; EEG ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION; ACHIEVEMENT	Previous studies provide indirect evidence for an ontogenetically continuous Approximate-Number System. We employed a rapid steady-state visual-presentation paradigm combined with electroencephalography to measure stimulus-driven neural oscillatory responses to numerosities in infants and adults. Steady-state repetition of the same numerosity across a 2.4-sec time block yielded an increase in the stimulus-locked neural entrainment in both groups. Entrainment changes following a numerosity switch varied by the ratio of the numerosities, consistent with Weber's Law.

A unique ANNAD-based decision-making process is devised to make this distinction by 1) computing all standard EEG parameters in both time and frequency domain and 2) determining which of these parameters will yield the optimal classifier. The temporal parameters include activity, mobility and complexity, and the frequency parameters include the spectral power in delta, theta, alpha, beta I and II, and gamma. A single layer perceptron was used to conduct this analysis without initially setting any conditions on the weight vector, but rather allowed for the random generation of these conditions, with as many trials as necessary. This is an important first step that confines the search space to only those EEG data that have a very high likelihood of being recorded from epileptic patients, significantly minimizing the time for accurate diagnosis. We have evaluated our system using 125 EEG files selected randomly from a database consisting of 10 subjects (5 non-epileptic and 5 epileptic). The proposed ANNAD system was capable of diagnosing subjects with epilepsy with an accuracy of 92.0.4% and a calculated F-measure of 93.39%.

Methods In our study, nine adolescents and young adults with WS and 9 age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) participants underwent polysomnography. We examined sleep architecture, leg movements and the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra of specific frequency bands at different scalp locations. Results We found an atypical, WS characteristic sleep pattern with decreased sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency, increased wake time after sleep onset, increased non-rapid eye movement percentage, increased slow wave sleep, decreased rapid eye movement sleep percentage, increased number of leg movements and irregular sleep cycles. Patients with WS showed an increased delta and slow wave activity and decreased alpha and sigma activity in the spectral analysis of the EEG. Conclusions Sleep maintenance and organisation are significantly affected in WS, while EEG spectra suggest increases in sleep pressure.

HFOs were originally discovered with intracranial micro-electrodes, but have, in the meantime, been identified in standard clinical intracranial electrodes and on surface EEGs. Several studies have shown a correlation between the removal of HFO generating tissue and postsurgical outcome. This review focuses on HFOs and their value as a biomarker of epilepto-genicity. Various clinical applications of HFOs and methodological problems are discussed. In conclusion, HFOs are promising EEG markers in epilepsy. Multicenter prospective studies are, however, necessary to evaluate clinical relevance and reliability of HFOs prior to widespread clinical use.	[Le Van, J.

Visual scoring of 30-s epochs of sleep data is not always adequate to show the dynamic structure of sleep in sufficient details. It is also prone to considerable inter- and intra-rater variability. Moreover, it involves considerable training and experience, and is very tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Hence, automatic sleep staging is needed to overcome these limitations. Since naturally occurring NREM sleep and anesthesia have been reported to possess various underlying neurophysiological similarities, EEG-based depth-of-anesthesia monitors have started to penetrate into sleep research. This study investigates the ability of WAV(CNS) index (as implemented in NeuroSENSE depth-of-anesthesia monitor) to detect NREM sleep stages and wake state for full overnight PSG data. Methods. Full overnight PSG sleep data, obtained from 24 adolescents, was scored by a registered PSG technologist for different sleep stages. Retrospective analysis was performed on a single frontal channel using the WAV(CNS) algorithm. Non-parametric descriptive statistics were used to examine the relationship between WAVCNS index and sleep stages. Results. A strong correlation (rho = 0.9458) was found between the WAV(CNS) index and NREM sleep stages, with WAV(CNS) index values decreasing with increasing sleep stages. Moreover, there was no significant overlap between different NREM sleep stages as classified by the WAV(CNS) index, which was able to significantly differentiate (P < 0.001) between all pairs of Awake and different NREM stages. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that changes in the depth of natural NREM sleep are reflected sensitively by changes in the WAV(CNS) index. Hence, WAV(CNS) index may serve as an automatic real-time indicator of depth of natural sleep with high temporal resolution, and can possibly be of great use for automated sleep staging in routine/postoperative somnographic studies.

Methods: 128-channel SEPs elicited by electrical stimuli of the left posterior tibial nerve were recorded from 11 healthy subjects. Probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) was used as a spatial filter to isolate SEP-related independent components (ICs), and wavelet filtering was used as a time-frequency filter to further enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs. Results: SEP-related ICs, identified using PICA, showed typical patterns of cortical SEP complex (P39-N50-P60) and scalp topography (centrally distributed with the spatial peak located near vertex). In addition, wavelet filtering significantly enhanced the SNR of single-trial SEPs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Combining PICA and wavelet filtering offers a space-time-frequency filter that can be used to enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs greatly, thus providing a reliable estimation of single-trial SEPs. Significance: This method can be used to detect single-trial SEPs and other types of evoked potentials (EPs) in various sensory modalities, thus facilitating the exploration of single-trial dynamics between EPs, behavioural variables (e. g., intensity of perception), as well as abnormalities in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring.

Degradation of white matter tracts related to age or alcoholism should negatively affect the oscillatory activity within the network. Objective This study aims to evaluate the effect of alcoholism and age on delta and theta oscillations and the relationship between these oscillations and measures of white matter microstructural integrity. Methods Data from ten long-term alcoholics to 25 nonalcoholic controls were used to derive P3 from Fz, Cz, and Pz using a visual GO/NOGO protocol. Total power and across trial phase synchrony measures were calculated for delta and theta frequencies. DTI, 1.5 T, data formed the basis of quantitative fiber tracking in the left and right cingulate bundles and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity (lambda L and lambda T) measures were calculated from each tract. Results NOGO P3 amplitude and delta power at Cz were smaller in alcoholics than controls. Lower delta total power was related to higher lambda T in the left and right cingulate bundles. GO P3 amplitude was lower and GO P3 latency was longer with advancing age, but none of the time-frequency analysis measures displayed significant age or diagnosis effects. Conclusions The relation of delta total power at CZ with lT in the cingulate bundles provides correlational evidence for a functional role of fronto-parietal white matter tracts in inhibitory processing.

Single-trial EEG Discrimination between Wrist and Finger Movement Imagery and Execution in a Sensorimotor BCI	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)		Brain-computer Interface (BCI); electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS); independent component analysis (ICA)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; HAND	A brain-computer interface (BCI) may be used to control a prosthetic or orthotic hand using neural activity from the brain. The core of this sensorimotor BCI lies in the interpretation of the neural information extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG). It is desired to improve on the interpretation of EEG to allow people with neuromuscular disorders to perform daily activities. This paper investigates the possibility of discriminating between the EEG associated with wrist and finger movements. The EEG was recorded from test subjects as they executed and imagined five essential hand movements using both hands. Independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency techniques were used to extract spectral features based on event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS), while the Bhattacharyya distance (BD) was used for featurer eduction. Mahalanobis distance (MD) clustering and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as classifiers and obtained average accuracies of 65% and 71% respectively. This shows that EEG discrimination between wrist and finger movements is possible. The research introduces a new combination of motor tasks to BCI research.	[Mohamed, A.

MEG/EEG Source Reconstruction, Statistical Evaluation, and Visualization with NUTMEG	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN; MEG; EEG; LOCALIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SUPPRESSION; MODELS; ATLAS	NUTMEG is a source analysis toolbox geared towards cognitive neuroscience researchers using MEG and EEG, including intracranial recordings. Evoked and unaveraged data can be imported to the toolbox for source analysis in either the time or time-frequency domains. NUTMEG offers several variants of adaptive beamformers, probabilistic reconstruction algorithms, as well as minimum-norm techniques to generate functional maps of spatiotemporal neural source activity. Lead fields can be calculated from single and overlapping sphere head models or imported from other software. Group averages and statistics can be calculated as well. In addition to data analysis tools, NUTMEG provides a unique and intuitive graphical interface for visualization of results. Source analyses can be superimposed onto a structural MRI or headshape to provide a convenient visual correspondence to anatomy. These results can also be navigated interactively, with the spatial maps and source time series or spectrogram linked accordingly. Animations can be generated to view the evolution of neural activity over time. NUTMEG can also display brain renderings and perform spatial normalization of functional maps using SPM's engine. As a MATLAB package, the end user may easily link with other toolboxes or add customized functions.

The essence of the method using the IEBW is to track bandwidths changes of EEG signals. Arousal maintenance state against sleepiness can be considered to be in a different physiological state compared to the normal sleep onset. The method was therefore applied to the EEG signals in the wakefulness maintenance state against sleepiness in order to capture the feature of the EEG signals. As a result, we have revealed that EEG signals while the subjects were trying to maintain wakefulness state against sleepiness had wide bandwidth compared to the EEG signals in normal sleep onset because of the EEG desynchronization. It can be considered that neuron activities from the frontal association area which coordinates behavior to hypothalamus which coordinates wakefulness and sleep were raised in order to maintain wakefulness state against sleepiness. Meanwhile, it is considered that EEG activity in gamma band is influenced by muscle activity. We therefore measured electromyograms (EMG) at mentalis muscle and trapezius muscle in order to evaluate the influence of the EMGs for the EEGs. The results showed that the EMG and the EEG were not correlated each other.

Here, we tested the ancillary hypothesis that golfer's performance is also associated to an improved coordination of cortical activity, as reflected by functional coupling of alpha rhythms across cortical regions. To this aim, between-electrodes spectral coherence was computed from spatially enhanced EEG data of the mentioned study (i.e. right handed 12 expert golfers; augmented 10-20 system: surface Laplacian estimation). Low- (about 8-10 Hz) and high-frequency (about 10-12 Hz) alpha sub-bands were considered with reference to individual alpha frequency peak. Statistical results showed that intra-hemispheric low-frequency alpha coherence in bilateral parietal-frontal (P3-F3 and P4-F4 electrodes) and parietal-central (P3-C3 and P4-C4 electrodes) was higher in amplitude in successful than unsuccessful putts (p<0.004). The same was true for intra-hemispheric high-frequency alpha coherence in bilateral parietal-frontal regions (p<0.004). These findings suggest that intra-hemispheric functional coupling of cortical alpha rhythms between "visuo-spatial" parietal area and other cortical areas is implicated in fine motor control of golfer's performance.

A novel telemetry system for recording EEG in small animals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Wireless telemetry; Rats; Open source	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; KAINATE-INDUCED EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FREELY MOVING RATS; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; SEIZURES; RADIOTELEMETRY; STRESS; BRAIN; ONSET	It has become increasingly evident that continuous EEG monitoring is necessary to observe the development of epilepsy in animals, and to determine the effect of drugs on spontaneous seizures. Telemetric recording systems have been increasingly used to monitor EEG in freely moving animals. One challenge faced by such systems is to monitor frequencies above 80 Hz continuously for weeks. We present an implantable, 2.4-ml, telemetric sensor that can monitor EEG at 512 samples per second for eight weeks in a freely moving animal. With minor modifications, the same transmitter can operate at higher sample rates with a proportional decrease in operating life. Signal transmission is through bursts of 915-MHz radio power. The burst transmission and several other novel techniques reduce the transmitter's power consumption by two orders of magnitude while allowing 8 transmitters to share the same recording system. The use of radio-frequency transmission permits digitization within the sensor to sixteen-bit resolution, thus eliminating transmission-generated signal noise. The result is a signal with dynamic range 9 mV, bandwidth 160 Hz, input noise 12 mu V, and AC power interference less than 1 mu V. All circuit diagrams are open-source. Data acquisition takes place over the Internet using open-source software that works on multiple operating systems. The resulting system permits long-term, continuous, monitoring of EEG signals, therefore providing continuous and reliable data upon which to base studies of epilepsy in freely moving animals.

Modulated microwave radiation was applied as a weak periodic stressor with strongly inhomogeneous distribution inside the brain. Experiments were performed on a group of 14 volunteers. Ten cycles (1 min on, 1 min off) of 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 40 Hz were applied. Higuchi's FD was calculated in eight symmetric electroencephalographic (EEG) channels located in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. FD values averaged over a group detected a small (1-2%) but statistically significant increase with exposure in all EEG channels. FD increased for 12, decreased for one, and was constant for one subject. FD showed the most remarkable effect in temporal and parietal regions of the left hemisphere where the microwave field was maximal. Changes of FD in these regions of the right hemisphere were much higher than expected in accordance with the field distribution. Correlation of FD between different EEG channels was high and retained its value in exposed conditions. Spreading of disturbance between different brain areas is supposed to be crucial for the effect of exposure on the electrical oscillations in the brain.

Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, 3-way, parallel-group transient insomnia study in 22 sleep laboratories. After a baseline night (N1), subjects underwent a 4-h phase-advance of their habitual sleep time the following night (N2). Healthy subjects aged 18-64 y were given single-blind placebo on N1 followed by double-blind treatment on N2 (gaboxadol 10 mg [n = 271], 15 mg [n = 274], or placebo [n = 277]) Results: At baseline, women showed significantly greater values in low frequency activity (< 10 Hz) and in high spindle/low beta frequency activity (14-18 Hz) compared to men. During the phase advance (placebo N2-baseline N1), there was a significant increase in power within the high spindle/low beta frequency range (15-17 Hz) and a significant reduction in beta activity (20-32 Hz), which was greater in women than men. Gaboxadol induced a significant (dose-related) increase in low frequencies (< 8 Hz) and a significant (dose-related) decrease within the alpha/spindle range (11-12 Hz). The effect was dependent upon sex, with a greater magnitude of effect observed in women than men. Conclusion: Gaboxadol shows a characteristic NREM EEG spectral profile in a model of transient insomnia. Men and women show clear differences in NREM EEG activity at baseline, to gaboxadol treatment and to phase-shifts in habitual sleep/wake times. The exact mechanisms underlying the sex differences remain unclear, but sex is an important variable in studies evaluating sleep and gaboxadol.

Tracking brain states under general anesthesia by using global coherence analysis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						alpha rhythm; delta rhythm; loss of consciousness	INDUCED ALPHA-RHYTHM; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; EEG; PROPOFOL; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DISEASE; SIGNALS; INDEX; POWER	Time and frequency domain analyses of scalp EEG recordings are widely used to track changes in brain states under general anesthesia. Although these analyses have suggested that different spatial patterns are associated with changes in the state of general anesthesia, the extent to which these patterns are spatially coordinated has not been systematically characterized. Global coherence, the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the sum of the eigenvalues of the cross-spectral matrix at a given frequency and time, has been used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of multivariate time-series. Using 64-lead EEG recorded from human subjects receiving computer-controlled infusions of the anesthetic propofol, we used surface Laplacian referencing combined with spectral and global coherence analyses to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain's anesthetic state. During unconsciousness the spectrograms in the frontal leads showed increasing alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta power (0-4 Hz) and in the occipital leads delta power greater than a power. The global coherence detected strong coordinated a activity in the occipital leads in the awake state that shifted to the frontal leads during unconsciousness. It revealed a lack of coordinated d activity during both the awake and unconscious states. Although strong frontal power during general anesthesia-induced unconsciousness-termed anteriorization-is well known, its possible association with strong a range global coherence suggests highly coordinated spatial activity. Our findings suggest that combined spectral and global coherence analyses may offer a new approach to tracking brain states under general anesthesia.

We assumed an interference model in the processes of taste and vision information. The model was tested with frequency analysis on EEG and using the switch response time. The tasks were matched/miss-matched between taste and vision information about orange juice and apple juice. There were changes in the a waves that originated in the visual processing of a juice package, and changes in the beta waves that originated in the taste processing. There is the possibility of a parallel processing mechanism in the vision-taste interference.

The development of BCI consisted of several steps. First, spline Laplacian analysis was performed. Next, time-frequency analysis was applied to determine the optimal frequency range and latencies of the electroencephalograms (EEGs). Finally, trials were classified as right or left based on P-band event-related synchronization using the cumulative distribution function of pretrigger EEG noise. To test the performance of the BCI, EEGs during the execution and imagination of right/left wrist-bending movements were measured from 63 locations over the entire scalp using eight healthy subjects. The highest classification accuracies were 84.4% and 77.8% for real movements and their imageries, respectively. The accuracy is significantly higher than that of previously reported machine-learning-based BCIs in the movement imagery task (paired t-test, p < 0.05). It has also been demonstrated that the highest accuracy was achieved even though subjects had never participated in movement imageries.

Sixty video/EEG-recorded PNES induced by suggestion maneuvers were evaluated. We examined the relationship between results from this scale and results from the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale to validate this technique. Interrater reliabilities of the PNES scale for three raters were analyzed using the AC1 statistic, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The relationship between the CGI and PNES scales was evaluated with Spearman correlations. The AC1 statistic demonstrated good interrater reliability for each phenomenon analyzed (tremor/oscillation, tonic; clonic/jerking, hypermotor/agitation, atonic/akinetic, automatisms, associated features). KCC and the ICC showed moderate interrater agreement for phenomenology, associated phenomena, and total PNES scores. Spearman's correlation of mean CGI score with mean total PNES score was 0.69 (P < 0.001). The scale described here accurately evaluates the phenomenology of PNES and could be used to assess and compare subgroups of patients with PNES. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG coupling patterns associated with psychotherapy have not yet been quantified in socially anxious individuals. In this study, we used a double baseline, repeated measures design, in which 25 adults with a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder completed 12 weekly sessions of standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy and four EEG assessments: two at pretreatment, one at midtreatment, and one at posttreatment. Treatment was associated with reductions in symptom severity across multiple measures and informants, as well as reductions in delta-beta coupling at rest and during speech anticipation. Moreover, the clinical group exhibited greater coupling at pretreatment than did post hoc control participants with low social anxiety. The EEG cross-frequency profiles in the clinical group normalized by the posttreatment assessment. These findings provide evidence of concomitant improvement in neural and behavioral functioning among socially anxious adults undergoing psychotherapy.

J	Ostwald, D; Porcaro, C; Bagshaw, AP				Ostwald, Dirk; Porcaro, Camillo; Bagshaw, Andrew P.			Voxel-wise information theoretic EEG-fMRI feature integration	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; ALPHA-RHYTHM; ARTIFACT; LOCALIZATION; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; REMOVAL; TOOLBOX; MAPS	We have recently proposed the evaluation of a set of information theoretic quantities (ITQs) for the integration of simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data (Ostwald, D., Porcaro, C., Bagshaw, A.P., 2010. An information theoretic approach to EEG-fMRI integration of visually evoked responses. Neuroimage. 49, 498-516). In our previous experimental evaluation of the information theoretic framework, we defined the data subsets from which to calculate the ITQs using a priori constraints. In the case of EEG, this meant that data were extracted from a single electrode, while for fMRI the analysed data came from voxels contained within a sphere surrounding the most responsive voxel of visual cortex. While this approach was a natural starting point for the evaluation of the framework in the application to combined EEG-fMRI data sets, a more principled approach to data selection is desirable. Here, we propose to combine standard fMRI data preprocessing and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for the evaluation of ITQs across the entire three-dimensional brain space. We apply the proposed method to a simultaneous EEG-fMRI data set acquired during checkerboard stimulation and assess the topographical informativeness of EEG (time and frequency domain) and fMRI features with respect to the stimulus and each other. The resulting information theoretic effect size maps are supplemented with a statistical evaluation based on Gaussian null model simulations using a false-discovery rate procedure. Given the contamination of EEG recordings by artefacts induced by the MR scanning environment we further assessed the influence of different advanced EEG preprocessing methods (independent component analysis and functional source separation) on the information topography. The results of this analysis provide evidence for the topographically focussed informativeness of both EEG and fMRI features with respect to the stimulus, but for the current feature selection do not detect EEG-fMRI activity dependence.

Interictal regional delta slowing is an EEG marker of epileptic network in temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						TIRDA; Interictal spikes; Seizure onset zone; ECoG; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Epileptogenesis	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FOCAL EPILEPSY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; ACTIVITY TIRDA; SEIZURE ONSET; HYPOMETABOLISM; LOCALIZATION; REGISTRATION; TOMOGRAPHY	P>Purpose: Several studies have suggested that interictal regional delta slowing (IRDS) carries a lateralizing and localizing value similar to interictal spikes and is associated with favorable surgical outcomes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, whether IRDS reflects structural dysfunction or underlying epileptic activity remains controversial. The objective of this study is to determine the cortical electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of scalp-recorded IRDS, in so doing, to further understand its clinical and biologic significances. Methods: We examined the cortical EEG substrates of IRDS with electrocorticography (ECoG-IRDS) and delineated the spatiotemporal relationship between ECoG-IRDS and both interictal and ictal discharges by recording simultaneously scalp and intracranial EEG in 18 presurgical candidates with TLE. Key Findings: Our results demonstrated that ECoG-IRDS is typically a mixture of delta/theta slowing and spike-wave potentials. ECoG-IRDS was predominantly recorded from basal and anterolateral temporal cortex, occasionally in mesial, posterior temporal, and extratemporal regions. Abundant IRDS was most commonly observed in patients with neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (NTLE), whereas infrequent to moderate IRDS was usually observed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The anatomic distribution of ECoG-IRDS was highly correlated with the irritative and seizure-onset zones in 10 patients with NTLE. However, it was poorly correlated with the irritative and seizure-onset zones in the 8 patients with MTLE. Significance: These findings demonstrate that IRDS is an EEG marker of epileptic network in patients with TLE. Although IRDS and interictal/ictal discharges likely arise from the same neocortical generator in patients with NTLE, IRDS in patients with MTLE may reflect a network disease that involves temporal neocortex.

The index of consciousness (IoC), the permutation entropy (PE), and the approximate entropy are recent EEG-derived indices of anaesthetic depth. In this study, a rabbit model under fentanyl and isoflurane anaesthesia was used to compare the performance of these indices and also the classic median and spectral edge frequency 95%. Methods. EEG recordings were obtained from six rabbits. Animals received fentanyl for premedication, followed by induction with propofol and maintenance with isoflurane. Anaesthetic depth was evaluated according to a clinical scale from 1 (awake) to 4 (surgical anaesthesia). Animals were submitted to surgical implantation of a small device in the lumbar muscles. A correction factor for the EEG suppression ratio was applied to the spectral parameters and to the PE. The correlation of the indices with the clinical scale of anaesthesia was analysed using prediction probability. Repeated-measures analysis of variance or its non-parametric equivalent was used to analyse the indices values at the study times and to compare their variability. Results. The IoC showed the best mean prediction probability value [0.94 (0.01)] followed by burst suppression-corrected PE [0.91(0.03)]. Both parameters also showed less variability than the others. Conclusions. The IoC and PE are promising indices for anaesthetic depth monitoring. The PE might benefit from the application of a burst suppression correction at deeper stages of anaesthesia. The rabbit is useful as a translational research animal model for the validation of clinical indices.	[Silva, A.; Ferreira, D. A.; Venancio, C.; Antunes, L.

Methods: The time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) method was used to estimate the EEG functional connectivity in the alpha and beta bands for seven healthy subjects during four functional states: the resting, preparing, movement-onset, and movement-offset states. Results: In the preparing state, the maintenance of the central-executive network (CEN, prefrontal-parietal connection) suppressed the motor network in the alpha band to plan the next movement, whereas the CEN was deactivated in the beta band to retain visual attention (the frontal-occipital connection). A significant decrease of the CEN in the alpha band occurred after a visual cue in the movement-onset state, followed by a significant increase in motor-network connectivity in the beta band until the movement-offset state. Conclusions: The temporal-spectral modulation mechanism allows the brain to manifest multiple functions subject to energy budget. Significance: The TFCMI method was employed to estimate EEG functional connectivity and effectively demonstrate the reorganization process between four functional states.

It has been hypothesized that this mechanism for neuronal communication is realized by bursts of high-frequency oscillations that are phase-coupled to a low-frequency spatially distributed coupling oscillation. This mechanism requires multiple physiologically different interacting sources, one generating the low-frequency coupling oscillation and the others generating phase-coupled high-frequency oscillations. Using human intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, we provide evidence for multiple oscillatory patterns, as characterized on the basis of their spatial maps (topographies) and their frequency spectra. In fact, we show that the spatial maps for the coupling oscillations are much more widespread than the ones for the associated phase-coupled bursts. Second, in the majority of the patterns of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), phase-coupled bursts of high-frequency activity are synchronized across brain areas. Third and last, working memory operations affect the PAC strength in a heterogeneous way: in some PAC patterns, working memory operations increase their strength, whereas in others they decrease it.

A prominent feature of the hippocampal network is the capability to generate rhythmic oscillations. Serotonergic modulation is known to play an important role in the regulation of theta rhythm. 5-HT2c receptors represent a specific target of psychopharmacology and, in particular, the behavioral effects of the 5-HT2c receptor agonist mCPP have been thoroughly tested. The present study used this compound and the selective 5-HT2c receptor antagonist SB-242084 to elucidate the role of 5-HT2c receptors in the generation of hippocampal oscillations. Hippocampal EEG was recorded and the power in the theta frequency range was monitored in different behaviors in freely-moving rats and after brainstem stimulation in anesthetized animals. We found that in freely-moving rats, mCPP suppressed hippocampal theta rhythm and the effect was stronger during REM sleep than during waking theta states. Under urethane anesthesia, mCPP decreased the power for both spontaneous and elicited theta rhythm in a dose-dependent manner and the 5-HT2c antagonist reversed this effect. The results of this study demonstrate that 5-HT2c receptors are important element of the serotonergic modulation of hippocampal theta oscillations and thus pharmacological interactions with these receptors can modulate physiological and pathological processes associated with limbic theta activity.

Quantitative EEG as a predictive biomarker for Parkinson disease dementia	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; FEATURES IMPROVE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RIVASTIGMINE; ACCURACY	Objective: We evaluated quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures as predictive biomarkers for the development of dementia in Parkinson disease (PD). Preliminary work shows that QEEG measures correlate with current PD cognitive state. A reliable predictive QEEG biomarker for PD dementia (PD-D) incidence would be valuable for studying PD-D, including treatment trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline in PD. Methods: A cohort of subjects with PD in our brain donation program utilizes annual premortem longitudinal movement and cognitive evaluation. These subjects also undergo biennial EEG recording. EEG from subjects with PD without dementia with follow-up cognitive evaluation was analyzed for QEEG measures of background rhythm frequency and relative power in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. The relationship between the time to onset of dementia and QEEG and other possible predictors was assessed by using Cox regression. Results: The hazard of developing dementia was 13 times higher for those with low background rhythm frequency (lower than the grand median of 8.5 Hz) than for those with high background rhythm frequency (p < 0.001). Hazard ratios (HRs) were also significant for > median theta bandpower (HR = 3.0; p = 0.004) compared to below, and for certain neuropsychological measures. The HRs for delta, alpha, and beta bandpower as well as baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not significant. Conclusion: The QEEG measures of background rhythm frequency and relative power in the theta band are potential predictive biomarkers for dementia incidence in PD. These QEEG biomarkers may be useful in complementing neuropsychological testing for studying PD-D incidence. Neurology(R) 2011;77:118-124	[Caviness, J.

One of the proposed solutions, which is probably the most accepted in the scientific community, involves the synchronized oscillations. According to this theory, the integration of the brain areas responsible for various features, such as color or spatial dimension of a perceived object, is the outcome of the synchronized oscillations of the neurons. Electroencephalogram (EEG) results show us that different frequency bands are correlated with particular mental states. However, after presenting in detail this approach, we try to show that it still encounters serious obstacles to be considered the definitive solution for the binding problem.

Given that alpha activity (8-12 Hz) has been shown to reflect the disengagement of task-irrelevant regions in attention and working memory tasks, we here ask if alpha activity plays a related role for long-term memory formation. Subjects were instructed to encode and maintain the order of word sequences while the ongoing brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In each trial, three words were presented followed by a 3.4 s rehearsal interval. Considering the good temporal resolution of MEG this allowed us to investigate the word presentation and rehearsal interval separately. The sequences were grouped in trials where word order either could be tested immediately (working memory trials; WM) or later (LTM trials) according to instructions. Subjects were tested on their ability to retrieve the order of the three words. The data revealed that alpha power in parieto-occipital regions was lower during word presentation compared to rehearsal. Our key finding was that parieto-occipital alpha power during the rehearsal period was markedly stronger for successfully than unsuccessfully encoded LTM sequences. This subsequent memory effect demonstrates that high posterior alpha activity creates an optimal brain state for successful LTM formation possibly by actively reducing parieto-occipital activity that might interfere with sequence encoding.

Furthermore, interactions among delay-induced oscillations can generate complex collective rhythms, which play important functional roles. However, due to their intrinsic infinite dimensionality, theoretical analysis of interacting delay-induced oscillations has been limited. Here, we show that the two primary methods for finite-dimensional limit cycles, namely, the center manifold reduction in the vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation and the phase reduction for weak interactions, can successfully be applied to interacting infinite-dimensional delay-induced oscillations. We systematically derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and the phase equation without delay for general interaction networks. Based on the reduced low-dimensional equations, we demonstrate that diffusive (linearly attractive) coupling between a pair of delay-induced oscillations can exhibit nontrivial amplitude death and multimodal phase locking. Our analysis provides unique insights into experimentally observed EEG activities such as sudden transitions among different phase-locked states and occurrence of epileptic seizures.

BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; TARGET DETECTION; N1 WAVE; EEG	Background: The oddball paradigm is widely applied to the investigation of cognitive function in neuroscience and in neuropsychiatry. Whether cortical oscillation in the resting state can predict the elicited oddball event related potential (ERP) is still not clear. This study explored the relationship between resting electroencephalography (EEG) and oddball ERPs. The regional powers of 18 electrodes across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were correlated with the amplitude and latency of N1, P2, N2 and P3 components of oddball ERPs. A multivariate analysis based on partial least squares (PLS) was applied to further examine the spatial pattern revealed by multiple correlations. Results: Higher synchronization in the resting state, especially at the alpha spectrum, is associated with higher neural responsiveness and faster neural propagation, as indicated by the higher amplitude change of N1/N2 and shorter latency of P2. None of the resting quantitative EEG indices predict P3 latency and amplitude. The PLS analysis confirms that the resting cortical dynamics which explains N1/N2 amplitude and P2 latency does not show regional specificity, indicating a global property of the brain. Conclusions: This study differs from previous approaches by relating dynamics in the resting state to neural responsiveness in the activation state. Our analyses suggest that the neural characteristics carried by resting brain dynamics modulate the earlier/automatic stage of target detection.

However, the traditional ERP approach discards most oscillatory information in the EEG through grand averaging process. This study tried to focus on ERP component of mismatch negativity (MMN) between control and schizophrenia groups in Taiwan. In addition to traditional (grand average) ERP approach, we also compared the time-frequency analysis results of the mismatch negativity. Methods: MMN values were recorded in 55 schizophrenia patients and 42 controls using an auditory oddball paradigm for the duration of the MMN. Besides the traditional grand average approach, the continuous data files were also used for time-frequency analysis via ERP wavelab. Six parameters were explored: event-related spectral perturbation, WTav, avWT, induced activity, intertrial phase coherence and intertrial linear coherence. Results: Traditional ERP approach discovered that group difference occurred in MMN mean amplitude which was compatible with the previous literature. In time-frequency analysis, schizophrenia subjects have lower intertrial phase coherence than controls. Conclusion: Deficit in preattentive sensory information processing, such as MMN, is prominent in Taiwanese schizophrenia subjects. It may also play a role in the basic integrated neural network activity, which could be further explored by time-frequency approach.

J	Jiang, XM; Mahadevan, S				Jiang, Xiaomo; Mahadevan, Sankaran			Wavelet spectrum analysis approach to model validation of dynamic systems	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Wavelet coherence analysis; Wavelet cross-spectra; Model validation; Hypothesis test; Dynamic system	COHERENCE ANALYSIS; EEG COHERENCE; TRANSFORMS; VERIFICATION; SIGNALS	Feature-based validation techniques for dynamic system models could be unreliable for nonlinear, stochastic, and transient dynamic behavior, where the time series is usually non-stationary. This paper presents a wavelet spectral analysis approach to validate a computational model for a dynamic system. Continuous wavelet transform is performed on the time series data for both model prediction and experimental observation using a Morlet wavelet function. The wavelet cross-spectrum is calculated for the two sets of data to construct a time-frequency phase difference map. The Box-plot, an exploratory data analysis technique, is applied to interpret the phase difference for validation purposes. In addition, wavelet time-frequency coherence is calculated using the locally and globally smoothed wavelet power spectra of the two data sets. Significance tests are performed to quantitatively verify whether the wavelet time-varying coherence is significant at a specific time and frequency point, considering uncertainties in both predicted and observed time series data. The proposed wavelet spectrum analysis approach is illustrated with a dynamics validation challenge problem developed at the Sandia National Laboratories. A comparison study is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodologies over classical frequency-independent cross-correlation analysis and time-independent cross-coherence analysis for the validation of dynamic systems.

Assessment of Sleep Quality in Powernapping	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EEG; SEGMENTATION	The purpose of this study is to assess the Sleep Quality (SQ) in powernapping. The contributed factors for SQ assessment are time of Sleep Onset (SO), Sleep Length (SL), Sleep Depth (SD), and detection of sleep events (K-complex (KC) and Sleep Spindle (SS)). Data from daytime nap for 10 subjects, 2 days each, including EEG and ECG were recorded. The SD and sleep events were analyzed by applying spectral analysis. The SO time was detected by a combination of signal spectral analysis, Slow Rolling Eye Movement (SREM) detection, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis and EEG segmentation using both Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and Crosscorrelation Function (CCF) methods. The EEG derivation FP1-FP2 filtered in a narrow band and used as an alternative to EOG for SREM detection. The ACF and CCF segmentation methods were also applied for detection of sleep events. The ACF method detects segment boundaries based on single channel analysis, while the CCF includes spatial variation from multiple EEG derivation. The results indicate that SREM detection using EEG is possible and can be used as input together with power spectral analysis to enhance SO detection. Both segmentation methods could detect SO as a segment boundary. Additionally they were able to contribute to detection of KC and SS events. The CCF method was more sensitive to spatial EEG changes and the exact segment boundaries varied slightly between the two methods. The HRV analysis revealed, that low and very low frequency variations in the heart rate was highly correlated with the EEG changes during both SO and variations in SD. Analyzing the relationship between the sleep events and SD showed a negative correlation between the Delta and Sigma activity. Analyzing the subjective measurement (SM) showed that there were a positive correlation between the SL and rated SQ. This preliminary study showed that the factors contributing to the overall SQ during powernapping can be assessed markedly better using a fusion of multiple methods. Future studies will include measures of individual performance before and after powernapping and investigate its relation to the assessed SQ.

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SLEEP INERTIA OF THE AWAKENING BRAIN	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep inertia; EEG power; cortical topography; local EEG changes; awakening	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; REACTION-TIME; WAKING EEG; DEPRIVATION; PERFORMANCE; TRANSITION; ALERTNESS; WAKEFULNESS; FINGERPRINT; PATTERNS	Sleep inertia (SI) denotes a period of hypovigilance, confusion and impaired cognitive and behavioral performance that immediately follows awakening. Based on the observation that the reactivation of some cortical areas is faster than other upon awakening, here we examined regional differences between presleep and postsleep waking period. Moreover, we also compared rapid eye movements (REM) and stage 2 non-rapid eye movements (NREM) awakenings in a within-subject design. Presleep and postsleep waking electroencephalogram (EEG; 5 min with eyes-closed and 5 min with eyes-open) of 18 healthy subjects (12 males, mean age=23.8 +/- 2.3 years) were recorded from 19 derivations. Participants slept for two consecutive nights in the laboratory. In one night they were awakened from stage 2 NREM, while in the other from REM sleep. EEG power spectra were calculated across the following bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-16 Hz) and beta-2 (17-24 Hz). Moreover, a detailed hertz-by-hertz analysis has been repeated in the 2-4 Hz frequency range. Postsleep wakefulness, compared to presleep, is characterized by a generalized decrease of higher beta-1 and beta-2 EEG power over almost all scalp locations. A detailed analysis of topographical modifications in the low-frequency range showed that postsleep wakefulness is characterized by an increased delta activity in the posterior scalp locations, and by a concomitant frontal decrease compared to presleep. Moreover, it was found a prevalence of EEG power in the high frequency ranges (beta-1 and beta-2) upon awakening from stage 2 compared to REM awakenings over the left anterior derivations. Altogether these findings support the hypothesis that a generalized reduction in beta activity and increased delta activity in more posterior areas upon awakening may represent the EEG substratum of the sleep inertia phenomenon.

This study aims to quantify and map the complexity of the EEG during PS, where complexity is measured as the degree of unpredictability resulting from local linear prediction. EEG activity was recorded with eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EC)) during resting and PS at 5, 10, and 15 Hz in a group of 30 healthy subjects and in a case-report of a patient suffering from cerebral ischemia. The mean squared prediction error (MSPE) resulting from k-nearest neighbour local linear prediction was calculated in each condition as an index of EEG unpredictability. The linear or nonlinear nature of the system underlying EEG activity was evaluated quantifying MSPE as a function of the neighbourhood size during local linear prediction, and by surrogate data analysis as well. Unpredictability maps were obtained for each subject interpolating MSPE values over a schematic head representation. Results on healthy subjects evidenced: (i) the prevalence of linear mechanisms in the generation of EEG dynamics, (ii) the lower predictability of EO EEG, (iii) the desynchronization of oscillatory mechanisms during PS leading to increased EEG complexity, (iv) the entrainment of alpha rhythm during EC obtained by 10 Hz PS, and (v) differences of EEG predictability among different scalp regions. Ischemic patient showed different MSPE values in healthy and damaged regions. The EEG predictability decreased moving from the early acute stage to a stage of partial recovery. These results suggest that nonlinear prediction can be a useful tool to characterize EEG dynamics during PS protocols, and may consequently constitute a complement of quantitative EEG analysis in clinical applications.

In the current study, bicuculline (GABA(A) antagonist) and muscimol (GABA(A) agonist) were microinjected into the deep layers of either the anterior SC (aSC) or posterior SC (pSC) of genetically developed Wistar audiogenic rats. Behavior and EEG activity were studied simultaneously. Only muscimol microinjected into the pSC had behavioral and EEG anticonvulsant effects in Wistar audiogenic rats, eliciting EEG oscillation changes in both SNPr and pSC, primarily during tonic seizures. The SC of Wistar audiogenic rats thus comprises two functionally different subregions, pSC and aSC, defined by distinct behavioral and EEG features. The pSC has proconvulsant audiogenic seizure activity in Wistar audiogenic rats. Our data suggest that this phenomenon may be a consequence of the genetic selection of the Wistar audiogenic rat strain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

REG-ICA: A hybrid methodology combining Blind Source Separation and regression techniques for the rejection of ocular artifacts	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EOG artifact rejection; REG-ICA; ICA; Regression analysis; Adaptive filter; EEG; EOG	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG SIGNALS; REMOVAL	There are so far two main methodological approaches for rejecting ocular artifacts from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals: regression- and Blind Source Separation (BSS)-based techniques, both having merits, as well as, some serious limitations. In this piece of work, a hybrid methodology that combines the main advantages of these two methods is proposed. We hypothesize that the artifactual independent components (ICs) extracted by a BSS method include more ocular and less cerebral activity than the contaminated EEG signals. We thus propose to apply a regression algorithm to the ICs rather than directly to the recorded signals. The analysis was carried out with synthetic mixtures of real EEG and electroocculographic (EOG) recordings. A BSS method, the extended INFOMAX version of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), was initially used to decompose the artificially contaminated EEG signals into spatiotemporal ICs. Then, a regression scheme, based on a stable version of the Recursive Least Squares algorithm, sRLS, was applied to the artifactual components in order to remove only the ocular artifacts, maintaining the underlying neural signals intact. The processed ICs were then projected back, reconstructing the artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed technique was compared with two automatic techniques; a regression technique based on Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and a BSS-based artifact rejection technique called wavelet-ICA (W-ICA) on the artificially contaminated data. For comparison, two metrics were used to assess the different methods' performance: the first quantified how successful each technique was in removing the ocular artifacts from the EEG recordings, and the second one quantified how much each technique distorted the ongoing brain activity in both time and frequency domains. Confirming our main hypothesis, results have shown that the artifactual ICs contained more ocular and less cerebral activity (p < 0.04) (artifact to signal ratio (ASR) = 1.83 +/- 3.65) in contrast to the contaminated electrode signals (ASR = 0.69 +/- 3.40). Our results reveal that the proposed methodology, namely REG-ICA, removes the ocular artifacts more successfully than W-ICA (p < 0.01) or LMS (p < 0.01). It also distorts less the brain activity in the time domain when compared to W-ICA and LMS. In the frequency domain, it distorts the brain activity less than the W-ICA in all frequency bands, and less than the LMS for the delta, beta, and gamma bands. Our results suggest that the proposed methodology is evidently an attractive alternative to other already proposed artifact rejection methodologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

So far, the correlative or causal nature of the link between brain oscillations and functions has remained elusive. A compelling demonstration of causality would primarily generate oscillatory signatures that are known to correlate with particular cognitive functions and then assess the behavioral consequences. Here, we provide the first direct evidence for causal entrainment of brain oscillations by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using concurrent EEG. Results: We used rhythmic TMS bursts to directly interact with an MEG-identified parietal alpha-oscillator, activated by attention and linked to perception. With TMS bursts tuned to its preferred alpha-frequency (alpha-TMS), we confirmed the three main predictions of entrainment of a natural oscillator: (1) that alpha-oscillations are induced during alpha-TMS (reproducing an oscillatory signature of the stimulated parietal cortex), (2) that there is progressive enhancement of this alpha-activity (synchronizing the targeted, alpha-generator to the alpha-TMS train), and (3) that this depends on the pre-TMS phase of the background alpha-rhythm (entrainment of natural, ongoing alpha-oscillations). Control conditions testing different TMS burst profiles and TMS-EEG in a phantom head confirmed specificity of alpha-boosting to the case of synchronization between TMS train and neural oscillator. Conclusions: The periodic electromagnetic force that is generated during rhythmic TMS can cause local entrainment of natural brain oscillations, emulating oscillatory signatures activated by cognitive tasks. This reveals a new mechanism of online TMS action on brain activity and can account for frequency-specific behavioral TMS effects at the level of biologically relevant rhythms.

A shortened REM latency has also been reported. We investigated the effects of a double-blind radiofrequency exposure (884 MHz, GSM signaling standard including non-DTX and DTX mode, time-averaged 10 g psSAR of 1.4 W/kg) on self-evaluated sleepiness and objective EEG measures during sleep. Forty-eight subjects (mean age 28 years) underwent 3 h of controlled exposure (7:30-10:30 PM; active or sham) prior to sleep, followed by a full-night polysomnographic recording in a sleep laboratory. The results demonstrated that following exposure, time in Stages 3 and 4 sleep (SWS, slow-wave sleep) decreased by 9.5 min (12%) out of a total of 78.6 min, and time in Stage 2 sleep increased by 8.3 min (4%) out of a total of 196.3 min compared to sham. The latency to Stage 3 sleep was also prolonged by 4.8 min after exposure. Power density analysis indicated an enhanced activation in the frequency ranges 0.5-1.5 and 5.75-10.5 Hz during the first 30 min of Stage 2 sleep, with 7.5-11.75 Hz being elevated within the first hour of Stage 2 sleep, and bands 4.75-8.25 Hz elevated during the second hour of Stage 2 sleep. No pronounced power changes were observed in SWS or for the third hour of scored Stage 2 sleep. No differences were found between controls and subjects with prior complaints of mobile phone-related symptoms. The results confirm previous findings that RF exposure increased the EEG alpha range in the sleep EEG, and indicated moderate impairment of SWS. Furthermore, reported differences in sensitivity to mobile phone use were not reflected in sleep parameters. Bioelectromagnetics 32:4-14, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Lisman and Idiart's theoretical model of STM proposes that this value depends on the number of gamma cycles that can fit in one theta cycle. Previous studies on animals and humans provided support for this hypothesis but direct evidence from human EEG scalp recordings has not previously been reported. We recorded spontaneous EEG activity from 17 participants and measured their verbal STM capacity with a modified digit span task from the Wechsler battery. The strong and positive correlation we found between verbal STM capacity and theta/gamma cycle length ratio thus provides a direct argument in favor of this STM theoretical model.

A representative, yet analytically tractable, model is essential to EEG processing. Several studies have examined different statistical models for EEG power spectrum. But recent studies have shown that not only the power, but also the phase of the spectrum, carries relevant information on brain activities. As a result, this paper focuses on the complex-valued spectrum of EEG, and proposes a general non-circularly-symmetric multivariate Gaussian model for this spectrum. This simple model can encapsulate the information in both power and phase of the spectrum, and its validity for EEG data has been verified using standard statistical tests.

In the present study, we performed fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis of kindling-induced afterdischarge (AD) in the rabbit hippocampus. Ten adult rabbits were used. Kindling stimulation to the right hippocampus was delivered as a train of biphasic pulses (1 ms duration each) of 50 Hz for 1 s, with suprathreshold intensity for AD. Motor responses were classified into five stages according to the conventional criteria. Of 10 animals, five developed stage 5 convulsions with a mean of 21 stimulations (kindled (K) group), while the remaining five animals did not (incomplete kindling (IK) group). We standardized each ratio of power spectral density of lower frequency band component (LFB: 0-9 Hz) and the higher frequency band (HFB: 12-30 Hz) in the initial stage as 1.0. The IK group exhibited small decrements (0.99 and 0.94 times) in LFB and HFB components at the final stage. In contrast, the K group exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) large decrement (0.49 times) in the LFB component and a very large increment (4.45 times) of HFB component at the final stage. Correlation analyses were performed between alteration of power spectral density ratio of the HFB component and AD duration, interictal discharge frequency, and behavioral stage during kindling progression. Fairly strong positive correlations were found in all cases in the K group. FFT analysis of kindling-induced AD demonstrated an important role of the HFB component: enhancement of the HFB component is associated with kindled stage, while decrement of it is associated with incomplete kindling stage. These findings suggest that FFT analysis of stimulus-induced and spontaneous seizure discharges is useful for examination of the progression of epileptic disorders. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Among the genetic variants, polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and variable-number-of-tandem-repeat in the second intron (5-HTTVNTR) have functional consequences. However, their genetic impact on cortical oscillation remains unclear. This study examined the modulatory effects of 5-HTTLPR (L-allele carriers vs. non-carriers) and 5-HTTVNTR (10-repeat allele carriers vs. non-carriers) polymorphism on regional neural activity in a young female population. Methods: Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected from 195 healthy women and stratified into 2 sets of comparisons of 2 groups each: L-allele carriers (N = 91) vs. non-carriers for 5-HTTLPR and 10-repeat allele carriers (N = 25) vs. non-carriers for 5-HTTVNTR. The mean power of 18 electrodes across theta, alpha, beta, gamma, gamma1, and gamma2 frequencies was analyzed. Between-group statistics were performed by an independent t-test, and global trends of regional power were quantified by non-parametric analyses. Results: Among 5-HTTVNTR genotypes, 10-repeat allele carriers showed significantly low regional power at gamma frequencies across the brain. We noticed a consistent global trend that carriers with low transcription efficiency of 5-HTT possessed low regional powers, regardless of frequency bands. The non-parametric analyses confirmed this observation, with P values of 3.071 x 10(-8) and 1.459 x 10(-12) for 5-HTTLPR and 5-HTTVNTR, respectively. Conclusions and Limitations: Our analyses showed that genotypes with low 5-HTT activity are associated with less local neural synchronization during relaxation. The implication with respect to genetic vulnerability of 5-HTT across a broad range of psychiatric disorders is discussed. Given the low frequency of 10-repeat allele of 5-HTTVNTR in our research sample, the possibility of false positive findings should also be considered.

The amplitude and phase features of SSVEP were commonly extracted by Fourier analysis method from single-channel EEG data. In the multichannel case, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been utilized for the analysis of frequency coding SSVEP. This paper presents the analysis of phase coding SSVEP using CCA. The phase coding scheme consists of six targets flickering at 10Hz, with a 60 degrees phase difference between any two sequential targets. For each target, 20 trials of 8s EEG signal were acquired. Using CCA, we achieve channel selection and extraction of phase features; a classification accuracy of above 80% is obtained, with the length of the time window up to 4s. The results demonstrate that phase coding SSVEP analysis based on CCA is feasible.

BCI has numerous applications in the clinical domain, the computer gaming, and the military. Real-time analysis of single trial brain signals is a challenging task, due to the low SNR of the incoming signals, added noise due to muscle artifacts, and trial-to-trial variability. In this work we present a computationally lightweight classification method based on several time and frequency domain features. After preprocessing and filtering, wavelet transform and Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) are used for feature extraction. Feature vectors which are extracted from theta and alpha frequency bands are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. EEG data were recorded from 64 electrodes during three different Go/NoGo tasks. We achieved 91% classification accuracy for two-class discrimination. The high recognition rate and low computational complexity makes this approach a promising method for a BCI system running on wearable and mobile devices. Computational profiling shows that this method is suitable for real time signal processing implementation.

An independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation coefficient are used to automatically eliminate the electrooculography (EOG) artifacts. Based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, active segment selection then detects the location of active segment in the time-frequency domain. Next, multiresolution fractal feature vectors (MFFVs) are extracted with the proposed modified fractal dimension from wavelet data. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for the robust classification of MFFVs. The EEG signals are continuously analyzed in 1-s segments, and every 0.5 second moves forward to simulate asynchronous BCI works in the two-stage recognition architecture. The segment is first recognized as lifted or not in the first stage, and then is classified as left or right finger lifting at stage two if the segment is recognized as lifting in the first stage. Several statistical analyses are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results indicate that it is a promising system in the applications of asynchronous BCI work.

One challenge is to unveil transduction mechanisms allowing ELF to interact with brain tissue. Thus, we present a cortical network model receiving internal and external stimuli. Using frequency analysis, we study how these stimuli durably modulate network dynamics depending on exposure duration, stimuli properties and transduction mechanisms. Our results indicate that these stimuli induce different responses in the frequency domain. Ultimately, such models might be useful in evaluating power line exposure thresholds, and in developing innovative brain stimulation methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An efficient SSVEP-based BCI system in shorter time with higher accuracy in recognizing SSVEP has been pursued by many studies. This paper introduces a novel multiway canonical correlation analysis (Multiway CCA) approach to recognize SSVEP. This approach is based on tensor CCA and focuses on multiway data arrays. Multiple CCAs are used to find appropriate reference signals for SSVEP recognition from different data arrays. SSVEP is then recognized by implementing multiple linear regression (MLR) between EEG and optimized reference signals. The proposed Multiway CCA is verified by comparing to the standard CCA and power spectral density analysis (PSDA). Results showed that the Multiway CCA achieved higher recognition accuracy within shorter time than that of the CCA and PSDA.

The software is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and includes a complete set of consistent and user-friendly high-level functions that allow experimental neuroscientists to analyze experimental data. It includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis, such as time-frequency analysis using multitapers, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers, connectivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical permutation tests at the channel and source level. The implementation as toolbox allows the user to perform elaborate and structured analyses of large data sets using the MATLAB command line and batch scripting. Furthermore, users and developers can easily extend the functionality and implement new algorithms. The modular design facilitates the reuse in other software packages.

Twenty-seven participants (13 males and 14 females) performed a spatial navigation task in a virtual maze where they had to find the shortest ways between landmarks. Absolute theta band power and event-related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) in the theta frequency band was used to analyze the EEG data. Processing of spatial cues or landmarks induced cortical theta activity compared to a baseline condition, confirming the hypothesis that theta oscillations reflect sensorimotor integration. The sensorimotor integration hypothesis proposes that theta oscillations coordinate sensory information with a motor plan to direct wayfinding behaviour to known goal locations. No sex differences were found in spatial performance. However, female participants showed a stronger increase in theta oscillations during processing of landmarks as navigational aids compared to a baseline condition than men. Additionally, a higher theta power was associated with an increased navigation performance in women, whereas an increase in theta power was associated with a decreased navigation performance in men. These results might indicate a stronger sensorimotor integration in females than in males. Possible explanations for the emerged sex differences in cortical theta activity are discussed.

In the literature there are some attempts to relate fractal features to spectral properties. However, a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between fractal and power spectral measures is still missing. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the relationship of monofractal and multifractal EEG measures (H and Delta D) with relative band powers and spectral edge frequency across different sleep stages and topographic locations. In addition we tested sleep stage classification capability of these measures according to different channels. We found that cross-correlations between fractal and spectral measures as well as between H and Delta D exhibit specific topographic and sleep stage-related characteristics. Best sleep stage classifications were achieved by estimating measure Delta D in temporal EEG channels both at group and individual levels, suggesting that assessing multifractality might be an adequate approach for compact modeling of brain activities.

During the past decade, neuroscientists working within several disciplines have observed an important involvement of the specific types of brain oscillations that occur during sleep-the cortical slow oscillations; during the resting state - the fMRI resting state networks including the default-mode network (DMN); and during task performance - the performance modulations that link as well to modulations in electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography frequency content. Understanding the role of these slow oscillations thus appears to be essential for our fundamental understanding of brain function. Brain activity is characterized by oscillations occurring in spike frequency, field potentials or blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signals. Environmental stimuli, reaching the brain through our senses, activate or inactivate neuronal populations and modulate ongoing activity. The effect they sort is to a large extent determined by the momentary state of the slow endogenous oscillations of the brain. In the absence of sensory input, as is the case during rest or sleep, brain activity does not cease. Rather, its oscillations continue and change with respect to their dominant frequencies and coupling topography. This chapter briefly introduces the topics that will be addressed in this dedicated volume of Progress in Brain Research on slow oscillations and sets the stage for excellent papers discussing their molecular, cellular, network physiological and cognitive performance aspects. Getting to know about slow oscillations is essential for our understanding of plasticity, memory, brain structure from synapse to DMN, cognition, consciousness, and ultimately for our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of sleep and vigilance.

In particular, the existing evidence is too inconsistent to allow formulation of specific hypotheses linking DMN activity to traditional EEG frequency bands. In this study, we aimed to test whether blind decomposition methods are able to identify in EEG data spatial patterns resembling the DMN as it is described in PET and fMRI studies. Further we aimed to test a degree of task-relatedness of DMN patterns identified in the traditional EEG frequency bands. To answer these questions we collected data both in a resting state and during performance of two experimental tasks: an explicit judgment of facial affect and a social game task. Individual differences in amount of self-referential thoughts during the resting state were measured by a short self-report scale. Only alpha band spatial patterns simultaneously showed a considerable overlap with the DMN and high correlations with presumptive DMN function-related outcomes both in the resting state and during the social game task. Spontaneous self-referential thoughts were associated with enhanced alpha activity in the posterior DMN hub, whereas processing of DMN function-related external stimuli disrupted this activity and simultaneously caused partial alpha phase-locking to external events. This evidence implies that synchronization of internal mental processes, as opposed to the processing of external stimuli, might be the primary function of alpha oscillations which is bound to be related to activity of the DMN.

A study using time-frequency analysis of mismatch responses from 7 years to adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; NEGATIVITY MMN; SOUND DISCRIMINATION; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MATURATION; EEG; DYNAMICS; STIMULI	Behavioural and electrophysiological studies give differing impressions of when auditory discrimination is mature. Ability to discriminate frequency and speech contrasts reaches adult levels only around 12 years of age, yet an electrophysiological index of auditory discrimination, the mismatch negativity (MMN), is reported to be as large in children as in adults. Auditory ERPs were measured in 30 children (7 to 12 years), 23 teenagers (13 to 16 years) and 32 adults (35 to 56 years) in an oddball paradigm with tone or syllable stimuli. For each stimulus type, a standard stimulus (1000 Hz tone or syllable [ba]) occurred on 70% of trials, and one of two deviants (1030 or 1200 Hz tone, or syllables [da] or [bi]) equiprobably on the remaining trials. For the traditional MMN interval of 100-250 ms post-onset, size of mismatch responses increased with age, whereas the opposite trend was seen for an interval from 300 to 550 ms post-onset, corresponding to the late discriminative negativity (LDN). Time-frequency analysis of single trials revealed that the MMN resulted from phase-synchronization of oscillations in the theta (4-7 Hz) range, with greater synchronization in adults than children. Furthermore, the amount of synchronization was significantly correlated with frequency discrimination threshold. These results show that neurophysiological processes underlying auditory discrimination continue to develop through childhood and adolescence. Previous reports of adult-like MMN amplitudes in children may be artefactual results of using peak measurements when comparing groups that differ in variance.	[Bishop, Dorothy V.

Instead the current brain state modulates our reaction to a stimulus. This modulation can be investigated by cognitive paradigms such as the attentional blink, which reveal that identical visual target stimuli are correctly reported only on about half the trials. Support for the notion that the fluctuating state of the brain determines stimulus detection comes from electrophysiological investigations of brain oscillations, which have shown that different parameters of ongoing oscillatory alpha activity (similar to 10 Hz) can predict whether a visual stimulus will be perceived or not. The present article reviews recent findings on the role of prestimulus alpha oscillatory activity for visual perception and incorporates these results into a neurocognitive model that is able to account for various findings in temporal attention paradigms, specifically the attentional blink.

However, reports of MEG spindles occurring without EEG spindles, and vice versa, are inconsistent with synchronous distributed generation. We objectively determined the frequency of MEG-only, EEG-only, and combined MEG-EEG spindles in high density recordings of natural sleep in humans. About 50% of MEG spindles occur without EEG spindles, but the converse is rare (similar to 15%). Compared to spindles that occur in MEG only, those that occur in both MEG and EEG have similar to 1% more MEG coherence and similar to 15% more MEG power, insufficient to account for the similar to 55% increase in EEG power. However, these combined spindles involve similar to 66% more MEG channels, especially over frontocentral cortex. Furthermore, when both MEG and EEG are involved in a given spindle, the MEG spindle begins similar to 150 ms before the EEG spindle and ends similar to 250 ms after. Our findings suggest that spindles begin in focal cortical locations which are better recorded with MEG gradiometers than referential EEG due to the biophysics of their propagation. For some spindles, only these regions remain active. For other spindles, these locations may recruit other areas over the next 200 ms, until a critical mass is achieved, including especially frontal cortex, resulting in activation of a diffuse and/or multifocal generator that is best recorded by referential EEG derivations due to their larger leadfields.

EEG signals of patients with MCI are transformed to a wavelet time-frequency representation, and afterwards a sparsification process (bump modeling) extracts time-frequency oscillatory bursts. We observed that organized oscillatory events contain stronger discriminative signatures than averaged spectral EEG statistics for patients in a probable early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, bump modeling enhanced the difference between MCI patients and age-matched control subjects in the theta and high beta frequency ranges. This effect is consistent with previous results obtained on other databases.

The EEG signals are collected from 29 channels distributed over the scalp. Four subjects completed three sessions each by performing four different mental tasks during each session. The BCI is designed in such a way that only one of the mental tasks can activate it. One important advantage of this BCI is its simplicity, since autoregressive modeling and quadratic discriminant analysis are used for feature extraction and classification, respectively. The autoregressive order which yields the best overall performance is obtained during a fivefold nested cross-validation process. The results are promising as the false positive rates are zero while the true positive rates are sufficiently high (67.26% average).

Nonuniform High-Gamma (60-500 Hz) Power Changes Dissociate Cognitive Task and Anatomy in Human Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BAND ACTIVITY; SURFACE EEG; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; BRAIN; LANGUAGE; LOCALIZATION; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; STIMULI	High-gamma-band (>60 Hz) power changes in cortical electrophysiology are a reliable indicator of focal, event-related cortical activity. Despite discoveries of oscillatory subthreshold and synchronous suprathreshold activity at the cellular level, there is an increasingly popular view that high-gamma-band amplitude changes recorded from cellular ensembles are the result of asynchronous firing activity that yields wideband and uniform power increases. Others have demonstrated independence of power changes in the low- and high-gamma bands, but to date, no studies have shown evidence of any such independence above 60 Hz. Based on nonuniformities in time-frequency analyses of electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals, we hypothesized that induced high-gamma-band (60 500 Hz) power changes are more heterogeneous than currently understood. Using single-word repetition tasks in six human subjects, we showed that functional responsiveness of different ECoG high-gamma sub-bands can discriminate cognitive task (e.g., hearing, reading, speaking) and cortical locations. Power changes in these sub-bands of the high-gamma range are consistently present within single trials and have statistically different time courses within the trial structure. Moreover, when consolidated across all subjects within three task-relevant anatomic regions (sensorimotor, Broca's area, and superior temporal gyrus), these behavior- and location-dependent power changes evidenced nonuniform trends across the population. Together, the independence and nonuniformity of power changes across a broad range of frequencies suggest that a new approach to evaluating high-gamma-band cortical activity is necessary. These findings show that in addition to time and location, frequency is another fundamental dimension of high-gamma dynamics.

Time-frequency characterization of electrocorticographic recordings of epileptic patients using frequency-entropy similarity: A comparison to other bi-variate measures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electrocorticography; Epilepsy; Wavelets; Wavelet-Packets; Entropy; Coherence	OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; COHERENCE; INTERDEPENDENCIES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM; SEIZURES; SIGNALS	Expert evaluation of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings forms the linchpin of seizure onset zone localization in the evaluation of epileptic patients for surgical resection. Numerous methods have been developed to analyze these complex recordings, including uni-variate (characterizing single channels), bi-variate (comparing channel pairs) and multivariate measures. Developing reliable algorithms may be helpful in clinical tasks such as localization of epileptogenic zones and seizure anticipation, as well as enabling better understanding of neuronal function and dynamics. Recently we have developed the frequency-entropy (F-E) similarity measure, and have tested its capability in mapping the epileptogenic zones. The F-E similarity measure compares time-frequency characterizations of two recordings. In this study, we examine the method's principles and utility and compare it to previously described bi-variate correspondence measures such as correlation, coherence, mean phase coherence and spectral comparison methods. Specially designed synthetic signals were used for illuminating theoretical differences between the measures. Intracranial recordings of four epileptic patients were then used for the measures' comparative analysis by creating a mean inter-electrode matrix for each of the correspondence measures and comparing the structure of these matrices during the inter-ictal and ictal periods. We found that the F-E similarity measure is able to discover spectral and temporal features in data which are hidden for the other measures and are important for foci localization.

Well documented prolonged development of anatomical brain structures includes white and gray matter changes that continue into the third decade of life. We investigated resting-state EEG oscillations in 1433 subjects from 5 to 71 years. Neuronal oscillations exhibit scale-free amplitude modulation as reflected in power-law decay of autocorrelations-also known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTC)-which was assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis. We observed pronounced increases in LRTC from childhood to adolescence, during adolescence, and even into early adulthood (similar to 25 years of age) after which the temporal structure stabilized. A principal component analysis of the spatial distribution of LRTC revealed increasingly uniform scores across the scalp. Together, these findings indicate that the scale-free modulation of resting-state oscillations reflects brain maturation, and suggests that scaling analysis may prove useful as a biomarker of pathophysiology in neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia.

Largely unknown, however, is the degree to which different neuronal events (i.e., excitation and inhibition) maintain or disrupt the neural-hemodynamic relationship, especially in humans. In the present study, we compared local electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations and the positive/negative BOLD responses of simultaneously recorded data from healthy human volunteers performing unilateral finger tapping at graded rates. By quantifying the single-trial modulations of EEG using source imaging, we tested for their correlation with positive BOLD response (PBR) and negative BOLD response (NBR) after coregistering their spatial locations. PBR was found to be overlapped with and correlated to the decrease of alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) band EEG in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Regional EEG modulations at the sensorimotor cortex further predicted a spatially distributed and interconnected network of motor-related cortical areas. Alternatively, no significant correlation was found at the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex between the NBR and EEG despite their spatial overlapping. This differential electrophysiological coupling of the positive and negative BOLD responses suggests that the underlying neuronal events may not only influence the direction of the signal change but also the neural-hemodynamic relationship.

For example, induced gamma band oscillations (iGBRs) have been recorded similar to 280 ms after the onset of a coherent Kanizsa triangle, but not after an incoherent equivalent shape. However, several recent studies have provided evidence that the EEG-recorded iGBR may be a by-product of small saccadic eye movements (microsaccades). Considering these two previous findings, one would hypothesis that there should be more microsaccades following the onset of a coherent Kanizsa triangle. However, we found that microsaccade rebound rate was significantly higher after an incoherent triangle was presented. This result suggests that microsaccades are not a reliable indicator of perceptual binding, and, more importantly, implies that iGBR cannot be universally produced by ocular artefacts.

So far, they have not been reported in spatially extended neural field models. We study a space-independent version of the Amari neural field model with two competing inhibitory populations. We show that this competition leads to robust spike-wave dynamics if the inhibitory populations operate on different time-scales. The spike-wave oscillations present a fold/homoclinic type bursting. From this result we predict parameters of the extended Amari system where spike-wave oscillations produce a spatially homogeneous pattern. We propose this mechanism as a prototype of macroscopic epileptic spike-wave discharges. To our knowledge this is the first example of robust spike-wave patterns in a spatially extended neural field model.

Methods: We use 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG with a sampling rate of 600 Hz. A single dipole method calculates equivalent current dipoles to localize epileptic sources. The equivalent current dipoles are superimposed onto MRI as magnetic source imaging (MSI). fetal MEG data are analyzed using time frequency analysis. The power spectrum density is calculated using short-time Fourier transform and superimposed onto MRI results. Results: Clustered equivalent current dipoles represent epileptogenic zones in patients with localization-related epilepsy. The surgical plan is reliably developed from source localizations of dipoles and power spectrum of interictal spike discharges, and ictal frequency. Conclusion: MEG is indispensable in diagnosis and surgical resection for epilepsy to accurately localize the epileptogenic zone. (C) 2010 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

The central executive is theorized as the controller of storage functions support WM. Neurophysiological data suggest that electroencephalographic (EEG) theta and alpha oscillations in frontal and midline regions are involved in neural communication between the central executive and storage functions during WM performance. Emotion is known to modulate several memory systems, including WM, through central and peripheral pathways. However, the physiological effect (EEG; autonomic nervous activity) of emotion over WM are not well described. In this study we aimed to identify physiological responses related to emotional WM performance. EEG (21 channels), hear rate (HR), and galvanic skin response (GSR) recordings were obtained from 54 volunteers while performing delayed matching and non-matching to sample tasks (DMTS/DNMTS). Emotional and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System and geometric figures were used as stimuli. As expected, WM performance was accompanied by presence of theta (frontal and midline electrodes) and alpha power (parietal electrodes). Beta and gamma oscillations were concentrated in frontopolar and left temporal regions. The DNMTS task was accompanied by higher increases in beta power, HR, and GSR compared to the DMTS task. Correlation analyses showed a positive tendency for gamma in the Fp2 site, ration of LF/HF and skin conductance in both tasks. The HR results indicate an inverse reaction related to parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system during the performance of the tasks. Taken together, our results contribute to elucidate the complex interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems in the modulation of emotional WM tasks.

Identification of Electroencephalographic Arousals in Multichannel Sleep Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG) arousal; pattern classification; sleep studies	AUTOMATIC DETECTION	Electroencephalographic arousals are defined as abrupt shifts in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency during sleep. Occurrence of arousals results in fragmented sleep, being one of the most important causes of daytime sleepiness among sleep disorders. Detection of arousals requires a polysomnographic (PSG) recording to be made during the patient's sleep. The resulting PSG is then analyzed offline by the physician. This is a time-consuming task, hence, automation of this process is pursued. The analysis, which involves the correlation of various events in time occurring among the different channels, in conjunction with the complexity of the related biomedical signals, makes this task also difficult to achieve in the computer algorithm. In this paper, we present a method for the detection of EEG arousals working on multichannel PSGs. The algorithm detects arousals using the information available through two EEG channels and the electromyography. A signal-processing technique is first proposed for the analysis of biomedical signals and extraction of relevant information. Individual events are detected from the signals and subsequently are related in time. Finally, a classification phase carries out the final decision on the presence of the event. Classifiers based on Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminants, support vector machines and artificial neural networks are compared at this phase. Experiments conducted on 20 patients reported a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 0.86 and 0.76 in the detection of the arousal events.

To better study the role of these oscillations in various cognitive processes, and to be able to build clinical applications around them, accurate and precise estimations of the instantaneous frequency and phase are required. Here, we present methodology based on autoregressive modeling to accomplish this in real time. This allows the targeting of stimulation to a specific phase of a detected oscillation. Using intracranial EEG recorded from two patients performing a Sternberg memory task, we characterize our algorithm's phase-locking performance on physiologic theta oscillations.	[Chen, L.

Quantifying chirp in sleep spindles	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Time series; Matching pursuit; EEG; Sleep spindles; Spectral analysis; Chirp	MATCHING PURSUIT; FREQUENCY; EEG; RESOLUTION; TRANSFORM	Sleep spindles are considered as a marker of integrity for thalamo-cortical circuits. Recently, attention has been given to internal frequency variation in sleep spindles. In this study, a procedure based on matching pursuit with a Gabor-chirplet dictionary was applied in order to measure chirp rate in atoms representing sleep spindles, also categorized into negative, positive or zero chirp types. The sample comprised 707 EEG segments containing visual sleep spindles, labeled TP, obtained from nine healthy male volunteers (aged 20-34, average 24.6 y). Control datasets were 333 non-REM (NREM) sleep background segments and 287 REM sleep intervals, each with 16s duration. Analyses were carried out on the C3-A2 EEG channel. In TP and NREM groups, the proportion of non-null chirp types was non-random and total chirp distribution was asymmetrical towards negative values, in contrast to REM. Median negative chirp rate in the TP and NREM groups was significantly lower than in REM (-0.4 Hz/s vs -0.3 Hz/s, P < 0.05). Negative chirp atoms outnumbered positives by 50% in TP, while in NREM and REM, they were, respectively, only 22% and 12% more prevalent. TP negative chirp atoms were significantly higher in amplitude compared to positive or zero types. Considering individual subjects, 88.9% had a TP negative/positive chirp ratio above 1 (mean +/- sd = 1.64 +/- 0.65). We propose there is increasing evidence, corroborated by the present study, favoring systematic measurement of sleep spindle chirp rate or internal frequency variation. Preferential occurrence of negatively chirping spindles is consistent with the hypothesis of electrophysiological modulation of neocortical memory consolidation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

EEG was collected during the performance of a computerised multitask test from 21 healthy male subjects, of which an experimental group of 14 subjects underwent sleep deprivation and 7 subjects formed the control group. EEG PSD plots were compared between the groups and were used to determine individual theta, alpha and beta bands for the subjects by studying the points of intersection between the individual subjects' normalised spectra and the normalised average spectrum of the control group. The results show that the frontal and occipital locations are best suited for the determination of individualised frequency bands. The proposed method can be used to enhance EEG spectral analysis of task-induced cognitive effort during sleep deprivation.

Data mining neocortical high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy and controls	BRAIN			English	Article						high-frequency oscillations; epilepsy; intracranial EEG	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; 80-500 HZ; EPILEPTOGENICITY; HIPPOCAMPUS; MACROELECTRODES; OUTCOMES; NETWORK; SURGERY; EEG	Transient high-frequency (100-500 Hz) oscillations of the local field potential have been studied extensively in human mesial temporal lobe. Previous studies report that both ripple (100-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) oscillations are increased in the seizure-onset zone of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Comparatively little is known, however, about their spatial distribution with respect to seizure-onset zone in neocortical epilepsy, or their prevalence in normal brain. We present a quantitative analysis of high-frequency oscillations and their rates of occurrence in a group of nine patients with neocortical epilepsy and two control patients with no history of seizures. Oscillations were automatically detected and classified using an unsupervised approach in a data set of unprecedented volume in epilepsy research, over 12 terabytes of continuous long-term micro- and macro-electrode intracranial recordings, without human preprocessing, enabling selection-bias-free estimates of oscillation rates. There are three main results: (i) a cluster of ripple frequency oscillations with median spectral centroid = 137 Hz is increased in the seizure-onset zone more frequently than a cluster of fast ripple frequency oscillations (median spectral centroid = 305 Hz); (ii) we found no difference in the rates of high frequency oscillations in control neocortex and the non-seizure-onset zone neocortex of patients with epilepsy, despite the possibility of different underlying mechanisms of generation; and (iii) while previous studies have demonstrated that oscillations recorded by parenchyma-penetrating micro-electrodes have higher peak 100-500 Hz frequencies than penetrating macro-electrodes, this was not found for the epipial electrodes used here to record from the neocortical surface. We conclude that the relative rate of ripple frequency oscillations is a potential biomarker for epileptic neocortex, but that larger prospective studies correlating high-frequency oscillations rates with seizure-onset zone, resected tissue and surgical outcome are required to determine the true predictive value.

Wavelet coherence is a popular method to construct a time-frequency map that can be used to analyze the time-frequency correlations between two time series. Coherence is a normalized measure of dependence, for which it is possible to construct confidence intervals, and that is commonly considered as being more interpretable than the wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS). In this paper, we provide empirical and theoretical arguments to show that a significant level of wavelet coherence does not necessarily correspond to a significant level of dependence between random signals, especially when the number of trials is small. In such cases, we demonstrate that the WCS is a much better measure of statistical dependence, and a new statistical test to detect significant values of the cross-spectrum is proposed. This test clearly outperforms the limitations of coherence analysis while still allowing a consistent estimation of the time-frequency correlations between two non-stationary stochastic processes. Simulated data are used to investigate the advantages of this new approach over coherence analysis. The method is also applied to experimental data sets to analyze the time-frequency correlations that may exist between electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (EMG).

P.; Ang, Kai Keng			Adaptive tracking of discriminative frequency components in electroencephalograms for a robust brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							EEG; FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	In an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), motor imagery has been successfully used as a communication strategy. Motor imagery causes detectable amplitude changes in certain frequency bands of EEGs, which are dubbed event-related desynchronization\synchronization. The frequency components that give effective discrimination between different types of motor imagery are subject specific and identification of these subject-specific discriminative frequency components (DFCs) is important for the accurate classification of motor imagery activities. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the DFC using the Fisher criterion and investigate the variability of these DFCs over multiple sessions of EEG recording. Observing the variability of DFC over sessions in the analysis, a new BCI approach called the Adaptively Weighted Spectral-Spatial Patterns (AWSSP) algorithm is proposed. AWSSP tracks the variation in DFC over time adaptively based on the deviation of discriminative weight values of frequency components. The classification performance of the proposed AWSSP is compared with a static BCI approach that employs fixed DFCs. In the offline and online experiments, AWSSP offers better classification performance than the static approach, emphasizing the significance of tracking the variability of DFCs in EEGs for developing robust motor imagery-based BCI systems. A study of the effect of feedback on the variation in DFCs is also performed in online experiments and it is found that the presence of visual feedback results in increased variation in DFCs.

A computational model of thalamocortical dysrhythmia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						bursting; neuropathic pain; oscillations; Parkinson's disease; thalamocortical network	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; NEUROGENIC PAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; RELAY NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; CAT; SYNCHRONIZATION; RAT; EEG	Functional stereotactic lesions in the central lateral nucleus of the medial thalamus have proved to be an effective treatment of neurogenic pain and other neurological disorders associated with thalamocortical dysrhythmia. The mechanisms underlying patient recovery after surgery are currently being explored using quantitative electroencephalography. Here we test the hypothesis that the particular role played by the non-specific medial thalamic nuclei in thalamocortical dysrhythmia is based on the divergent connectivity between these non-specific and reticular nuclei. We built a spiking computer model of the human thalamocortical system consisting of specific, non-specific and reticular thalamic nuclei. In our simulations of the thalamocortical system, deafferentation of peripheral thalamic afferents leads to hyperpolarization and subsequent bursting in the reticular nucleus. This provides strong inhibitory feedback to both the specific and the non-specific thalamic nuclei and initiates a feedback cycle of thalamic bursts in the theta frequency range. The divergent connections between the reticular and non-specific thalamic nuclei provide synchronization of the oscillating circuits. Functional silencing of the non-specific model nucleus limits reverberation and rescues the system from these oscillations. The same effect could be achieved by increasing the input to the non-specific nucleus from cortical areas. The model predicts that the invasiveness of functional neurosurgery can be reduced by targeting only deafferented areas in the medial nuclei as these are the key areas for generation and maintenance of pathological rhythms.

Design: Analysis of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during 40 h of extended wakefulness under constant routine conditions. Artifact-free EEG samples derived from 12 locations were subjected to spectral analysis. Additionally, half-hourly ratings of subjective tension and sleepiness levels and salivary melatonin measurements were collected. Setting: Centre for Chronobiology, Psychiatric Hospitals of the University of Basel, Switzerland. Participants: Eight young healthy women and 8 young untreated women with MDD. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: MDD women exhibited higher frontal low-frequency (FLA) EEG activity (0.5-5.0 Hz) during extended wakefulness than controls, particularly during the night. Enhanced FLA was paralleled by higher levels of subjective sleepiness and tension. In MDD women, overall FLA levels correlated positively with depression scores. The timing of melatonin onset did not significantly differ between the two groups, but the nocturnal secretion of salivary melatonin was significantly attenuated in MDD women. Conclusions: Our data imply that young women with MDD live on a higher homeostatic sleep pressure level, as indexed by enhanced FLA during wakefulness. Its positive correlation with depression scores indicates a possible functional relationship. High FLA could reflect a use-dependent phenomenon in depression (enhanced cognitive rumination or tension) and/or an attenuated circadian arousal signal.

Especially, its counterpart in frequency domain, spectral GC, as well as other Granger-like causality measures have recently been applied to study causal interactions between brain areas in different frequency ranges during cognitive and perceptual tasks. In this paper, we show that: 1) GC in time domain cannot correctly determine how strongly one time series influences the other when there is directional causality between two time series, and 2) spectral GC and other Granger-like causality measures have inherent shortcomings and/or limitations because of the use of the transfer function (or its inverse matrix) and partial information of the linear regression model. On the other hand, we propose two novel causality measures (in time and frequency domains) for the linear regression model, called new causality and new spectral causality, respectively, which are more reasonable and understandable than GC or Granger-like measures. Especially, from one simple example, we point out that, in time domain, both new causality and GC adopt the concept of proportion, but they are defined on two different equations where one equation (for GC) is only part of the other (for new causality), thus the new causality is a natural extension of GC and has a sound conceptual/theoretical basis, and GC is not the desired causal influence at all. By several examples, we confirm that new causality measures have distinct advantages over GC or Granger-like measures. Finally, we conduct event-related potential causality analysis for a subject with intracranial depth electrodes undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and show that, in the frequency domain, all measures reveal significant directional event-related causality, but the result from new spectral causality is consistent with event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral GC as well as other Granger-like measures are shown to generate misleading results. The proposed new causality measures may have wide potential applications in economics and neuroscience.

Circadian distribution and sleep/wake patterns of generalized seizures in children	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy monitoring; Circadian patterns; Generalized seizures; Semiology; Epilepsy	TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; PARTIAL EPILEPSY; RHYTHMS; DEPTH; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES; NEURONS; MODEL; STAGE; CYCLE	Purpose: To evaluate the relationship of sleep/awake and circadian patterns to generalized seizures. Methods: Charts of 1,044 consecutive pediatric epilepsy patients undergoing video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (vEEG) over 5 years were reviewed: 962 patients were excluded due to focal epilepsy (556), non-epileptic recorded events (217), missing data (125), age over 21 years (59), and no recorded events or seizures (10). Seizure semiology of recorded seizures with generalized onset on EEG was classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) seizure semiology terminology, and analyzed based on occurrence during day (6 a. m. to 6 p. m.) or night and on their relationship to wakefulness and sleep, with calculated occurrence in 3-h time blocks throughout 24 h. Statistical analysis was performed with binomial testing. Key Findings: Three-hundred sixteen generalized seizures were analyzed in 77 children. Mean age was 6.4 years +/- 5.4 (range 0.33-20 years), including 50.6% girls. Tonic and tonic-clonic seizures were more frequently seen in sleep, whereas all other generalized semiologic seizure types occurred more frequently out of wakefulness. Clonic seizures had two peaks: (6-9 a.m.) and (noon to 3 p.m.) in wakefulness. Absence seizures occurred predominantly in wakefulness, (9 a.m. to noon and 6 p.m. to midnight). Atonic seizures occurred predominantly in wakefulness (noon to 6 p.m.). Myoclonic seizures occurred in wakefulness (6 a.m. to noon). Epileptic spasms had two peaks: (6-9 a.m. and 3-6 p.m.) in wakefulness. Significance: Circadian pattern and sleep-wake patterns are important considerations in characterization of generalized seizure types. Recognition and characterization of individual diurnal seizure patterns offer new diagnostic and therapeutic options, including EEG or long-term video EEG monitoring scheduling, differential (day/night) medication dosing, and a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying circadian patterns of epilepsy.

J	Hsu, CC; Shih, PT				Hsu, Chien-Chang; Shih, Ping-Ta			A novel sleep apnea detection system in electroencephalogram using frequency variation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; Electroencephalogram; Frequency variation; Hilbert-Huang transformation; Real time detection	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; EVENTS; RECOGNITION	Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the most common respiratory disturbance in humans. Many new diagnosis and treatment methods are constantly being proposed. Electroencephalogram analysis has become one of the most important items in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This paper proposes a novel sleep apnea detection system in electroencephalogram using frequency variation. The system utilizes a band-pass filter to filter out components with extreme low and high frequencies from the electroencephalogram. It also utilizes baseline correction to eliminate components with pseudo-interference frequency. Moreover, it extracts frequency elements from Hilbert spectrum by Hilbert-Huang transformation. The system then detects duration of obstructive sleep apnea from the variation of Hilbert spectrum frequency. The main contribution of the system is to preserve time information in the electroencephalogram by Hilbert-Huang transformation mechanism as well as find frequency variation information. The system also allows free adjustment of time scale to establish a flexible detection system with fast response so it is capable of real time detection of obstructive sleep apnea.

Disruption of Frontal Theta Coherence by Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol is Associated with Positive Psychotic Symptoms	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol; EEG; psychosis; theta	CANNABINOID CB1 RECEPTOR; WORKING-MEMORY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; INTRAVENOUS DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; CORTICAL NETWORKS; HUMAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS	The main ingredient in cannabis, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can elicit acute psychotic reactions in healthy individuals and precipitate relapse in schizophrenic patients. However, the neural mechanism of this is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that THC psychopathology is related to changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power or inter-regional coherence. In a within-subjects design, participants (n = 16) were given intravenous THC (1.25 mg) or placebo under double-blind conditions, during EEG recordings. Using fast-Fourier transform, EEG data were analyzed for power and coherence in the delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-25 Hz), low-gamma (30-40 Hz), and high-gamma (60-70 Hz) bands during engagement in the n-back test of working memory (WM). Compared with placebo, THC evoked positive and negative psychotic symptoms, as measured by the positive and negative syndrome scale (p < 0.001) and slowed WM performance (p < 0.05). Under THC, theta power was specifically reduced, (p < 0.001) regardless of WM load; however, the reduction showed no relationship with psychotic symptoms or WM impairment. Coherence between bi-frontal electrodes in the theta band was also reduced by THC (p < 0.05) and these reductions correlated with the change-in positive psychotic symptoms (rho = 0.79, p < 0.001). Bi-frontal specificity was suggested by the absence of a relationship between psychotic symptoms and fronto-parietal coherence. The results reveal that the pro-psychotic effects of THC might be related to impaired network dynamics with impaired communication between the right and left frontal lobes.

However, clinical EEG uses 19 to 32 electrodes that significantly limits its localization ability. Recent development of dense-array recording techniques has suggested that increased spatial sampling rate improves the accuracy of source localization. In the current study, we proposed a 76-channel EEG system for the long-term monitoring of epilepsy patients, and proposed a dynamic seizure imaging (DSI) technique to image the ictal rhythmic activity that may evolve through time, space and frequency. We tested the system in a cohort of 8 patients and our results show that the DSI estimated the seizure activity in good correlation with intracranial recordings, successful surgery outcomes and other clinical evidence. The proposed dense-array recording and DSI imaging approach enable a non-invasive but quantitative imaging of continuous seizure activity. The results suggest that DSI may potentially be useful to assist the pre-surgical evaluation in patients with intractable epilepsy.

Methods: There are 8 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, 5 males and 3 females, aged between 19 to 47 years, the average age of 30.63 years. 16-channel EEG in 8 patients was recorded by Stellate Video EEG. Sample time = 20s (sample points = 4000), Sampling frequency (f, = 2 0 0 H z) . Directional transfer functions is used to direct the information transduction between each channel of the EEG signals, which can reflect the causal relationship between each channel and determine the location of the lesions source. (In this paper, we used eConnectome software that developed by Biomedical Functional Imaging and Neuroengineering Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, directed by Dr. Bin He). Results: Causality results of 8 patients during intermittent episodes of EEG 20s are as follows: 6 patients' lesions source are located on channels T5 and F7 in left tempora. One of 5 cases' are located on channel T5 in the left posterior temporal. One of 1 case is located on channel F7 in the left anterior temporal. And 2 patients' lesions source are located on channels T4 and T6 in the right tempora, in the 2 patients, 1 case's lesions source is located on channel T4 in right middle temporal, 1 case's lesions source is located on channel T6 in right posterior temporal. Causality results consistent with the clinical diagnosis. Conclusions: Research of EEG on causal analysis of directional transfer function can effectively determine the lesions source of seizure, and effectively calculate the transmission direction of the multi-channel information, which is to provide support in the clinic for determine the source of seizure.

After 3 years of follow-up, three subgroups were characterized as converters to Alzheimer's disease (AD, N=18), converters to non-AD dementia (N=14) and non-converters (N=44). The theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 ratio, performance on cognitive tests and hippocampal volume, as evaluated at the time of initial MCI diagnosis, were studied in the three groups. As expected, MCI to AD converters had the smallest mean hippocampal volume and poorest performance on verbal learning tests, whereas MCI to non-AD converters had poorest cognitive performance in non-verbal learning tests, abstract thinking, and letter fluency. Increased theta/gamma ratio was associated with conversion to both AD and non-AD dementia; increased alpha3/alpha2 ratio was only associated with conversion to AD. Theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 ratio could be promising prognostic markers in MCI patients. In particular, the increase of high alpha frequency seems to be associated with conversion in AD. EEG markers allow a mean correct percentage of correct classification up to 88.3%. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these measures for predicting an AD outcome. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Moretti, D.

The subjects were presented with pictures of "angry", "happy", and "neutral" faces and had to choose one out of three options: "attack", "avoid", or "make friends". Sources of cortical EEG were localized with sLORETA software. Subjects with high aggressiveness chose attack more frequently and this behavior was accompanied by a stronger induced delta and theta synchronization in the right orbitofrontal cortex. In subjects with high anxiety, delta and theta responses were stronger induced in the right temporal cortex during their more frequent avoidance behavior. Thus, both in anxious and in aggressive subjects, typical behavior was accompanied by increased induced low-frequency synchronization whose localization implies that it is associated with motivational and emotional processes.

Neural Dynamics during Anoxia and the "Wave of Death''	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; SPREADING DEPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; DEPOLARIZATION; MECHANISMS; ISCHEMIA; SEIZURES; EEG	Recent experiments in rats have shown the occurrence of a high amplitude slow brain wave in the EEG approximately 1 minute after decapitation, with a duration of 5-15 s (van Rijn et al, PLoS One 6, e16514, 2011) that was presumed to signify the death of brain neurons. We present a computational model of a single neuron and its intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, which shows the physiological mechanism for this observation. The wave is caused by membrane potential oscillations, that occur after the cessation of activity of the sodium-potassium pumps has lead to an excess of extracellular potassium. These oscillations can be described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the sodium and potassium channels, and result in a sudden change in mean membrane voltage. In combination with a high-pass filter, this sudden depolarization leads to a wave in the EEG. We discuss that this process is not necessarily irreversible.

In early sensory processing that seems to be the case, but the assumption may not be correct in high-level cognitive tasks. For example, MEG and fMRI literature of single-word reading suggests differences in cortical activation, but direct comparisons are lacking. Here, while the same human participants performed the same reading task, analysis of MEG evoked responses and fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals revealed marked functional and spatial differences in several cortical areas outside the visual cortex. Divergent patterns of activation were observed in the frontal and temporal cortex, in accordance with previous separate MEG and fMRI studies of reading. Furthermore, opposite stimulus effects in the MEG and fMRI measures were detected in the left occipitotemporal cortex: MEG evoked responses were stronger to letter than symbol strings, whereas the fMRI BOLD signal was stronger to symbol than letter strings. The EEG recorded simultaneously during MEG and fMRI did not indicate neurophysiological differences that could explain the observed functional discrepancies between the MEG and fMRI results. Acknowledgment of the complementary nature of hemodynamic and electrophysiological measures, as reported here in a cognitive task using evoked response analysis in MEG and BOLD signal analysis in fMRI, represents an essential step toward an informed use of multimodal imaging that reaches beyond mere combination of location and timing of neural activation.

Gamma oscillations in schizophrenia: Mechanisms and clinical significance	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Schizophrenia; Electroencephalography; Gamma oscillation; GABAergic interneuron; Endophenotype	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; REPEATED AUDITORY-STIMULI; WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; EVOKED-RESPONSE; IN-VITRO	Brain oscillations are increasingly used for understanding complex psychiatric disorders. Gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations have warranted special attention due to their omnipresence in cognitive tasks. For patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), a disease associated with poor cognition, abnormal gamma oscillations have been reported in many experimental paradigms. The goal of this paper is to review the literature on gamma oscillations in SCZ. The review is structured into four sections. First, the functional role, neurobiology, and analysis of brain oscillations, especially gamma oscillations will be outlined. Second, the neurobiological abnormalities of SCZ in relation to gamma oscillations will be reviewed. Third, selected paradigms for investigating irregular gamma oscillations in SCZ will be discussed in detail. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of current findings and potential future research directions will be provided. The reviewed evidence suggests that gamma oscillations are disrupted in SCZ and could account for cognitive disturbances in this disorder. With additional analysis and experimentation, these indices may ultimately serve as endophenotypes that facilitate the development of etiologically based diagnostic methods, foster early identification and treatment, and advance our understanding of the complex genetic mechanisms involved in this disorder.

Several studies have reported preictal changes on electrophysiological traces. More recently, observations have been made of changes occurring on haemodynamic signals before interictal events or before seizures, often without concurrent changes observed on electrophysiology. We present here a critical review of these findings, in optical imaging, SPECT and fMRI, followed by a discussion based on data from intracerebral EEG. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: A time-frequency analysis of the cortical and thalamic ECoG of WAG/Rij rats was accomplished with a continuous wavelet decomposition of SWDs, 3 s prior to the onset of SWDs (pre-SWD), and in control periods devoid of SWDs. Results: The pre-SWD ECoG consisted of delta and theta components in 80-90% of all SWDs simultaneously in cortex and thalamus, the co-occurrence of delta and theta was rare (7%) during control periods. The occurrence of delta and theta events in pre-SWDs in the cortex preceded that in the thalamus. The frequency of theta component in cortex correlated positively with that in thalamus, this correlation was less strong for delta. Conclusion: Precursors of SWDs comprise of delta and theta, their co-occurrence is typical for non-epileptic periods. Thalamic and cortical theta are strongly related. Rhythmic precursors appear earlier in cortex than in thalamus, and this is in line with the cortical origin of SWD. Significance: Simultaneous presence of delta and theta events in EEG is a condition for the occurrence of SWDs. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this study, we characterized the patterns and timing of cortical activation of visually guided movements in a task with critical temporal demands. In particular, we investigated the neural correlates of motor planning and on-line adjustments of reaching movements in a choice-reaction time task. High-density electroencephalograohy (EEG, 256 electrodes) was recorded in 13 subjects performing reaching movements. The topography of the movement-related spectral perturbation was established across five 250-ms temporal windows (from prestimulus to postmovement) and five frequency bands (from theta to beta). Nine regions of interest were then identified on the scalp, and their activity was correlated with specific behavioral outcomes reflecting motor planning and on-line adjustments. Phase coherence analysis was performed between selected sites. We found that motor planning and on-line adjustments share similar topography in a fronto-parietal network, involving mostly low frequency bands. In addition, activities in the high and low frequency ranges have differential function in the modulation of attention with the former reflecting the prestimulus, top-down processes needed to promote timely responses, and the latter the planning and control of sensory-motor processes.

Effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment on the subsequent EEG spectral power and sleepiness over sustained wakefulness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep apnea; EEG; Sustained wakefulness; Spectral analysis; Daytime sleepiness; CPAP	DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; THERAPY	Objective: To determine whether sleepiness and its evolution over sustained wakefulness could be reversed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Methods: Twelve OSAHS patients underwent three 32-h sessions of study: one before CPAP therapy (T0), the second (T3) and the third (T6), respectively, after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Each session included one night of sleep followed by 24 h of sustained wakefulness, during which EEG recordings and subjective ratings were performed every hour. Results: The waking EEG in treated OSAHS patients was partially improved after 3 months of CPAP and their subjective complaint of sleepiness was normalized after 6 months. Theta power (3.9-7.8 Hz) was decreased as well as its time course during the diurnal period but beta power (12.7-29.2 Hz) remained higher. Conclusions: CPAP partially reverses waking EEG abnormalities in OSAHS patients with reduced theta activity after 3 months and removes the subjective complaint of sleepiness after 6 months. Nevertheless, the persistence of increased beta activity in treated patients suggests that efforts to stay awake remain strong after CPAP treatment. Significance: CPAP influences the EEG's time course over sustained wakefulness in a frequency-specific manner in OSAHS patients. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

DELTA OSCILLATIONS INDUCED BY KETAMINE INCREASE ENERGY LEVELS IN SLEEP-WAKE RELATED BRAIN REGIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ATP; brain energy metabolism; ketamine-xylazine; slow-wave-activity; Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase; NREM sleep	CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RAT-BRAIN; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; HZ OSCILLATION; ATP CHANGES; ADENOSINE; DEPRIVATION	Neuronal signaling consumes much of the brain energy, mainly through the restoration of the membrane potential (MP) by ATP-consuming ionic pumps. We have reported that, compared with waking, ATP levels increase during the initial hours of natural slow-wave sleep, a time with prominent electroencephalogram (EEG) delta oscillations (0.5-4.5 Hz). We have hypothesized that there is a delta oscillation-ATP increase coupling, since, during delta waves, neurons exhibit a prolonged hyperpolarizing phase followed by a very brief phase of action potentials. However, direct proof of this hypothesis is lacking, and rapid changes in EEG/neuronal activity preclude measurement in the naturally sleeping brain. Thus, to induce a uniform state with pure delta oscillations and one previously shown to be accompanied by a similar pattern of neuronal activity during delta waves as natural sleep, we used ketamine-xylazine treatment in rats. We here report that, with this treatment, the high-energy molecules ATP and ADP increased in frontal and cingulate cortices, basal forebrain, and hippocampus compared with spontaneous waking. Moreover, the degree of ATP increase positively and significantly correlated with the degree of EEG delta activity. Supporting the hypothesis of decreased ATP consumption during delta activity, the ATP-consuming Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase mRNA levels were significantly decreased, whereas the mRNAs for the ATP-producing cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits COX III and COX IVa were unchanged. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis of a cortical delta oscillation-dependent reduction in ATP consumption, thus providing the brain with increased ATP availability, and likely occurring because of reduced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase related energy consumption.

Both are modulated by LTM retrieval demands, but it is unclear what specific LTM functions they are related to. Here, different oscillatory correlates of LTM retrieval could be obtained for theta and alpha with a paradigm that is suited to monitor the activation of a varying number of material-specific LTM representations. Both frequency bands responded parametrically to the number of retrieved items. However, only the alpha effect dissociated topographically for material type, indicating that the activation of material-specific representations became systematically modulated. For theta, this effect was material-unspecific with mid-frontal topography. These results suggest that alpha is functionally related to the activation of stored information, whereas theta is a sign of retrieval-related control processes.

J	Mutlu, AY; Aviyente, S				Mutlu, Ali Yener; Aviyente, Selin			Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition for Quantifying Multivariate Phase Synchronization	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; COHERENCE	Quantifying the phase synchrony between signals is important in many different applications, including the study of the chaotic oscillators in physics and the modeling of the joint dynamics between channels of brain activity recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG). Current measures of phase synchrony rely on either the wavelet transform or the Hilbert transform of the signals and suffer from constraints such as the limit on time-frequency resolution in the wavelet analysis and the prefiltering requirement in Hilbert transform. Furthermore, the current phase synchrony measures are limited to quantifying bivariate relationships and do not reveal any information about multivariate synchronization patterns, which are important for understanding the underlying oscillatory networks. In this paper, we address these two issues by employing the recently introduced multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) for quantifying multivariate phase synchrony. First, an MEMD-based bivariate phase synchrony measure is defined for a more robust description of time-varying phase synchrony across frequencies. Second, the proposed bivariate phase synchronization index is used to quantify multivariate synchronization within a network of oscillators using measures of multiple correlation and complexity. Finally, the proposed measures are applied to both simulated networks of chaotic oscillators and real EEG data.

AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF EPILEPTIC EEG SIGNALS USING HIGHER ORDER CUMULANT FEATURES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; cumulants; epilepsy; higher order spectra; wavelet packet decomposition	FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WAVELET-CHAOS METHODOLOGY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SEIZURE DETECTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM SERIES; COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PREDICTION; IDENTIFICATION	The unpredictability of the occurrence of epileptic seizures makes it difficult to detect and treat this condition effectively. An automatic system that characterizes epileptic activities in EEG signals would allow patients or the people near them to take appropriate precautions, would allow clinicians to better manage the condition, and could provide more insight into these phenomena thereby revealing important clinical information. Various methods have been proposed to detect epileptic activity in EEG recordings. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, the use of nonlinear Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features is a seemingly promising approach. This paper presents the methodology employed to extract HOS features (specifically, cumulants) from normal, interictal, and epileptic EEG segments and to use significant features in classifiers for the detection of these three classes. In this work, 300 sets of EEG data belonging to the three classes were used for feature extraction and classifier development and evaluation. The results show that the HOS based measures have unique ranges for the different classes with high confidence level (p-value < 0.0001). On evaluating several classifiers with the significant features, it was observed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) presented a high detection accuracy of 98.5% thereby establishing the possibility of effective EEG segment classification using the proposed technique.

Previous research has shown that emotionally negative valence imagery induced alpha and beta power changes relative to neutral imagery and that alpha activity relates inversely to empathy. We therefore investigated the hypothesis that enhanced beta is associated with personal distress and is accompanied by a correlation between alpha and perspective-taking. Participants viewed negative and neutral valence images from the International Affective Picture System and made judgments about their levels of concern for humans in each image. As predicted, greater beta enhancement was associated with higher personal distress, whereas greater alpha-band suppression was associated with lower perspective-taking abilities. We suggest that these data support Batson's Empathy-Altruism hypothesis in which failure to adopt another person's perspective is related to greater personal distress.

Slow rhythm of the synchronized EEG reflects an alternation of active (depolarized, UP) and silent (hyperpolarized, DOWN) states of neocortical neurons. In neurons, involvement in the generalized slow oscillation results in a long-range synchronization of changes of their membrane potential as well as their firing. Here, we aimed at intracellular analysis of details of this synchronization. We asked which components of neuronal activity exhibit long-range correlations during the synchronized EEG? To answer this question, we made simultaneous intracellular recordings from two to four neocortical neurons in cat neocortex. We studied how correlated is the occurrence of active and silent states, and how correlated are fluctuations of the membrane potential in pairs of neurons located close one to the other or separated by up to 13 mm. We show that strong long-range correlation of the membrane potential was observed only (i) during the slow oscillation but not during periods without the oscillation, (ii) during periods which included transitions between the states but not during within-the-state periods, and (iii) for the low-frequency (<5 Hz) components of membrane potential fluctuations but not for the higher-frequency components (>10 Hz). In contrast to the neurons located several millimeters one from the other, membrane potential fluctuations in neighboring neurons remain strongly correlated during periods without slow oscillation. We conclude that membrane potential correlation in distant neurons is brought about by synchronous transitions between the states, while activity within the states is largely uncorrelated. The lack of the generalized fine-scale synchronization of membrane potential changes in neurons during the active states of slow oscillation may allow individual neurons to selectively engage in short living episodes of correlated activity-a process that may be similar to dynamical formation of neuronal ensembles during activated brain states.

J	Park, Y; Luo, L; Parhi, KK; Netoff, T				Park, Yun; Luo, Lan; Parhi, Keshab K.; Netoff, Theoden			Seizure prediction with spectral power of EEG using cost-sensitive support vector machines	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure; Prediction; Detection; Electroencephalogram	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES	Purpose: We propose a patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction using multiple features of spectral power from electroencephalogram (EEG) and support vector machine (SVM) classification. Methods: The proposed patient-specific algorithm consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, SVM classification, and postprocessing. Preprocessing removes artifacts of intracranial EEG recordings and they are further preprocessed in bipolar and/or time-differential methods. Features of spectral power of raw, or bipolar and/or time-differential intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in nine bands are extracted from a sliding 20-s-long and half-overlapped window. Nine bands are selected based on standard EEG frequency bands, but the wide gamma bands are split into four. Cost-sensitive SVMs are used for classification of preictal and interictal samples, and double cross- validation is used to achieve in-sample optimization and out-of-sample testing. We postprocess SVM classification outputs using the Kalman Filter and it removes sporadic and isolated false alarms. The algorithm has been tested on iEEG of 18 patients of 20 available in the Freiburg EEG database who had three or more seizure events. To investigate the discriminability of the features between preictal and interictal, we use the Kernel Fisher Discriminant analysis. findings: The proposed patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction has achieved high sensitivity of 97.5% with total 80 seizure events and a low false alarm rate of 0.27 per hour and total false prediction times of 13.0% over a total of 433.2 interictal hours by bipolar preprocessing (92.5% sensitivity, a false positive rate of 0.20 per hour, and false prediction times of 9.5% by time-differential preprocessing). This high prediction rate demonstrates that seizures can be predicted by the patient-specific approach using linear features of spectral power and nonlinear classifiers. Bipolar and/or time-differential preprocessing significantly improves sensitivity and specificity. Spectral powers in high gamma bands are the most discriminating features between preictal and interictal. Significance: High sensitivity and specificity are achieved by nonlinear classification of linear features of spectral power. Power changes in certain frequency bands already demonstrated their possibilities for seizure prediction indicators, but we have demonstrated that combining those spectral power features and classifying them in a multivariate approach led to much higher prediction rates. Employing only linear features is advantageous, especially when it comes to an implantable device, because they can be computed rapidly with low power consumption.

Time scales are thought to be nested within distinct spatial scales, so that whereas fast oscillations may integrate local networks, slow oscillations might integrate computations across distributed brain areas. We here describe a newly developed approach that provides potential for the further substantiation of this hypothesis in future studies. We demonstrate the feasibility and important caveats of a novel wavelet-based means of relating time series of three-dimensional spatial variance (energy) of fMRI data to time series of temporal variance of EEG. The spatial variance of fMRI data was determined by employing the three-dimensional dual-tree complex wavelet transform. The temporal variance of EEG data was estimated by using traditional continuous complex wavelets. We tested our algorithm on artificial signals with known signal-to-noise ratios and on empirical resting state EEG-fMRI data obtained from four healthy human subjects. By employing the human posterior alpha rhythm as an exemplar, we demonstrated face validity of the approach. We believe that the proposed method can serve as a suitable tool for future research on the spatiotemporal properties of brain dynamics, hence moving beyond analyses based exclusively in one domain or the other.

In the present study, changes in EEG power spectra were examined with respect to reproductive status in the music frog. Babina daunchina. The results indicated that in the reproductive stage, (1) power spectra of all EEG oscillations except for theta were significantly higher than in the non-reproductive stage; (2) for delta, significant increase of the power spectrum only appeared in the right hemisphere: and (3) the brain exhibited left-dominance of EEG spectra in the telencephalon and right-dominance of EEG spectra in the mesencephalon, providing evidence of lateralization of function. It is likely that sex hormone differences in the reproductive stage mediate these phenomena, through expression of their receptors. transcriptional regulatory elements, in specific regions of the forebrain and midbrain.

Attention-Induced Deactivations in Very Low Frequency EEG Oscillations: Differential Localisation According to ADHD Symptom Status	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESTING BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; CORTEX; ALPHA; THETA	Background: The default-mode network (DMN) is characterised by coherent very low frequency (VLF) brain oscillations. The cognitive significance of this VLF profile remains unclear, partly because of the temporally constrained nature of the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal. Previously we have identified a VLF EEG network of scalp locations that shares many features of the DMN. Here we explore the intracranial sources of VLF EEG and examine their overlap with the DMN in adults with high and low ADHD ratings. Methodology/Principal Findings: DC-EEG was recorded using an equidistant 66 channel electrode montage in 25 adult participants with high-and 25 participants with low-ratings of ADHD symptoms during a rest condition and an attention demanding Eriksen task. VLF EEG power was calculated in the VLF band (0.02 to 0.2 Hz) for the rest and task condition and compared for high and low ADHD participants. sLORETA was used to identify brain sources associated with the attention-induced deactivation of VLF EEG power, and to examine these sources in relation to ADHD symptoms. There was significant deactivation of VLF EEG power between the rest and task condition for the whole sample. Using s-LORETA the sources of this deactivation were localised to medial prefrontal regions, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and temporal regions. However, deactivation sources were different for high and low ADHD groups: In the low ADHD group attention-induced VLF EEG deactivation was most significant in medial prefrontal regions while for the high ADHD group this deactivation was predominantly localised to the temporal lobes. Conclusions/Significance: Attention-induced VLF EEG deactivations have intracranial sources that appear to overlap with those of the DMN. Furthermore, these seem to be related to ADHD symptom status, with high ADHD adults failing to significantly deactivate medial prefrontal regions while at the same time showing significant attenuation of VLF EEG power in temporal lobes.

Automated detection of neonatal seizures has the potential to greatly improve the outcome of patients in the neonatal intensive care unit. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the only signal on which 100% of electrographic seizures are visible and thus is considered the gold standard for neonatal seizure detection. Although a number of methods and algorithms have been proposed previously to automatically detect neonatal seizures, to date their transition to clinical use has been limited due to poor performances mainly attributed to large inter and intra-patient variability of seizure patterns and the presence of artifacts. Here, a novel detector is proposed based on time-domain, frequency-domain and information theory analysis of the signal combined with pattern recognition using machine learning principles. The proposed methodology is based on a classifier with a large and diverse feature set and includes a post-processing stage to incorporate contextual information of the signal. It is shown that this methodology achieves high classification accuracy for both classifiers and allows for the use of soft decisions, such as the probability of seizure over time, to be displayed.

Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) has a better spatial resolution than EEG, it has not extensively been used to explore alpha-power change deficits in schizophrenia as a possible neurophysiological marker of the disease. The purpose of this study was to use MEG to identify abnormalities in alpha synchronization induced by eye-closing in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls, and to investigate whether alpha reactivity deficits correlate with clinical features of the disorder. MEG data were recorded in 22 schizophrenia patients and 20 age- and gender-matched controls during eyes-open/eyes-closed resting states. Cortical sources of event-related synchronization (ERS) were estimated using multiple source beamformer, and BrainVoyager was used for statistic group analysis. A significant decrease in ERS in the upper alpha band (10-13 Hz) was found in the left posterior temporal region in schizophrenia patients relative to controls, and this activity showed correlation with visual memory scores. This upper alpha ERS deficit may indicate left temporal dysfunction and visual-information processing impairment in schizophrenia, and upon further confirmation it might represent a neurophysiological state marker of the disorder.

A group of 50 participants (10 ADHD subjects and 40 ones with no attention disorders) was examined. Independent component analysis was applied to the recorded signals. For ERP extraction, averages for each group of ICs, which were time-locked to the onset of stimuli, were calculated. Several frequency characteristics (704 items) were extracted from different ERPs in each IC. Eight features of the brain signals had a significant (P < 0.001) correlation with the participants' clinical presentation, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The revealed promising relation can be used for further evaluation of the sustained attention level.	[Ghassemi, F.; Moradi, M.

Electroencephalography data was analysed using a novel data-driven approach assessing source coherence at the whole-brain level. Three connections in the beta-band (18-24 Hz) and one in the gamma-band (30-40 Hz) were modulated by dual-task performance. Beta-coherence increased within two dorsofrontal-occipital connections in dual-task conditions compared to the single-task condition, with the highest coherence seen during low working memory load trials. In contrast, beta-coherence in a prefrontal-occipital functional connection and gamma-coherence in an inferior frontal-occipitoparietal connection was not affected by the addition of the second task and only showed elevated coherence under high working memory load. Analysis of coherence as a function of time suggested that the dorsofrontal-occipital beta-connections were relevant to working memory maintenance, while the prefrontal-occipital beta-connection and the inferior frontal-occipitoparietal gamma-connection were involved in top-down control of concurrent visual processing. The fact that increased coherence in the gamma-connection, from low to high working memory load, was negatively correlated with faster reaction time on the perception task supports this interpretation.

We aim to assess whether quantitative epileptic graph analysis during interictal period may be helpful to predict the seizure onset zone of ictal iEEG. Using wavelet transform, cross-correlation coefficient, and multiple hypothesis test, we propose a differential connectivity graph (DCG) to represent the connections that change significantly between epileptic and nonepileptic states as defined by the interictal events. Postprocessings based on mutual information and multiobjective optimization are proposed to localize the leading epileptic regions through DCG. The suggested approach is applied on iEEG recordings of five patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed epileptic regions within ictal onset zones detected by visual inspection and using electrically stimulated seizures, reveal good performance of the present method.

Extension of non-invasive EEG into the kHz range for evoked thalamocortical activity by means of very low noise amplifiers	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG; ultra fast; high frequency; non-invasive; low amplifier noise	SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEM; 1000 HZ; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; GENERATORS; POTENTIALS	Ultrafast electroencephalographic signals, having frequencies above 500 Hz, can be observed in somatosensory evoked potential measurements. Usually, these recordings have a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because weak signals are overlaid by intrinsic noise of much higher amplitude like that generated by biological sources and the amplifier. As an example, recordings at the scalp taken during electrical stimulation of the median nerve show a 600 Hz burst with submicro-volt amplitudes which can be extracted from noise by the use of massive averaging and digital signal processing only. We have investigated this signal by means of a very low noise amplifier made in-house ( minimal voltage noise 2.7 nV Hz(-1/2), FET inputs). We examined how the SNR of the data is altered by the bandwidth and the use of amplifiers with different intrinsic amplifier noise levels of 12 and 4.8 nV Hz(-1/2), respectively. By analyzing different frequency contributions of the signal, we found an extremely weak 1 kHz component superimposed onto the well-known 600 Hz burst. Previously such high-frequency electroencephalogram responses around 1 kHz have only been observed by deep brain electrodes implanted for tremor therapy of Parkinson patients. For the non-invasive measurement of such signals, we recommend that amplifier noise should not exceed 4 nV Hz(-1/2).	[Scheer, H.

This disproportionate amount of energy is used to create electricity in approximately 100 billion interconnected neurons. Quantitative EEG is a real-time movie of the electrical activity of the preconscious and conscious mind at frequencies of approximately 1-300 Hz. Numerous studies have cross-validated electrical neuroimaging by structural MRI, functional MRI and diffusion spectral imaging and thereby demonstrated how quantitative EEG can aid in linking a patient's symptoms and complaints to functional specialization in the brain. Electrical neuroimaging provides an inexpensive millisecond measure of functional modules, including the animation of structures through phase shift and phase lock. Today, neuropsychiatrists use these methods to link a patient's symptoms and complaints to functional specialization in the brain and use this information to implement treatment via brain computer interfaces and neurofeedback technology.

Principal Components of Electroencephalographic Spectrum as Markers of Opponent Processes Underlying Ultradian Sleep Cycles	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						EEG spectrum; Opponent-process model; Principal component analysis; Sleep-wake regulation; Two-process model	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; WAKING EEG; CIRCADIAN MODULATION; DAYTIME AROUSAL; WAKEFULNESS; RHYTHMS; HOMEOSTASIS; SIMULATION; PACEMAKER	Sleep-wake regulation involves reciprocal interactions between sleep-and wake-promoting processes that inhibit one another. To uncover the signatures of the opponent processes underlying ultradian sleep cycles, principal component analysis was performed on the sets of 16 single-Hz log-transformed electroencephalographic (EEG) power densities (116 Hz frequency range). Data were collected during unrestricted night sleep followed by 9 20-min naps (14 women aged 17-55 yrs) and during 12 20-min naps after either restriction or deprivation of sleep (9 males and 9 males, respectively, aged 18-22 yrs). It was found that any subset of power spectra could be reduced to the invariant four-principal component structure. The time courses of scores on these four components might be interpreted as the spectral EEG markers of the kinetics of two pairs of opponent chronoregulatory processes. In a sequence of ultradian sleep cycles, the 1st and 2nd components represent the alternations between competing drives for sleep and wakefulness, respectively, whereas the 3rd and 4th components reflect the alternations between light and deep sleep, respectively. The results suggest that principal component structuring of EEG spectrum can be employed for derivation of the parameters of the quantitative models conceptualizing the three major aspects of sleep-wake regulation-homeostatic, circadian, and ultradian processes.

A neural mass model of interconnected regions simulates rhythm propagation observed via TMS-EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TMS; Neural mass model; EEG rhythms; Connectivity; Fitting algorithm	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; ALPHA; CONNECTIVITY; INHIBITION	Knowledge of cortical rhythms represents an important aspect of modern neuroscience, to understand how the brain realizes its functions. Recent data suggest that different regions in the brain may exhibit distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms when perturbed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and that these rhythms can change due to the connectivity among regions. In this context, in silico simulations may help the validation of these hypotheses that would be difficult to be verified in vivo. Neural mass models can be very useful to simulate specific aspects of electrical brain activity and, above all, to analyze and identify the overall frequency content of EEG in a cortical region of interest (ROI). In this work we implemented a model of connectivity among cortical regions to fit the impulse responses in three ROIs recorded during a series of TMS/EEG experiments performed in five subjects and using three different impulse intensities. in particular we investigated Brodmann Area (BA) 19 (occipital lobe), BA 7 (parietal lobe) and BA 6 (frontal lobe). Results show that the model can reproduce the natural rhythms of the three regions quite well, acting on a few internal parameters. Moreover, the model can explain most rhythm changes induced by stimulation of another region, and inter-subject variability, by estimating just a few long-range connectivity parameters among ROIs.

The present study explored the differences in dynamics of frontal theta and occipital alpha activities between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and healthy participants in terms of reflection of prestimulus top-down regulation. EEGs were recorded from 16 OCD patients and 16 healthy controls using a color and a shape discrimination task. The power and time course of oscillatory activity were calculated by convolving the EEG signals with Monet wavelets. Although OCD patients yielded significantly lower total alpha and total theta power results than the normal controls, they demonstrated that significantly higher total alpha and total theta power preceded the difficult task (shape-task) as compared to the easy task (color-task). Furthermore, the frontal region, where OCD patients usually revealed abnormalities, showed significant differences in the prestimulus total theta power between the normal and OCD groups. Taken together, frontal theta and occipital alpha oscillations seem to be potent electrophysiological correlates reflecting impairment in the prestimulus top-down processing of OCD patients.

Originality and fluency indices of social thinking were evaluated on basis of specially developed 'divergent' task solution that stimulated different interpretations of social scenes; complex visual stimuli (architectural building) were used as control task. 'Divergent' task performing was characterized by both the greater power of the delta and alpha2 rhythms mostly in the right hemisphere and widespread increase in the gamma2 power as compared with the control task. Positive correlations between delta and gamma2 rhythms in baseline condition were revealed in the fronto-parietal cortex, and this relationship between low- and high-frequency oscillations while 'divergent' task performing was found in the right posterior cortex. Special topographic patterns of delta and gamma2 activity as predictors of social creativity were obtained using multiple regression analysis. These patterns can be interpreted as EEG correlates of a summation of endogenous and exogenous components of social thinking.	[Razumnikova, O. M.; Finikov, S.

This paper presents an alternative neural information processing architecture using the Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) for enhancement of the raw EEG signal. The raw EEG signal obtained during the motor imagery (MI) of a BCI user is intrinsically embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual signal is still a mystery. The proposed work in the field of recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) is designed to filter such non-Gaussian noise using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the signal type. The proposed learning architecture has been modified to do away with the Hebbian learning associated with the existing RQNN architecture as this learning scheme was found to be unstable for complex signals such as EEG. Besides, this the soliton behaviour of the non-linear SWE was not properly preserved in the existing scheme. The unsupervised learning algorithm proposed in this paper is able to efficiently capture the statistical behaviour of the input signal while making the algorithm robust to parametric sensitivity. This denoised EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. It is shown that the accuracy of the classifier output over the training and the evaluation datasets using the filtered EEG is much higher compared to that using the raw EEG signal. The improvement in classification accuracy computed over nine subjects is found to be statistically significant.	[Gandhi, Vaibhav; Behera, Laxmidhar; Prasad, Girijesh; Coyle, Damien; McGinnity, T.

Empirical insight into the underlying systems-level mechanisms has, however, remained fragmented. We review here recent studies on how wideband scale-free and scale-specific neuronal activity fluctuations together bias sensory processing and perceptual performance. We posit that these fluctuations constitute the neurophysiological foundation for both the trial-to-trial behavioral variability and the scaling laws governing psychophysical performance.	[Palva, J.

This paper aims towards identifying and analyzing distinct responses in an auditory working memory paradigm, as independent components with variable latency, frequency and phase characteristics. The event-related nature of components (either phase or non-phase-locked) over multiple trials is thoroughly examined through intertrial coherence measures. Furthermore, the functional coupling of independent components is investigated through the concept of partial directed coherence depicted as a directed graph. Using these tools, the paper compares issues of activation, connectivity and directionality in the synchronization maps of two populations, of control and Alzheimer's subjects. The results on real data from an oddball experiment verify and further enhance the findings of previous studies and illustrate the potential of the proposed analysis framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Prospects of using electroencephalographic signatures of the chronoregulatory processes for meaningful, parsimonious and quantitative description of the sleep-wake sub-states	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH			English	Article						principal component analysis; EEG spectrum; sleep scoring; all-night sleep; MSLT; sleep-wake regulation	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; LATENCY TEST; EEG; DEPRIVATION; ALERTNESS; DYNAMICS; PHASE	The two traditional terminological systems for description of sleep-wake phenomena are based on criteria for visual scoring of sleep and on measuring EEG power densities in conventional frequency bands. There are serious limitations concerning the use of these terminologies for distinguishing different sleep-wake sub-states and transitions between them. Polysomnographic recordings obtained throughout all-night sleep (n=14) and during 24-hour multiple sleep latency test (n=32) were analyzed to demonstrate the possibilities (1) to uncover the universal three principal component structure of wake and sleep EEG spectra, (2) to predict such wake-sleep parameters as sleepiness, sleep latency, amount of any sleep stage, etc. from the three principal component scores, and (3) to link the magnitudes and time courses of these scores with the levels and kinetics of sleep-wake regulatory processes. This demonstration could lead to the development of a theoretically based terminological system allowing meaningful, parsimonious and quantitative description of sub-states along the sleep-wake continuum.

This is achieved by using the visual, audio, and audiovisual stimuli representing human emotions. The analysis of brain responses to such stimuli involves several challenges related to the conditioning of brain electrical responses, extraction of the responses to stimuli and mutual information between the several physiological recording modalities used. This is achieved in the time-frequency domain, using multichannel empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which proves very accurate in the joint analysis of neurophysiological and peripheral body signals. Our results indicate the usefulness of such an approach and confirm the possibility of using affective brain-computer/machine interfaces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neuronal Dynamics Underlying High- and Low-Frequency EEG Oscillations Contribute Independently to the Human BOLD Signal	NEURON			English	Article							BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; FMRI; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; CORRELATE; NETWORKS	Work on animals indicates that BOLD is preferentially sensitive to local field potentials, and that it correlates most strongly with gamma band neuronal synchronization. Here we investigate how the BOLD signal in humans performing a cognitive task is related to neuronal synchronization across different frequency bands. We simultaneously recorded EEG and BOLD while subjects engaged in a visual attention task known to induce sustained changes in neuronal synchronization across a wide range of frequencies. Trial-by-trial BOLD fluctuations correlated positively with trial-by-trial fluctuations in high-EEG gamma power (60-80 Hz) and negatively with alpha and beta power. Gamma power on the one hand, and alpha and beta power on the other hand, independently contributed to explaining BOLD variance. These results indicate that the BOLD-gamma coupling observed in animals can be extrapolated to humans performing a task and that neuronal dynamics underlying high- and low-frequency synchronization contribute independently to the BOLD signal.

J	Rajagovindan, R; Ding, MZ				Rajagovindan, Rajasimhan; Ding, Mingzhou			From Prestimulus Alpha Oscillation to Visual-evoked Response: An Inverted-U Function and Its Attentional Modulation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SENSORY RESPONSES; PHASE-RESET; EEG; CORTEX; BAND; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; SUMMATION	Understanding the relation between prestimulus neural activity and subsequent stimulus processing has become an area of active investigation. Computational modeling, as well as in vitro and in vivo single-unit recordings in animal preparations, have explored mechanisms by which background synaptic activity can influence the responsiveness of cortical neurons to afferent input. How these mechanisms manifest in humans is not well understood. Although numerous EEG/MEG studies have considered the role of prestimulus alpha oscillations in the genesis of visual-evoked potentials, no consensus has emerged, and divergent reports continue to appear. The present work addresses this problem in three stages. First, a theoretical model was developed in which the background synaptic activity and the firing rate of a neural ensemble are related through a sigmoidal function. The derivative of this function, referred to as local gain, has an inverted-U shape and is postulated to be proportional to the trial-by-trial response evoked by a transient stimulus. Second, the theoretical model was extended to noninvasive studies of human visual processing, where the model variables are reinterpreted in terms of ongoing EEG oscillations and event-related potentials. Predictions were derived from the model and tested by recording high-density scalp EEG from healthy volunteers performing a trial-by-trial cued spatial visual attention task. Finally, enhanced stimulus processing by attention was linked to an increase in the overall slope of the sigmoidal function. The commonly observed reduction of alpha magnitude with attention was interpreted as signaling a shift of the underlying neural ensemble toward an optimal excitability state that enables the increase in global gain.

Here, we report that cortical brain oscillations of human sleep are predictive of successful dream recall. In particular, after morning awakening from REM sleep, a higher frontal 5-7 Hz (theta) activity was associated with successful dream recall. This finding mirrors the increase in frontal theta activity during successful encoding of episodic memories in wakefulness. Moreover, in keeping with the different EEG background, a different predictive relationship was found after awakening from stage 2 NREM sleep. Specifically, a lower 8-12 Hz (alpha) oscillatory activity of the right temporal area was associated with a successful dream recall. These findings provide the first evidence of univocal cortical electroencephalographic correlates of dream recall, suggesting that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the encoding and recall of episodic memories may remain the same across different states of consciousness.

While gamma oscillations have been shown to be correlated with brain rhythms at different frequencies, to date no empirical evidence has been presented that supports a causal influence of gamma oscillations on other brain rhythms. In this work, we study the relation of gamma oscillations and the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in healthy human subjects using electroencephalography. We first demonstrate that modulation of the SMR, induced by motor imagery of either the left or right hand, is positively correlated with the power of frontal and occipital gamma oscillations, and negatively correlated with the power of centro-parietal gamma oscillations. We then demonstrate that the most simple causal structure, capable of explaining the observed correlation of gamma oscillations and the SMR, entails a causal influence of gamma oscillations on the SMR. This finding supports the fundamental role attributed to gamma oscillations for information processing within the brain, and is of particular importance for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). As modulation of the SMR is typically used in BCIs to infer a subject's intention, our findings entail that gamma oscillations have a causal influence on a subject's capability to utilize a BCI for means of communication.

ATTENTIONAL MODULATION OF THE SOMATOSENSORY MU RHYTHM	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; somatosensory; neural oscillations; Mu; alpha; ERPs	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; BACKWARD CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUSTAINED SPATIAL ATTENTION; MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS	Neural oscillations with a frequency of around 10 Hz are thought to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in sensory cortices, and it has been hypothesized that the level of 10 Hz activity is related to local cortical excitability. During spatial attention, the visual alpha rhythm has been found to be modulated according to the direction of attention. Specifically, the alpha rhythm desynchronizes over visual cortex contralateral to the direction of attention and synchronizes over visual cortex ipsilateral to the direction of attention, and these modulations have been associated with facilitation and inhibition of sensory processing. In the somatosensory domain, the reactivity of a similar rhythm, known as the mu rhythm, during attention tasks is a current topic of inquiry and somatotopic modulation of the mu rhythm by directed attention have been reported. In this paper, we investigate how lateralized spatial attention modulates the ongoing somatosensory mu rhythm, and how such modulation impacts sensory information processing. 128 channel EEG was recorded while subjects performed a somatosensory spatial attention task. In addition to analyses on scalp recorded data, a spatial filtering method was utilized to investigate spatial attention effects in the source space. The direction of spatial attention was found to have a significant somatotopic effect on the ongoing mu rhythm occurring in primary somatosensory cortex. Concurrently, the visual alpha rhythm was significantly elevated above the baseline level during somatosensory attention, demonstrating a cross-modal effect. Lastly, an analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the level of prestimulus mu activity and subsequent stimulus evoked activity in primary somatosensory cortex. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Components of cross-frequency modulation in health and disease	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-frequency modulation; cross-frequency coupling; oscillations; EEG; schizophrenia; independent component analysis; biomarker	DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; C957T POLYMORPHISM; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PHASE; SYNCHRONY; GENE; AMPLITUDES	The cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia are commonly believed to arise from the abnormal temporal integration of information, however a quantitative approach to assess network coordination is lacking. Here, we propose to use cross-frequency modulation (cfM), the dependence of local high-frequency activity on the phase of widespread low-frequency oscillations, as an indicator of network coordination and functional integration. In an exploratory analysis based on pre-existing data, we measured cfM from multi-channel EEG recordings acquired while schizophrenia patients (n = 47) and healthy controls (n = 130) performed an auditory oddball task. Novel application of independent component analysis (ICA) to modulation data delineated components with specific spatial and spectral profiles, the weights of which showed covariation with diagnosis. Global cfM was significantly greater in healthy controls (F-1,F-175 = 9.25, P < 0.005), while modulation at fronto-temporal electrodes was greater in patients (F-1,F-175 = 17.5, P < 0.0001). We further found that the weights of schizophrenia-relevant components were associated with genetic polymorphisms at previously identified risk loci. Global cfM decreased with copies of 957C allele in the gene for the dopamine D2 receptor (r = -0.20, P < 0.01) across all subjects. Additionally, greater "aberrant" fronto-temporal modulation in schizophrenia patients was correlated with several polymorphisms in the gene for the alpha 2-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABRA2) as well as the total number of risk alleles in GABRA2 (r = 0.45, P < 0.01). Overall, our results indicate great promise for this approach in establishing patterns of cfM in health and disease and elucidating the roles of oscillatory interactions in functional connectivity.

Cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations: An impact of state anxiety	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Delta-beta coupling; State anxiety; sLORETA; Independent component analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DELTA-BETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN NEOCORTEX; CODING SCHEME; EEG-ALPHA; GAMMA; PERSONALITY	In recent studies, statistical relations among activities in different frequency EEG bands have been reported. Most of these studies investigate within-subject cross-frequency relations, such as amplitude-amplitude, phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between different frequencies. All these cross-frequency interactions are considered to be transient correlates of information processing. However, some authors suggested that a particular pattern of amplitude-amplitude relations among different frequencies may be associated with relatively stable states or even traits. Particularly delta-beta amplitude-amplitude correlation measured in the between-subject domain was shown to lawfully increase in some presumably anxiogenic conditions and in some pathological groups. The main purpose of this paper was to further explore the phenomenon of between-subject delta-beta correlation in terms of its spatial localization, relatedness to state anxiety, and similarity to within-subject amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-amplitude coupling. Independent component analysis was used to identify temporally correlated spatial patterns that most reliably show the phenomenon of between-subject delta-beta correlation. Results of this analysis show that in an anxiogenic situation, delta-beta correlation increases in a network of cortical areas which includes the orbitofrontal and the anterior cingulate cortices as its main node. This increase of correlation is accompanied by an increase of delta power and connectivity in the same cortical regions. Analysis of the within-subject delta-beta amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-amplitude coupling showed that in an anxiogenic situation, in subjects with higher scores on state anxiety they also tend to increase in the same set of cortical areas.

Evoked potentials in large-scale cortical networks elicited by TMS of the visual cortex. J Neurophysiol 106: 1734-1746, 2011. First published June 29, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00739.2010.-Single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) result in distal and long-lasting oscillations, a finding directly challenging the virtual lesion hypothesis. Previous research supporting this finding has primarily come from stimulation of the motor cortex. We have used single-pulse TMS with simultaneous EEG to target seven brain regions, six of which belong to the visual system [left and right primary visual area V1, motion-sensitive human middle temporal cortex, and a ventral temporal region], as determined with functional MRI-guided neuronavigation, and a vertex "control" site to measure the network effects of the TMS pulse. We found the TMS-evoked potential (TMS-EP) over visual cortex consists mostly of site-dependent theta-and alphaband oscillations. These site-dependent oscillations extended beyond the stimulation site to functionally connected cortical regions and correspond to time windows where the EEG responses maximally diverge (40, 200, and 385 ms). Correlations revealed two site-independent oscillations similar to 350 ms after the TMS pulse: a theta-band oscillation carried by the frontal cortex, and an alpha-band oscillation over parietal and frontal cortical regions. A manipulation of stimulation intensity at one stimulation site (right hemisphere V1-V3) revealed sensitivity to the stimulation intensity at different regions of cortex, evidence of intensity tuning in regions distal to the site of stimulation. Together these results suggest that a TMS pulse applied to the visual cortex has a complex effect on brain function, engaging multiple brain networks functionally connected to the visual system with both invariant and site-specific spatiotemporal dynamics. With this characterization of TMS, we propose an alternative to the virtual lesion hypothesis. Rather than a technique that simulates lesions, we propose TMS generates natural brain signals and engages functional networks.

The EEG activity was recorded in a double-blind placebo experiment, and prestimulus spectral power and inter-and intrahemispheric temporal coupling were assessed during visual sustained attention task performance. A single DZ dose (5 mg) was enough to increase reaction times during visual sustained attention task responses. DZ decreased prestimulus EEG power in the 1- to 6-, 8- to 12-, and 19- to 35-Hz bands and disrupted right intrahemispheric temporal coupling in the a-frequency range (8-12 Hz). The combined reduction in power and temporal coupling suggests both local and interregional DZ-induced disruption of neuronal synchronicity especially in the right hemisphere in agreement with the prominent attention-related networks in this hemisphere. These data support the notion that the influence of DZ on behavior goes beyond sedative effects and can potentially compromise higher cognitive functions with negative consequences to daily life situations.

Using frequency analysis of high-density electroencephalogram coupled with source estimations, the present study investigated the role of pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in auditory spatial temporal order judgments (TOJ). Oscillations within the beta range (i.e. 18-23 Hz) were significantly stronger before accurate than inaccurate TOJ trials. Distributed source estimations identified bilateral posterior sylvian regions as the principal contributors to pre-stimulus beta oscillations. Activity within the left posterior sylvian region was significantly stronger before accurate than inaccurate TOJ trials. We discuss our results in terms of a modulation of sensory gating mechanisms mediated by beta activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition to oscillatory activity between 30 and 60 Hz, current evidence from electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) and local-field potentials (LFPs) has consistently shown oscillations > 60 Hz (high gamma-band) whose function and generating mechanisms are unclear. In the present paper, we summarize data that highlights the importance of high gamma-band activity for cortical computations through establishing correlations between the modulation of oscillations in the 60-200 Hz frequency and specific cognitive functions. Moreover, we will suggest that high gamma-band activity is impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. In the final part of the paper, we will review physiological mechanisms underlying the generation of high gamma-band oscillations and discuss the functional implications of low vs. high gamma-band activity patterns in cortical networks.

Resting eyes-closed EEG was recorded twice in two weeks in 14 healthy subjects (13 women, aged 25-69 years). At follow-up, the significant decrease of alpha and theta-2 power, along with changes of alpha-1 and alpha-2 mean frequencies in the right hemisphere, was observed. In addition, the increase of delta-2, theta and beta power was prominent in the left temporal region in the combination with slowing of delta-1 mean frequency in the left hemisphere and theta-2 frequency in the temporal regions. The present results reveal that physiological changes of brain electrical activity at repeated recordings are prominent and this fact should be correctly treated during longitudinal clinical studies using EEG.

Scalp-Recorded Induced Gamma-Band Responses to Auditory Stimulation and Its Correlations with Saccadic Muscle-Activity	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Induced gamma; Auditory; Human; Saccades; Microsaccades; High frequency; Spike potential	ODDBALL PARADIGM; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ACTIVITY REFLECTS; HUMAN CORTEX; TERM-MEMORY; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; TASK	We previously showed that the transient broadband induced gamma-band response in EEG (iGBRtb) appearing around 200-300 ms following a visual stimulus reflects the contraction of extra-ocular muscles involved in the execution of saccades, rather than neural oscillations. Several previous studies reported induced gamma-band responses also following auditory stimulation. It is still an open question whether, similarly to visual paradigms, such auditory paradigms are also sensitive to the saccadic confound. In the current study we address this question using simultaneous eye-tracking and EEG recordings during an auditory oddball paradigm. Subjects were instructed to respond to a rare target defined by sound source location, while fixating on a central screen. Results show that, similar to what was found in visual paradigms, saccadic rate displayed typical temporal dynamics including a post-stimulus decrease followed by an increase. This increase was more moderate, had a longer latency, and was less consistent across subjects than was found in the visual case. Crucially, the temporal dynamics of the induced gamma response were similar to those of saccadic-rate modulation. This suggests that the auditory induced gamma-band responses recorded on the scalp may also be affected by saccadic muscle activity.

WM manipulates information for a short time and dose multi-task. In this paper, the significant factors of WM have been extracted by wavelet coefficients from EEG signals. 12 pictures were shown to subjects randomly and asked them to review these pictures in order to focus on WM task. The analysis is concentrated on the differences between EEG signals of the WM task and those of the rest mood, by means of the Repeated Measures ANOVA. The results show significant reduction in standard deviation of some wavelet coefficients in WM task in contrast with rest mood. Also importance of alpha (8-12Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) oscillations which matches with pervious related studies outcome is shown.

It is an essential test for the most common drug-resistant epilepsy, mesial temporal sclerosis, and predicts good outcome when interictal epileptiform discharges are concordant with unilateral hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, and predicts poor outcome when interictal epileptic discharges are discordant with the lesion. Its role in other types of epilepsy surgery, including nonlesional cases and corpus callosotomy, is less clear. Future research gathering large multicenter prospective data is needed to maximize the role of this classic neurophysiological test in the evaluation of candidates for epilepsy surgery.

Due to the relatively small spatial extent of auditory cortical areas, this rhythmic activity is less obvious and frequently masked by non-auditory alpha-generators when recording non-invasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Following stimulation with sounds, marked desynchronizations can be observed between 6 and 12 Hz, which can be localized to the auditory cortex. However knowledge about the functional relevance of the auditory alpha rhythm has remained scarce so far. Results from the visual and sensorimotor system have fuelled the hypothesis of alpha activity reflecting a state of functional inhibition. The current article pursues several intentions: (1) Firstly we review and present own evidence (MEG, EEG, sEEG) for the existence of an auditory alpha-like rhythm independent of visual or motor generators, something that is occasionally met with skepticism. (2) In a second part we will discuss tinnitus and how this audiological symptom may relate to reduced background alpha. The clinical part will give an introduction into a method which aims to modulate neurophysiological activity hypothesized to underlie this distressing disorder. Using neurofeedback, one is able to directly target relevant oscillatory activity. Preliminary data point to a high potential of this approach for treating tinnitus. (3) Finally, in a cognitive neuroscientific part we will show that auditory alpha is modulated by anticipation/expectations with and without auditory stimulation. We will also introduce ideas and initial evidence that alpha oscillations are involved in the most complex capability of the auditory system, namely speech perception. The evidence presented in this article corroborates findings from other modalities, indicating that alpha-like activity functionally has an universal inhibitory role across sensory modalities.

This method takes advantage of a Matching Pursuit algorithm using a dictionary reduced to Gabor functions reproducing the main targeted waveform characteristics. By describing the EEG signals in terms of SSW properties, the corresponding algorithm is able to identify waveforms based on the largest matching coefficients. The implemented algorithm was tested on a database of whole night sleep EEG recordings collected in 9 young healthy subjects where SSW have been visually scored by an expert. Besides being fully automated and much faster than visual scoring analysis, the results obtained to the proposed method were in excellent agreement with the expert with 98% of correct detections and a 77% concordance in event time position and duration. These results were superior from those of the classical method both in terms of sensibility and precision.

They occur during seizures and interictally and seem important in seizure genesis. We investigated whether interictal and ictal HFOs occur in the same regions and how they relate to epileptiform spikes. Methods: In 25 patients, spikes, ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (FR: 250-500 Hz) and their co-occurrences were marked during interictal slow wave sleep (5-10 min), during 10 pre-ictal seconds and 5 s following seizure onset. We compared occurrence and spatial distribution between these periods. Results: HFOs and spikes increased from interictal to ictal periods: the percentage of time occupied by ripples increased from 2.3% to 6.5%, FR from 0.2% to 0.8%, spikes from 1.1% to 4.8%. HFOs increased from interictal to pre-ictal periods in contrast to spikes. Spikes were in different channels in the interictal, pre-ictal and ictal periods whereas HFOs largely remained in the same channels. Conclusions: HFOs remain confined to the same, possibly epileptogenic, area, during interictal and ictal periods, while spikes are more widespread during seizures than interictally. Significance: Ictal and interictal HFOs represent the same (epileptogenic) area and are probably similar phenomena. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Many disparate putative causes may co-associate with a single disease state. However, uncovering functional, hierarchical networks of underlying mechanisms can provide a framework in which many primary pathologies converge on more complex, single higher level correlates of disease. This article focuses on cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia to illustrate: a) How non-invasive EEG biomarkers of cognitive function constitute such a 'higher level correlate' of underlying pathologies. b) How derangement of multiple, cell-specific, molecular processes can converge on such EEG-visible, correlates of disrupted cognitive function. This approach suggests that evidence-based design of multitarget therapies may take advantage of hierarchical patterns of convergence to improve both efficacy and selectivity of disease-intervention.

The ability to efficiently process rapid changes in auditory information is important for decoding speech and thereby crucial during language acquisition. Investigating functional networks of speech perception in infancy might elucidate neuronal ensembles supporting perceptual abilities that gate language acquisition. Interhemispheric specializations for language have been demonstrated in infants. How these asymmetries are shaped by basic temporal acoustic properties is under debate. We recently provided evidence that newborns process non-linguistic sounds sharing temporal features with language in a differential and lateralized fashion. The present study used the same material while measuring brain responses of 6 and 3 month old infants using simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS reveals that the lateralization observed in newborns remains constant over the first months of life. While fast acoustic modulations elicit bilateral neuronal activations, slow modulations lead to right-lateralized responses. Additionally, auditory-evoked potentials and oscillatory EEG responses show differential responses for fast and slow modulations indicating a sensitivity for temporal acoustic variations. Oscillatory responses reveal an effect of development, that is, 6 but not 3 month old infants show stronger theta-band desynchronization for slowly modulated sounds. Whether this developmental effect is due to increasing fine-grained perception for spectrotemporal sounds in general remains speculative. Our findings support the notion that a more general specialization for acoustic properties can be considered the basis for lateralization of speech perception. The results show that concurrent assessment of vascular based imaging and electrophysiological responses have great potential in the research on language acquisition.

Human non-rapid eye movement stage II sleep spindles are blocked upon spontaneous K-complex coincidence and resume as higher frequency spindles afterwards	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						human electroencephalogram; K-complex; non-rapid eye movement sleep; spindle	SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; NREM SLEEP; MUSCLE; EEG; FLUNITRAZEPAM; ACTIVATION; GENERATION; RESOLUTION; CORTEX	P>The purpose of this study was to investigate a potential relation between the K-complex (KC) and sleep spindles of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage II of human sleep. Using 58 electroencephalogram electrodes, plus standard electrooculogram and electromyogram derivations for sleep staging, brain activity during undisturbed whole-night sleep was recorded in six young adults (one of them participated twice). NREM stage II spindles (1256 fast and 345 slow) and 1131 singular generalized KCs were selected from all sleep cycles. The negative peak of the KC, the positive peak of the KC (where applicable), and the prominent negative wave peak of slow and fast spindles were marked as events of reference. Fast Fourier transform-based time-frequency analysis was performed over the marked events, which showed that: (a) fast spindles that happen to coincide with KC are interrupted (100% of 403 cases) and in their place a slower rhythmic oscillation often (80%) appears; and (b) spindles that are usually (72% of 1131) following KCs always have a higher frequency (by similar to 1 Hz) than both the interrupted spindles and the individual fast spindles that are not in any way associated with a KC. This enhancement of spindle frequency could not be correlated to any of the KC parameters studied. The results of this study reveal a consistent interaction between the KC and the sleep spindle during NREM stage II in human sleep.

However, recent results suggest that the set of semantic features activated by an input is broader than implied by a view wherein access serially follows recognition. EEG was collected from participants who viewed items varying in number and frequency of both orthographic neighbors and lexical associates. Regression analysis of single item ERPs replicated past findings, showing that N400 amplitudes are greater for items with more neighbors, and further revealed that N400 amplitudes increase for items with more lexical associates and with higher frequency neighbors or associates. Together, the data suggest that in the N400 time window semantic features of items broadly related to inputs are active, consistent with models in which semantic access takes place in parallel with stimulus recognition.

However, little work has been done to understand how a-activity is linked to neuronal firing. Here, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and spikes from somatosensory, premotor, and motor regions while a trained monkey performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. In the local field potentials we observed strong activity in the alpha-band, which decreased in the sensorimotor regions during the discrimination task. This alpha-power decrease predicted better discrimination performance. Furthermore, the alpha-oscillations demonstrated a rhythmic relation with the spiking, such that firing was highest at the trough of the alpha-cycle. Firing rates increased with a decrease in alpha-power. These findings suggest that alpha-oscillations exercise a strong inhibitory influence on both spike timing and firing rate. Thus, the pulsed inhibition by alpha-oscillations plays an important functional role in the extended sensorimotor system.

Reduced sensory oscillatory activity during rapid auditory processing as a correlate of language-learning impairment	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Specific language impairment; Dyslexia; Auditory rate processing; Electroencephalography; Gamma-band activity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; ALTERED HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; VISUAL-CORTEX; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; DYSLEXIA	Successful language acquisition has been hypothesized to involve the ability to integrate rapidly presented, brief acoustic cues in sensory cortex. A body of work has suggested that this ability is compromised in language-learning impairment (LLI). The present research aimed to examine sensory integration during rapid auditory processing by means of electrophysiological measures of oscillatory brain activity using data from a larger longitudinal study. Twenty-nine children with LLI and control participants with typical language development (n = 18) listened to tone doublets presented at a temporal interval that is essential for accurate speech processing (70-ms interstimulus interval). The children performed a deviant (pitch change of second tone) detection task, or listened passively. The electroencephalogram was recorded from 64 electrodes. Data were source-projected to the auditory cortices and submitted to wavelet analysis, resulting in time-frequency representations of electrocortical activity. Results show significantly reduced amplitude and phase-locking of early (45-75 ms) oscillations in the gamma-band range (29-52 Hz), specifically in the LLI group, for the second stimulus of the tone doublet. This suggests altered temporal organization of sensory oscillatory activity in LLI when processing rapid sequences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially, differences in within-person variability in behavior and neural activity between young and older adults and changes in topography of slow event-related oscillations (EROs) were of interest. Within-person variability in behavior was assessed by reaction time (RT) variability. Event-related delta and theta oscillations were analyzed using time-frequency transformation, which can give information on the time-course of single trial event-related EEG spectral power enhancement and intertrial phase-locking (ITC). In contrast to our previous visual Go/NoGo study, no under-recruitment of task-relevant brain regions was found for the auditory theta and delta ER0s. Young did not differ from older adults in RI variability or in single trial delta/theta ITC. Altered recruitment of brain activity at advanced age was indicated, first, by stronger early theta phase-locking in older compared to young adults and, second, by a Go-specific lateralization of delta/theta activity. We conclude that within-person variability may increase with age, but the degree depends on performance level and the modality investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A part of such networks is considered to be realized with synchronization of neuronal activities, which can generate correlated neural oscillation at the same and/or different frequency bands. To investigate the networks with the synchronization, analysis of connectivity between not only same frequency oscillation but also different frequency (i.e. cross-frequency) is needed. For source estimation with electroencephalogram (EEG) or magneto-encephalogram (MEG) signals, a spatial filtering technique is recently applied as an alternative method for equivalent current dipole (ECD) estimation technique. Non-adaptive type of spatial filtering technique, such as the Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), is reported to discriminate correlated sources. However, it may lead to inaccurate results due to its low spatial resolution. In the present study, we proposed a new systematic approach for localizing the sources of correlated cross-frequency oscillations. The method we propose can overcome the limitation of the non-adaptive spatial filtering technique by proactively using identified information in sensor level analysis (e. g. cross-correlation map and correlation topography), which allow us to focus on target sources. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated with simulated EEG signals, and is compared with traditional method.

One of the key issues in electrophysiological studies of schizophrenia is whether high or low frequency oscillations, or both, are related to schizophrenia because many brain functions are modulated with frequency specificities. Many recent electrophysiological studies of schizophrenia have focused on high frequency oscillations at gamma band and in general support gamma band dysfunction in schizophrenia. We discuss the concept that gamma oscillation abnormalities in schizophrenia often occur in the background of oscillation abnormalities of lower frequencies. The review discusses the basic neurobiology for the emergence of oscillations of all frequency bands in association with networks of inhibitory interneurons and the convergence and divergence of such mechanisms in generating high vs low frequency oscillations. We then review the literature of oscillatory frequency abnormalities identified in each frequency band in schizophrenia. By describing some of the key functional roles exerted by gamma, low frequencies, and their cross-frequency coupling, we conceptualize that even isolated alterations in gamma or low frequency oscillations may impact the interactions of high and low frequency bands that are involved in key cognitive functions. The review concludes that studying the full spectrum and the interaction of gamma and low frequency oscillations may be critical for deciphering the complex electrophysiological abnormalities observed in schizophrenia patients.

First published June 8, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00193.2011.-Oscillatory activity of the sensorimotor cortex has been reported to show coherence with muscle activity in the 15- to 35-Hz frequency band (beta-band) during weak to moderate intensity of isometric contraction. The present study examined the variance of the magnitude of the corticomuscular coherence across a large number of subjects. We quantified the coherence between EEG over the sensorimotor cortex and rectified electromyogram (EMG) from the tibialis anterior muscle during tonic isometric contraction at 30% of maximal effort in 100 healthy young individuals. We estimated the maximal peak of EEG-EMG coherence (Cohmax) and the ratio of the sum of the autopower spectral density function within the beta-band to that of all frequency ranges for both EEG (EEG beta-PSD) and EMG (EMG beta-PSD) signals. The frequency histogram of Cohmax across all subjects showed a broad bell-shaped continuous distribution (range, 0.048-0.816). When the coherence was thresholded at the estimated significance level of P < 0.05 (0.114), 46 out of 100 subjects showed significant EEG-EMG coherence. Cohmax occurred within the beta-band in the majority of subjects who showed significant EEG-EMG coherence (n = 43). Furthermore, Cohmax showed significant positive correlations with both EEG beta-PSD (r = 0.575, P < 0.001) and EMG beta-PSD (r = 0.606, P < 0.001). These data suggest that even during simple tonic isometric contraction, the strength of oscillatory coupling between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal motoneurons varies among individuals and is a contributory factor determining muscle activation patterns such as the degree of grouped discharge in muscle activity within the beta-band for each subject.

Spindles are slower in frontal EEG and possibly MEG. The posterior-fast EEG pattern may predominate early in the spindle, and the anterior-slow pattern late. We aimed to determine the proportion of spindles showing this spatio-spectro-temporal interaction for EEG, and whether it occurs in MEG. Methods: We recorded high density EEG and MEG from seven healthy subjects during normal stage 2 sleep. High vs. low frequency (12 vs. 14 Hz) power was measured early vs. late (25th-45th vs. 55th-75th duration percentile) in 183 spindle discharges. Results: The predicted spatio-spectro-temporal interaction was shown by 48% of EEG and 34% of MEG spindles (chance = 25%). Topographically, high frequency EEG power was greatest at midline central contacts, and low frequency power at midline frontal. This frequency-specific topography was fixed over the course of the spindle. Conclusions: An evolution from posterior-fast to anterior-slow generators commonly occurs during spindles, and this is visible with EEG and to a lesser extent, MEG. Significance: The spatio-spectral-temporal evolution of spindles may reflect their possible involvement in coordinating cortical activity during consolidation.

Whereas alpha is an ongoing process, the P1 is the manifestation of an event-related process. It is suggested that alpha and the P1 reflect inhibition that is effective during early access to a complex knowledge system (KS). Most importantly, inhibition operates in two different ways. In potentially competing and task irrelevant networks, inhibition is used to block information processing. In task relevant neural networks, however, inhibition is used to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) by enabling precisely timed activity in neurons with a high level of excitation but silencing neurons with a comparatively low level of excitation. Inhibition is increased to modulate the SNR when processing complexity and network excitation increases and when certain types of attentional demands such as top down control, expectancy or reflexive attention increase. A variety of findings are reviewed to demonstrate that they can well be interpreted on the basis of the suggested theory. One interesting aspect thereby is that attentional benefits (reflected e.g., by a larger P1 for attended as compared to unattended items at contralateral sites) and costs (reflected e.g., by a larger PI. at ipsilateral sites) can both be interpreted in terms of inhibition. In the former case an increased P1 is associated with a more effective processing of the presented item (due to an inhibition modulated increase in SNR), in the latter case, however, with a suppression of item processing (due to inhibition that blocks information processing).

However, the extent to which the human brain responds to external stimuli during sleep is uncertain. We used simultaneous EEG and functional MRI to characterize brain responses to tones during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sounds during wakefulness elicited responses in the thalamus and primary auditory cortex. These responses persisted in NREM sleep, except throughout spindles, during which they became less consistent. When sounds induced a K complex, activity in the auditory cortex was enhanced and responses in distant frontal areas were elicited, similar to the stereotypical pattern associated with slow oscillations. These data show that sound processing during NREM sleep is constrained by fundamental brain oscillatory modes (slow oscillations and spindles), which result in a complex interplay between spontaneous and induced brain activity. The distortion of sensory information at the thalamic level, especially during spindles, functionally isolates the cortex from the environment and might provide unique conditions favorable for off-line memory processing.

We used EEG power spectral analysis to determine if frequency and power provide an independent measure of developmental impairment in infants. We examined the spectral power of EEGs in 200 infants between 6 and 24 months of age who were evaluated for seizures. Infants were stratified into three age groups 6-12, 12-18, and 18-24 months, and development assessments were coded as normal, moderately delayed, and severely delayed. Compared with the normal infants, children with developmental delay had lower mean frequencies and greater delta and less theta and alpha power. Delta/theta and theta/alpha ratios were highly significant indicators of developmental status. This study demonstrates that frequency and power of brain oscillations during wakefulness is a strong predictor of development in infants. The findings support the concept that normal oscillatory activity is critical for normal cognitive function during development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identifying network interaction from the complementary neuroelectric and hemodynamic signals may help to explain the complex relationships between different brain regions. In this paper, multimodal functional network connectivity (mFNC) is proposed for the fusion of EEG and fMRI in network space. First, functional networks (FNs) are extracted using spatial independent component analysis (ICA) in each modality separately. Then the interactions among FNs in each modality are explored by Granger causality analysis (GCA). Finally, fMRI FNs are matched to EEG FNs in the spatial domain using network-based source imaging (NESOI). Investigations of both synthetic and real data demonstrate that mFNC has the potential to reveal the underlying neural networks of each modality separately and in their combination. With mFNC, comprehensive relationships among FNs might be unveiled for the deep exploration of neural activities and metabolic responses in a specific task or neurological state.

We studied these changes using ERP and EEG spectral analyses in subjects playing Space Fortress, a complex video game comprising standard cognitive task components. We hypothesized that training would free up attentional resources for a secondary auditory oddball task. Both P3 and delta EEG showed a processing trade-off between game and oddball tasks, but only some game events showed reduced attention requirements with practice. Training magnified a transient increase in alpha power following both primary and secondary task events. This contrasted with alpha suppression observed when the oddball task was performed alone, suggesting that alpha may be related to attention switching. Hence, P3 and EEG spectral data are differentially sensitive to changes in attentional processing occurring with complex task training.

Changes in brain network activity during working memory tasks: A magnetoencephalography study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Network; Theta; Gamma; Beamformer; Oscillations; Connectivity	HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; FREQUENCY; CORRELATE; DYNAMICS	In this study, we elucidate the changes in neural oscillatory processes that are induced by simple working memory tasks. A group of eight subjects took part in modified versions of the N-back and Sternberg working memory paradigms. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded, and subsequently processed using beamformer based source imaging methodology. Our study shows statistically significant increases in 9 oscillations during both N-back and Sternberg tasks. These oscillations were shown to originate in the medial frontal cortex, and further to scale with memory load. We have also shown that increases in theta oscillations are accompanied by decreases in beta and gamma band oscillations at the same spatial coordinate. These decreases were most prominent in the 20-40 Hz frequency range, although spectral analysis showed that gamma band power decrease extends up to at least 80 Hz. beta/gamma Power decrease also scales with memory load. Whilst theta increases were predominately observed in the medial frontal cortex, beta/gamma decreases were associated with other brain areas, including nodes of the default mode network (for the N-back task) and areas associated with language processing (for the Sternberg task). These observations are in agreement with intracranial EEG and fMRI studies. Finally, we have shown an intimate relationship between changes in beta/gamma, band oscillatory power at spatially separate network nodes, implying that activity in these nodes is not reflective of urn-modal task driven changes in spatially separate brain regions, but rather represents correlated network activity. The utility of MEG as a non-invasive means to measure neural oscillatory modulation has been demonstrated and future studies employing this technology have the potential to gain a better understanding of neural oscillatory processes, their relationship to functional and effective connectivity, and their correspondence to BOLD fMRI.

Researchers across the globe have studied various tools to implicitly assess emotions and affective states of people. Human computer interface systems specifically can benefit from such implicit emotion evaluator module, which can help them determine their users' affective states and act accordingly. Brain electrical activity can be considered as an appropriate candidate for extracting emotion-related cues, but it is still in its infancy. In this paper, the results of analyzing the Electroencephalogram (EEG) for assessing emotions elicited during watching various pre-selected emotional music video clips have been reported. More precisely, in-depth results of both subject-dependent and subject-independent correlation analysis between time domain, and frequency domain features of EEC signal and subjects' self assessed emotions are produced and discussed.

The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.

However, frequency and regional specific differences in EEG activity remains controversial. We investigated NREM and REM sleep EEG power density associated with and without dream recall in 17 young subjects during a 40-h multiple nap protocol under constant routine conditions. NREM sleep was associated with lower EEG power density for dream recall in the delta range, particularly in frontal derivations, and in the spindle range in centro-parietal derivations. REM sleep was associated with low frontal alpha activity and with high alpha and beta activity in occipital derivations. Our data indicate that specific EEG frequency- and topography changes underlie differences between dream recall and no recall after both NREM and REM sleep awakening. This dual NREM-REM sleep modulation holds strong implications for the mechanistic understanding of this complex ongoing cognitive process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seizure classification in EEG signals utilizing Hilbert-Huang transform	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article								Background: Classification method capable of recognizing abnormal activities of the brain functionality are either brain imaging or brain signal analysis. The abnormal activity of interest in this study is characterized by a disturbance caused by changes in neuronal electrochemical activity that results in abnormal synchronous discharges. The method aims at helping physicians discriminate between healthy and seizure electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Method: Discrimination in this work is achieved by analyzing EEG signals obtained from freely accessible databases. MATLAB has been used to implement and test the proposed classification algorithm. The analysis in question presents a classification of normal and ictal activities using a feature relied on Hilbert-Huang Transform. Through this method, information related to the intrinsic functions contained in the EEG signal has been extracted to track the local amplitude and the frequency of the signal. Based on this local information, weighted frequencies are calculated and a comparison between ictal and seizure-free determinant intrinsic functions is then performed. Methods of comparison used are the t-test and the Euclidean clustering. Results: The t-test results in a P-value < 0.02 and the clustering leads to accurate (94%) and specific (96%) results. The proposed method is also contrasted against the Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition that reaches 80% accuracy. Comparison results strengthen the contribution of this paper not only from the accuracy point of view but also with respect to its fast response and ease to use. Conclusion: An original tool for EEG signal processing giving physicians the possibility to diagnose brain functionality abnormalities is presented in this paper. The proposed system bears the potential of providing several credible benefits such as fast diagnosis, high accuracy, good sensitivity and specificity, time saving and user friendly. Furthermore, the classification of mode mixing can be achieved using the extracted instantaneous information of every IMF, but it would be most likely a hard task if only the average value is used. Extra benefits of this proposed system include low cost, and ease of interface. All of that indicate the usefulness of the tool and its use as an efficient diagnostic tool.

Optimal imaging of cortico-muscular coherence through a novel regression technique based on multi-channel EEG and un-rectified EMG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Coherence; Neuronal oscillations; EEG; EMG; Synchronization	HUMAN CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; TASK; RECTIFICATION; OUTPUT; MUSCLE	Cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) reflects interactions between muscular and cortical activities as detected with EMG and EEG recordings, respectively. Most previous studies utilized EMG rectification for CMC calculation. Yet, recent modeling studies predicted that EMG rectification might have disadvantages for CMC evaluation. In addition, previously the effect of rectification on CMC was estimated with single-channel EEG which might be suboptimal for detection of CMC. In order to optimally detect CMC with un-rectified EMG and resolve the issue of EMG rectification for CMC estimation, we introduce a novel method, Regression CMC (R-CMC), which maximizes the coherence between EEG and EMG. The core idea is to use multiple regression where narrowly filtered EEG signals serve as predictors and EMG is the dependent variable. We investigated CMC during isometric contraction of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In order to facilitate the comparison with previous studies, we estimated the effect of rectification with frequently used Laplacian filtering and C3/C4 vs. linked earlobes. For all three types of analysis, we detected CMC in the beta frequency range above the contralateral sensorimotor areas. The R-CMC approach was validated with simulations and real data and was found capable of recovering CMC even in case of high levels of background noise. When using single channel data, there were no changes in the strength of CMC estimated with rectified or un-rectified EMG in agreement with the previous findings. Critically, for both Laplacian and R-CMC analyses EMG rectification resulted in significantly smaller CMC values compared to un-rectified EMG. Thus, the present results provide empirical evidence for the predictions from the earlier modeling studies that rectification of EMG can reduce CMC. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the molecular players involved in this cascade of events are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that immunosupression by splenectomy or lack of perforin, a downstream factor of natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells, could reduce seizure onset. Methods: Pilocarpine was used to induce seizures in adult rats wild-type and perforin-deficient mice. Splenectomy was performed prior to pilocarpine injection. Seizure onset was evaluated by electroencephalography (EEG) and joint time-frequency analysis. Spleens from control and pilocarpine-treated groups were analyzed for anatomical changes and CD3+ cell content. BBB damage was assessed by measuring albumin parenchymal extravasation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on spleen and brain tissue of wild-type and perforin-deficient mice treated, or not, with pilocarpine. Key Findings: Splenectomy significantly reduced seizure-associated mortality. Histologic analysis of the spleens exposed to pilocarpine revealed altered white and red pulp anatomy and an increase in CD3+ T cells. Onset of status epilepticus (SE) and mortality were significantly decreased in perforin-deficient mice. Pilocarpine significantly increased spleen NK 1.1 and CD8+ cell percentage; in contrast, the brain inflammatory cell profile remained unchanged at the time of pilocarpine SE. BBB damage was reduced in the perforin-deficient pilocarpine-treated mice. Significance: Immunosuppressant maneuvers such as splenectomy or lack of perforin decrease the onset or the severity of pilocarpine SE. Our results suggest that cytotoxic lymphocytes, and specifically the cytolytic factor perforin, may be key molecular players involved in the axis between peripheral intravascular inflammation and seizures.

Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses reported age-related deficits in the amplitude of an early positive-negative working memory (PNwm) component as well as changes in working memory (WM)-load related brain oscillations during the successful performance of the n-back task. To explore the age-related differences of EEG activation in the face of increasing WM demands, we assessed the PNwm component area, parietal alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) as well as frontal theta ERS in 32 young and 32 elderly healthy individuals who successfully performed a highly WM demanding 3-back task. PNwm area increased with higher memory loads (3- and 2-back > 0-back tasks) in younger subjects. Older subjects reached the maximal values for this EEG parameter during the less WM demanding 0-back task. They showed a rapid development of an alpha ERS that reached its maximal amplitude at around 800 ms after stimulus onset. In younger subjects, the late alpha ERS occurred between 1,200 and 2,000 ms and its amplitude was significantly higher compared with elders. Frontal theta ERS culmination peak decreased in a task-independent manner in older compared with younger cases. Only in younger individuals, there was a significant decrease in the phasic frontal theta ERS amplitude in the 2- and 3-back tasks compared with the detection and 0-back tasks. These observations suggest that older adults display a rapid mobilization of their neural generators within the parietal cortex to manage very low demanding WM tasks. Moreover, they are less able to activate frontal theta generators during attentional tasks compared with younger persons.

A simple answer to this question is not possible. There are specific situations where surgery is commonly performed without clear EEG ictal localization, and other situations where electrical localization is mandatory. However, opinions differ in many other situations. What are the core issues for determining when EEG localization is necessary? Neuroimaging is imperfect. It does not always accurately identify the site of seizure origination, because seizures do not always arise from visible structural lesions. EEG localization is also imperfect, as well as expensive and time consuming. Sometimes the site of origin is not identified, or a region of spread is misidentified as site of origin. False localization and lateralization can occur. Finally, epilepsy surgery is imperfect. It can produce life-changing results, but it carries risk, and surgical failure is not rare. The limitations of these methods, and the high stakes of epilepsy surgery imply that we should be very cautious to omit EEG studies. The desire to improve access to epilepsy surgery, and to minimize the expense and risk from inpatient EEG studies, must be weighed against the possibility of an ineffective resection. To improve outcomes, improvements in both neuroimaging and EEG techniques are needed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We explore the presence and significance of ictal FA on scalp video EEG seizures (EEG Sz) recorded in neonates. Methodology: Forty two babies had 159 EEG Szs. The seizures were analysed for ictal FA, using a low frequency filter of 30 Hz. We explored the relationship of ictal FA to the occurrence of electroclinical and electrographic seizures, the use of phenobarbitone and to neurodevelopmental outcomes. Results: Ictal FA occurred in 62 (39%) of the 159 EEG Szs. In the 62 seizures with ictal FA, 34 (55%) were electroclinical seizures (ECSz) and 28 (45%) were electrographic (ESz). In the remaining 97 seizures without ictal FA, 27 (28%) were ECSz and 70 (72%) ESz. There was a significant correlation (p=0.0006) between ictal FA and electroclinical seizures. There was no relationship between phenobarbitone and presence of ictal FA. There was no significant difference in the background EEG, neuroimaging abnormalities, neurodevelopmental impairment or post neonatal seizures between those with and without ictal FA. Conclusions: Ictal FA is highly correlated to the occurrence of clinical features during an EEG seizure. The presence of ictal FA does not appear to influence neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Participants were required to generate original uses of conventional objects (Alternative Uses task, AU) while the EEG was recorded. In the cognitive stimulation condition, participants worked on the AU task subsequent to the exposure to other people's ideas. In the affective stimulation condition, they had to think creatively in positive affective states, induced via emotionally contagious sound clips. Creative cognition generally elicited alpha synchronization, most prominent in the prefrontal cortex and in the right hemisphere. The interventions were associated with stronger prefrontal alpha activity in the upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) than the control condition (no intervention), possibly indicating a state of heightened internal awareness, which might have a beneficial impact on creativity.

Sixty children, aged 4 to 12 years, participated. Hospital records were reviewed, and sleep histories were obtained by interviewing the parents. EEGs of 39 subjects were normal, showed epileptiform activity, and/or mild to moderate background dysrhythmia. Severe unilateral dysrhythmia was noted in 6 and bilaterally in 15 EEGs, with all 15 children having profound neurodevelopmental disabilities and 14 of these 15 having long-standing severe chaotic sleep/wake patterns. Thus, there was a highly significant association between EEG evidence of severe bilateral dysrhythmia and chronic sleep/wake dysregulation. Unilateral dysrhythmia was not associated with sleep difficulties. This study delineates a specific sleep disorder in a group of children with marked neurodevelopmental disabilities and offers insight into how disturbed cerebral connectivity impacts the thalamocortical dynamics relating to neurodevelopmental disabilities, sleep, and melatonin production.

The effect of contact size (in the clinical range: 1-10 mm(2)) on HFO detection has not been determined. This study assesses the feasibility of HFO detection in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts and clinical amplifiers, and the effect of contact size on HFO detection within the macrocontact range. Methods: Eight epileptic rats were implanted with intracerebral electrodes containing three adjacent contacts of different sizes (0.02, 0.05 and 0.09 mm(2)). HFOs were manually marked on 5 min interictal EEG segments. HFO rates and durations were compared between the different contacts. Results: 10,966 ripples and 1475 fast ripples were identified in the recordings from 30 contacts. There were no significant differences in spike or HFO rates between the different contact sizes, nor was there a significant difference in HFO duration. Conclusions: HFOs can be detected in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts. Within the studied range, size did not significantly influence HFO detection. Significance: Using comparative anatomy of rat and human limbic structures, these findings suggest that reducing the size of macrocontacts (compared to those commercially available) would not improve HFO detection rates.

Previous studies investigating the effects of top-down factors on stimulus encoding revealed similar modulation of late ERPs and alpha-band desynchronization (alpha-ERD) by relevant target stimuli. Focusing on the bottom-up effects of emotional content and picture size, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship of the late positive potential (LPP) and alpha-ERD during the viewing of emotional pictures. Results showed similar affective modulation by picture arousal of the LPP and alpha-ERD. Moreover, picture size reduction diminished overall magnitude of both responses, but did not dampen affective modulation of either response. These results suggest that, during affective picture viewing, these two brain responses similarly reflect the engagement of motivational systems in order to facilitate perception.

In a computational study in generic networks of phase oscillators and bursting neurons, however, we show that this common belief may be wrong if the neuronal population receives an external rhythmic input. The latter may stem from another neuronal population or an external, e.g., sensory or electrical, source. In that case the population field potential may be entrained by the rhythmic input, whereas the individual neurons are phase desynchronized both mutually and with their field potential. Intriguingly, the corresponding large-amplitude oscillations of the population mean field are generated by pairwise desynchronized neurons oscillating at frequencies shifted far away from the frequency of the macroscopic field potential.

Trial-to-trial noise cancellation of cortical field potentials in awake macaques by autoregression model with exogenous input (ARX)	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Awake macaque; Local field potential; Gamma band; Autoregression model with exogenous input (ARX); Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC); Wavelet transform	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; POWER; EEG; MANIFESTATION; OSCILLATIONS; REDUCTION; TRANSFORM; FREQUENCY	Gamma band synchronization has drawn increasing interest with respect to its potential role in neuronal encoding strategy and behavior in awake, behaving animals. However, contamination of these recordings by power line noise can confound the analysis and interpretation of cortical local field potential (LFP). Existing denoising methods are plagued by inadequate noise reduction, inaccuracies, and even introduction of new noise components. To carefully and more completely remove such contamination, we propose an automatic method based on the concept of adaptive noise cancellation that utilizes the correlative features of common noise sources, and implement with AutoRegressive model with exogenous Input (ARX). We apply this technique to both simulated data and LFPs recorded in the primary visual cortex of awake macaque monkeys. The analyses here demonstrate a greater degree of accurate noise removal than conventional notch filters. Our method leaves desired signal intact and does not introduce artificial noise components. Application of this method to awake monkey V1 recordings reveals a significant power increase in the gamma range evoked by visual stimulation. Our findings suggest that the ARX denoising procedure will be an important pre-processing step in the analysis of large volumes of cortical LFP data as well as high frequency (gamma-band related) electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) applications, one which will help to convincingly dissociate this notorious artifact from gamma-band activity.

In this study, we investigated heart rate intervals, arterial blood pressure (BP), and prefrontal oxyhemoglobin changes during 5 min rest and during brisk finger movements in 19 healthy subjects. We analyzed the phase coupling around 0.1 Hz between cardiovascular and (de) oxyhemoglobin oscillations, using the cross-spectral method. The analyses revealed phase shifts for slow oscillations in BP and heart rate intervals between - 10 degrees and - 118 degrees (BP always leading). These phase shifts increased significantly (p < 0.01) in the movement session. The coupling between cardiovascular and oxyhemoglobin oscillations was less clear. Only 12 subjects demonstrated a phase coupling (COH2 >= 0.5) between oxyhemoglobin and BP oscillations. This may be explained by an overwhelming proportion of nonlinearity in cardiovascular and hemodynamic systems. The phase shifts between slow cardiovascular and hemodynamic oscillations are relatively stable subject-specific biometric features and could be of interest for person identification in addition to other biometric data. Slow BP-coupled oscillations in prefrontal oxyhemoglobin changes can seriously impair the detection of mentally induced hemodynamic changes in an optical brain-computer interface, a novel nonmuscular communication system.

Phase-Locked Alpha Oscillations Evoked by Illusory Contour Perception in Boys with Autism	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						evoked alpha oscillations; EEG; Kanizsa; perception of illusion; contour completion; perceptual grouping	REGIONS; CORTEX	We examined temporal dynamics of EEG phase-locked alpha oscillations during perception of illusory (Kanizsa square) and non-illusory images in boys with autism and age-matched typically developing boys. In typically developing boys the illusory contour (IC) as compared to the control stimulus provoked an increased alpha response at the parietal scalp areas. This IC effect demonstrated continuity within the time window of 133-267 ms after the stimulus onset. Although boys with autism did not display this effect at the group level, part of the sample showed an atypical two-stage pattern of illusory contour effect. The first early stage of IC effect (50-133 ms) was pronounced at the midline occipital electrode localized in the vicinity of the primary visual cortex. The localization and the early onset time suggest that this early IC effect is related to abnormally enhanced "low-level" locally-oriented processes of contour completion in autism. The second stage of IC effect (267-400 ms) was observed at the left parietal region only, and was delayed comparatively to that in healthy boys, suggesting the deficit of "intermediate" processes of perceptual grouping linked to the higher-order visual areas.

By selectively breeding mice for high (HR), intermediate (IR), or low (LR) reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortical (HPA) axis, we recently established a new genetic animal model of extremes in stress reactivity (SR). Studies characterizing this SR mouse model on the behavioral, endocrine, and neurobiological levels revealed several similarities with key endophenotypes observed in MD patients. HR mice were shown to have changes in rhythmicity and sleep measures such as rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REM sleep (NREMS) as well as in slow wave activity, indicative of reduced sleep efficacy and increased REMS. In the present study we were interested in how far a detailed spectral analysis of several electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters, including relevant frequency bands, could reveal further alterations of sleep architecture in this animal model. Eight adult males of each of the three breeding lines were equipped with epidural EEG and intramuscular electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. After recovery, EEG and EMG recordings were performed for two days. Results: Differences in the amount of REMS and wakefulness and in the number of transitions between vigilance states were found in HR mice, when compared with IR and LR animals. Increased frequencies of transitions from NREMS to REMS and from REMS to wakefulness in HR animals were robust across the light-dark cycle. Detailed statistical analyses of spectral EEG parameters showed that especially during NREMS the power of the theta (6-9 Hz), alpha (10-15 Hz) and eta (16-22.75 Hz) bands was significantly different between the three breeding lines. Well defined distributions of significant power differences could be assigned to different times during the light and the dark phase. Especially during NREMS, group differences were robust and could be continuously monitored across the light-dark cycle. Conclusions: The HR mice, i.e. those animals that have a genetic predisposition to hyper-activating their HPA axis in response to stressors, showed disturbed patterns in sleep architecture, similar to what is known from depressed patients. Significant alterations in several frequency bands of the EEG, which also seem to at least partly mimic clinical observations, suggest the SR mouse lines as a promising animal model for basic research of mechanisms underlying sleep impairments in MD.

This approach is based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and band power (BP). The EMD method is a data-driven technique to analyze non-stationary and nonlinear signals. It generates a set of stationary time series called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) to represent the original data. These IMFs are analyzed with the power spectral density (PSD) to study the active frequency range correspond to the motor imagery for each subject. Then, the band power is computed within a certain frequency range in the channels. Finally, the data is reconstructed with only the specific IMFs and then the band power is employed on the new database. The classification of motor imagery was performed by using two classifiers, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The results obtained show that the EMD method allows the most reliable features to be extracted from EEG and that the classification rate obtained is higher and better than using only the direct BP approach.

The behaviours of the eye movement signal is described using wavelet method and combined with the energy distribution features. The features are derived from EOG signals of four type eye movement and recorded using the EEG Data Acquisition System Neurofax EEG-9200. The electrodes were attached to the subjects on the forehead and below the eye. The data is acquired from 15 subjects in a quiet room, in which the recorded data is composed by four different eye movements that are upward, downward, towards to left and towards to right. Wavelet scalogram algorithm is used as the tool because of its capable to distribute the EOG signals energy of eye movement with the change of time and frequency. From the results, it indicated that the energy distribution of EOG signals exhibit different patterns in their corresponding movements as follow: level 6 (8-16 Hz) for left eye movement; level 7 (4-8 Hz) for upward; level 8 (2-4 Hz) for right and level 9 (1-2 Hz) for downward.

Auditory Event-Related Response in Visual Cortex Modulates Subsequent Visual Responses in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; PHASE-RESET; EEG; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; BINDING	Growing evidence from electrophysiological data in animal and human studies suggests that multisensory interaction is not exclusively a higher-order process, but also takes place in primary sensory cortices. Such early multisensory interaction is thought to be mediated by means of phase resetting. The presentation of a stimulus to one sensory modality resets the phase of ongoing oscillations in another modality such that processing in the latter modality is modulated. In humans, evidence for such a mechanism is still sparse. In the current study, the influence of an auditory stimulus on visual processing was investigated by measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral responses of humans to visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimulation with varying stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). We observed three distinct oscillatory EEG responses in our data. An initial gamma-band response around 50 Hz was followed by a beta-band response around 25 Hz, and a theta response around 6 Hz. The latter was enhanced in response to cross-modal stimuli as compared to either unimodal stimuli. Interestingly, the beta response to unimodal auditory stimuli was dominant in electrodes over visual areas. The SOA between auditory and visual stimuli-albeit not consciously perceived-had a modulatory impact on the multisensory evoked beta-band responses; i.e., the amplitude depended on SOA in a sinusoidal fashion, suggesting a phase reset. These findings further support the notion that parameters of brain oscillations such as amplitude and phase are essential predictors of subsequent brain responses and might be one of the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration.

Such rhythms can entrain multiple neurons into coherent patterns of activity, consistent with a role in behaviour, cognition and memory formation. Recent evidence suggests that locally generated fast network oscillations can be systematically aligned to long-range slow oscillations. It is likely that such cross-frequency coupling supports specific tasks including behavioural choice and working memory. Principal Findings: We analyzed temporal coupling between high-frequency oscillations and EEG theta activity (4-12 Hz) in recordings from mouse parietal neocortex. Theta was exclusively present during active wakefulness and REM-sleep. Fast oscillations occurred in two separate frequency bands: gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz). Theta, gamma and fast gamma were more prominent during active wakefulness as compared to REM-sleep. Coupling between theta and the two types of fast oscillations, however, was more pronounced during REM-sleep. This state-dependent cross-frequency coupling was particularly strong for theta-fast gamma interaction which increased 9-fold during REM as compared to active wakefulness. Theta-gamma coupling increased only by 1.5-fold. Significance: State-dependent cross-frequency-coupling provides a new functional characteristic of REM-sleep and establishes a unique property of neocortical fast gamma oscillations. Interactions between defined patterns of slow and fast network oscillations may serve selective functions in sleep-dependent information processing.

The generation of neural activity in the gamma-band was shown to be critically related to a glutamatergic and GABAergic microcircuit which is also known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recently, a reduction of the early auditory evoked gamma-band response (eGBR) in schizophrenic patients was reported. In order to investigate the possible applicability of this neurophysiological marker as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, this is the main question of our investigation: Is the early eGBR decreased regarding evoked power and phase locking in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia? Methods: We investigated the early eGBR in 17 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in age-, gender- and education-matched groups of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls using an auditory reaction task. Results: First-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenic patients showed a significant reduction of evoked power and phase locking of the early eGBR compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: This study shows significantly reduced evoked power and phase locking of the early auditory eGBR in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia pointing to the applicability of this marker as a heritable intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. The findings are in line with the hypothesis of a disturbed GABAergic interneural modulation of pyramidal cells in schizophrenia and findings of different schizophrenia risk genes associated with transmission at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses.

The mechanism of MN involved in the perception of musical structures is seen as a means for cueing the learner on 'known' factors that can be used for his/her knowledge scaffolding. To explore such relationships, EEG recordings, and especially the Mu-rhythm in the premotor cortex that relates to the activation of MN, were acquired and explored. Three experiments were designed to provide the auditory and visual stimuli to a group of subjects, including both musicians and non-musicians. The acquired signals, after appropriate averaging in the time domain, were analyzed in frequency and bifrequency domains, using spectral and bispectral analysis, respectively. Experimental results have shown that an intention - related activity shown in musicians could be associated with Mu - rhythm suppression. Moreover, an underlying ongoing function appearing in the transition from heard sound to imagined sound could be revealed in the bispectrum domain. A Mu-rhythm modulation provoked by the MNs could cause bispectral fluctuations, especially when visual stimulation is combined with an auditory one for the case of musicians. These results pave the way for further exploitation of the role of MNs in music and, in general, knowledge perception.

High-frequency EEG covaries with spike burst patterns detected in cortical neurons. J Neurophysiol 105: 2951-2959, 2011. First published April 13, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00327.2010.-Invasive microelectrode recordings measure neuronal spikes, which are commonly considered inaccessible through standard surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Yet high-frequency EEG potentials (hf-EEG, f > 400 Hz) found in somatosensory evoked potentials of primates may reflect the mean population spike responses of coactivated cortical neurons. Since cortical responses to electrical nerve stimulation vary strongly from trial to trial, we investigated whether the hf-EEG signal can also echo single-trial variability observed at the single-unit level. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of behaving macaque monkeys and identified variable spike burst responses following peripheral stimulation. Each of these responses was classified according to the timing of its spike constituents, conforming to one of a discrete set of spike patterns. We here show that these spike patterns are accompanied by variations in the concomitant epidural hf-EEG. These variations cannot be explained by fluctuating stimulus efficacy, suggesting that they were generated within the thalamocortical network. As high-frequency EEG signals can also be reliably recorded from the scalp of human subjects, they may provide a noninvasive window on fluctuating cortical spike activity in humans.

Neurofeedback training of the upper alpha frequency band in EEG improves cognitive performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; EEG; Upper alpha; Trainability; Cognitive performance; Mental rotation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; DISORDERS; ATTENTION	In this study, the individually determined upper alpha frequency band in EEG (electroencephalogram) was investigated as a neurofeedback parameter. Fourteen subjects were trained on five sessions within 1 week by means of feedback dependent on the current upper alpha amplitude. On the first and fifth session, cognitive ability was tested by a mental rotation test. As a result, eleven of the fourteen subjects showed significant training success. Individually determined upper alpha was increased independently of other frequency bands. The enhancement of cognitive performance was significantly larger for the neurofeedback group than for a control group who did not receive feedback. Thus, enhanced cognitive control went along with an increased upper alpha amplitude that was found in the neurofeedback group only. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the experimental procedure, each subject is asked to undertake three different sessions: offline training, an online feedback test, and real-time control of a humanoid robot in an indoor maze. During the offline training session, amplitude features from the EEG are extracted using auto-regressive frequency analysis with a Laplacian filter. The optimal feature components are selected by using the Fisher ratio and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) distance metric. Two classifiers are hierarchically set to build the asynchronous BCI system. During the online test session, the trained BCI system translates a subject's ongoing EEG into four mental states: rest, left-hand imagery, right-hand imagery, and foot imagery. Event-by-event analysis is applied to evaluate the performance of the BCI system. If the test performance is consistently satisfactory, the subject executes the real-time control experiments. During the navigation experiments, the subject controls the robot in an indoor maze using the BCI system while surveying the environment through visual feedback. The results show that BCI control was comparable to manual control with a performance ratio of 81%. The evaluation of the results validates the feasibility and power of the proposed system.

J	Jancke, L; Langer, N				Jaencke, Lutz; Langer, Nicolas			A strong parietal hub in the small-world network of coloured-hearing synaesthetes during resting state EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; DISTURBED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHASE-LOCKING; TIME-COURSE; NEUROCOGNITIVE MECHANISMS	We investigated whether functional brain networks are different in coloured-hearing synaesthetes compared with non-synaesthetes. Based on resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, graph-theoretical analysis was applied to functional connectivity data obtained from different frequency bands (theta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta) of 12 coloured-hearing synaesthetes and 13 non-synaesthetes. The analysis of functional connectivity was based on estimated intra-cerebral sources of brain activation using standardized low-resolution electrical tomography. These intra-cerebral sources of brain activity were subjected to graph-theoretical analysis yielding measures representing small-world network characteristics (cluster coefficients and path length). In addition, brain regions with strong interconnections were identified (so-called hubs), and the interconnectedness of these hubs were quantified using degree as a measure of connectedness. Our analysis was guided by the two-stage model proposed by Hubbard and Ramachandran (2005). In this model, the parietal lobe is thought to play a pivotal role in binding together the synaesthetic perceptions (hyperbinding). In addition, we hypothesized that the auditory cortex and the fusiform gyrus would qualify as strong hubs in synaesthetes. Although synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes demonstrated a similar small-world network topology, the parietal lobe turned out to be a stronger hub in synaesthetes than in non-synaesthetes supporting the two-stage model. The auditory cortex was also identified as a strong hub in these coloured-hearing synaesthetes (for the alpha2 band). Thus, our a priori hypotheses receive strong support. Several additional hubs (for which no a priori hypothesis has been formulated) were found to be different in terms of the degree measure in synaesthetes, with synaesthetes demonstrating stronger degree measures indicating stronger interconnectedness. These hubs were found in brain areas known to be involved in controlling memory processes (alpha1: hippocampus and retrosplenial area), executive functions (alpha1 and alpha2: ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; theta: inferior frontal cortex), and the generation of perceptions (theta: extrastriate cortex; beta: subcentral area). Taken together this graph-theoretical analysis of the resting state EEG supports the two-stage model in demonstrating that the left-sided parietal lobe is a strong hub region, which is stronger functionally interconnected in synaesthetes than in non-synaesthetes. The right-sided auditory cortex is also a strong hub supporting the idea that coloured-hearing synaesthetes demonstrate a specific auditory cortex. A further important point is that these hub regions are even differently operating at rest supporting the idea that these hub characteristics are predetermining factors of coloured-hearing synaesthesia.

The current work is based on a dataset that has been acquired in the context of a previous study, which has already been published (Beeli et al., 2008). However, the analysis presented here is based on EEG data obtained in the resting conditions. These EEG data have not been used in the previous paper. In addition, the current manuscript uses a different theoretical and methodological approach, which allows it to reach conclusions beyond what has previously been published. In addition, we thank Drs. Juergen Haenggi and Roberto Pascual-Marqui for insightful and helpful discussion about synaesthesia, EEG analysis, and graph-theoretical data analysis. We also thank Marcus Cheetham for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

Modulations in the Oscillatory Activity of the Globus Pallidus internus neurons during a Behavioral Task-A Point Process Analysis	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION/SYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; DISCHARGE; MOVEMENTS; CORTEX; EEG	The behavioral state of a subject is hypothesized to be reflected in the oscillatory modulations of the spiking activity of certain groups of neurons. In particular, the beta-and gamma-bands have been experimentally shown to be related to movement in the motor cortex and parts of the basal ganglia. Here, we analyze the relationship between directional tuning and oscillations in the beta-and gamma-bands of the neurons in the Globus Pallidus internus (GPi) of two healthy nonhuman primates during a radial center-out motor task. We find that, during the planning stages of the movement, the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying gamma oscillations increases when compared to the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying beta oscillations. A similar trend is not seen in non-directionally tuned neurons. This suggests that the GPi neurons involved in the planning of movement communicate information using an emergence of oscillations in the gamma-band.

In this study, a two-kinetics lumped-parameter neural mass model is extended to a multi-kinetics and multi-channel coupled model. This new model can effectively simulate the coupled dynamics activities between different areas in the brain. The simulation results show that the proposed model can generate neural signals with various frequency bands, from delta wave (1-4 Hz) to gamma wave (30-70 Hz), and the dynamics of the simulated neural signals is more complicated. The simulation analysis can also reveal the relationship between the coupled neural networks and the rhythm of neural populations, and the simulated neural signals can present the bi-modal and uni-modal phenomenon in the frequency domain when the coupling strength of models increases. Finally, analysis of an epileptic EEG signal from a rat demonstrates that the coupling among the neural populations can induce a large-scale seizure.

It is in this context that the term "BrainModes" was adopted to explore how cooperative phenomena (or 'modes' of activity) occurring at one spatial or temporal scale give rise to coherent structures at other scales. This Special Issue reports the 2009 BrainModes Workshop, held in Bristol (December 2009) which focussed on the fusion of theoretical, computational, experimental and clinical methods for enhancing our understanding of the role played by neuronal oscillations in healthy and diseased brain states.

The present study used EEG recordings to evaluate global synchronization and network organization of rhythmic activity during the encoding and recognition phases of an episodic memory task varying in stimulus type (kaleidoscope images, pictures, words, and pseudowords). Synchronization of oscillatory activity was assessed using a linear and nonlinear connectivity estimator and network analyses were performed using algorithms derived from graph theory. Twenty five MTBI patients (tested within days post-injury) and healthy volunteers were closely matched on demographic variables, verbal ability, psychological status variables, as well as on overall task performance. Patients demonstrated sub-optimal network organization, as reflected by changes in graph parameters in the theta and alpha bands during both encoding and recognition. There were no group differences in spectral energy during task performance or on network parameters during a control condition (rest). Evidence of less optimally organized functional networks during memory tasks was more prominent for pictorial than for verbal stimuli. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The emotional state varied between groups using diazepam, buspirone, and placebo. The University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist was used for the assessment of emotional state in the drug condition, yielding three estimates of emotional state: Energetic Arousal, Tension Arousal, and Hedonic Tone. These measures were correlated with the Synchronization Likelihood index of the resting EEG. Increased affective valence and arousal were related to an increased level of synchronization between frontal and right temporoparietal emotional areas. Two identified centers of synchronization, localized in the temporal and centroparietal regions, appeared to be functionally distinct. Stable relationships between subjective emotional state measures and cortical EEG synchronization patterns were confirmed, especially for the valence and energetic arousal estimation. A higher synchronization is associated with increased emotional valence and arousal, and this can thus be seen as a neural correlate of emotional experiences.

The new perspective used in this article consists in releasing the widely accepted hypothesis stating that motor tasks-related brain activities should have similar time course across trials. This work proposes a learning model that takes into account two previously unconsidered sources of variability. First, the time course of the subject's brain activity, while performing a motor imagery task, will be considered as a trial-dependent variable. This means that the optimal time, defined as an amount of time after the trial cue, chosen to determine the task performed by the subject might be different between distinct trials. The second released hypothesis deals with the spectral discriminative brain response. Although usual learning methods do not allow any dependency between the optimal discriminative time and frequency bands, our model takes into account this possible source of variability. Therefore, the brain response in distinct frequency bands, e. g., in the mu band or beta band, could be used by the decision function at distinct instants. Based on this underlying enhanced model, we propose a two-step procedure. In the first step, the algorithm carefully analyzes, using cross-validation techniques, the training data to identify previously mentioned sources of variability. In the second step, the enhanced frequency-dependent linear spatial filters and the classification function are determined. As by-products of this analysis, substantial piece of knowledge about motor imagery is provided. First, the method allows the identification and quantification of labeling noise in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery. Second, the algorithm gives a comparative estimation of the spectral time courses during motor imagery. This article makes an extensive use of the dataset I of BCI Competition IV, which took place in 2008. It consists of a training set and a test set of 59 EEG signals recording on four subjects while performing an asynchronous BCI experiment. The two-step procedure presented in this article is shown to significantly outperform a comparative naive approach. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nitrous Oxide Paradoxically Modulates Slow Electroencephalogram Oscillations: Implications for Anesthesia Monitoring	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							EEG; INDEX; CONVULSIONS; SEVOFLURANE; ANTAGONIST; INDUCTION; PROPOFOL; ENTROPY	BACKGROUND: Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the oldest analgesics/adjuvant agents still in use today; however, its effects on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) remain unclear. It has been proposed that N2O may enhance higher-frequency EEG activity (often indicative of alert states and cognition) duration sedation. This possibly paradoxical effect has been used to explain the failure of many EEG monitors to capture the effects of N2O on patient state during anesthesia. To better understand the poor efficacy of current EEG approaches to monitoring N2O action, we quantitatively studied the sole effect of N2O on the resting EEG in healthy volunteers using multichannel EEG recordings under noise-minimized laboratory conditions. METHODS: Healthy male volunteers were administered 20% (n = 10), 40% (n = 10), or 60% (n = 5) inspired N2O mixed with oxygen during noise-shielded EEG recordings. N2O was administered over a 20-minute period involving a 5-minute equilibration period and 5-minute washout. EEG spectral edge frequency (95%), median power frequency, total power, and band-limited power (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were used as quantitative EEG parameters. The changes in these EEG parameters were quantified throughout N2O inhalation and compared between predrug baseline, peak drug effect, and washout. RESULTS: Quantification of changes in spectral power during N2O inhalation showed only minor changes in estimates of spectral edge and median power frequency, whereas significant reductions in total power were observed at frontal sites during peak gas effect (P = 0.001; mean reduction [95% confidence interval]: 41.90 mu V-2 [18.19-65.61 mu V-2]) that rebounded during N2O washout. Such changes in total power were driven by shifts in low-frequency power (delta/theta), which were most elevated at frontal sites. CONCLUSION: Rather than directly enhancing high-frequency EEG power (beta or gamma bands), N2O seems to preserve the awake features of resting EEG (alpha band) and suppress power in those bands in which increases are typically associated with sedation/hypnosis (delta and theta). These data suggest that N2O's suppression of low-frequency EEG power may help to explain previously reported difficulties in attempting to monitor patient state with the EEG during anesthesia involving N2O. Because increases in low-frequency power typically indicate increasing anesthesia, N2O's suppression of such activity and its rebound during washout would paradoxically influence EEG monitoring parameters. Therefore, correcting for such effects is expected to improve future monitoring methods. (Anesth Analg 2011;113:758-65)	[Foster, Brett L.; Liley, David T.

Evidence of disrupted functional connectivity in the brain after combat-related blast injury	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDUCED NEUROTRAUMA; MILITARY TBI; EEG; CONCUSSION; MECHANISMS; IRAQ; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; AFGHANISTAN; MANAGEMENT; SYMPTOMS	Non-impact blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) appears to be present in soldiers returning from deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. Although mTBI typically results in cognitive deficits that last less than a month, there is evidence that disrupted coordination of brain activity can persist for at least several months following injury (Thatcher et al., 1989, 2001). In the present study we examined whether neural communication may be affected in soldiers months after blast-related mTBI, and whether coordination of neural function is associated with underlying white matter integrity. The investigation included an application of a new time-frequency based method for measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) phase synchronization (Aviyente et al., 2010) as well as fractional anisotropy measures of axonal tracts derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nine soldiers who incurred a blast-related mTBI during deployments to Afghanistan or Iraq were compared with eight demographically similar control subjects. Despite an absence of cognitive deficits, the blast-related mTBI group exhibited diminished EEG phase synchrony of lateral frontal sites with contralateral frontal brain regions suggesting diminished interhemispheric coordination of brain activity as a result of blast injury. For blast injured (i.e., blast-related mTBI) soldiers we found that EEG phase synchrony was associated with the structural integrity of white matter tracts of the frontal lobe (left anterior thalamic radiations and the forceps minor including the anterior corpus callosum). Analyses revealed that diminished EEG phase synchrony was not the consequence of combat-stress symptoms (e. g., post-traumatic stress and depression) and commonly prescribed medications. Results provide evidence for poor coordination of frontal neural function after blast injury that may be the consequence of damaged anterior white matter tracts. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The studies presented here underscore the strong dependence on the ongoing brain activity of the induced effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral measures. The reviewed data on the effect of applied electric currents on brain electric activity and behavior boost the reemerging concept that endogenous oscillating fields are per se of physiologic and functional significance. Applying weak electric currents is a promising approach for investigating different cortical EEG rhythms and their immediate interactions and functional implications for behavior.

Recently, there has been increased interest in higher frequency components of clinical IEEG recordings and their potential relationship to epileptogenic brain tissue. We employ a previously validated, automated discrete gamma oscillation (GO) detection algorithm to determine the prevalence of discrete gamma events over prolonged, representative segments of IEEG recorded from ten patients. Approximately 8 h of IEEG, 16 randomly selected 30-min segments of continuous interictal IEEG per patient, were analyzed. The electrodes within the seizure onset zone were found to have significantly higher mean GO activity averaged across these 16 segments in five of the ten patients. There was observed variability between individual 30-min segments in these patients, indicating that longer recordings of interictal activity improved localization. Our data suggest this method of automated GO detection across long periods may be useful in planning epilepsy surgery in certain children with intractable epilepsy. Further research is required to help determine which patients would benefit from this technique.

This study aims to conduct an exploratory analysis of the effects of 10 and 50 mg of MK-0249, a novel histamine subtype-3 receptor inverse agonist, and 200 mg of modafinil, a presumed dopaminergic compound, on EEG power spectra during sleep deprivation and subsequent recovery sleep. A total of 25 healthy men were recruited to a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design. EEG power spectra, an electrophysiological marker of changes in sleepiness and vigilance, were obtained at the beginning of wake maintenance tests at two-hourly intervals throughout a night and day of sleep deprivation, which is an established model of excessive sleepiness. After placebo, sleep deprivation was associated with enhancements in delta and theta and reductions in alpha and beta activity. Following dosing at 02:00 h, MK-0249 and modafinil reduced delta and theta activity and enhanced alpha and beta activity, compared to placebo. During recovery sleep initiated at 21:00 h, latency to sleep onset and number of awakenings were not different from placebo for any of the active treatments. Wake after sleep onset and stage 1% was increased and total sleep time, SWS% and REM% were reduced after both doses of MK-0249. Compared to placebo, MK-0249, the 50-mg dose in particular, reduced activity in some delta and theta/alpha frequencies and enhanced beta activity during NREM sleep and REM sleep. After modafinil, no changes were observed for power spectra during sleep. Both MK-0249 and modafinil exert effects on the EEG which are consistent with wake promotion.

Alterations in gamma band oscillations have attracted a great deal of interest as they appear to represent a pathophysiological process of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. Gamma band oscillations reflect local cortical activities, and the synchronization of these activities among spatially distributed cortical areas has been suggested to play a central role in the formation of networks. To assess global coordination across spatially distributed brain regions, Omega complexity (DC) in multichannel EEG was proposed. Using DC, we investigated global coordination of resting-state EEG activities in both gamma (30-50 Hz) and below-gamma (1.5-30 Hz) bands in drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and investigated the effects of neuroleptic treatment. We found that gamma band OC was significantly higher in drug-naive patients with schizophrenia compared to control subjects and that a right frontal electrode (F3) contributed significantly to the higher OC. After neuroleptic treatment, reductions in the contribution of frontal electrodes to global OC in both bands correlated with the improvement of schizophrenia symptomatology. The present study suggests that frontal brain processes in schizophrenia were less coordinated with activity in the remaining brain. In addition, beneficial effects of neuroleptic treatment were accompanied by improvement of brain coordination predominantly due to changes in frontal regions. Our study provides new evidence of improper intrinsic brain integration in schizophrenia by investigating the resting-state gamma band activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Effects of Nicotine Replacement on Cognitive Brain Activity During Smoking Withdrawal Studied with Simultaneous fMRI/EEG	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						nicotine; cognitive impairment; smoking; addiction; fMRI; EEG	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; ABSTINENCE; RESPONSES	Impaired attention ('difficulty concentrating') is a cognitive symptom of nicotine withdrawal that may be an important contributor to smoking relapse. However, the neurobiological basis of this effect and the potentially beneficial effects of nicotine replacement therapy both remain unclear. We used functional MRI with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to define brain activity correlates of cognitive impairment with short-term smoking cessation in habitual smokers and the effects of nicotine replacement. We found that irrespective of treatment (ie nicotine or placebo) EEG a power was negatively correlated with increased activation during performance of a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) task in dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, parietal, and insular cortices, as well as, caudate, and thalamus. Relative to placebo, nicotine replacement further increased the alpha-correlated activation across these regions. We also found that EEG a power was negatively correlated with RVIP-induced deactivation in regions comprising the 'default mode' network (ie angular gyrus, cuneus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These alpha-correlated deactivations were further reduced by nicotine. These findings confirm that effects of nicotine on cognition during short-term smoking cessation occur with modulation of neuronal sources common to the generation of both the blood oxygen-level-dependent and a EEG signals. Our observations thus demonstrate that nicotine replacement in smokers has direct pharmacological effects on brain neuronal activity modulating cognitive networks.

J	Smart, O; Tsoulos, IG; Gavrilis, D; Georgoulas, G				Smart, Otis; Tsoulos, Ioannis G.; Gavrilis, Dimitris; Georgoulas, George			Grammatical evolution for features of epileptic oscillations in clinical intracranial electroencephalograms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Grammatical evolution; Detector; Epileptic oscillations; Intracranial EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; 80-500 HZ; INDICATOR; SPIKES	This paper presents grammatical evolution (GE) as an approach to select and combine features for detecting epileptic oscillations within clinical intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings of patients with epilepsy. Clinical iEEG is used in preoperative evaluations of a patient who may have surgery to treat epileptic seizures. Literature suggests that pathological oscillations may indicate the region(s) of brain that cause epileptic seizures, which could be surgically removed for therapy. If this presumption is true, then the effectiveness of surgical treatment could depend on the effectiveness in pinpointing critically diseased brain, which in turn depends on the most accurate detection of pathological oscillations. Moreover, the accuracy of detecting pathological oscillations depends greatly on the selected feature(s) that must objectively distinguish epileptic events from average activity, a task that visual review is inevitably too subjective and insufficient to resolve. Consequently, this work suggests an automated algorithm that incorporates grammatical evolution (GE) to construct the most sufficient feature(s) to detect epileptic oscillations within the iEEG of a patient. We estimate the performance of GE relative to three alternative methods of selecting or combining features that distinguish an epileptic gamma (similar to 65-95 Hz) oscillation from normal activity: forward sequential feature-selection, backward sequential feature-selection, and genetic programming. We demonstrate that a detector with a grammatically evolved feature exhibits a sensitivity and selectivity that is comparable to a previous detector with a genetically programmed feature, making GE a useful alternative to designing detectors.

An electrophysiological study of task demands on concreteness effects: evidence for dual coding theory	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Imagery; N400; Semantic processing; Time-frequency analysis; Theta band; Alpha band; Delta band	THETA-POWER INCREASES; CONTEXT-AVAILABILITY; EEG; RETRIEVAL; WORDS; ATTENTION; KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN	We examined ERP responses during the generation of word associates or mental images in response to concrete and abstract concepts. Of interest were the predictions of dual coding theory (DCT), which proposes that processing lexical concepts depends on functionally independent but interconnected verbal and nonverbal systems. ERP responses were time-locked to either stimulus onset or response to compensate for potential latency differences across conditions. During word associate generation, but not mental imagery, concrete items elicited a greater N400 than abstract items. A concreteness effect emerged at a later time point during the mental imagery task. Data were also analyzed using time-frequency analysis that investigated synchronization of neuronal populations over time during processing. Concrete words elicited an enhanced late going desynchronization of theta-band power (723-938 ms post stimulus onset) during associate generation. During mental imagery, abstract items elicited greater delta-band power from 800 to 1,000 ms following stimulus onset, theta-band power from 350 to 205 ms before response, and alpha-band power from 900 to 800 ms before response. Overall, the findings support DCT in suggesting that lexical concepts are not amodal and that concreteness effects are modulated by tasks that focus participants on verbal versus nonverbal, imagery-based knowledge.

A single-subject analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Single-subject analysis; Non-parametric statistics; Own-name; Wavelet analysis; Alpha; DOC	ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; VEGETATIVE STATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CHRONIC DISORDERS; BRAIN RESPONSE; NOVELTY P3; EEG; ERP; SYNCHRONIZATION	In previous studies event-related potentials and oscillations in response to subject's own name have been analyzed extensively on group-level in healthy subjects and in patients with a disorder of consciousness. Subject's own name as a deviant produces a P3. With equiprobable stimuli, non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are smaller in response to subject's own name compared to other names or subject's own name backwards. However, little is known about replicability on a single-subject level. Seventeen healthy subjects were assessed in an own-name paradigm with equiprobable stimuli of subject's own name, another name, and subject's own name backwards. Event-related potentials and non-phase locked oscillations were analyzed with single-subject, non-parametric statistics. No consistent results were found either for ERPs or for the non-phase locked changes of oscillatory activities. Only 4 subjects showed a robust effect as expected, that is, a lower activity in the alpha-beta range to subject's own name compared to other conditions. Four subjects elicited a higher activity for subject's own name. Thus, analyzing the EEG reactivity in the own-name paradigm with equiprobable stimuli on a single-subject level yields a high variance between subjects. In future research, single-subject statistics should be applied for examining the validity of physiologic measurements in other paradigms and for examining the pattern of reactivity in patients.

Dynamics of large-scale cortical interactions at high gamma frequencies during word production: Event related causality (ERC) analysis of human electrocorticography (ECoG)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Effective connectivity; Granger causality; Large-scale brain networks; High gamma oscillations; Language mapping	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; INFORMATION-FLOW; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NONLINEAR CAUSALITY; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Intracranial EEG studies in humans have shown that functional brain activation in a variety of functional-anatomic domains of human cortex is associated with an increase in power at a broad range of high gamma (> 60 Hz) frequencies. Although these electrophysiological responses are highly specific for the location and timing of cortical processing and in animal recordings are highly correlated with increased population firing rates, there has been little direct empirical evidence for causal interactions between different recording sites at high gamma frequencies. Such causal interactions are hypothesized to occur during cognitive tasks that activate multiple brain regions. To determine whether such causal interactions occur at high gamma frequencies and to investigate their functional significance, we used event-related causality (ERC) analysis to estimate the dynamics, directionality, and magnitude of event-related causal interactions using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded during two word production tasks: picture naming and auditory word repetition. A clinical subject who had normal hearing but was skilled in American Signed Language (ASL) provided a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis with reference to a predictable pattern of causal interactions, i.e. that language cortex interacts with different areas of sensorimotor cortex during spoken vs. signed responses. Our ERC analyses confirmed this prediction. During word production with spoken responses, perisylvian language sites had prominent causal interactions with mouth/tongue areas of motor cortex, and when responses were gestured in sign language, the most prominent interactions involved hand and arm areas of motor cortex. Furthermore, we found that the sites from which the most numerous and prominent causal interactions originated, i.e. sites with a pattern of ERC "divergence", were also sites where high gamma power increases were most prominent and where electrocortical stimulation mapping interfered with word production. These findings suggest that the number, strength and directionality of event-related causal interactions may help identify network nodes that are not only activated by a task but are critical to its performance.

In this study, we sought to determine abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with SLPE, compared with nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, and to assess correlations with psychopathological deficits. Methodology/Principal Findings: Resting EEG was recorded in 21 patients with focal epilepsy and SLPE and in 21 clinically-matched non-psychotic epilepsy controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA software. For connectivity analysis, a novel nonlinear connectivity measure called "lagged phase synchronization" was used. We found increased theta oscillations in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), namely the medial and lateral parietal cortex bilaterally in the psychotic patients relative to their nonpsychotic counterparts. In addition, patients with psychosis had increased beta temporo-prefrontal connectivity in the hemisphere with predominant seizure focus. This functional connectivity in temporo-prefrontal circuits correlated with positive symptoms. Additionally, there was increased interhemispheric phase synchronization between the auditory cortex of the affected temporal lobe and the Broca's area correlating with auditory hallucination scores. Conclusions/Significance: In addition to dysfunction of parietal regions that are part of the DMN, resting-state disrupted connectivity of the medial temporal cortex with prefrontal areas that are either involved in the DMN or implicated in psychopathological dysfunction may be critical to schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This suggests that DMN deficits might be a core neurobiological feature of the disorder, and that abnormalities in theta oscillations and beta phase synchronization represent the underlying neural activity.

Newer studies tend to show that beyond the wellknown long-term homeostatic and circadian regulation of NREM sleep, sleep is regulated by a stimulus and arousal dependent flexible defense system, the elements of which participate in sleep delta homeostasis. Within the EEG elements of sleep a more larger amount represents reactible type as it was thought previously. Both the events of wake state and sensory input during sleep are shaping the sleep EEG in a function- and localisation specific way and the next day cognitive functios are determined by these changes.

Temporal dynamics of primary motor cortex gamma oscillation amplitude and piper corticomuscular coherence changes during motor control	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma oscillations; Primary motor cortex; Coherence; Magnetoencephalography	PHASE-LOCKING; MOVEMENT; RHYTHM; RANGE; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; FORCE	In recent years, the use of non-invasive techniques (EEG/MEG) to measure the similar to 80 Hz ("gamma") oscillations generated by the primary motor cortex during motor control has been well validated. However, primary motor cortex gamma oscillations have yet to be systematically compared with lower frequency (30-50 Hz, 'piper') corticomuscular coherence in the same tasks. In this paper, primary cortex gamma oscillations and piper corticomuscular coherence are compared for three types of movements: simple abductions of the index finger, repetitive abductions of the index finger of different extents and frequencies and static abduction of the index finger at two different force levels. For simple movements, piper coherence and gamma amplitude followed very similar time courses with coherence appearing at approximately half the frequency of cortical gamma oscillations. No evidence of 2:1 phase-phase coupling was observed. A similar pattern of results was observed for repetitive movements varying in size and frequency; however, during the production of static force, the time courses became dissociated. During these movements, EMG piper amplitude was sustained for the entire contraction; gamma power showed a burst at onset but no piper corticomuscular coherence was observed. For these data, this dissociation suggests that while primary motor cortex gamma oscillations and piper corticomuscular coherence may often co-occur during the production of dynamic movements, they probably reflect different functional processes in motor control.

EEG provides non-invasive approaches for monitoring brain electrical activity to emotional stimuli. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, based on power shifts in specific frequency bands, has some potential as a method for differentiating responses to basic emotions as measured during brief presentations of affective stimuli. Although there appears to be fairly consistent theta ERS in frontal regions of the brain during the earliest phases of processing affective auditory stimuli, the patterns do not readily distinguish between specific emotions. To date it has not been possible to consistently differentiate brain responses to emotion-specific affective states or stimuli, and some evidence to suggests the theta ERS more likely measures general arousal processes rather than yielding veridical indices of specific emotional states. Perhaps cortical EEG patterns will never be able to be used to distinguish discrete emotional states from the surface of the brain. The implications and limitations of such approaches for understanding human emotions are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bekkedal, Marni Y.

First published September 7, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00157.2011.-Recent studies have associated increasing temporal expectations with synchronization of higher frequency oscillations and suppression of lower frequencies. In this experiment, we explore a proposal that low-frequency oscillations provide a mechanism for regulating temporal expectations. We used a speeded Go/No-go task and manipulated temporal expectations by changing the probability of target presentation after certain intervals. Across two conditions, the temporal conditional probability of target events differed substantially at the first of three possible intervals. We found that reactions times differed significantly at this first interval across conditions, decreasing with higher temporal expectations. Interestingly, the power of theta activity (4-8 Hz), distributed over central midline sites, also differed significantly across conditions at this first interval. Furthermore, we found a transient coupling between theta phase and beta power after the first interval in the condition with high temporal expectation for targets at this time point. Our results suggest that the adjustments in theta power and the phase-power coupling between theta and beta contribute to a central mechanism for controlling neural excitability according to temporal expectations.

Less is known about the dynamics and identities of the cortical regions in which these modulations take place, and hence their functional significance has remained unclear. We used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography together with minimum norm estimate-based source modeling to study the dynamics of ongoing brain activity during a parametric VWM task. Early stimulus processing and memory encoding were associated with a memory load-dependent spread of neuronal activity from occipital to temporal, parietal, and frontal cortical regions. During the VWM retention period, the amplitudes of oscillations in theta/alpha-(5-9 Hz), high-alpha-(10-14 Hz), beta-(15-30 Hz), gamma-(30-50 Hz), and high-gamma-(50-150 Hz) frequency bands were suppressed below baseline levels, and yet, in frontoparietal regions, load dependently strengthened. However, in occipital and occipitotemporal structures, only beta, gamma, and high-gamma amplitudes were robustly strengthened by memory load. Individual behavioral VWM capacity was predicted by both the magnitude of the N1 evoked response component in early visual regions and by the amplitudes of frontoparietal high-alpha and high-gamma band oscillations. Thus, both early stimulus processing and late retention period activities may influence the behavioral outcome in VWM tasks. These data support the notion that beta-and gamma-band oscillations support the maintenance of object representations in VWM whereas alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band oscillations together contribute to attentional and executive processing.

This characterization was performed in segments of 500 ms with presence of focal seizures that had been initially identified and labeled by a specialist during their visual examination. After selection of the segments and channels for analysis, the energy of the signals were calculated with the idea that the energy of focal seizures could be larger than the one of their side waves in the segments. This procedure produced peaks of energy corresponding to the seizures and, some times, to noise and artifacts. In order to identify the peaks of energy of the seizures an analysis with continuous wavelet transform was performed. It was found that the mother wavelet 'bior2.2' allowed more easily the identification of such seizures from the seventh scale of the analysis. The method allowed the identification of the 65% of the seizures labeled by the specialist.

Initial evidence signified relevance of fMRI signal variability for perception and behavior. Yet the underlying intrinsic neuronal sources have not been previously substantiated. Here, we address this issue using simultaneous EEG-fMRI and real-time classification of ongoing alpha-rhythm states triggering visual stimulation in human subjects. We investigated whether spontaneous neuronal oscillations-as reflected in the posterior alpha rhythm-account for variability of evoked fMRI responses. Based on previous work, we specifically hypothesized linear superposition of fMRI activity related to fluctuations of ongoing alpha rhythm and a visually evoked fMRI response. We observed that spontaneous alpha-rhythm power fluctuations largely explain evoked fMRI response variance in extrastriate, thalamic, and cerebellar areas. For extrastriate areas, we confirmed the linear superposition hypothesis. We hence linked evoked fMRI response variability to an intrinsic rhythm's power fluctuations. These findings contribute to our conceptual understanding of how brain rhythms can account for trial-by-trial variability in stimulus processing.

We aimed in this study to test the changes in coupling between these characteristic oscillations of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM)/rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep within and between cortical and pontine EEGs following monoaminergic lesion, by using the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients. Experiments were performed in 14 adult, male Sprague Dawley rats chronically instrumented for sleep recording. We lesioned the dorsal raphe nucleus axon terminals in four rats using PCA neurotoxin (p-chloroamphetamine; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) administered as two intraperitoneal (IP) injections (6 mg/kg) 24 h apart. Lesioning of locus coeruleus axon terminals was performed in five rats using DSP-4 neurotoxin (N-2-chloroethyl-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzilamine; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) in a single IP dose of 50 mg/kg. Our previous study [Saponjic et al., Physiol Behav 90:1-10, 2007] demonstrated that these systemically induced monoaminergic lesions failed to produce significant changes in sleep/wake distribution from control conditions. The present study, by using spectral analysis and by examining the Pearson's correlation coefficients and their approximate probability density (APD) distribution profiles in control and lesion condition, demonstrates significant augmentation of the sigma/theta coupling strength, an inversion of cortical sigma/theta coupling direction and emergence of an additional sigma/theta coupling "mode" specific to the post-lesion state only within the cortex. By using the Pearson's correlation coefficients and their APD profiles, instead of classical sleep/wake distribution analysis, as a measure of direction and strength of sigma/theta coupling within and between cortex and pons, we were able to uncover the impact of a tonically decreased level of brain monoamines as altered strength and mode of coupling between sigma and theta oscillations. Specifically, a new mode of sigma/theta coupling emerged following lesion, which was specific to NREM sleep, suggests that loss of monoaminergic signaling interferes with NREM sleep consolidation. Our results also indicate an importance of monoamines in control of the sleep spindle and theta rhythm generators.

Error-related medial frontal theta activity predicts cingulate-related structural connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERN; Theta; DTI; Diffusion imaging; Connectivity; Oscillation; Synchrony; EEG	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; CONTROL MECHANISMS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Studies on electrophysiological signatures of error processing have focused on the medial frontal cortex, although widespread neuroanatomical networks support error/action monitoring. Here, electrophysiological responses to errors were combined with structural white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the long-range anatomical networks that support error processing. The approach taken here was to link individual differences in error-related EEG responses to individual differences in white matter connectional anatomy. Twenty subjects performed a speeded instructed choice task (a variant of the Simon task) designed to elicit response errors, and also underwent DTI scanning in a separate session. In the EEG data, significantly enhanced theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations were observed over medial frontal electrodes (centered on FCz) during response errors. Mid-frontal scalp sites (likely reflecting medial frontal cortex activity) also functioned as a strong "hub" for information flow, measured through theta-band phase synchronization degree. Next, a dipole source of the error-related theta-band activity was localized for each subject, accounting for approximately 80% of the topographical variance. Correlating individual differences in medial frontal theta dynamics with white matter tracts linking these dipole sources to the rest of the brain revealed that subjects with stronger error-related theta also had stronger white matter connectivity with the ventral striatum and inferior frontal gyrus. Further, subjects in whom medial frontal regions acted as a stronger synchronization "hub" had stronger connectivity between the dipole source location and the corpus callosum and dorsomedial prefrontal white matter pathways. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of widespread frontostriatal networks in monitoring actions and signaling behavioral errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABNORMAL INTERICTAL GAMMA ACTIVITY MAY MANIFEST A SEIZURE ONSET ZONE IN TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Epilepsy; pre-seizure state; seizure prediction; iEEG; gamma oscillations; neural synchrony	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CONCENTRIC RING ELECTRODES; KAINIC ACID; EEG RECORDINGS; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPAL	Even though recent studies have suggested that seizures do not occur suddenly and that before a seizure there is a period with an increased probability of seizure occurrence, neurophysiological mechanisms of interictal and pre-seizure states are unknown. The ability of mathematical methods to provide much more sensitive tools for the detection of subtle changes in the electrical activity of the brain gives promise that electrophysiological markers of enhanced seizure susceptibility can be found even during interictal periods when EEG of epilepsy patients often looks 'normal'. Previously, we demonstrated in animals that hippocampal and neocortical gamma-band rhythms (30-100 Hz) intensify long before seizures caused by systemic infusion of kainic acid. Other studies in recent years have also drawn attention to the fast activity (> 30 Hz) as a possible marker of epileptogenic tissue. The current study quantified gamma-band activity during interictal periods and seizures in intracranial EEG (iEEG) in 5 patients implanted with subdural grids/intracranial electrodes during their pre-surgical evaluation. In all our patients, we found distinctive (abnormal) bursts of gamma activity with a 3 to 100 fold increase in power at gamma frequencies with respect to selected by clinicians, quiescent, artifact-free, 7-20 min "normal" background (interictal) iEEG epochs 1 to 14 hours prior to seizures. Increases in gamma activity were largest in those channels which later displayed the most intensive electrographic seizure discharges. Moreover, location of gamma-band bursts correlated (with high specificity, 96.4% and sensitivity, 83.8%) with seizure onset zone (SOZ) determined by clinicians. Spatial localization of interictal gamma rhythms within SOZ suggests that the persistent presence of abnormally intensified gamma rhythms in the EEG may be an important tool for focus localization and possibly a determinant of epileptogenesis.

However, limitations of MMP have not been adequately tested. The aims of this study were to investigate how the accuracy of MMP algorithm is altered due to increased number of brain sources and increased noise level, and to implement and test a modified K-means clustering algorithm in order to group similar MMP atoms in time-frequency and space between subjects together. Methods: Four groups of 20 EEG signals were simulated. The groups consisted of simulations with 5, 10, 15, and 20 brain sources. The accuracy of MMP algorithm was first tested on increasing number of sources. Then, different levels of noise were added to the simulations and accuracy of the algorithm was tested on increasing noise level. K-means clustering algorithm was tested on 4 datasets (5, 10, 15, and 20 sources) of 10 similar phantom subjects. Finally, the clustering algorithm was tested on empirical somatosensory evoked potential and brainstem evoked potential data. Results: The MMP accuracy decreased as the number of sources increased and MMP accuracy was robust to noise. Furthermore, we found that when applying the clustering method to a subject group's MMP data, the clustering method grouped the similar atoms between subjects correctly. Conclusion: The MMP and clustering method proved to be an efficient way to group similar brain activity and thus study differences in brain activation sequence to sensory stimulation between groups of subjects.

Mechanism behind gamma band activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arousal; calcium channels; gamma band; N-type; oscillations; P/Q-type	CALCIUM CONDUCTANCES; MAMMALIAN NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; CHANNELS; EXCITABILITY; SYSTEMS; SLEEP; TRANSMISSION; RESPONSES; RELEASE	The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), part of the reticular activating system, modulates waking and paradoxical sleep. During waking and paradoxical sleep, EEG responses are characterized by low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillatory activity in the beta-gamma band range (similar to 20-80 Hz). We have previously reported that gamma band activity may be intrinsically generated by the membrane electroresponsiveness of PPN neurons, and that the neuronal ensemble generates different patterns of gamma activity in response to specific transmitters. This study attempted to identify the voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels involved in the rising and falling phases of gamma oscillations in PPN neurons. We found that all rat (8-14 day) PPN cell types showed gamma oscillations in the presence of TTX and synaptic blockers when membrane potential was depolarized using current ramps. PPN neurons showed gamma oscillations when voltage-clamped at holding potentials above) -30 mV, suggesting that their origin may be spatially located beyond voltage-clamp control. The average frequency for all PPN cell types was 23 +/- 1 Hz and this increased under carbachol (47 +/- 2 Hz; ANOVA df = 64, t = 12.5, P < 0.001). The N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin-GVIA partially reduced gamma oscillations, while the P/Q-type blocker omega-agatoxin-IVA abolished them. Both omega-CgTX and omega-Aga blocked voltage-dependent calcium currents, by 56 and 52% respectively. The delayed rectifier-like potassium channel blocker alpha-dendrotoxin also abolished gamma oscillations. In carbachol-induced PPN population responses, omega-agatoxin-IVA reduced higher, and omega-CgTx mostly lower, frequencies. These results suggest that voltage-dependent P/Q-and, to a lesser extent, N-type calcium channels mediate gamma oscillations in PPN.

Development of auditory-specific brain rhythm in infants	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cortex; cortical plasticity; EEG frequency band analysis; event-related oscillations; maturation	ALPHA RHYTHMS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVOKED RESPONSES; 10-HZ RHYTHM; EEG ALPHA; PATTERNS; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; MEMORY; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Human infants rapidly develop their auditory perceptual abilities and acquire culture-specific knowledge in speech and music in the second 6 months of life. In the adult brain, neural rhythm around 10 Hz in the temporal lobes is thought to reflect sound analysis and subsequent cognitive processes such as memory and attention. To study when and how such rhythm emerges in infancy, we examined electroencephaolgram (EEG) recordings in infants 4 and 12 months of age during sound stimulation and silence. In the 4-month-olds, the amplitudes of narrowly tuned 4-Hz brain rhythm, recorded from bilateral temporal electrodes, were modulated by sound stimuli. In the 12-month-olds, the sound-induced modulation occurred at faster 6-Hz rhythm at temporofrontal locations. The brain rhythms in the older infants consisted of more complex components, as even evident in individual data. These findings suggest that auditory-specific rhythmic neural activity, which is already established before 6 months of age, involves more speed-efficient long-range neural networks by the age of 12 months when long-term memory for native phoneme representation and for musical rhythmic features is formed. We suggest that maturation of distinct rhythmic components occurs in parallel, and that sensory-specific functions bound to particular thalamo-cortical networks are transferred to newly developed higher-order networks step by step until adult hierarchical neural oscillatory mechanisms are achieved across the whole brain.

AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neurofibrillary plaques and tangles in the brain that leads to neuronal death and dementia. Early diagnosis of AD is still a major unresolved health concern: several biomarkers are being investigated, among which the electroencephalogram (EEG) provides the only option for an electrophysiological information. In this study, EEG signals obtained from 161 subjects - 79 with AD, and 82 age-matched controls (CN) - are analyzed using several non-linear signal complexity measures. These measures include: Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), spectral entropy (SE), spectral centroid (SC), spectral roll-off (SR), and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). HFD is a quantitative measure of time series complexity derived from fractal theory. Among spectral measures, SE measures the level of disorder in the spectrum, SC is a measure of spectral shape, and SR is frequency sample below which a specified percent of the spectral magnitude distribution is contained. Lastly, ZCR is simply the rate at which the signal changes signs. A t-test was first applied to determine those features that provide significant differences between the groups. Those features were then used to train a neural network. The classification accuracies ranged from 60-66%, suggesting they contain some discriminatory information; however, not enough to be clinically useful alone. Combining these features and training a support vector machine (SVM) resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 78%, indicating that these feature carry complementary information.

INTERRELATIONS AND CIRCADIAN CHANGES OF ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM FREQUENCIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS AND CONSTANT SLEEP PRESSURE IN THE RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						correlation and spectra analysis; EEG; circadian; sleep homeostat	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; EEG POWER SPECTRA; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; HIPPOCAMPAL NETWORKS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; BRAIN TEMPERATURE; IN-VIVO; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRIVATION; THETA	Similar to the nap-protocols applied in humans, the repeated short-sleep deprivation protocol in rats stabilizes slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4 Hz) in the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), thus reflecting a constant sleep pressure or sleep homeostatic level, whereas higher frequencies (7-25 Hz) in these conditions preserve their daily rhythm, therefore demonstrating a strong input from an endogenous circadian clock. How different EEG frequencies in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and waking respond to these constant conditions, how they interrelate to each other within the different vigilance states, and which component of sleep regulation (homeostatic or circadian) is involved, remain unknown. To answer these questions, we applied power spectral analysis and correlation analysis to 1 Hz bin EEG frequency data for different vigilance states in freely moving rats in constant darkness, under baseline conditions and during the repeated short-sleep deprivation protocol. Our analysis suggests that (1) 0.5-5 Hz frequencies in NREM sleep and higher frequencies in REM sleep (above 19 Hz) and waking (above 10 Hz) are sleep-dependent, and thus seem to be under control of the sleep homeostat, while (2) faster frequencies in the NREM sleep EEG (7-25 Hz) and 3-7 Hz activity in the REM sleep EEG are under strong influence of the endogenous circadian clock. Theta activity in waking (5-7 Hz) seems to reflect both circadian and behavior dependent influences. NREM sleep EEG frequencies between 9 and 14 Hz showed both homeostatic and circadian components in their behavior. Thus, frequencies in the EEG of the different vigilance states seem to represent circadian and homeostatic components of sleep regulatory mechanisms, where REM sleep and waking frequency ranges behave similarly to each other and differently from NREM sleep frequencies.

Cognitive impairments, seen early in the course of psychotic disorders, may be related to alterations in these oscillations, but few studies have examined this relationship. Method: Twenty seven untreated patients with a recently diagnosed psychotic disorder had polysomno-graphic sleep studies and neuro-cognitive testing. Results: Reduced power in the sigma range, which reflects spindle density, was associated with impaired attention, and reasoning, but not intelligence quotient (IQ). Slow wave sleep measures were not significantly associated with any cognitive measures. Conclusions: Impairments in sleep spindles may be associated with cognitive deficits in the early course of psychotic disorders. These observations may help clarify neuro-biologic mechanisms of cognitive deficits in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG alpha synchronization is related to top-down processing in convergent and divergent thinking	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Alpha synchronization; Frontal cortex; Top-down control; Internal processing; Creativity	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TASK CONTENT; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS; CREATIVITY; PERFORMANCE; BAND	Synchronization of EEG alpha activity has been referred to as being indicative of cortical idling, but according to more recent evidence it has also been associated with active internal processing and creative thinking. The main objective of this study was to investigate to what extent EEG alpha synchronization is related to internal processing demands and to specific cognitive process involved in creative thinking. To this end, EEG was measured during a convergent and a divergent thinking task (i.e., creativity-related task) which once were processed involving low and once involving high internal processing demands. High internal processing demands were established by masking the stimulus (after encoding) and thus preventing further bottom-up processing. Frontal alpha synchronization was observed during convergent and divergent thinking only under exclusive top-down control (high internal processing demands), but not when bottom-up processing was allowed (low internal processing demands). We conclude that frontal alpha synchronization is related to top-down control rather than to specific creativity-related cognitive processes. Frontal alpha synchronization, which has been observed in a variety of different creativity tasks, thus may not reflect a brain state that is specific for creative cognition but can probably be attributed to high internal processing demands which are typically involved in creative thinking.

Since the present pharmacotherapy has probably reached its limit in this area, there is a logical effort to utilize other, non-pharmacological methods. One of the most promising supplements that has been for a long time verified in the clinical practice is rTMS. Most of the studies have arrived at the conclusion that rTMS is an efficient method in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A valuable contribution to the assessment of the rTMS application in the treatment of negative symptoms is represented by meta-analyses. The meta-analyses indicate that the effect is mild to moderate (d=0.43 to 0.68). To sum it up, there will be higher probability of the rTMS effect on negative symptoms if 10 Hz stimulating frequency and a longer stimulation period in the extent at least three, ideally four to six weeks is used.

To examine changes in event-related potentials (ERPs) and brain oscillations, we recorded the EEGs of healthy groups of young (n = 14; mean age = 32.3 years) and older adults (n = 14; mean age = 65.1). Both age groups exhibited similar accuracy and exploration times when making old-new judgments. Young and older participants showed a marginally significant ERP old/new effect widely distributed over the scalp between 550-750 ms. In addition, the elders showed lower amplitude than younger participants within 1200-1500 ms. There were age-related differences in brain oscillations as measured by event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP). Older adults showed greater alpha and beta power reductions than young participants, suggesting the recruitment of additional neural resources. In contrast, the two age groups showed a reliable old/new effect in the theta band that temporarily overlapped the ERP old/new effect. The present results suggest that despite similar behavioral performance, the young and older adults recruited different neural resources to perform a haptic recognition task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A group of 40 patients with first-onset schizophrenia and 40 controls performed an auditory oddball task. Wavelet analysis of the single-trial data was used to compute the Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and the Inter-Trial Phase Coherence (ITC) for the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands on the 50 ms window around peak P300 amplitude. The contribution of power and synchrony for P300 amplitudes was studied through correlation and regression analysis. Further, two sub-samples in which patients had lower or higher P300 amplitudes than their control match were contrasted. P300 amplitude did not differ between patients and controls. The frequency domain analysis revealed that controls display larger reductions on gamma power than patients. However, this gamma activity might be the result of micro-saccadic muscular artifacts. Regression analysis shows that P300 amplitude is highly dependent on delta power and synchronization. The analysis of the subsamples confirmed that while gamma power differences are dependent on the diagnosis, delta and theta synchronization are related to P300 amplitude, irrespective of diagnosis.

However, the patterns of cortico-cortical coupling and their relation to behavioural success are widely unknown. Here, we analysed changes in cortico-cortical coherence during an unimanual visuomotor task and their correlation with performance. A 28-channel-EEC was attained in 27 healthy subjects during the tracking of an irregularly fluctuating target on a screen by manipulating a force sensor with the right index finger and thumb. For oscillatory power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and the lower beta-band (betal, 13-20 Hz), we found a decrease in central and occipital areas during performance. Interregional coherence between contralateral frontal and central areas was enhanced in the alpha band. In betal, we observed a marked increase of coherence in centroparietal regions of both hemispheres extending to occipital and frontal regions in beta2 (21-30 Hz). Most prominently, correlation analysis between alpha coherence and performance accuracy indicated that higher occipitocentral (i.e. visuomotor) coherence is associated with better visuomotor performance whereas high tracking error is associated with enhanced frontocentral coupling, suggesting additional activation of a frontoparietal control network. These results provide further evidence that coherent brain oscillations in alpha and beta bands significantly contribute to effective functional integration of visual and motor areas.

However, recent evidence suggests that low-level mechanisms such as multisensory and sensorimotor integration may play a fundamental role in self-related processing. Here we used virtual reality technology and visuo-tactile conflict to study such low-level mechanisms and manipulate where participants experienced their self to be localized (self-location). Frequency analysis and electrical neuroimaging of co-recorded high-resolution electroencephalography revealed body-specific alpha band power modulations in bilateral sensorimotor cortices. Furthermore, alpha power in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was correlated with the degree of experimentally manipulated self-location. We argue that these alpha oscillations in sensorimotor cortex and mPFC reflect self-location as manipulated through multisensory conflict.

Piracetam increased alpha/beta1 EEG activity in the left frontal cortex, and alpha activity in both the right cortex and hippocampus, with a 10-min latency and 40-min duration. Noopept increased alpha/beta1 activity, with 30-min latency and 40-min duration in all brain areas. CPP pretreatment eliminated Piracetam EEG effects; reduced Noopept effects in the cortex and completely suppressed them in the hippocampus. After four injections of Piracetam, EEG effects were very small in the cortex, and completely lacking in the hippocampus, while GDEE pretreatment partially recovered them. The effect of Noopept in the alpha/beta1 ranges was replaced by increased beta2 activity after the eighth injection, while no effects were observed after the ninth one. GDEE pretreatment restored the effect of Noopept in the beta2 frequency range. These results demonstrate similarities in EEG effects and their mediatory mechanisms for Piracetam and its much more effective analogue, Noopept. Activation of NMDA receptors is involved in the effects of a single injection of the nootropics, whereas activation of quisqualate/AMPA receptors is associated with the decrease in their efficacy after repeated use.

Lack of effects of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on alpha rhythm phase synchronization in migraine patients	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Migraine; Visual cortex excitability; EEG synchronization	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; LEVETIRACETAM; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; TOPIRAMATE; MODULATION; CAT; EEG	The study aimed to test the modulation induced by 1 Hz repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) of the occipital cortex on the alpha phase synchronization under repetitive flash stimuli in 15 migraine without aura patients compared to 10 controls. The EEG was recorded by 7 channels, while flash stimuli were delivered at 9, 18, 21 and 24 Hz in basal, rTMS (15 min of 1 Hz stimulation of the occipital cortex) and sham conditions. Migraine patients displayed increased alpha-band phase synchronization under visual stimulation, while an overall desynchronizing effect was evident in controls. The rTMS resulted in a slight increase of synchronization index in migraine patients, which did not cause significant differences in respect to the basal and sham conditions. The synchronizing-desynchronizing changes of alpha rhythm under repetitive flash stimulation, seem independent from the state of occipital cortex excitability. Other mechanisms beyond cortical excitability may contribute to explain migraine pathogenesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detection of quadratic phase coupling from human EEG signals using higher order statistics and spectra	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Bispectrum; Cumulants; Higher order spectra; Higher order statistics; Quadratic phase coupling; Surrogate data	SURROGATE DATA; MYOGENIC OSCILLATIONS; BISPECTRUM ESTIMATION; RHYTHMS; NONLINEARITY; NORMALITY; POWER	Interactions among neural signals in different frequency components have become a focus of strong interest in biomedical signal processing. The bispectrum is a method to detect the presence of quadratic phase coupling (QPC) between different frequency bands in a signal. The traditional way to quantify phase coupling is by means of the bicoherence index (BCI), which is essentially a normalized bispectrum. The main disadvantage of the BCI is that the determination of significant QPC becomes compromised with noise. To mitigate this problem, a statistical approach that combines the bispectrum with an improved surrogate data method to determine the statistical significance of the phase coupling is introduced. The method was first tested on two simulation examples. It was then applied to the human EEG signal that has been recorded from the scalp using international 10-20 electrodes system. The frequency domain method, based on normalized spectrum and bispectrum, describes frequency interactions associated with nonlinearities occurring in the observed EEG.

Chronic stress-induced changes in REM sleep on theta oscillations in the rat hippocampus and amygdala	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Stress; Sleep; Amygdala; Hippocampus; Theta rhythm	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; EEG POWER SPECTRUM; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SPATIAL MEMORY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CENTRAL NUCLEUS; PREOPTIC AREA; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR	The present study investigated the effect of Chronic Immobilization Stress (CIS) on theta oscillations in the hippocampus and amygdala during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of CIS daily for 10 days. Polysomnographic recordings with electroencephalogram (EEG) from hippocampus (CA3 and CA1 subregion) and lateral nucleus of amygdala (LA) were carried out after termination of CIS protocol on the 7th, 14th and 21st day. The results showed a bimodal distribution on the total REM sleep duration in CIS rats: group of rats exhibited increased REM sleep duration considered as a stress-enhanced REM (SER) and rats with reduced REM sleep as stress-reduced REM sleep (SRR) group. The bimodal distribution in REM sleep was continued to exhibit even after 21 days of termination of stress, showing increased REM sleep in SER and reversible REM sleep in SRR rats. In addition to changes in sleep, increased REM sleep in SER rats was associated with attenuated theta activity in the hippocampus and amygdala, while the SRR rats did not show attenuated theta activities during the stress recovery period. Thus, the study demonstrates the dependence of synchronized amygdalo-hippocampal theta activity with the CIS-induced enhanced REM sleep duration. This raises the possibility that CIS-induced manifestations of the anxiety may be associated with synchronized theta oscillations in the hippocampus and amygdala. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the relationship between theta phase and gamma power coupling (TGC) and scores obtained regarding memory tasks. Thirty-one older subjects performed a spatial delayed match-to-sample task (SDMST) during EEG recording. We also evaluated performance on the delayed figure recall (DFR) and delayed verbal recall (DVR) tasks regarding memory ability. Partial correlation analysis (controlled for age) demonstrated that increases in TGC in the parietal area were significantly correlated with increases in the DFR scores obtained. In addition, TGC was significantly correlated with the accuracy rate of the SDMST. Our results indicate that TGC could be a useful biophysiological marker of memory ability.

An EEG-MEG dissociation between online syntactic comprehension and post hoc reanalysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						syntax; Broca's area; semantic; language; complexity; reversibility	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BROCAS AREA; SENTENCE; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES; MAINTENANCE; POTENTIALS	Successful comprehension of syntactically complex sentences depends on online language comprehension mechanisms as well as reanalysis in working memory. To differentiate the neural substrates of these processes, we recorded electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during sentence-picture-matching in healthy subjects, assessing the effects of two difficulty factors: syntactic complexity (object-embedded vs. subject-embedded relative clauses) and semantic reversibility on neuronal oscillations during sentence presentation, and during a subsequent memory delay prior to picture onset. Synthetic Aperture magnetometry analysis of MEG showed that semantic reversibility induced left lateralized perisylvian power decreases in a broad frequency range, approximately 8-30 Hz. This effect followed the relative clause presentation and persisted throughout the remainder of the sentence and the subsequent memory delay period, shifting to a more frontal distribution during the delay. In contrast, syntactic complexity induced enhanced power decreases only during the delay period, in bilateral frontal and anterior temporal regions. These results indicate that detailed syntactic parsing of auditory language input may be augmented in the absence of alternative cues for thematic role assignment, as reflected by selective perisylvian engagement for reversible sentences, compared with irreversible sentences in which world knowledge constrains possible thematic roles. Furthermore, comprehension of complex syntax appears to depend on post hoc reanalysis in working memory implemented by frontal regions in both hemispheres.

Modulation of High-Frequency EEG Rhythms under Conditions of the Activation Reaction: Dependence on Psychological Characteristics of Personality	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						reaction of the EEG activation; resting state with the eyes open and closed; spectral power; coefficient of reactivity; beta rhythm; gamma rhythm; psychological questionnaires	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; NETWORKS	In a group of 118 adults of both sexes, we studied modulation of high-frequency EEG rhythms (beta and gamma components) under conditions of EEG activation related to opening of the eyes. Typical changes in the alpha rhythm (significant depression in the overwhelming majority of the tested subjects) was accompanied by different (in direction and intensity) shifts of the spectral powers (SPs) of the beta and gamma components in different subjects. The power of the beta 1 subcomponent under conditions of the activation reaction increased in 6 persons and dropped in 109 persons; changes in this index in two hemispheres were opposite in their directions in 3 subjects. Thus, changes in the beta 1 SP upon opening of the eyes were nearly parallel to those of the alpha rhythm but less intense. The subgroups differentiated according to the pattern of reactivity of the beta 2 subcomponent included 23, 85, and 10 subjects; for the gamma rhythm, the corresponding numbers were 31, 72, and 8. In other words, the patterns of reactivity of beta 2 and gamma oscillations were rather similar to each other but differed significantly from the pattern for the beta 1 rhythm. Values of the differential coefficients of reactivity (DCRs) of the beta 1, beta 2, and gamma rhythms demonstrated significant correlations that were especially close for the beta 2 and gamma activity. Within the entire examined group, we found significant negative correlations of the DCR values for beta and gamma activities with the estimates of some psychological characteristics of the subjects (levels of neuroticism, psychoticism, plasticity, self-control of behavior, and some others) measured using the RTS (Strelau), EPQ (Eysenck), OST (Rusalov), and 16PF (Kettel) questionnaires. The dispersion analysis demonstrated that the above-mentioned subgroups of the subjects (with increase and decrease in the SPs of the beta and gamma rhythms in both hemispheres and opposite changes of these indices in the right and left hemisphere) showed significant or close to significant specific intergroup differences of a few mean values of the psychological characteristics estimated according to the above questionnaires. Possible mechanisms of modulation of high-frequency EEG components under conditions of the reaction of EEG activation and relations of such changes to the psychological characteristics of the personality are discussed.

Brain Rhythms Reveal a Hierarchical Network Organization	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY; GAMMA; MODEL; CONNECTIVITY; NEUROANATOMY; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; SPECTRA	Recordings of ongoing neural activity with EEG and MEG exhibit oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background. The oscillations appear in the power spectrum as a collection of frequency bands that are evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale, thereby preventing mutual entrainment and cross-talk. Over the last few years, experimental, computational and theoretical studies have made substantial progress on our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying the generation of network oscillations and their interactions, with emphasis on the role of neuronal synchronization. In this paper we ask a very different question. Rather than investigating how brain rhythms emerge, or whether they are necessary for neural function, we focus on what they tell us about functional brain connectivity. We hypothesized that if we were able to construct abstract networks, or "virtual brains", whose dynamics were similar to EEG/MEG recordings, those networks would share structural features among themselves, and also with real brains. Applying mathematical techniques for inverse problems, we have reverse-engineered network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves, which appear in the power spectrum as frequency bands superimposed on a non-oscillatory background dominated by low frequencies. We show that all reconstructed networks display similar topological features (e. g. structural motifs) and dynamics. We have also reverse-engineered putative diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic), in which the oscillatory activity is altered in different ways, as reported in clinical studies. These reconstructed networks show consistent alterations of functional connectivity and dynamics. In particular, we show that the complexity of the network, quantified as proposed by Tononi, Sporns and Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness, since virtual brains modeling diseased states display lower complexity than virtual brains modeling normal neural function. We finally discuss the implications of our results for the neurobiology of health and disease.	[Steinke, G.

Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during SWS represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical <1 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15 Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories.

However it is not yet known how these changes are manifested by the dynamic brain oscillations and synchronization patterns subserving the language networks. In search for synchronization correlates of proficiency and expertise in second language acquisition, multivariate EEG signals were recorded from 44 high and low proficiency bilinguals during processing of natural language in their first and second languages. Gamma band (30-45 Hz) phase synchronization (PS) was calculated mainly by two recently developed methods: coarse-graining of Markov chains (estimating global phase synchrony, measuring the degree of PS between one electrode and all other electrodes), and phase lag index (PLI; estimating bivariate phase synchrony, measuring the degree of PS between a pair of electrodes). On comparing second versus first language processing, global PS by coarse-graining Markov chains indicated that processing of the second language needs significantly higher synchronization strength than first language. On comparing the proficiency groups, bivariate PS measure (i.e., PLI) revealed that during second language processing the low proficiency group showed stronger and broader network patterns than the high proficiency group, with interconnectivities between a left fronto-parietal network. Mean phase coherence analysis also indicated that the network activity was globally stronger in the low proficiency group during second language processing.

Spindles differ in location, frequency, and association with slow waves, but whether this heterogeneity may reflect different physiological processes and potentially serve different functional roles remains unclear. Here we used a unique opportunity to record intracranial depth EEG and single-unit activity in multiple brain regions of neurosurgical patients to better characterize spindle activity in human sleep. We find that spindles occur across multiple neocortical regions, and less frequently also in the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus. Most spindles are spatially restricted to specific brain regions. In addition, spindle frequency is topographically organized with a sharp transition around the supplementary motor area between fast (13-15 Hz) centroparietal spindles often occurring with slow-wave up-states, and slow (9-12Hz) frontal spindles occurring 200 ms later on average. Spindle variability across regions may reflect the underlying thalamocortical projections. We also find that during individual spindles, frequency decreases within and between regions. In addition, deeper NREM sleep is associated with a reduction in spindle occurrence and spindle frequency. Frequency changes between regions, during individual spindles, and across sleep may reflect the same phenomenon, the underlying level of thalamocortical hyperpolarization. Finally, during spindles neuronal firing rates are not consistently modulated, although some neurons exhibit phase-locked discharges. Overall, anatomical considerations can account well for regional spindle characteristics, while variable hyperpolarization levels can explain differences in spindle frequency.

J	Logar, V; Belic, A				Logar, Vito; Belic, Ales			Brain-computer interface analysis of a dynamic visuo-motor task	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Dynamic visuo-motor task; Fuzzy logic; Brain-information decoding; Brain-computer interface; Wrist-movement prediction	CODING SCHEME; PHASE CODE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; COHERENCE; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY	Background: The area of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represents one of the more interesting fields in neurophysiological research, since it investigates the development of the machines that perform different transformations of the brain's "thoughts" to certain pre-defined actions. Experimental studies have reported some successful implementations of BC's; however, much of the field still remains unexplored. According to some recent reports the phase coding of informational content is an important mechanism in the brain's function and cognition, and has the potential to explain various mechanisms of the brain's data transfer, but it has yet to be scrutinized in the context of brain-computer interface. Therefore, if the mechanism of phase coding is plausible, one should be able to extract the phase-coded content, carried by brain signals, using appropriate signal-processing methods. In our previous studies we have shown that by using a phase-demodulation-based signal-processing approach it is possible to decode some relevant information on the current motor action in the brain from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Objective: In this paper the authors would like to present a continuation of their previous work on the brain-information-decoding analysis of visuo-motor (VM) tasks. The present study shows that EEG data measured during more complex, dynamic visuo-motor (dVM) tasks carries enough information about the currently performed motor action to be successfully extracted by using the appropriate signal-processing and identification methods. The aim of this paper is therefore to present a mathematical model, which by means of the EEG measurements as its inputs predicts the course of the wrist movements as applied by each subject during the task in simulated or real time (BCI analysis). However, several modifications to the existing methodology are needed to achieve optimal decoding results and a real-time, data-processing ability. The information extracted from the EEG could, therefore, be further used for the development of a closed-loop, non-invasive, brain-computer interface. Materials and methods: For the case of this study two types of measurements were performed, i.e., the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and the wrist movements were measured simultaneously, during the subject's performance of a dynamic visuo-motor task. Wrist-movement predictions were computed by using the EEG data-processing methodology of double brain-rhythm filtering, double phase demodulation and double principal component analyses (PCA), each with a separate set of parameters. For the movement-prediction model a fuzzy inference system was used. Results: The results have shown that the EEG signals measured during the dVM tasks carry enough information about the subjects' wrist movements for them to be successfully decoded using the presented methodology. Reasonably high values of the correlation coefficients suggest that the validation of the proposed approach is satisfactory. Moreover, since the causality of the rhythm filtering and the PCA transformation has been achieved, we have shown that these methods can also be used in a real-time, brain-computer interface. The study revealed that using non-causal, optimized methods yields better prediction results in comparison with the causal, non-optimized methodology; however, taking into account that the causality of these methods allows real-time processing, the minor decrease in prediction quality is acceptable. Conclusion: The study suggests that the methodology that was proposed in our previous studies is also valid for identifying the EEG-coded content during dVM tasks, albeit with various modifications, which allow better prediction results and real-time data processing. The results have shown that wrist movements can be predicted in simulated or real time; however, the results of the non-causal, optimized methodology (simulated) are slightly better. Nevertheless, the study has revealed that these methods should be suitable for use in the development of a non-invasive, brain-computer interface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. Methods: We propose an automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel setups and from new subjects. Results: Based on six features only, the optimized linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement (<10% Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15% MSE. On data of the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60% of the most artifactual source components. Conclusions: We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye-and muscle artifacts. Its performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG studies.

In addition, evidence is accumulating that suggests GABAergic-mediated neurotransmission is altered during aging. This study investigated whether baclofen administration (5 mg kg(-1)) induces differential effects on cortical electrical activity with age. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from young (3-4 months) and aged (15-17 months) rats, and both the absolute and relative powers in five frequency bands (delta: 2-4 Hz; theta: 4-8 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 12-20 Hz; gamma: 20-100 Hz) were analyzed. Before administration of baclofen, we found that the EEG relative power in the beta band was higher in the aged than that in the young rats. After administration of baclofen, there was a slower increase in the relative power in the delta band in the aged than that in the young rats. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two age groups in absolute power in any frequency band. These findings indicate that baclofen treatment appears to differentially modify cortical EEG activity as a function of age. Our data further elucidate the relationship between GABA(B) receptor-mediated neurotransmission and aging.

J	Konareva, IN				Konareva, I. N.			Modulation of Low-Frequency EEG Rhythms under Conditions of an Activation Reaction: Dependence on Psychological Characteristics of Personality	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						reaction of EEG activation; resting state with the eyes open or closed; spectral power; coefficient of reactivity; delta rhythm; theta rhythm; psychological questionnaires	PERFORMANCE; TASKS; THETA	In a group of 118 adults of both sexes, we studied modulation of the low-frequency EEG components (delta and theta rhythms) under conditions of an activation reaction resulting from opening of the eyes. Typical changes of the alpha rhythm (considerable depression in a great majority of the tested subjects) was accompanied by diverse, in their direction, shifts of the spectral power (SP) of the delta and theta components in different subjects. The delta rhythm power increased upon the reaction of activation in 79 subjects and decreased in 29 subjects, while changes in this index in different hemispheres were of opposite directions in 10 persons. According to the reactivity of the rhythm, the respective subgroups included 36, 75, and 7 subjects. Values of the differential coefficients of reactivity (DCR) for the delta and theta rhythms demonstrated significant positive correlation (r = 0.616 and 0.603 for the left and right hemispheres, respectively). Indices of reactivity of the alpha and theta rhythms also correlated but less closely (r about 0.3). At the same time, there was practically no correlation between the DCR values of the delta and theta rhythms. Within the entire studied group, we found significant negative correlations between the DCRs of the delta and theta activity with the estimates of some psychological characteristics of the subjects (levels of extroversion, psychoticism, ergicity, plasticity, dominance, and a few others) measured using the questionnaires RTS (Strelau), EPQ (Eysenck), OST (Rusalov), and 16 PF (Kettel). We also found positive correlations with the levels of normativity of behavior and development of imagination. At a rather high significance of such correlations, coefficients of the latter were, as a rule, relatively low (usually less than 0.2). Results of dispersion analysis showed that significant or close to significant intergroup differences of the mean values of estimates of psychological characteristics diagnosed according to the above-mentioned questionnaires were typical of the subgroups of subjects with increases and decreases in the SPs of the. and. rhythms or with opposite changes of these indices in the hemispheres. Probable mechanisms of modulation of the low-frequency EEG components under conditions of the activation reaction and correlations of such changes with psychological peculiarities of the personality are discussed.

The message processing usually includes memorization and transformation in order to simplify the present of information. Thereby, design of message presentation has been a critical factor of improving working performance. Over the experiment, we acquired and recorded the data of working performance and subjects' brain wave during the task operating. This research is going to discuss the effects of short-term memory load and verbal transformation on working performance and EEG response. Working performance in this experiment consisted of finish time and error number. EEG response included theta rhythm and alpha signal. The results were analyzed with SPSS and showed that: With increased memory load, both finish time and error number significantly increased. Verbal transformation significantly affected finish time and error number. ETR caused the longest finish time, and TR caused the largest error number. Frontal-theta rhythm increased in strength with the difficulties of memorization and transformation. Occipital-alpha signal decreased in strength while the amount of characters remembered increased, and showed the strongest power for TR. The left hemisphere was more functional than the right side during verbal memorization and transformation.

They showed that significant activity was consistently associated with slow (>140 mu V) and delta waves (75-140 mu V) during NREM sleep in several cortical areas including inferior frontal, medial prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortices. Unexpectedly, slow waves were also associated with transient responses in the pontine tegmentum and in the cerebellum. On the other hand, spindles were associated with a transient activity in the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. Moreover, slow spindles (11-13 Hz) were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast spindles (13-15 Hz) recruited a set of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. These findings indicate that human NREM sleep is an active state during which brain activity is temporally organized by spontaneous oscillations (spindles and slow oscillation) in a regionally specific manner. The functional significance of these NREM sleep oscillations is currently interpreted in terms of synaptic homeostasis and memory consolidation.

Data-Driven Modeling of Phase Interactions Between Spontaneous MEG Oscillations	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						functional interaction; synchronization; oscillatory activity; phase locking; coupled oscillators; EEG; MEG; volume conduction	STATE TRANSITIONS; BRAIN; EEG	Objective: Synchronization between distributed rhythms in the brain is commonly assessed by estimating the synchronization strength from simultaneous measurements. This approach, however, does not elucidate the phase dynamics that underlies synchronization. For this, an explicit dynamical model is required. Based on the assumption that the recorded rhythms can be described as weakly coupled oscillators, we propose a method for characterizing their phase-interaction dynamics. Methods: We propose to model ongoing magnetoencephalographic (MEG) oscillations as weakly coupled oscillators. Based on this model, the phase interactions between simultaneously recorded signals are characterized by estimating the modulation in instantaneous frequency as a function of their phase difference. Furthermore, we mathematically derive the effect of volume conduction on the model and show how indices for strength and direction of coupling can be derived. Results: The methodology is tested using simulations and is applied to ongoing occipital-frontal MEG oscillations of healthy subjects in the alpha and beta bands during rest. The simulations show that the model is robust against the presence of noise, short observation times, and model violations. The application to MEG data shows that the model can reconstruct the observed occipital-frontal phase difference distributions. Furthermore, it suggests that phase locking in the alpha and beta band is established by qualitatively different mechanisms. Conclusion: When the recorded rhythms are assumed to be weakly coupled oscillators, a dynamical model for the phase interactions can be fitted to data. The model is able to reconstruct the observed phase difference distribution, and hence, provides a dynamical explanation for observed phase locking. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 1161-1178, 2011.

Although there is a large body of knowledge regarding single neuron responses to periodic stimuli, responses at the scale of cortical populations are incompletely understood. The characteristics of large-scale neuronal activity during periodic stimulation speak directly to the mechanisms underlying collective neuronal activity. Their accurate elucidation is hence a vital prelude to constructing and evaluating large-scale computational and biophysical models of the brain. Electroencephalographic data was recorded from eight human subjects while periodic vibrotactile stimuli were applied to the fingertip. Time frequency decomposition was performed on the multi-channel data in order to investigate relative changes in the power and phase distributions at stimulus-related frequencies. We observed phase locked oscillatory activity at multiple stimulus-specific frequencies, in particular at ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 2:3 to the stimulus frequency. These phase locked components were found to be modulated differently across the range of stimulus frequencies, with oscillatory responses most robustly sustained around 30 Hz. In contrast, no robust frequency-locked responses were apparent in the power changes. These results demonstrate n:m phase synchronization between cortical oscillations in the somatosensory system and an external periodic signal. We argue that neuronal populations evidence a collective nonlinear response to periodic sensory input. The existence of n:m phase synchronization demonstrates the contribution of intrinsic cortical dynamics to stimulus encoding and provides a novel phenomenological criteria for the validation of large-scale models of the brain.

To isolate attentional processes, we investigated neural correlates of anticipatory attention when estimating stimulus duration. Magneto-encephalographic (MEG) activity was recorded in fourteen healthy right-handed volunteers, who were cued to attend to either the duration or the intensity of a visual stimulus. We report an increase of gamma-band oscillations over right fronto-central and parietal regions when subjects are prompted to attend to duration, which is not present when subjects are cued to attend to intensity. Cue-related alpha power decreases over occipito-parietal regions were similar in the two conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that the right fronto-parietal network observed repeatedly in time estimation imaging studies is indeed involved in attentional control rather than stimulus processing. Moreover, they underline the supramodal property of time dimension that goes beyond purely perceptive features.

Neurofeedback for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: From efficacy to neurophysiology specificity effect	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Neurofeedback; Self-regulation; Efficacy; Specificity; Electrophysiology	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CLINICAL-TRIAL; ADHD; BRAIN; CHILDREN; EEG; POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; IMPULSIVITY; ANNOTATION	Clinical guidelines for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) recommend a multimodal treatment encompassing pharmacological medication with methylphenidate, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and family treatments. Methylphenidate is the most effective treatment, though the relatively high rate of partial responders, and the possible parental reluctance against the pharmacological treatment. Thus, it is interesting to consider new non-pharmacological therapies based, such as CBT, on the learning capacity of children to self-regulate their behavior. Neurofeedback is interesting insofar as it would allow children to acquire self-control over certain brain activity patterns to improve the regulation of their behavior in daily-life situation. Early studies on neurofeedback in ADHD are nearly 30 years old. Two training protocols were created, based on EEG abnormalities in ADHD. First training allows the modulation of EEG frequency bands: increased activity in the beta band, or decreased activity in the theta rhythm. The second allows an increase in a slow cortical potential. In both protocols, feedback of the brain activity patterns is given to children in real time as a kind of computer game, and changes that are made in the desired direction are rewarded, i.e., positively reinforced. The evidence-based level of the neurofeedback is still unclear. But, unlike other mental disorders, many studies have investigated the effect of this treatment on symptoms of ADHD. Thus, we propose to analyze the data of literature and especially recent studies. A meta-analysis and randomized controlled studies seem to confirm the efficacy and the possible place of neurofeedback in the multimodal treatment strategies of ADHD. But, if this treatment supposes to allow self-regulation of children behavior by learning the control of EEG activity, the specific mechanisms of action on brain activity remains problematic. Thus, we propose to identify methodological and neurophysiological areas for future research on this therapy involving the subject and electrophysiology in psychiatry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A performance study of the wavelet-phase stability (WPS) in auditory selective attention	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Wavelet phase-stability; Auditory selective attention; Wavelet coherence; Correlation coefficient	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LABILE BRAIN; EVOKED POTENTIALS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; TRANSIENTS; COHERENCE; SIGNAL; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION	Large-scale neural correlates of auditory selective attention reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been identified by using the complex wavelet-phase stability measure (WPS). In this paper, we study the feasibility of using this amplitude independent measure, the WPS in extracting the correlates of attention by comparing its performance to the widely used linear interdependency measures, i.e., the wavelet coherence and the correlation coefficient. The outcome reveals that the WPS outperforms the other two measures in discriminating both the attended and unattended single sweep auditory late responses (ALRs). It is concluded that the proposed WPS provides a faster (in terms of less sweeps which are required) and robust objective quantification of selective attention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that phase-reset must not be proven in order to accept the general involvement of phase in ERP-generation as it is only one of several possible mechanisms influencing or generating certain ERP-components. Supporting data are presented showing that positive peaks of ongoing pre-stimulus alpha activity are not randomly distributed in time across trials. Most importantly, we found that a certain kind of pre-stimulus phase concentration that represents a continuous development of an alpha wave up to the time window where the P1 is generated is associated with an enlarged event-related component. We conclude that ongoing oscillations cannot be considered random background noise (even before stimulus onset) and that there are probably more phase-mechanisms that can contribute to the ERP-generation.

J	Laganaro, M; Perret, C				Laganaro, Marina; Perret, Cyril			Comparing Electrophysiological Correlates of Word Production in Immediate and Delayed Naming Through the Analysis of Word Age of Acquisition Effects	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						ERP; Language production; Picture naming; Age of acquisition	OF-ACQUISITION; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL COMPLEXITY; IMAGE VARIABILITY; SPEECH PRODUCTION; LEXICAL DATABASE; NAME AGREEMENT; FREQUENCY; FRENCH	Most EEG studies analysing speech production with event related brain potential (ERP) have adopted silent metalinguistic tasks or delayed or tacit picture naming in order to avoid possible artefacts during motor preparation. A central issue in the interpretation of these results is whether the processes involved in those tasks are comparable to those involved in overt speech production. In the present study we addressed a methodological issue about the integration of stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs in immediate overt picture naming in comparison to delayed production, coupled with a theoretical point on the effect of word Age of Acquisition (AoA). High density EEG recordings were used and waveform analyses and spatio-temporal segmentation were combined on stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs. The same sequence and duration of topographic maps appeared in the immediate and delayed production until around 350 ms after picture onset, revealing similar encoding processes until the beginning of phonological encoding, but modulations linked to word AoA were only observed in the immediate production. Considering stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs together allowed to identify that a stable topography starting around 350 ms lasts 30 ms longer for late-acquired than for early-acquired words. This difference falls within the time-window of phonological encoding and its modulation can be linked to the longer production latencies for late-acquired words.

The acquisition of fast predictive mechanisms might be possible due to the extensive training characterizing expertise performance. Recent EEG studies on piano performance reported a negative event-related potential (ERP) triggered in the ACC 70 ms before performance errors (pitch errors due to incorrect keypress). This ERP component, termed pre-error related negativity (pre-ERN), was assumed to reflect processes of error detection in advance. However, some questions remained to be addressed: (i) Does the electrophysiological marker prior to errors reflect an error signal itself or is it related instead to the implementation of control mechanisms? (ii) Does the posterior frontomedial cortex (pFMC, including ACC) interact with other brain regions to implement control adjustments following motor prediction of an upcoming error? (iii) Can we gain insight into the electrophysiological correlates of error prediction and control by assessing the local neuronal synchronization and phase interaction among neuronal populations? (iv) Finally, are error detection and control mechanisms defective in pianists with musician's dystonia (MD), a focal task-specific dystonia resulting from dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamic-frontal circuits? Consequently, we investigated the EEG oscillatory and phase synchronization correlates of error detection and control during piano performances in healthy pianists and in a group of pianists with MD. In healthy pianists, the main outcomes were increased pre-error theta and beta band oscillations over the pFMC and 1315 Hz phase synchronization, between the pFMC and the right lateral prefrontal cortex, which predicted corrective mechanisms. In MD patients, the pattern of phase synchronization appeared in a different frequency band (6-8 Hz) and correlated with the severity of the disorder. The present findings shed new light on the neural mechanisms, which might implement motor prediction by means of forward control processes, as they function in healthy pianists and in their altered form in patients with MD.

Our objective was to investigate the relationships between episodic memory deficits and electro-encephalography [EEG] abnormalities occurring during sleep in patients with early AD. Postlearning sleep was recorded in 14 patients with mild to moderate AD, and 14 healthy elderly controls after they performed an episodic memory task derived from the Grober and Buschke's procedure. For each sleep stage, the relative power and mean frequency in each band were analyzed. Relative to agematched controls, AD patients presented faster mean theta frequency in both REM sleep and slow wave sleep [SWS]. In AD patients, a correlative analysis revealed that faster theta frequency during SWS was associated with better delayed episodic recall. We assume that increased theta activity reflects changes in neuronal activity to maintain memory performance, indicating that compensatory mechanisms already described at the waking state could also be engaged during SWS.

In 2007, Schiff et al reported a patient in a minimally conscious state (MCS) who responded to deep brain stimulation (DBS), but clinicians cannot predict which patients might respond prior to the implantation of electrodes. Methods. A patient in a MCS for 5 years participated in an ABA design alternating between repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation. rTMS (condition A) involved the delivery of 10 trains of 100 stimuli at 20 Hz using a stimulator with a 70-mm figure-of-eight coil to elicit a contraction of the abductor pollicis brevis. Condition B used median nerve electrical stimulation. Results. After peripheral stimulation, the patient did not exhibit clinical, behavioral, or electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. The frequency of specific and meaningful behaviors increased after rTMS, along with the absolute and relative power of the EEG delta, beta, and alpha bands. Conclusion. These results suggest that rTMS may improve awareness and arousal in MCS. If these results are reproducible, rTMS may identify subgroups of MCS patients who might benefit from DBS.

Here we investigated whether ischemic adenosine release and subsequent functional inhibition via the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R) contributes to post-ischemic delta activity. Methods: Rats were subjected to episodes of non-injuring transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) under chloral hydrate anesthesia. Results: We found that a GCI lasting only 10 s was enough to induce a brief discharge of rhythmic delta activity (RDA) with a peak frequency just below 1 Hz quantified as an increase by twofold of the 0.5-1.5 Hz spectral power. This post-ischemic RDA did not occur following administration of the A(1)R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. Nevertheless, a similar RDA could be induced in rats not subjected to GCI, by systemic administration of the A(1)R agonist N-6-cyclopentyladenosine. Conclusions: Our data suggest that A(1)R activation at levels that occur following cerebral ischemia underlies the transient post-ischemic RDA. Significance: It is likely that the functional, thus potentially reversible, synaptic disconnection by A(1)R activation promotes slow oscillations in the cortical networks.

J	Hartmann, T; Schulz, H; Weisz, N				Hartmann, Thomas; Schulz, Hannah; Weisz, Nathan			Probing of brain states in real-time: introducing the ConSole environment	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; single-trial analysis; real-time analysis; oscillation; brain states; neurofeedback		Recent years have seen huge advancements in the methods available and used in neuroscience employing EEG or MEG. However, the standard approach is to average a large number of trials for experimentally defined conditions in order to reduce intertrial-variability, i.e., treating it as a source of "noise." Yet it is now more and more accepted that trial-to-trial fluctuations bear functional significance, reflecting fluctuations of "brain states" that predispose perception and action. Such effects are often revealed in a pre-stimulus period, when comparing response variability to an invariant stimulus. However such offline analyses are disadvantageous as they are correlational by drawing conclusions in a post hoc-manner and stimulus presentation is random with respect to the feature of interest. A more direct test is to trigger stimulus presentation when the relevant feature is present. The current paper introduces Constance System for Online EEG (ConSole), a software package capable of analyzing ongoing EEG/MEG in real-time and presenting auditory and visual stimuli via internal routines. Stimulation via external devices (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) or third-party software (e.g., PsyScope X) is possible by sending TTL-triggers. With ConSole it is thus possible to target the stimulation at specific brain states. In contrast to many available applications, ConSole is open-source. Its modular design enhances the power of the software as it can be easily adapted to new challenges and writing new experiments is an easy task. ConSole is already pre-equipped with modules performing standard signal processing steps. The software is also independent from the EEG/MEG system, as long as a driver can be written (currently two EEG systems are supported). Besides a general introduction, we present benchmark data regarding performance and validity of the calculations used, as well as three example applications of ConSole in different settings.

Event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor EEG rhythms in hemiparetic patients with acute stroke	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Acute stroke; Motor cortex; Plasticity; Reorganization; Affected hemisphere	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR RECOVERY; SUBCORTICAL INFARCTION; POSTSTROKE HEMIPARESIS; STRIATOCAPSULAR STROKE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; BRAIN ACTIVATION; CAPSULAR STROKE; REORGANIZATION; MOVEMENT	Previous neuroimaging studies based on neurovascular coupling have shown that stroke affects both, strength and spatial extent of brain activation during upper limb movements. Here, we investigated the sub-second amplitude dynamics of a direct neuronal measure, i.e., event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG oscillations during finger movements, in patients with acute cortical and subcortical stroke. Acute cortical strokes were found to decrease the ERD of alpha oscillations for the affected pericentral sensorimotor areas compared to a control group. Within the cortical stroke group, the affected hemisphere showed a smaller alpha-ERD compared to the unaffected hemisphere when each was contralateral to the acting hand. Furthermore, when cortical stroke patients moved their paretic hand, the ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) alpha-ERD was stronger than the contralateral (ipsilesional) ERD. Interestingly, the alpha-ERD amplitude in a hemisphere with a cortical stroke was relatively well preserved for non-paretic hand movements compared to alpha-ERD amplitude for paretic hand movements. This finding provides a new perspective for assessing the rehabilitative potential, which could be utilized through training of the still responsive cortical network, e.g., via enforced use of the paretic hand.

Robots can be used to emulate motor tasks that involve haptic interaction with objects. These studies may provide useful insights on how humans acquire a novel motor skill. Here we address motor skill learning in a 2D ball putting task, by looking at both kinematic and EEG correlates of learning and performance. Participants grasped the handle of a manipulandum and had to hit a virtual ball in order to put it into a target region (hole). The robot was used to render the contact force with the ball during impact. At every trial, with respect to the initial ball position, the hole appeared in one of three different directions and two distances, selected randomly. The experimental protocol included a total of 300 movements. In movement kinematics we looked at the effects of learning and target distance. In EEG signals, we looked at the effect of learning and the effect of success/failure on the ongoing brain activity. Subjects managed to improve their performance through practice, in all directions and at both target distances. Direction did not affect the performance much, but greater target distance induced greater errors. With regards to the EEG activity, we found that (i) practice led to an increased theta synchronization in the frontal areas; (ii) successful trials were preceded by higher theta synchronization, and alpha and beta desynchronization. These results suggest that EEG signals can be used to monitor the learning process and to predict the outcome (success/failure) of individual trials. These findings open possibilities to develop new schemes to promote and facilitate learning, which integrate EEG and robots.

Altered directional connectivity in Parkinson's disease during performance of a visually guided task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Partial directed coherence; EEG; Connectivity; Visually guided; Levodopa	CORTICOCORTICAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; VOLUME CONDUCTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DYNAMIC CHANGES; EEG COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT	Recent animal studies have suggested that cortical areas may play a greater role in the modulation of abnormal oscillatory activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) than previously recognized. We investigated task and medication-dependent, EEG-based directional cortical connectivity in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and low gamma (31-50 Hz) frequency bands in 10 PD subjects and 10 age-matched controls. All subjects performed a visually guided task previously shown to modulate abnormal oscillatory activity in PD subjects. We examined the connectivity in the simultaneously-recorded EEG between 5 electrode regions of interest (fronto-central, left and right sensorimotor, central and occipital) using a sparse, multivariate, autoregressive-based partial directed coherence method. For comparison, we utilized traditional Fourier analysis to evaluate task-dependent frequency spectra modulation in these same regions. While the spectral analysis revealed some overall differences between PD and control subjects, it demonstrated relatively modest changes between regions. In contrast, the partial directed coherence-based analysis revealed multifaceted, regionally and directionally-dependent alterations of connectivity in PD subjects during both movement preparation and execution. Connectivity was particularly altered posteriorly, suggesting abnormalities in visual and visuo-motor processing in PD. Moreover, connectivity measures in the alpha, beta and low gamma frequency ranges correlated with motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scores in PD subjects withdrawn from medication. Levodopa administration only partially restored connectivity, and in some cases resulted in further exacerbation of abnormalities. Our results support the notion that PD is associated with significant alterations in connectivity between brain regions, and that these changes can be non-invasively detected in the EEG using partial directed coherence methods. Thus, the role of EEG to monitor PD may need to be further expanded. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The interface uses electroencephalographic signals and works with three mental tasks, which are the imagination of right or left hand movements and generation of words beginning with the same random letter. This research uses a data set to perform a simulation of real-time classification, which is the pseudo-online technique, in order to have a preliminary view of the performance of the proposed BCI architecture. Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to recognize the mental tasks. The feature extraction uses the Power Spectral Density and the choice of EEG channel and frequency uses the Kullback-Leibler symmetric divergence. A reclassification model is proposed to stabilize the classifier, and the Sammon map is used to visualize the class separation.

Here, we bring together these two literatures to explore the relationship between alpha activity and participants' introspective judgments of attentional state as each varied from trial-to-trial during performance of a visual detection task. We collected participants' subjective ratings of perceptual decision confidence and attentional state on continuous scales on each trial of a rapid serial visual presentation detection task while recording EEG. We found that confidence and attentional state ratings were largely uncorrelated with each other, but both were strongly associated with task performance and post-stimulus decision-related EEG activity. Crucially, attentional state ratings were also negatively associated with prestimulus EEG alpha power. Attesting to the robustness of this association, we were able to classify attentional state ratings via prestimulus alpha power on a single-trial basis. Moreover, when we repeated these analyses after smoothing the time series of attentional state ratings and alpha power with increasingly large sliding windows, both the correlations and classification performance improved considerably, with the peaks occurring at a sliding window size of approximately 7 min worth of trials. Our results therefore suggest that slow fluctuations in attentional state in the order of minutes are reflected in spontaneous alpha power. Since these subjective attentional state ratings were associated with objective measures of both behavior and neural activity, we suggest that they provide a simple and effective estimate of task engagement that could prove useful in operational settings that require human operators to maintain a sustained focus of visual attention.

Methods: The participants were 114 children, aged 8-16 years. MMNs were elicited by two deviants in duration that occurred in an uninterrupted sound within a passive oddball paradigm, and each trial lasted 650 ms with 130 samples. CoRaST was derived from the frequency-domain MMN model through Fourier transformation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the wavelet transformation-based inter-trial coherence (ITC) was taken as a reference. Results: Performances of the proposed CoRaST and ITC were similar in evaluating the correlation of MMN activity among single trials. However, the analysis of electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings comprising approximately 330 trials at one channel took approximately 0.12 s with CoRaST, whereas ITC required approximately 45 s in our workstation. Conclusions: CoRaST has the potential to evaluate the correlation of MMN activity among single trials in a real-time system. Furthermore, the new method can be facilitated to study other event-related potentials (ERPs) of evoked or induced brain activity. Significance: The correlation of ERP activity among single trials can be immediately inspected during the ERP data collection in a real-time system.

We aimed to examine the acute changes in this corticomuscular coupling due to muscle fatigue and its effect on the steadiness of the exerted force. We quantified the coherence between the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded over the sensorimotor cortex and the rectified surface electromyogram (EMG) of the tibialis anterior muscle as well as the coefficient of variance of the dorsiflexion force (Force(CV)) and sum of the auto-power spectral density function of the force within the beta-band (Force(beta-PSD)) during 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for 60 s before (prefatiguing task) and after (postfatiguing task) muscle fatigue induced by sustained isometric contraction at 50% of MVC until exhaustion in seven healthy male subjects. The magnitude of the EEG-EMG coherence increased in the postfatiguing task in six of seven subjects. The maximal peak of EEG-EMG coherence stayed within the beta-band in both pre- and postfatiguing tasks. Interestingly, two subjects, who had no significant EEG-EMG coherence in the prefatiguing task, showed significant coherence in the postfatiguing task. Additionally, ForceCV and Force beta-PSD significantly increased after muscle fatigue. These data suggest that when muscle fatigue develops, the central nervous system enhances oscillatory muscular activity in the beta-band stronger coupled with the sensorimotor cortex activity accomplishing the sustained isometric contraction at lower performance levels.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the sleep structure of children with dysregulation of the GH/insulin-like growth factor axis. Methods: Laboratory polysomnographic sleep recordings were obtained from 10 GHD children and 20 normal healthy age-matched children. The classical sleep parameters were evaluated together with sleep microstructure, by means of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), in GHD patients and compared to the control group. Results: GHD children showed a significant decrease in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, movement time and in non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 2. Although some indicators of sleep fragmentation were increased in GHD children, we found a general decrease in EEG arousability represented by a significant global decrease in the CAP rate, involving all CAP A phase subtypes. Conclusions: The analysis of sleep microstructure by means of CAP, in children with GHD, showed a reduction of transient EEG amplitude oscillations. Further studies are needed in order to better clarify whether GH therapy is able to modify sleep microstructure in GHD children, and the relationships between sleep microstructure, hormonal secretion and neurocognitive function in these patients.

The present study assessed the patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during the encoding and retrieval phases of short-term memory in these two aMCI subtypes, to identify potential functional differences according to the neuropsychological profile. Continuous EEG was recorded in 43 aMCI patients, whose 16 sd-aMCI and 27 md-aMCI, and 36 age-matched controls (EC) during delayed match-to-sample tasks for face and letter stimuli. At encoding, attended stimuli elicited parietal alpha (8-12 Hz) power decrease (desynchronization), whereas distracting stimuli were associated with alpha power increase (synchronization) over right central sites. No difference was observed in parietal alpha desynchronization among the three groups. For attended faces, the alpha synchronization underlying suppression of distracting letters was reduced in both aMCI subgroups, but more severely in md-aMCI cases that differed significantly from EC. At retrieval, the early N250r recognition effect was significantly reduced for faces in md-aMCI as compared to both sd-aMCI and EC. The results suggest a differential alteration of working memory cerebral processes for faces in the two aMCI subtypes, face covert recognition processes being specifically altered in md-aMCI.

Here we examine whether prestimulus oscillatory brain activity can influence the ability to retrieve episodic memories. Neural activity in the theta-frequency band (4-8 Hz) was enhanced before presentation of test items which elicited accurate recollection of contextual details of the prior study episode ("source retrieval"), relative to trials for which item recognition was successful but source retrieval failed. Poststimulus theta activity was also related to source retrieval, and the magnitude of poststimulus theta was predicted by the magnitude of the prestimulus theta effects. The results suggest that ongoing neural processes occurring before stimulus onset might play a critical role in readying the brain for successful memory retrieval.

Methods: Based on a 64-channel eyes closed resting EEG we combined local and global coherence measures in order to reduce volume conduction and reference effects. We used a two point longitudinal design in order to analyze intraindividual change during school-age (n = 40; 6-18 years). Coherence was analyzed within individually adjusted frequency bands and around iPF (= individual alpha peak frequency). Results: Both local and global resting coherence was largest in the alpha range and particularly around iPF. Local synchronisation was larger in the left compared with the right hemisphere. Controlling for increases in iPF, synchronisation increased with age, with global changes being most pronounced in the alpha range. Moreover age-related changes suggest an earlier development in girls. Conclusions: Our data provides evidence that both local and global functional integration increases during normal development within school-age. Significance: This general pattern - combined with more specific effects of sex and frequency - may help to specify deviations in developmental disorders.

However, BDNF (+/-) mice exhibit reduced cortical inhibition and disrupted balance of excitation/inhibition synaptic transmission. We investigated penicillin-induced focal cortical epileptiform activity and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power of BDNF (+/-) mice, by using electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings. BDNF (+/-) mice (n = 10) and wild type littermates (n = 9) were anesthetized with i.p. urethane (1.750 g/kg). The recordings of ECoG were carried out by using a data acquisition system and 100 IU penicillin was administered intracortically to induce epileptiform activity. The latencies for the onset of spikes and the amplitude of the spikes showed no differences. However the frequency of the spikes was significantly lower in BDNF (+/-) mice at 40th and 45th min following penicillin injection. Additionally, the EEG power for both BDNF (+/-) and wild type mice reduced after penicillin injection and enhanced during epileptiform activity. The spectral power analysis also revealed that the absolute Gamma power of BDNF (+/-) was significantly smaller than wild types. The results of the present study provide the first in vivo electrophysiological evidence that BDNF heterozygous mice exhibited suppressed epileptiform activity. Moreover, reduced levels of BDNF led to a reduction of absolute Gamma band power. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Negro, F; Farina, D				Negro, Francesco; Farina, Dario			Linear transmission of cortical oscillations to the neural drive to muscles is mediated by common projections to populations of motoneurons in humans	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							PULSE FREQUENCY-MODULATION; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MOTOR CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; PRINCIPLES; NEURONS; STROKE; OUTPUT	Non-technical summary Since the human central nervous system controls muscle contraction through inputs to spinal motoneurons, oscillations recorded on the primary motor cortex during voluntary movements are correlated with the electrical activity produced on the surface of the muscles. We show through theoretical derivations and experimental recordings that cortical input is transmitted partly in a linear way to the population of motoneurons. The results demonstrate the effective spread of the cortical projections to the motoneuron pool to allow an efficient control of the muscle force output.Oscillations in the primary motor cortex are transmitted through the corticospinal tract to the motoneuron pool. This transmission has been previously investigated using coherence analysis between concurrent recordings of EEG and surface EMG signals. In this study we used a mathematical derivation and motor unit recordings in vivo to investigate the origin of linear transmission of cortical input to the motoneuron spike trains (neural drive to muscle). The theoretical derivation showed that a common input spread to a relatively small number of motoneurons is partly transmitted in a linear way, overcoming the interference signal generated by the non-linearity of the individual motoneurons. We further calculated the corticomuscular coherence between experimental EEG signals and the cumulative spike trains of motor units in the abductor digiti minimi muscle of seven healthy men. The experimental results indicated that, on average, only four to five motor units were sufficient to reach the same level of coherence as estimated from the surface EMG. The results demonstrate that linearity in the transmission of the cortical input to motoneurons through the corticospinal tract is achieved because (i) this input is largely common to all motoneurons, and (ii) its frequency content requires only a small fraction of active motoneurons to be accurately sampled. In this way, the central nervous system can directly transmit oscillations to the control signals to muscles for practically the entire range of functionally relevant forces.

Working memory is an arousal dependant cognitive function. This study used functional MRI (fMRI) as a surrogate marker of working memory to evaluate the sensitivity of patients' hypoactive regions to arousal in a subpopulation of rehabilitated patients. Are hypoactive regions sensitive to arousal? Does the deficit result from arousal deficit or improper coupling with cognitive activity? Eighteen patients and matched controls were recruited. Participants performed a working memory task during combined electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI measurements. Cortical regions sensitive to arousal were defined as those which were inversely correlated with low EEG frequencies. Overlap between the arousal-sensitive and hypoactive regions was assessed by mutual information. Arousal-cognitive coupling was evaluated by the correlation between the arousal effect and the task effect. In the patient group, most hypoactive voxels were sensitive to arousal and corresponded to the prefronto-parietal network But patients had no arousal deficit. Although arousal seems to improve cognitive activity in most of the patients' cortical areas, this coupling appears to be specifically disturbed in their hypoactive regions. In conclusion, although increasing arousal may help cognition, it may do so in an unspecific way. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Selective Tuning of Hippocampal Oscillations by Phasic Locus Coeruleus Activation in Awake Male Rats	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						EEG; norepinephrine; noradrenaline; theta; gamma	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NORADRENERGIC BETA-RECEPTORS; THETA-RHYTHM; DENTATE GYRUS; CERULEUS ACTIVATION; BEHAVING RATS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; RAPID HABITUATION; NOREPINEPHRINE; RESPONSES	Theta and gamma oscillations are thought to provide signal sets that promote neural coding of cognitive processes. Over 40 yrs ago, Jeffrey Gray reported event-related changes in a narrow band of hippocampal theta (7.5-8.5 Hz) which appeared to involve norepinephrine (NE) release from, the noradrenergic nucleus, the locus coeruleus (LC). These event-related alterations in EEG were elicited by novelty, attentional changes, the use of preparatory signals, and signal-mismatch events. Gray et al. have since provided indirect evidence that supports the role of NE in the modulation of 7.5- to 8.5-Hz oscillations in the hippocampus, but studies investigating the effects of direct LC activation in awake rats have been lacking. In the present study, dentate gyrus EEG was examined during glutamatergic activation of the LC in awake male rats in relation to plasticity effects on simultaneously recorded perforant path-evoked field potentials. Glutamate-injected animals were divided into three groups based on histological and plasticity outcomes; perforant path stimulated controls were also included. The three injected groups were: (1) rats with positive LC placements, demonstrating NE-LTP of the dentate gyrus evoked potential, (2) rats with positive LC placements, without NE-LTP, and (3) Non-LC injected controls. Activation of the LC in awake rats demonstrating NE-LTP increased the relative power of 7- to 9-Hz theta, a result masked in broader 4- to 12-Hz analysis. Comparatively, urethane-anesthetized rats showed an increase in 5-7 Hz, but not 7- to 9-Hz theta with LC activation. Discriminative analysis in the approximate theta band predicted by Gray (7.4-8.5 Hz) revealed that awake rats demonstrating NE-LTP had increased relative power in this narrow frequency compared to rats receiving perforant path only (noninjected) and Non-LC injected rats. Transiently reduced gamma (20-40 Hz) relative power was most commonly observed in rats with verified LC placements failing to express NE-LTP. Given current theories of LC function, these results suggest oscillatory tuning within the theta and gamma range may facilitate shifts in cognitive set. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Dysfunctional Prefrontal Cortical Network Activity and Interactions following Cannabinoid Receptor Activation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL; CORTEX; GAMMA; EEG; PLACE	Coordinated activity spanning anatomically distributed neuronal networks underpins cognition and mediates limbic-cortical interactions during learning, memory, and decision-making. We used CP55940, a potent agonist of brain cannabinoid receptors known to disrupt coordinated activity in hippocampus, to investigate the roles of network oscillations during hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) interactions in rats. During quiet wakefulness and rest, CP55940 dose-dependently reduced 0.1-30 Hz local field potential power in CA1 of the hippocampus while concurrently decreasing 30-100 Hz power in mPFC; these contrasting population-level effects were paralleled by differential effects on underlying single-unit activity in the two structures. During decision-making phases of a spatial working memory task, CP5540-induced deficits in hippocampal theta and prefrontal gamma oscillations were observed alongside disrupted theta-frequency coherence between the two structures. These changes in coordinated limbic-cortical network activities correlated with (1) reduced accuracy of task performance, (2) impaired phase-locking of prefrontal single-unit spiking to the local gamma and hippocampal theta rhythms, and (3) impaired task-dependent activity in a subset of mPFC units. In addition to highlighting the importance of CA1-mPFC network oscillations for cognition, these results implicate disrupted theta-frequency coordination of CA1-mPFC activity in the cognitive deficits caused by exogenous activation of brain cannabinoid receptors.

The role of alpha-band brain oscillations as a sensory suppression mechanism during selective attention	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						alpha; brain; oscillations; selection; attention; biasing; suppression; EEG		Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating. The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64-256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8-14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information. That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against.

J	Dugue, L; Marque, P; VanRullen, R				Dugue, Laura; Marque, Philippe; VanRullen, Rufin			The Phase of Ongoing Oscillations Mediates the Causal Relation between Brain Excitation and Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ALPHA-RHYTHM; EXCITABILITY; CORTEX; STIMULATION; AREAS; TIME	Why does neuronal activity in sensory brain areas sometimes give rise to perception, and sometimes not? Although neuronal noise is often invoked as the key factor, a portion of this variability could also be due to the history and current state of the brain affecting cortical excitability. Here we directly test this idea by examining whether the phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity is causally linked with modulations of cortical excitability and with visual perception. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over human visual cortex to induce illusory perceptions (phosphenes) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded. Subjects reported the presence or absence of an induced phosphene following a single pulse of TMS at perceptual threshold. The phase of ongoing alpha (similar to 10 Hz) oscillations within 400 ms before the pulse significantly covaried with the perceptual outcome. This effect was observed in occipital regions around the site of TMS, as well as in a distant frontocentral region. In both regions, we found a systematic relationship between prepulse EEG phase and perceptual performance: phosphene probability changed by similar to 15% between opposite phases. In summary, we provide direct evidence for a chain of causal relations between the phase of ongoing oscillations, neuronal excitability, and visual perception: ongoing oscillations create periodic "windows of excitability," with sensory perception being more likely to occur at specific phases.

Neuromagnetic oscillations and hemodynamic correlates of P50 suppression in schizophrenia	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Auditory gating; fMRI; Magnetoencephalography; Oscillator; Alpha	ALPHA-BAND; BOLD-CONTRAST; RESPONSES; RHYTHM; FMRI; NETWORKS; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; NOISE; EEG	Behavioral and electrophysiological data indicate compromised stimulus suppression in schizophrenia. The physiological basis of this effect and its contributions to the etiology of the disease are poorly understood. We examined neural and metabolic measures of P50 suppression in 12 patients with schizophrenia and controls. First, whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) assessed amplitudes of left- and right-hemispheric evoked responses and induced oscillations. Secondly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measured the hemodynamic responses to pairs of beeps with a short interval (500 ms) as compared with those with a long interval (1500 ms). The suppression of alpha power (8-13 Hz) time-locked to the stimuli was negatively correlated with the suppression of evoked components and the hemodynamic measures. Remarkably, the suppression of alpha power was reduced in the patients already prior to stimulus onset. Conceivably, alpha oscillations play a central role in stimulus adaptation of neuronal networks and reflect an active mechanism for sensory suppression. The reduced stimulus suppression in schizophrenia seems to be in part due to impaired generation of alpha oscillations in the auditory cortex, resulting in higher metabolic demand as detected by fMRI. Delayed recovery of alpha rhythm may reflect an impaired gating function and contribute to sensory and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sleep complaints are among the most prominent complaints accompanying tinnitus, but objective data are rare. In this study, we examined prospectively the subjective and objective sleep parameters of this patient population in order to determine differences in sleep disturbances associated with chronic tinnitus compared to matched controls. Forty-four subjects (22 with tinnitus and 22 controls without tinnitus), unselected with respect to sleep complaints, participated in this study. The analysis involved 1-week sleep diaries, subjective sleep questionnaires and 1 night of polysomnographic (PSG) assessment. Compared to matched controls, the tinnitus group showed lower subjective sleep quality as measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep diaries, but no significant difference in objective polysomnograph sleep parameters (i.e. sleep latency, efficiency). However, quantitative non-rapid eye movement sleep analysis revealed lower spectral power in the delta frequency band in the tinnitus group compared to controls, and this decrease was correlated with subjective sleep complaints (the lower the delta spectral power, the greater the complaints). This is the first report of an electrophysiological correlate of sleep difficulties supportive of subjective sleep complaints in the tinnitus population.

While alpha-related physiology in V2 and V4 appears consistent with a role in attention-related suppression, in IT, alpha reactivity appears conflicted with such a role. We addressed this issue directly by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potentials and multiunit activities from the IT of macaque monkeys during performance of an intermodal selective attention task (visual versus auditory). We found that (1) before visual stimulus onset (-200 to 0 ms), attention to visual input increased ongoing alpha power in IT relative to attention to auditory input, and (2) in contrast to the prevailing view of alpha inhibition, the increased ongoing alpha activity is accompanied by increased concurrent multiunit firing and facilitates visual stimulus processing. These results suggest that ongoing alpha oscillations in IT play a different functional role than that in the occipital cortex and may be part of the neuronal mechanism representing task-relevant information.

We hypothesized that arithmetic-operation effect (AOE) will show greater modulation of early components (P100, P200) in high-frequency erps; late components (P300, N300) and slow waves in low-frequency ERP when large-size problems are employed. Methods: Fourteen normal human subjects mentally processed large-and small-size addition, division, multiplication and subtraction problems. Spatiotemporal differences between these arithmetic-operations were studied by way of comparing amplitudes and latencies of early, late and slow waves. Results: All components were modulated by AOE. Modulated was observed as early as 100 ms post-question presentation (in high-frequency ERP components). AOE was very pronounced in large-size problems (in low-frequency ERP components). Conclusions: Results suggest that modulation by AOE of ERP components is improved when large-size problems and low-frequency ERP components are employed. Thus, differentiation of neuropsychological processes manifested by amplitude and latency of ERP components may be best studied by first separating components into high- and low-frequency erps. Significance: Findings raise the potential of obtaining ERP indices that may improve findings about the degree (and time) of engagement of cognitive processes (e.g. Strategy employed in MAP).

Three Ca(V)3 channel subtypes are expressed in the thalamocortical (TC) system, but their respective roles for the sleep EEG are unclear. Ca(V)3.3 protein is expressed abundantly in the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), an essential oscillatory burst generator. We report the characterization of a transgenic Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mouse line and demonstrate that Ca(V)3.3 channels are indispensable for nRt function and for sleep spindles, a hallmark of natural sleep. The absence of Ca(V)3.3 channels prevented oscillatory bursting in the low-frequency (4-10 Hz) range in nRt cells but spared tonic discharge. In contrast, adjacent TC neurons expressing Ca(V)3.1 channels retained low-threshold bursts. Nevertheless, the generation of synchronized thalamic network oscillations underlying sleep-spindle waves was weakened markedly because of the reduced inhibition of TC neurons via nRt cells. T currents in Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice were <30% compared with those in WT mice, and the remaining current, carried by Ca(V)3.2 channels, generated dendritic [Ca2+](i) signals insufficient to provoke oscillatory bursting that arises from interplay with Ca2+-dependent small conductance-type 2 K+ channels. Finally, naturally sleeping Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice showed a selective reduction in the power density of the sigma frequency band (10-12 Hz) at transitions from NREM to REM sleep, with other EEG waves remaining unaltered. Together, these data identify a central role for Ca(V)3.3 channels in the rhythmogenic properties of the sleep-spindle generator and provide a molecular target to elucidate the roles of sleep spindles for brain function and development.

A comparison of methods for assessing alpha phase resetting in electrophysiology, with application to intracerebral EEG in visual areas	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; GENERATION; AMPLITUDE; MEMORY; DESYNCHRONIZATION	There are two competing views on the mechanisms underlying the generation of visual evoked potentials/fields in EEG/MEG. The classical hypothesis assumes an additive wave on top of background noise. Another hypothesis states that the evoked activity can totally or partially arise from a phase resetting of the ongoing alpha rhythm. There is no consensus however, on the best tools for distinguishing between these two hypotheses. In this study, we have tested different measures on a large series of simulations under a variety of scenarios, involving in particular trial-to-trial variability and different dynamics of ongoing alpha rhythm. No single measure or set of measures was found to be necessary or sufficient for defining phase resetting in the context of our simulations. Still, simulations permitted to define criteria that were the most reliable in practice for distinguishing additive and phase resetting hypotheses. We have then applied these criteria on intracerebral EEG data recordings in the visual areas during a visual discrimination task. We investigated the intracerebral channels that presented both ERP and ongoing alpha oscillations (n = 37). Within these channels, a total of 30% fulfilled phase resetting criteria during the generation of the visual evoked potential, based on criteria derived from simulations. Moreover, 19% of the 37 channels presented dependence of the ERP on the level of pre-stimulus alpha. Only 5% of channels fulfilled both the simulation-related criteria and dependence on baseline alpha level. Our simulation study points out to the difficulty of clearly assessing phase resetting based on observed macroscopic electrophysiological signals. Still, some channels presented an indication of phase resetting in the context of our simulations. This needs to be confirmed by further work, in particular at a smaller recording scale.

Recording the adult zebrafish cerebral field potential during pentylenetetrazole seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Epilepsy; Zebrafish; EEG; Pentylenetetrazole; Seizure; Amplifier	VALPROIC ACID; EPILEPSY; ELECTRODE; BRAIN; INHIBITION; MUTATIONS; MECHANISM; IMPEDANCE; IDENTIFY; MODELS	Although the zebrafish is increasingly used as a model organism to study epilepsy, no standard electrophysiological technique for recording electrographic seizures in adult fish exists. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a readily implementable technique for recording pentylenetetrazole seizures in the adult zebrafish. We find that we can consistently record a high quality field potential over the zebrafish cerebrum using an amplification of 5000 V/V and bandpass filtering at corner frequencies of 1.6 and 16 Hz. The cerebral field potential recordings show consistent features in the baseline, pre-seizure, seizure and post-seizure time periods that can be easily recognized by visual inspection as is the case with human and rodent electroencephalogram. Furthermore, numerical analysis of the field potential at the time of seizure onset reveals an increase in the total power, bandwidth and peak frequency in the power spectrum, as is also the case with human and rodent electroencephalogram. The techniques presented herein stand to advance the utility of the adult zebrafish in the study of epilepsy by affording an equivalent to the electroencephalogram used in mammalian models and human patients.

The effect of isoflurane anesthesia on the electroencephalogram assessed by harmonic wavelet bicoherence-based indices	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL ENTROPY; CEREBRAL STATE; BURST PATTERNS; TIME-DELAY; SEVOFLURANE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Bicoherence quantifies the degree of quadratic phase coupling among different frequency components within a signal. Previous studies, using Fourier-based methods of bicoherence calculation (FBIC), have demonstrated that electroencephalographic bicoherence can be related to the end-tidal concentration of inhaled anesthetic drugs. However, FBIC methods require excessively long sections of the encephalogram. This problem might be overcome by the use of wavelet-based methods. In this study, we compare FBIC and a recently developed wavelet bicoherence (WBIC) method as a tool to quantify the effect of isoflurane on the electroencephalogram. We analyzed a set of previously published electroencephalographic data, obtained from 29 patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Nine potential indices of the electroencephalographic anesthetic effect were obtained from the WBIC and FBIC techniques. The relationship between each index and end-tidal concentrations of isoflurane was evaluated using correlation coefficients (r), the inter-individual variations (CV) of index values, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the PKPD models and the prediction probability (P-K). The WBIC-based indices tracked anesthetic effects better than the traditional FBIC-based ones. The DiagBic_En index (derived from the Shannon entropy of the diagonal bicoherence values) performed best [r = 0.79 (0.66-0.92), CV = 0.08 (0.05-0.12), R2 = 0.80 (0.75-0.85), P-K = 0.79 (0.75-0.83)]. Short data segments of similar to 10-30 s were sufficient to reliably calculate the indices of WBIC. The wavelet-based bicoherence has advantages over the traditional Fourier-based bicoherence in analyzing volatile anesthetic effects on the electroencephalogram.

It differs from the other approaches by its computational lightness and its algorithmic simplicity. The method is essentially based on a redefinition of the signal mean envelope, computed thanks to new characteristic points, which offers the possibility to decompose multivariate signals without any projection. The scope of application of the novel algorithm is specified, and a comparison of the 2T-EMD technique with classical methods is performed on various simulated mono- and multivariate signals. The monovariate behaviour of the proposed method on noisy signals is then validated by decomposing a fractional Gaussian noise and an application to real life EEG data is finally presented.

Functional MRI-based identification of brain areas involved in motor imagery for implantable brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2010	Monterey, CA				POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HAND MOVEMENTS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; REPRESENTATIONS; CORTEX; FMRI; EEG; ACTIVATION; EXECUTION	For the development of minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), it is important to accurately localize the area of implantation. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain areas are involved in motor imagery. Twelve healthy subjects performed a motor execution and imagery task during separate fMRI and EEG measurements. fMRI results showed that during imagery, premotor and parietal areas were most robustly activated in individual subjects, but surprisingly, no activation was found in the primary motor cortex. EEG results showed that spectral power decreases in contralateral sensorimotor rhythms (8-24 Hz) during both movement and imagery. To further verify the involvement of the motor imagery areas found with fMRI, one epilepsy patient performed the same task during both fMRI and ECoG recordings. Significant ECoG low (8-24 Hz) and high (65-95 Hz) frequency power changes were observed selectively on premotor cortex and these co-localized with fMRI. During a subsequent BCI task, excellent performance (91%) was obtained based on ECoG power changes from the localized premotor area. These results indicate that other areas than the primary motor area may be more reliably activated during motor imagery. Specifically, the premotor cortex may be a better area to implant an invasive BCI.	[Hermes, D.; Vansteensel, M. J.; Albers, A. M.; Bleichner, M. G.; Benedictus, M. R.; Orellana, C.

For example, it has been discussed whether hippocampal theta rhythm reflects motor activity or cognitive activity, whereas it is widely accepted that the P300 event-related potential (ERP) reflects cognitive processes such as updating working memory. Here, we investigated the interrelationships among motor activity, hippocampal theta rhythm, and hippocampal P300 ERP using electrophysiological and behavioral data recorded from rats performing an auditory discrimination task (i.e., the auditory oddball paradigm) in a chamber with and without a running-wheel. We found that the hippocampal theta rhythm generated during locomotion codes information about self-motion, and event-related increases in hippocampal theta rhythm observed when rats performed the auditory discrimination cognitive task reflect a change in motor behavior after learning the cognitive task. Interestingly, the hippocampal P300 ERP occurred coincidently with increases in the power and frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we found that changes in theta rhythm observed during spontaneous wheel running without performing a cognitive task as well as when performing the cognitive task are associated with changes in delta-and gamma-band EEG activities. These major findings are discussed with respect to current hypotheses regarding P300 ERP and theta-, delta-, and gamma-band EEG activities in brain functions. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Covert Waking Brain Activity Reveals Instantaneous Sleep Depth	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AROUSAL THRESHOLD; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY; COHERENCE; POWER; FLUCTUATIONS; ALERTNESS; DYNAMICS	The neural correlates of the wake-sleep continuum remain incompletely understood, limiting the development of adaptive drug delivery systems for promoting sleep maintenance. The most useful measure for resolving early positions along this continuum is the alpha oscillation, an 8-13 Hz electroencephalographic rhythm prominent over posterior scalp locations. The brain activation signature of wakefulness, alpha expression discloses immediate levels of alertness and dissipates in concert with fading awareness as sleep begins. This brain activity pattern, however, is largely ignored once sleep begins. Here we show that the intensity of spectral power in the alpha band actually continues to disclose instantaneous responsiveness to noise-a measure of sleep depth-throughout a night of sleep. By systematically challenging sleep with realistic and varied acoustic disruption, we found that sleepers exhibited markedly greater sensitivity to sounds during moments of elevated alpha expression. This result demonstrates that alpha power is not a binary marker of the transition between sleep and wakefulness, but carries rich information about immediate sleep stability. Further, it shows that an empirical and ecologically relevant form of sleep depth is revealed in real-time by EEG spectral content in the alpha band, a measure that affords prediction on the order of minutes. This signal, which transcends the boundaries of classical sleep stages, could potentially be used for real-time feedback to novel, adaptive drug delivery systems for inducing sleep.

We investigated electroencephalogram frequency modulations of accompanying change-related de- and rebinding processes. Presenting the stimuli discontinously, we synchronized perceptual reversals with stimulus onset, which served as a time reference for averaging. The resultant gain in temporal resolution revealed a sequence of time-frequency correlates of the reversal process. Most conspicuous was a transient right-hemispheric gamma modulation preceding endogenous reversals by at least 200 ms. No such modulation occurred with exogenously induced reversals of unambiguous stimulus variants. Post-onset components were delayed for ambiguous compared to unambiguous stimuli. The time course of oscillatory activity differed in several respects from predictions based on binding-related hypotheses. The gamma modulation preceding endogenous reversals may indicate an unstable brain state, ready to switch.

Consonant chords have coherent auditory properties due to the physical relationships of their components, in contrast to dissonant chords. EEGs were measured on 18 subjects with no musical expertise while they listened to consonant chords, dissonant chords, and single-note sounds and counted the number of single tones they heard. Induced gamma band activity was observed over the right brain hemisphere 170 ms after the onset of stimuli. The induced gamma activity was significantly increased while listening to consonant chords as compared to dissonant chords. Our results suggest that the neural activity of the gamma frequency bands may reflect an auditory coherent percept generated from physical relationships of sounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Phase-Based Measures of Cross-Frequency Coupling in Brain Electrical Dynamics under General Anesthesia	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS	The state of general anesthesia (GA) is associated with an increase in spectral power in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) at frequencies below 40 Hz, including spectral peaks in the slow oscillation (SO, 0.1-1 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) bands. Because conventional power spectral analyses are insensitive to possible cross-frequency coupling, the relationships among the oscillations at different frequencies remain largely unexplored. Quantifying such coupling is essential for improving clinical monitoring of anesthesia and understanding the neuroscience of this brain state. We tested the usefulness of two measures of cross-frequency coupling: the bispectrum-derived SynchFastSlow, which is sensitive to phase-phase coupling in different frequency bands, and modulogram analysis of coupling between SO phase and alpha rhythm amplitude. SynchFastSlow, a metric that is used in clinical depth-of-anesthesia monitors, showed a robust correlation with the loss of consciousness at the induction of propofol GA, but this could be largely explained by power spectral changes without considering cross-frequency coupling. Modulogram analysis revealed two distinct modes of cross-frequency coupling under GA. The waking and two distinct states under GA could be discriminated by projecting in a two-dimensional phase space defined by the SynchFastSlow and the preferred SO phase of alpha activity. Our results show that a stereotyped pattern of phase-amplitude coupling accompanies multiple stages of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. These findings suggest that modulogram analysis can improve EEG based monitoring of brain state under GA.

However, the poor spatial resolution of EEG and the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to the activity of the underlying cortex limited the interpretation of these results. In order to better understand local cortical regulation of sleep, we used source modeling to show that plastic changes in specific cortical areas during waking produce correlated changes in SWA during sleep in those same areas. We found that implicit learning of a visuomotor adaptation task induced an increase in SWA in right premotor and sensorimotor cortices when compared to a motor control. These same areas have previously been shown to be selectively involved in the performance of this task. We also found that arm immobilization resulted in a decrease in SWA in sensorimotor cortex. Inducing cortical potentiation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) caused an increase in SWA in the targeted area and a decrease in SWA in the contralateral cortex. Finally, we report the first evidence that these modulations in SWA may be related to the dynamics of individual slow waves. We conclude that there is a local, plasticity dependent component to sleep regulation and confirm previous inferences made from the scalp data.

Methods: Forty children with AD/HD and 40 age-and sex-matched controls had eyes-closed resting EEG coherence calculated for eight interhemispheric electrode pairs and eight intrahemispheric pairs (four within each hemisphere) in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and "40 Hz" gamma bands. Results: At short-medium inter-electrode distances, the AD/HD group had increased intrahemispheric coherence in delta and theta, and reduced (L > R) laterality in delta, alpha, beta and gamma. Over longer inter-electrode distances, the AD/HD group had reduced intrahemispheric coherence in alpha. In interhemispheric comparisons, the AD/HD group had reduced frontal coherence in delta, alpha and gamma, increased temporal theta and reduced temporal alpha coherences, and increased central/parietal/occipital coherence in theta. Smaller left-lateralized coherences in AD/HD correlated negatively with DSM Inattentive and DSM Total scores, and smaller frontal interhemispheric coherence in alpha correlated negatively with DSM Hyperactive/Impulsive score. Conclusions: The negative correlations between AD/HD coherence anomalies and symptoms suggest that several anomalies reflect compensatory brain function. Significance: Coherence differences in AD/HD may reflect anomalous frontal right-hemisphere linkages that help compensate functional brain anomalies in the left frontal regions in this disorder.

Attractor Dynamics and Thermodynamic Analogies in the Cerebral Cortex: Synchronous Oscillation, the Background EEG, and the Regulation of Attention	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Cognition; Cortical activation; Cerebral cortex; Gamma synchrony; Synchronous oscillation; EEG; LFP; Continuum neural field; Attractor neural networks; Thermodynamic analogies; Null-spikes; Phase-cones	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; STATISTICAL NEURODYNAMICS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ORIGIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; COHERENCE; RESPONSES; BRAIN; SIMULATION	Ongoing changes in attention and cognition depend upon cortical/subcortical interactions, which select sequences of different spatial patterns of activation in the cortex. It is proposed that each pattern of cortical activation permits evolution of electrocortical wave activity toward statistically stationary states, analogous to thermodynamic equilibrium. In each steady-state, neurons fire with an intrinsic Poisson spike probability and also with a bursting pattern related to network oscillations. Excitatory cell dendrites act as a regenerative reservoir in which pulse generation is balanced against dissipations. Equilibria exhibit contrasting limits. One limit, at high cortical activation, generates widespread zero-lag synchrony among excitatory cells, with partial suppression of noise. Excitatory and inhibitory cells approach zero-lag local correlation, with 1/4 cycle lag-correlation at greater distances of separation. The high-activation limit defines a correlated system of attractor basins, capable of co-ordinating synaptic modifications and intracortical signal generation. Suppression of noise would enhance convergence about attractor basins in the manner of simulated annealing, while, conversely, the persistence of some noise prevents network paralysis by phase locking. At the opposite limit-that of low activation-spikes and waves have low cross- and auto-correlation, but have wide-spectrum sensitivity to inputs. It is hypothesised that cortical regions, transiently at equilibrium near these extremes, engage in interaction with each other and with subcortical systems, to generate ongoing sequences of attention and cognition. This account is compatible with classical and recently observed experimental phenomena. The principle features inferred from a simplified linear mathematical account are reproduced in a more physiologically realistic and non-linear numerical simulation.	[Wright, J.

Intrahippocampal EEG recordings from four patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and implanted electrodes were analyzed with regard to spike activity and power in 10 frequency bands (0.5-148 Hz) during SCP feedback based on surface recordings (position Cz). Trials with positive, negative and indifferent SCPs were contrasted. Three of the four patients showed changes in spike activity during SCPs, but these were inconsistent between patients, and resulted in increased and decreased activity in both positive and negative SCPs. Spectral analysis revealed that in all patients, positive surface shifts showed a bi-hemispheric higher power in the high-frequency activity above 40 Hz. Two patients showed a higher power also during negative shifts, both in high-frequency activity and one in most other frequency bands. Feedback-related power effects did not differ between focal and non-focal side. The inconsistent change in spiking activity and the lack of decrease of power in pathology associated frequency bands during SCPs show that these SCPs do not decrease pathological activity within the epileptic focus. A possible relation of higher power in high-frequency activity during positive SCPs to cognitive processes, such as memory functions, is discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that cortical state, as reflected in electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, exhibits progressive systematic changes before and after a spontaneous, isolated arousal and that the time courses of the spectral components of the EEG before and after an arousal would differ between healthy middle-aged and elderly subjects. We analyzed the power spectrum and Sample Entropy of the C3A2 EEG before and after isolated arousals from 20 middle-aged (47.2 +/- 2.0 years) and 20 elderly (78.4 +/- 3.8 years) women using polysomnograms from the Sleep Heart Health Study database. In middle-aged women, all EEG spectral band powers <16 Hz exhibited a significant increase relative to baseline at some time in the 21 s before an arousal, but only low- (0.2-2.0 Hz) and high-frequency (2.0-4.0 Hz) delta increased in elderly and only during the last 7 s pre-arousal. Post-arousal, all frequency bands below 12 Hz transiently fell below pre-arousal baseline in both age groups. Consistent with these findings, Sample Entropy decreased steadily before an arousal, increased markedly during the arousal, and remained above pre-arousal baseline levels for similar to 30 s after the arousal. In middle-aged, but not in elderly, women the presence of early pre-arousal low delta power was associated with shorter arousals. We propose that this attenuation of the effect of the arousing stimulus may be related to the slow (<1 Hz) cortical state oscillation, and that prolonged alterations of cortical state due to arousals may contribute to the poor correlation between indices of arousals and indices of sleepiness or impaired cognitive function.

Synchronous neural gamma oscillations are critical for cortico-cortical communication and large-scale integration of distributed sets of neurons. We investigated long distance gamma (28-48 Hz) coherence in bipolar disorder. Methods: Sensory evoked coherence (EC) and event related coherence (ERC) values for the gamma frequency band during simple light stimulation and visual odd-ball paradigm was assessed in 20 drug-free euthymic bipolar patients in comparison to healthy controls. Groups were compared for the coherence values of the left (F-3-T-3, F-3-TP2, F-3-P-3, F-3-O-1) and right (F-4-T-4, F-4-TP8, F-4-P-4, F-4-O-2) intra-hemispheric electrode pairs by means of a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. Results: Patients showed significantly lower gamma coherence values in response to target stimuli than the healthy controls between left and right fronto-temporal, as well as between frontal and temporo-parietal electrode pairs. Coherence values for the non-target stimuli were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy controls between frontal and temporo-parietal regions on both right and left sides. EP coherence values did not differ significantly between the groups. Limitations: A relatively small sample size is the major limitation of the study. Conclusions: Bipolar patients present disturbance in functional long-range connectivity between the frontal and temporal as well as temporo-parietal brain structures during a cognitive paradigm requiring attention and immediate recall. The location of the connectivity disturbance corresponds to the underlying neurobiology of executive function, memory and attention impairments in bipolar disorder and raises the question of whether gamma coherence reduction may be a candidate biomarker for bipolar disorder.

The first component consists of low-amplitude very fast oscillations (VFO, >70-80 Hz): the second component consists of larger amplitude transients, lasting tens to hundreds of ms, and variously called population spikes, EEG spikes, or bursts terms chosen in part because of the cellular correlates of the field events. To first approximation, the two components arise because of distinctive types of cellular interactions: gap junctions for VFO (a model of which is reviewed in the following), and recurrent synaptic excitation and/or inhibition for the transients. With in vitro studies of epileptic human neocortical tissue, it is possible to elicit VFO alone, or VFO superimposed on a large transient, but not a large transient without the VFO. If such observations prove to be general, they would imply that gap junction-mediated interactions are the primary factor in epileptogenesis. It appears to be the case then, that in the setting of seizure initiation (but not necessarily under physiological conditions), the gain of gap junction-mediated circuits can actually be larger than the gain in excitatory synaptic circuits.

The medial PFC (mPFC) is innervated by the hippocampus/subiculum, and the subiculum-mPFC pathway is known to be involved in various cognitive processes. Glutamate-containing subicular axons innervate cortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons where AMPA and NMDA receptors are implicated in synaptic transmission. In our experiments, properties of subiculum-mPFC interactions were studied using pathway stimulation and local field potential (LFP) recordings of the mPFC in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Changes in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and LFP oscillations, effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and the AMPAkine LY451395 were evaluated. Effects of disruption of the thalamo-cortical loop with local microinjection of lidocaine into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were also studied. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic administration of MK-801 and local MD lidocaine microinjection produce similar changes in LFP oscillations and reduction in PPF. Specifically, it was observed that MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg i.v.) and intra-thalamic lidocaine changed regular, 2 Hz delta oscillation to a less regular 0.5-1.5 Hz delta rhythm. Concurrently, PPF in response to electrical stimulation of the subiculum was significantly attenuated. Administration of the AMPAkine LY451395 (0.01 mg/kg i.v.) reversed the MK-801- and lidocaine-induced changes, and was itself blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist CP-465022. Analysis of our findings suggests a critical role of cortical interneurons in NMDA/AMPA receptor-mediated changes in thalamo-cortical oscillations and PPF, and contributes to our understanding of the NMDA hypofunction model of schizophrenia.

Behavioral correlates of human hippocampal delta and theta oscillations during navigation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hippocampus; navigation	PLACE CELLS; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; SPATIAL MEMORY; EEG; RHYTHM; PATTERNS; INTEGRATION; FREQUENCY; MOVEMENT; VELOCITY	Watrous AJ, Fried I, Ekstrom AD. Behavioral correlates of human hippocampal delta and theta oscillations during navigation. J Neurophysiol 105: 1747-1755, 2011. First published February 2, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00921.2010.-Previous rodent studies demonstrate movement-related increases in theta oscillations, and recent evidence suggests that multiple navigationally relevant variables are reflected in this activity. Human invasive recordings have revealed movement-related modulations in delta and theta activity, although it is unclear whether additional behavioral variables are responsible for modulating this neural activity during navigation. We tested the role of delta and theta oscillations during navigation by addressing whether spatial-related processing, in addition to speed and task variables, modulates delta and theta activity. Recording from 317 hippocampal intracranial electrodes in 10 patients undergoing seizure monitoring, we observed increasing delta and theta power with increasing virtual speed at significantly more electrodes than would be expected by chance, replicating previous findings in nonhuman mammals. Delta and theta power were more consistently modulated, however, as a function of spatial view, including when subjects looked at stores in the virtual environment both to find a relevant goal or for spatial updating. A significantly larger proportion of electrodes showed view-related effects than speed-related modulations. Although speed, task, and spatial view affected delta and theta activity, individual electrodes were most frequently modulated by only one variable, rather than a combination of variables. These electrodes likely sampled independent delta and theta generators, which reflected movement-related and allocentric processing, respectively. These results extend previous findings in nonhuman mammals and humans, expanding our knowledge of the role of human hippocampal low-frequency oscillations in navigation.

EFFECTS OF COLOR INFORMATION ON FACE PROCESSING USING EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS AND GAMMA OSCILLATIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						face processing; face color; electroencephalogram; N170; gamma oscillations	REPETITION PRIMING TASK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; SURFACE REFLECTANCE; INVERTED FACES; FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL MECHANISMS	In humans, face configuration, contour and color may affect face perception, which is important for social interactions. This study aimed to determine the effect of color information on face perception by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) during the presentation of natural- and bluish-colored faces. Our results demonstrated that the amplitude of the N170 event-related potential, which correlates strongly with face processing, was higher in response to a bluish-colored face than to a natural-colored face. However, gamma-band activity was insensitive to the deviation from a natural face color.

While previous studies have focused on the development of gray and white matter, recent evidence suggests that brain maturation during adolescence extends to fundamental changes in the properties of cortical circuits that in turn promote the precise temporal coding of neural activity. In the current article, we will highlight modifications in the amplitude and synchrony of neural oscillations during adolescence that may be crucial for the emergence of cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Specifically, we will suggest that schizophrenia is associated with impaired parameters of synchronous oscillations that undergo changes during late brain maturation, suggesting an important role of adolescent brain development for the understanding, treatment, and prevention of the disorder.

This is the first study on time and frequency resolved fronto-posterior coherence during cognitive control in schizophrenia. Method: We examined 16 schizophrenic/schizoaffective patients and 20 age-matched controls performing a choice-reaction task. Fronto-posterior coherence was analyzed for event-related increases with respect to the inter-trial interval. Furthermore, we compared the two groups for event-related coherence during the task-related time intervals which showed a significant coherence increase with respect to the inter-trial interval, as well as for absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. Results: Event-related coherence was significantly reduced in patients during time intervals (0-250 ms poststimulus) when controls showed significant event-related coherence increases. However, patients showed significantly higher absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. These results pointed to differential deficits in fronto-posterior connectivity during the inter-trial interval and task-related conditions in schizophrenia. Conclusion: Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia might be driven by abnormal fronto-posterior communication. Task-related hypo-connectivity and inter-trial interval hyper-connectivity point to resource allocation deficits. The timing of cortico-cortical interactions during crucial task-related intervals may be impaired, while frontal and posterior areas may exhibit increased interactions between the trials.

Using frequency-encoded steady-state visual stimulation together with a combination of time-resolved functional magnetic source imaging from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study evidences maps of visuotopic sustained oscillatory neural responses distributed across the visual cortex. Our results further reveal relative phase delays across responding striate and extra-striate visual areas, which thereby shape the chronometry of neural processes amongst these regions. The methodology developed in this study points at further developments in time-resolved analyses of distributed visual processes in the millisecond range, and to new ways of exploring the dynamics of functional processes within the human visual cortex non-invasively.

The generation of SSRs is usually attributed to the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the stimulus train. However, a more parsimonious account suggests that SSRs might result from the linear addition of the transient responses elicited by each stimulus. This study aimed to investigate this possibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded brain potentials elicited by a checkerboard stimulus reversing at different rates. We modeled SSRs by sequentially shifting and linearly adding rate-specific ERPs. Our results show a strong resemblance between recorded and synthetic SSRs, supporting the superposition hypothesis. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of entrainment of a neural oscillation at the stimulation frequency. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that visual SSRs can be explained as a superposition of transient ERPs. These findings have critical implications in our current understanding of brain oscillations. Contrary to the idea that neural networks can be tuned to a wide range of frequencies, our findings rather suggest that the oscillatory response of a given neural network is constrained within its natural frequency range.

We analyze offline the anticipation related SCPs recorded from 11 subjects over two days in a variation of the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions in an assistive technology framework. The results suggest that widely used spatial filters such as Common Average Referencing (CAR) and Laplacian are sub-optimal for the single trial analysis of SCPs. We show that a spatial smoothing filter (SSF), which in combination with CAR enhances the spatially distributed SCP while attenuating high frequency spatial noise. We report, first, that a narrow band filter in the range [0.1 1] Hz captures anticipation related SCP better and effectively reduces ISOs. Second, the SSF in combination with CAR outperforms CAR-alone and Laplacian spatial filters. Third, we compare linear and quadratic classifiers calculated using optimally filtered Cz electrode potentials and report that the best methods resulted in single trial classification accuracies of 8 3 +/- 4%, where classifiers were trained on day 1 and tested using data from day 2, to ensure generalization capabilities across days (1-7 days).

Variability of Brain Signals Processed Locally Transforms into Higher Connectivity with Brain Development	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; IN-VIVO; EEG; COMPLEXITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; INTEGRATION; MEG	A number of studies have characterized the changes in variability of brain signals with brain maturation from the perspective of considering the human brain as a complex system. Specifically, it has been shown that complexity of brain signals increases in development. On one hand, such an increase in complexity can be attributed to more specialized and differentiated brain regions able to express a higher repertoire of mental microstates. On the other hand, it can be explained by increased integration between widely distributed neuronal populations and establishment of new connections. The goal of this study was to see which of these two mechanisms is dominant, accounting for the previously observed increase in signal complexity. Using information-theoretic tools based on scalp-recorded EEG measurements, we examined the trade-off between local and distributed variability of brain signals in infants and children separated into age groups of 1-2, 2-8, 9 -24, and 24 -66 months old. We found that developmental changes were characterized by a decrease in the amount of information processed locally, with a peak in alpha frequency range. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the variability of brain signals processed as a distributed network. Complementary analysis of phase locking revealed an age-related pattern of increased synchronization in the lower part of the spectrum, up to the alpha rhythms. At the same time, we observed the desynchronization effects associated with brain development in the higher beta to lower gamma range.

Modifications of EEG Activity Related to Perception of Emotionally Colored, Erotic, and Neutral Pictures in Women during Different Phases of the Ovulatory (Menstrual) Cycle	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG components; spectral power; ovulatory (menstrual) cycle; affective images	NEURAL FUNCTION; STIMULI; AROUSAL; ESTROGEN; MEMORY	We studied modifications of EEG activity related to perception of visual stimuli (pictures) of the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) in women during different phases of the ovulatory (menstrual) cycle. We found that the woman's brain is most intensely activated by both emotionally negative and positive visual stimuli during the follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle, while such activation is minimum during ovulation per se. Upon the action of neutral stimuli, cerebral activation was the most intense during the lutein phase (compared with that within other phases); manifestations of activation were concentrated in the right hemisphere. Cognitive and emotional components of perception of affective pictures were expressed to a greatest extent in the course of viewing positive stimuli during the follicular phase. Perception of emotionally pleasant stimuli during other phases was accompanied by lateralization of activation of sensory and analytical processes in the left hemisphere during the ovulatory phase and in the right hemisphere within the lutein phase. The viewing of emotionally negative pictures during the follicular phase led to a rise in the power of theta oscillations in the left frontal region and also to depression of the alpha activity in central/parietal parts of the left hemisphere, which can result from aggravation of anxiety and verbally shaped disturbing ideas upon the action of such stimuli. Presentation of erotically colored visual stimuli caused the most intense changes in the EEG, which depended on the phases of the ovulatory cycle, during post-stimulation time interval but not during the viewing of pictures itself.

Slow intrinsic rhythm in the koniocellular visual pathway	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						parallel pathways; visual system; sleep-wake cycles; anesthesia; epilepsy	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; MARMOSET; SIGNALS; CORTEX; SCALES; BRAIN; CELLS	Slow rhythmic changes in nerve-cell activity are characteristic of unconscious brain states and also may contribute to waking brain function by coordinating activity between cortical and subcortical structures. Here we show that slow rhythms are exhibited by the koniocellular (K) pathway, one of three visual pathways beginning in the eye and projecting through the lateral geniculate visual relay nucleus to the cerebral cortex. We recorded activity in pairs and ensembles of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found slow rhythms are common in K cells but are rare in parvocellular and magnocellular cell pairs. The time course of slow K rhythms corresponds to subbeta (<10 Hz) EEG frequencies, and high spike rates in K cells are associated with low power in the theta and delta EEG bands. By contrast, spontaneous activity in the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways is neither synchronized nor strongly linked to EEG state. These observations suggest that parallel visual pathways not only carry different kinds of visual signals but also contribute differentially to brain circuits at the first synapse in the thalamus. Differential contribution of sensory streams to rhythmic brain circuits also raises the possibility that sensory stimuli can be tailored to modify brain rhythms.

J	Wang, X; Ding, MZ				Wang, Xue; Ding, Mingzhou			Relation between P300 and event-related theta-band synchronization: A single-trial analysis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ASEO; Single trial analysis; ERS/ERD; Theta; P300	RECOGNITION MEMORY; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SPECTRAL DYNAMICS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; WAVELET ANALYSIS; EEG; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS; LATENCY	Objective: Recent reports show that theta-band (4-7 Hz) power is enhanced by target detection in the standard oddball paradigm, which, together with increased P300, is considered as providing complementary neural mechanisms supporting memory and attention processes. We hypothesize that the increased theta event-related synchronization (ERS) may stem largely from not accounting for the trial-to-trial variability of the P300 evoked component and may not reflect a separate mechanism for target detection and related cognitive processing. Methods: EEG was recorded from healthy volunteers performing visual and auditory odd-ball tasks. Ongoing-activity was obtained using two methods: (a) subtracting the ASEO-estimated (analysis of single-trial event-related potentials and ongoing-activity) single-trial ERP from corresponding single-trial EEG time series and (b) subtracting the average event-related potential (AERP) from single-trial EEG time series. Event-related oscillatory activities obtained from the two methods were compared. Results: The amount of power increase in the theta-band was greatly attenuated for the single-trial based method relative to the traditional AERP method. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the theta-ERS arises largely from not modeling the trial-to-trial variability of the P300. Significance: ERP components such as the P300 vary from trial-to-trial in both amplitude and latency. The traditional AERP method leaves traces of evoked responses in the residual data which can negatively impact the inference of ongoing oscillatory dynamics. Thus, caution should be exercised in interpreting such phenomena in basic and clinical contexts. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Schwartzman, DJ; Kranczioch, C				Schwartzman, David J.; Kranczioch, Cornelia			In the blink of an eye: The contribution of microsaccadic activity to the induced gamma band response	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Microsaccade; Saccadic spike potential; Induced gamma band response; EEG; ICA	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OFF-LINE REMOVAL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL RESPONSES; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; MODULATION	In 2008 an article by Yuval-Greenberg and colleagues initiated a lively debate within the field of induced gamma band research. Their article suggested that scalp-recorded induced gamma band responses (iGBRs) to visual stimuli could be obscured by minute movements of extraocular muscles, called microsaccades, which are associated with the saccadic spike potentials (SPs). Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2008) proposed that the temporal and spectral characteristics of SPs could mask and have been previously mistaken for cortical induced gamma band activity. This review summarises the main findings of the report by Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2008) and the research that has emerged since its publication. Microsaccades and the associated SP waveforms are described in detail and their contribution to the iGBR discussed. Different lines of argument are considered that suggest that the scalp-recorded iGBR exists separate from ocular contributions. The article then considers techniques that are widely used to remove electroencephalogram (EEG) artefacts and their potential adaptation for the removal of SPs. The review closes by pointing to future directions that researchers may explore in order to disentangle neural iGBRs and artefactual, SP-related iGBRs, and to several routes which researchers may consider in order to increase the informative value of their scalp-recorded iGBR data. We conclude that further investigation and testing is necessary to develop signal processing tools that successfully identify and correct SPs in EEG data without distorting the neural iGBR.

This complex problem becomes even more difficult as the number of channels in the neural recording is increased. Here, new techniques based on wavelet thresholding and independent component analysis (ICA) are developed for use in high-dimensional neural data. The wavelet technique uses a discrete wavelet transform with a Haar basis function to localize artifacts in both time and frequency before removing them with thresholding. Wavelet decomposition level is automatically selected based on the smoothness of artifactual wavelet approximation coefficients. The ICA method separates the signal into independent components, detects artifactual components by measuring the offset between the mean and median of each component, and then removing the correct number of components based on the aforementioned offset and the power of the reconstructed signal. A quantitative method for evaluating these techniques is also presented. Through this evaluation, the novel adaptation of wavelet thresholding is shown to produce superior reduction of ocular artifacts when compared to regression, principal component analysis, and ICA.

Although the neuroanatomical substrates underlying each of the two processes have been extensively investigated, they have predominantly been probed separately and therefore a precise knowledge of the functional overlap within the multiple OFC sub-portions involved is still lacking. Here, we explore the neural dynamics mediating performance monitoring and emotional processing using direct intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from multiple OFC sites of an epileptic patient. Neural activity was recorded during two experiments. The first task required processing of emotional faces and the second investigated action outcome evaluation based on a visual feedback on the subject's performance. Task-related neural dynamics were assessed using modulations of high frequency responses in the gamma-band (50-150 Hz). Our results reveal that processing negative facial emotions as well as receiving negative feedback both elicited gamma-band responses in the lateral OFC. By contrast, the mid-OFC was selectively activated for positive feedback. Furthermore, we also found significant gamma-band deactivation in the gyrus rectus during processing of negative feedback. Our findings provide novel evidence for an intricate valence-selective interaction between the networks mediating emotion processing and performance monitoring in human OFC and support the hypothesis of a tight relationship between gamma-band activity and behavior.

This study investigates to what extent these absolute differences in SWA can be explained with differences in grey matter volume, white matter volume or the thickness of skull and outer liquor rooms. To do this, we selected the 10-min interval showing maximal SWA of 20 young adult subjects and correlated these values lobe-wise with grey matter, skull and liquor thickness and globally with white matter as well as segments of the corpus callosum. Whereas grey matter, skull thickness and liquor did not correlate significantly with maximal slow wave activity, there were significant correlations with the anterior parts of the corpus callosum and with one other white matter region. In contrast, electroencephalogram power of higher frequencies correlates positively with grey matter volumes and cortical surface area. We discuss the possible role of white matter tracts on the synchronization of slow waves across the cortex.

A possible physiological basis for the discontinuity of consciousness	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ECoG; intracranial EEG; analytic power; discontinuous consciousness; cinematographic consciousness; 1/f noise		A comparison is made between the frequency of local minima in the analytic power (AP) of intracranial EEG (ECoG) from waking and unconscious human subjects and the frequency of putative frames of consciousness reported in earlier psychological literature. In ECoG from unconscious subjects, the frequency of deep minima in AP is found to be a linear function of bandwidth. In contrast, in ECoG from conscious subjects, the bandwidth/minima-frequency curve saturates or plateaus at minima frequencies similar to the frequencies of previously reported frames of consciousness. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that local minima in AP may act as the shutter in a cinematographic model of consciousness. The fact that artificially generated samples of black noise with power spectra similar to ECoG data give similar results in the analyses above suggests that the discontinuous nature of consciousness is not due to some specifically biological factor, but is simply a consequence of the physical properties of the 1/f (aka power law) oscillations that are widely found in nature.

In a situation of choice of behavioral strategy, subjects could be divided in "inclined to risk" and "careful". Tipologycal differences between groups were the greatest under conditions of 25% probability of getting a valuable reward. Probability prognosis was more efficient in persons "tended to risk", than in "careful" subjects. According to psychological tests, "impulsive" people appeared to be more inclined to risk than to cautiousness.

In the present experiment we analyzed in rats, from early to mature life (2 to 11 months old), the response to unattended auditory evoked stimulation (Auditory evoked potential, AEP) and the power spectrum of spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), with the aim of unraveling the onset and target functional effects of aging. Somatosensory and cingulate cortex, mediodorsal thalamus and CA3 hippocampus were chosen for examination based on their involvement in sensory processing and age-related deficits. The main finding of this study is the early onset of age-related changes in adult rats as can be established with both AEP's and frequency analyses, and its diversity between brain regions during normal aging.

ECG-derived cardiopulmonary analysis of pediatric sleep-disordered breathing	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Pediatrics; Sleep apnea; Respiration disordered index; Cardiopulmonary coupling; High-frequency coupling; Low-frequency coupling	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; APNEA SYNDROME; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; TIME; CHILDREN; EEG; RECORDINGS; SNORERS	Background: The diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and evaluation of sleep quality in the pediatric population is dependent on resource intensive attended polysomnography. An ECG-derived cardiopulmonary coupling sleep spectrogram (CPC) analysis previously described in adults can provide information about the severity of SDB and coupled interactions of sleep modulated autonomic drive and respiration. We hypothesized that CPC algorithm-derived metrics will correlate with nasal pressure-based apnea-hypopnea scoring in pediatric population. Methods: A total of 63 subjects (mean 6.2 years: range 2-12 years) were analyzed by both CPC and conventional nasal flow and desaturation scoring obtained during cardiorespiratory recordings. The characteristics of CPC indices and correlation with conventional SDB scoring were computed. Results: High-frequency coupling (HFC), the CPC marker of stable sleep state, is reduced in proportion to SDB. The HFC durations are negatively correlated with the nasal flow-derived respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a CPC-derived RDI (CPC-RDI), and the 3% oxygen desaturation index (correlation coefficient -0.60, -0.78 and -0.54, respectively). CPC-RDI has a strong positive correlation with the conventional nasal-flow RDI (correlation coefficient 0.70). In this group with a mean nasal-flow RDI 36.1/h, the percentage of correct CPC diagnosis was 85.7% in total, 40% in the non-severe group (10 subjects, RDI < 20/h) and 94.3% in the severe group (53 subjects, RDI > 20/h). Conclusions: ECG-derived sleep spectrogram metrics are correlated with nasal flow-derived respiratory abnormality in pediatric SDB. In suitable clinical contexts, this method may have screening utility and possibly allow tracking of treatment effects, specifically in the children with severe SDB. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ferber, G; Staner, L; Boeijinga, P				Ferber, Georg; Staner, Luc; Boeijinga, Peter			Structured multiplicity and confirmatory statistical analyses in pharmacodynamic studies using the quantitative electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Pharmacodynamic studies; Multiplicity; Quantitative electroencephalogram; Confirmatory statistics	TESTS	Pharmacodynamic (PD) clinical studies are characterised by a high degree of multiplicity. This multiplicity is the result of the design of these studies that typically investigate effects of a number of biomarkers at various doses and multiple time points. Measurements are taken at many or all points of a "hyper-grid" that can be understood as the cross-product of a number of dimensions each of which has typically 3-30 discrete values. This exploratory design helps understanding the phenomena under investigation, but has made a confirmatory statistical analysis of these studies difficult, so that such an analysis is often missing in this type of studies. In this contribution we show that the cross-product structure of PD studies allows to combine several well-known techniques to address multiplicity in an effective way, so that a confirmatory analysis of these studies becomes feasible without unrealistic loss of power. We demonstrate the application of this technique in two studies that use the quantitative EEG (qEEG) as biomarker for drug activity at the GABA-A receptor. QEEG studies suffer particularly from the curse of multiplicity, since, in addition to the common dimensions like dose and time, the qEEG is measured at many locations over the scalp and in a number of frequency bands which inflate the multiplicity by a factor of about 250.

Thalamocortical dysrhythmia has been proposed as a possible pathophysiological mechanism for both tinnitus and pain. Thalamocortical dysrhythmia refers to a persistent pathological resting state theta-gamma coupling that is spatially localized at an area where normally alpha oscillations predominate. Auditory cortex stimulation via implanted electrodes has been developed to treat tinnitus, targeting an area of activation on functional MR imaging elicited by tinnitus-matched sound presentation. The authors describe a case in which clinical improvement was correlated with changes in intracranial recordings. Maximal tinnitus suppression was obtained by current delivery exactly at the blood oxygen level dependent activation hotspot, which colocalizes with increased gamma and theta activity, in contrast to the other electrode poles, which demonstrated a normal alpha peak. These spectral changes normalized when stimulation induced tinnitus suppression, both on electrode and source-localized electroencephalography recordings. These data suggest that theta-gamma coupling as proposed by the thalamocortical dysrhythmia model might be causally related to a conscious auditory phantom percept.

Altered evoked gamma-band responses as a neurophysiological marker of schizophrenia?

They have been linked to the integration and processing of incoming information leading to an adequate behavioral outcome. Consequently, altered evoked GBRs have been associated with impaired cognitive and behavioral states present in a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports directly comparing evoked GBRs of different clinical groups in the same experimental setting. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to shed light on the question, whether evoked GBRs, as a kind of a neurophysiological biomarker of pathological states, might serve for characterization and distinguishing of groups suffering from diverse psychiatric disorders. We measured EEG during a passive auditory oddball-paradigm. Participants were patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, mood disorder, and personality disorders as well as a fourth group consisting of healthy participants. Our results indicate that evoked GBRs significantly differed from healthy participants only in schizophrenic patients whereas no difference could be observed for the other clinical groups. Our findings support the notion that early evoked GBRs could be indeed a trait variable of schizophrenia and are not a general marker of pathological brain states. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to check the connectivity of brain rhythm, this paper develops a new method of constructing functional network based on phase synchronization. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected while subjects looking at a green cross in two states, performing an attention task and relaxing with eyes-open. The EEG from these two states was filtered by three band-pass filters to obtain signals of theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) bands. Mean resultant length was used to estimate strength of phase synchronization in three bands to construct networks of both states, and mean degree K and cluster coefficient C of networks were calculated as a function of threshold. The result shows higher cluster coefficient in the attention state than in the eyes-open state in all three bands, suggesting that cluster coefficient reflects brain state. In addition, an obvious fronto-parietal network is found in the attention state, which is a well-known attention network. These results indicate that attention modulates the fronto-parietal connectivity in different modes as compared with the eyes-open state. Taken together this method is an objective and important tool to study the properties of neural networks of brain rhythm.

But how these map onto distinct aspects of visual perception remains elusive. Recent electroencephalography data indicate that theta or beta frequencies at parietal sensors increase in amplitude when conscious perception is dominated by global or local features, respectively, of a reversible visual stimulus [6]. But this provides only correlative, noninterventional evidence. Here we show via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interventions that short rhythmic bursts of right-parietal TMS at theta or beta frequency can causally benefit processing of global or local levels, respectively, for hierarchical visual stimuli, especially in the context of salient incongruent distractors. This double dissociation between theta and beta TMS reveals distinct causal roles for particular frequencies in processing global versus local visual features.

Recently, we outlined a potential cellular substrate by which such aspects of perception might be linked to basic alpha rhythm mechanisms This scheme relies on a specialized subset of rhythmically bursting thalamocortical (IC) neurons (high threshold bursting cells) in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) which are interconnected by gap junctions (GJs). By engaging GABAergic interneurons, that in turn inhibit conventional relay-mode IC neurons, these cells can lead to an effective temporal framing of thalamic relay-mode output. Although the role of GJs is pivotal in this scheme, evidence for their involvement in thalamic alpha rhythms has thus far mainly derived from experiments in in vitro slice preparations. In addition, direct anatomical evidence of neuronal GJs in the LGN is currently lacking. To address the first of these issues we tested the effects of the GJ inhibitors, carbenoxolone (CBX), and 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 beta-GA), given directly to the LGN via reverse microdialysis, on spontaneous LGN and EEG alpha rhythms in behaving cats. We also examined the effect of CBX on alpha rhythm-related LGN unit activity. Indicative of a role for thalamic GJs in these activities, 18 beta-GA and CBX reversibly suppressed both LGN and EEG alpha rhythms, with CBX also decreasing neuronal synchrony. To address the second point, we used electron microscopy to obtain definitive ultrastructural evidence for the presence of GJs between neurons in the cat LGN. As interneurons show no phenotypic evidence of GJ coupling (i.e., dye-coupling and spikelets) we conclude that these GJs must belong to TC neurons. The potential significance of these findings for relating macroscopic changes in alpha rhythms to basic cellular processes is discussed.

Methods: This study included 19 patients who underwent intracranial electrode implantation in bilateral temporal lobes and had at least one seizure recorded at 1 kHz sampling rate. The characteristics of ictal HFO in the medial temporal lobe, and the relations between the presence of HFO, pathology, and postoperative seizure outcome were analyzed. Results: Ictal HFO were detected from medial temporal structures in 11 patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Among eight patients without HFO, only three were diagnosed with MTLE. Ictal HFO were detected from unilateral medial temporal structures ipsilateral to the side of hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In one patient with bitemporal independent seizure onset, ictal HFO were detected only on the side of HS. HS was detected in all 11 patients with HFO, but in only one of four patients without HFO. Seizure outcome did not differ between patients with and without HFO. Conclusions: Ictal HFO in the medial temporal lobe may be a specific marker for MTLE with HS. Significance: Recording of ictal HFO in the medial temporal lobe may be useful for presurgical evaluation of MTLE. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The effect of excitatory circuit disruption on the beta band power (13-30 Hz) using a conductance-based network model of 200 neurons is assessed. Then, the neural correlates of abnormal cortical oscillations in different frequency bands based on a larger network model of 1000 neurons consisting of different types of cortical neurons is also analyzed. The results show that, despite the heterogeneity of the network models, the beta band power is significantly affected by excitatory neural and synaptic loss. Secondly, the results of modeling a functional impairment in the excitatory circuit shows that beta band power exhibits the most decrease compared with other bands. Previous biological experiments on different types of cultural excitatory neurons show that cortical neuronal death is mediated by dysfunctional ionic behavior that might specifically contribute to the pathogenesis of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta)-induced neuronal death in AD. Our study also shows that beta band power was the first affected component when the modeled excitatory circuit begins to lose neurons and synapses. Alpha (8-12 Hz), gamma (30-50 Hz) and Full frequency (1-70 Hz) band power are affected in a later stage when more severe synaptic loss occurs.

Oscillatory Sensory Selection Mechanisms during Intersensory Attention to Rhythmic Auditory and Visual Inputs: A Human Electrocorticographic Investigation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-RHYTHMS; PHASE	Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms are invoked during attentional processing of rhythmically occurring stimuli, whereby their phase alignment regulates the excitability state of neurons coding for anticipated inputs. These mechanisms have been examined in the delta band (1-3 Hz), where entrainment frequency matches the stimulation rate. Here, we investigated entrainment for subdelta rhythmic stimulation, recording from intracranial electrodes over human auditory cortex during an intersensory audiovisual task. Audiovisual stimuli were presented at 0.67 Hz while participants detected targets within one sensory stream and ignored the other. It was found that entrainment operated at twice the stimulation rate (1.33 Hz), and this was reflected by higher amplitude values in the FFT spectrum, cyclic modulation of alpha-amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling between delta phase and alpha power. In addition, we found that alpha-amplitude was relatively increased in auditory cortex coincident with to-be-ignored auditory stimuli during attention to vision. Thus, the data suggest that entrainment mechanisms operate within a delimited passband such that for subdelta task rhythms, oscillatory harmonics are invoked. The phase of these delta-entrained oscillations modulates alpha-band power. This may in turn increase or decrease responsiveness to relevant and irrelevant stimuli, respectively.

Retrieval During Learning Facilitates Subsequent Memory Encoding	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						learning; encoding; retrieval; testing; brain oscillations	EPISODIC MEMORY; FREE-RECALL; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; CONTEXT CHANGE; ALPHA; MODEL; EEG	In multiple-list learning, retrieval during learning has been suggested to improve recall of the single lists by enhancing list discrimination and, at test, reducing interference. Using electrophysiological, oscillatory measures of brain activity, we examined to what extent retrieval during learning facilitates list encoding. Subjects studied 5 lists of items in anticipation of a final cumulative recall test and did either a retrieval or a no-retrieval task between study of the lists. Retrieval was front episodic memory (recall of the previous list), semantic memory (generation of exemplars from an unrelated category), or short-term memory (2-back task). Behaviorally, all 3 forms of retrieval enhanced recall of both previously and subsequently studied lists. Physiologically, the results showed an increase of alpha power (8-14 Hz) from List 1 to List 5 encoding when no retrieval activities were interpolated but no such increase when any of the 3 retrieval activities occurred. Brain-behavior correlations showed that alpha-power dynamics from List 1 to List 5 encoding predicted subsequent recall performance. The results suggest that, without intermittent retrieval, encoding becomes ineffective across lists. In contrast, with intermittent retrieval, there is a reset of the encoding process for each single list that makes encoding of later lists as effective as encoding of early lists.

In a WAG/Rij rat genetic model, absence seizures appear after puberty and they are increased with age. It is known that (1) epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats is initiated at the perioral area in the somatosensory cortex; (2) sensory deprivation, i.e., whisker trimming during the critical period of development, could enhance excitatory activity in the somatosensory cortex. It is hypothesized that the cortex may become more excitable after neonatal vibrissae removal, and this may precipitate absence seizures in adult rats. We found that whisker trimming during the first postnatal weeks caused more rapid development of EEG seizure activity in adult WAG/Rij rats. Epileptic discharges in the trimmed rats were more numerous (vs control), showed longer duration and often appeared in desynchronized and drowsy EEG. The number of absence-like spindle-shaped EEG events (spike-wave spindles) in the whisker-trimmed rats was higher than in control, especially during the intermediate sleep state. An age-dependent increase of intermediate sleep state was found in the trimmed rats, but not in the intact animals. We discuss epigenetic factors that can modulate absence epilepsy in genetically prone subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Second, behavioural activation system (BAS) and behavioural inhibition system (BIS) was considered to verify the effect of motivational/emotional variable on alpha activity. In addition, alpha band variation was monitored when subjects attentively (supraliminal) or preattentively (subliminal) processed faces. In fact, it remains an open question whether it is possible to assign a specific function to cortical oscillations for facial emotion comprehension in unconscious perception. Eighteen participants looked at an ample range of facial expressions of emotions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness, neutral) in two different conditions: supraliminal and subliminal stimulation. The results showed that both attentive and preattentive processing can modulate the alpha power. Moreover, frontal right and left side responses varied as a function of emotional types, with increased right frontal activity for negative, aversive emotions versus an increased left response for positive emotion. Finally, higher scoring BIS participants generated more right hemisphere activation for some negative emotions, whereas higher scoring BAS participants were more responsive to a positive emotion measured over the left hemisphere. Motivational significance of facial expressions was considered to elucidate cortical differences in participants' responses to emotional types.

The current study investigated the patterns of brain oscillations during simultaneous processing of music and language using visually presented sentences and auditorily presented chord sequences. Music-syntactically regular or irregular chord functions were presented in sync with syntactically or semantically correct or incorrect words. Irregular chord functions (presented simultaneously with a syntactically correct word) produced an early (150-250 ms) spectral power decrease over anterior frontal regions in the theta band (5-7 Hz) and a late (350-700 ms) power increase in both the delta and the theta band (2-7 Hz) over parietal regions. Syntactically incorrect words (presented simultaneously with a regular chord) elicited a similar late power increase in delta-theta band over parietal sites, but no early effect. Interestingly, the late effect was significantly diminished when the language-syntactic and music-syntactic irregularities occurred at the same time. Further, the presence of a semantic violation occurring simultaneously with regular chords produced a significant increase in later delta-theta power at posterior regions; this effect was marginally decreased when the identical semantic violation occurred simultaneously with a music syntactical violation. Altogether, these results show that low frequency oscillatory networks get activated during the syntactic processing of both music and language, and further, these networks may possibly be shared.

We explore in this article the steps along the pathway from data acquisition to closed-loop applications that can and should be considered to design the most efficient early seizure detection. Microelectrodes, high-frequency oscillations, high sampling rate, high-density arrays, and modern analysis techniques are all elements of the recording and detection process that in combination with modeling studies can provide new insights into the dynamics of seizure onsets. Each of these steps needs to be considered if detection devices that will favorably impact the quality of life of patients are to be implemented.

The aim of the present study was to use a new methodological approach in order to investigate gamma-band phase synchronization between the left and right auditory cortex in patients with schizophrenia and its relationship to auditory hallucinations. Subjects were 18 patients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ) and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects. Auditory hallucination symptom scores were obtained using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms. Stimuli were 40-Hz binaural click trains. The generators of the 40 Hz-ASSR were localized using eLORETA and based on the computed intracranial signals lagged interhemispheric phase locking between primary and secondary auditory cortices was analyzed. Current source density of the 40 ASSR response was significantly diminished in SZ in comparison to HC in the right superior and middle temporal gyrus (p < 0.05). Interhemispheric phase locking was reduced in SZ in comparison to HC for the primary auditory cortices (p < 0.05) but not in the secondary auditory cortices. A significant positive correlation was found between auditory hallucination symptom scores and phase synchronization between the primary auditory cortices (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple testing) but not for the secondary auditory cortices. These results suggest that long-range synchrony of gamma oscillations is disturbed in schizophrenia and that this deficit is related to clinical symptoms such as auditory hallucinations.

Seizure prediction research holds great promise for such patients, since an effective algorithm will enable the development of a closed-loop system that intervenes before the clinical onset of a seizure. As a step toward practical implementation of this technology, we present a new method based on a measure of brain excitability identified by couplings between low-frequency phases and high-frequency amplitudes of brain oscillations. The proposed method was applied to long-term intracranial recordings of 20 patients with partial epilepsy, for a total of 267 seizures and more than 3400-hour-long interictal activities. We found that our predictor was in 50% of cases better than chance, with an average sensitivity of 98.9% and false prediction rate of 1.84/hour. From these observations, we concluded that our method enables a new quantitative way to identify preictal states with a high risk of seizure generation	[Alvarado-Rojas, C.; Witon, A.] CRICM, Paris, France; [Valderrama, M.] Univ Los Andes, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Bagota, Colombia; [Navarro, V.] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Epilepsy Unity, Paris, France		Alvarado-Rojas, C (corresponding author), CRICM, Paris, France.	catalina.alvarado.rojas@gmail.com; mvalderr@uniandes.edu.co; adrien_witon@yahoo.fr; vincent.navarro@psl.aphp.fr; quyen@t-online.de	Alvarado-Rojas, Catalina/AAR-8761-2021	Alvarado-Rojas, Catalina/0000-0002-2315-5692; /0000-0002-4858-2930; Valderrama, Mario/0000-0001-8791-6078; Navarro, Vincent/0000-0003-0077-8114	EU [211713]	EU(European Commission)	Manuscript received June 20, 2011.

Explicit-Duration Hidden Markov Model Inference of UP-DOWN States from Continuous Signals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FORWARD-BACKWARD ALGORITHM; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; IN-VIVO; PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS; SENSORY RESPONSES; DEPENDENCE; BURSTS; PHASE	Neocortical neurons show UP-DOWN state (UDS) oscillations under a variety of conditions. These UDS have been extensively studied because of the insight they can yield into the functioning of cortical networks, and their proposed role in putative memory formation. A key element in these studies is determining the precise duration and timing of the UDS. These states are typically determined from the membrane potential of one or a small number of cells, which is often not sufficient to reliably estimate the state of an ensemble of neocortical neurons. The local field potential (LFP) provides an attractive method for determining the state of a patch of cortex with high spatio-temporal resolution; however current methods for inferring UDS from LFP signals lack the robustness and flexibility to be applicable when UDS properties may vary substantially within and across experiments. Here we present an explicit-duration hidden Markov model (EDHMM) framework that is sufficiently general to allow statistically principled inference of UDS from different types of signals (membrane potential, LFP, EEG), combinations of signals (e. g., multichannel LFP recordings) and signal features over long recordings where substantial non-stationarities are present. Using cortical LFPs recorded from urethane-anesthetized mice, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows robust inference of UDS. To illustrate the flexibility of the algorithm we show that it performs well on EEG recordings as well. We then validate these results using simultaneous recordings of the LFP and membrane potential (MP) of nearby cortical neurons, showing that our method offers significant improvements over standard methods. These results could be useful for determining functional connectivity of different brain regions, as well as understanding network dynamics.

An improved index of phase-synchronization for electrophysiological data in the presence of volume-conduction, noise and sample-size bias	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Phase relationship; Synchronization; Oscillation; Volume conduction; Imaginary; Coherence	GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; EEG-DATA; COHERENCE; LOCKING; INTEGRATION; ATTENTION	Phase-synchronization is a manifestation of interaction between neuronal groups measurable from LFP, EEG or MEG signals, however, volume conduction can cause the coherence and the phase locking value to spuriously increase. It has been shown that the imaginary component of the coherency (ImC) cannot be spuriously increased by volume-conduction of independent sources. Recently, it was proposed that the phase lag index (PLI), which estimates to what extent the phase leads and lags between signals from two sensors are nonequiprobable, improves on the ImC. Compared to ImC. PLI has the advantage of being less influenced by phase delays. However, sensitivity to volume-conduction and noise, and capacity to detect changes in phase-synchronization, is hindered by the discontinuity of the PLI, as small perturbations turn phase lags into leads and vice versa. To solve this problem, we introduce a related index, namely the weighted phase lag index (WPLI). Differently from PLI, in WPLI the contribution of the observed phase leads and lags is weighted by the magnitude of the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum. We demonstrate two advantages of the WPLI over the PLI, in terms of reduced sensitivity to additional, uncorrelated noise sources and increased statistical power to detect changes in phase-synchronization. Another factor that can affect phase-synchronization indices is sample-size bias. We show that, when directly estimated, both PLI and the magnitude of the ImC have typically positively biased estimators. To solve this problem, we develop an unbiased estimator of the squared PLI, and a debiased estimator of the squared WPLI. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The optimally balanced brain state is applied in academics, consulting and business coaching to change subconscious belief patterns that tend to minimize effective thought and behavior. This kind of research might well be very important and useful in processes oriented toward integrating academic, consulting, business coaching activities, and similar processes. It may also be significant in finding ways of integrating research and education. The author based his conclusion on the documentation of one hundred twenty-five cases where data was gathered over a 12 month period, in three different locations, with different EEG technicians, using two different types of EEG equipment; the p-value is <=0.010. Consequently the conclusions are well supported. The creation of the essential neuropathways, indicated by the author might certainly help in processes oriented to integrate academic informing in its three main components (research, education and consulting), as well as in improving the performance of each of these three activities.

In mammals and birds, the best characterized marker of sleep pressure is slow wave activity (SWA), defined as the electroencephalogram (EEG) power between 0.5 and 4 Hz during NREM sleep. SWA peaks at sleep onset and decreases with time spent asleep, and reflects the synchronous firing of cortical neurons coordinated by an underlying slow oscillation, the fundamental cellular phenomenon of NREM sleep. We have recently proposed the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep, which claims that an important function of sleep is to maintain synaptic balance. This hypothesis states that plastic processes during wake are biased towards synaptic potentiation, resulting in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. Such increased synaptic weight would be unsustainable in the long run, due to increased demand for energy, space and supplies, and risk of synaptic saturation. Thus, according to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, sleep is important to renormalize synaptic strength to a baseline level that is sustainable and beneficial for memory and performance. There is strong evidence that the amplitude and slope of EEG slow waves is related to the number of neurons that enter an up state or a down state of the slow oscillation near-synchronously, and that synchrony is directly related to the number, strength, and efficacy of synaptic connections among them. Thus, the average synaptic strength (number or efficacy of synapses) reached in a given cortical area at the end of the major wake phase should be reflected by the level of SWA in the EEG at sleep onset. Moreover, according to the hypothesis, sleep SWA is not only a useful proxy of wake-related cortical synaptic strength, but could mediate the renormalization of neural circuits by favoring net synaptic depression, perhaps aided by low levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine during NREM sleep. Here we briefly review human and animal studies showing that, consistent with this hypothesis, 1) in the adult cerebral cortex wake is associated with a net increase in synaptic strength, and sleep with a net decrease; and 2) SWA reflects not just prior "use" of specific neuronal circuits, but rather the occurrence of plastic changes, with increases in SWA after synaptic potentiation, and decreases in SWA after synaptic depression. We end by discussing current challenges to this hypothesis and future research directions.

In this study we aimed to confirm this by examining early evoked oscillatory patterns in the EEG theta, beta and gamma bands in individuals with high schizotypal personality trait scores. We carried out an event-related experiment using a computerised delayed matching to sample working memory (WM) task on a sample of volunteers scoring high or low on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Phase-locking factor (PLF), a measure of network synchronisation, was reduced in the beta and gamma bands in two distinct topographical regions (fronto-central and centraloccipital). In addition, signal power in the beta band was decreased in the high schizotypy group in the same fronto-occipital network. These findings suggest that abnormalities in functional connectivity, already described in schizophrenia, extend to schizotypy. Further, the pattern and latency of the altered neural oscillations in the high schizotypy group suggests a deficient modulation of the sensory processing by higher-order structures. Such top-down deficits have been reported in schizophrenia and this data supports the idea that top-down dysfunction is a vulnerability trait that is independent of disease course, medication or symptom severity.

A brain-machine interface (BMI) offers patients with severe motor disabilities greater independence by controlling external devices such as prosthetic arms. Among the available signal sources for the BMI, electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a clinically feasible signal with long-term stability and low clinical risk. Although ECoG signals have been used to infer arm movements, no study has examined its use to control a prosthetic arm in real time. The authors present an integrated BMI system for the control of a prosthetic hand using ECoG signals in a patient who had suffered a stroke. This system used the power modulations of the ECoG signal that are characteristic during movements of the patient's hand and enabled control of the prosthetic hand with movements that mimicked the patient's hand movements. Methods. A poststroke patient with subdural electrodes placed over his sensorimotor cortex performed 3 types of simple hand movements following a sound cue (calibration period). Time-frequency analysis was performed with the ECoG signals to select 3 frequency bands (1-8. 25-40, and 80-150 Hz) that revealed characteristic power modulation during the movements. Using these selected features. 2 classifiers (decoders) were trained to predict the movement state that is. whether the patient was moving his hand or not and the movement type based on a linear support vector machine. The decoding accuracy was compared among the 3 frequency bands to identify the most informative features. With the trained decoders. novel ECoG signals were decoded online while the patient performed the same task without cues (free-run period). According to the results of the real-time. decoding. the prosthetic hand mimicked the patient's hand movements. Results. Offline cross-validation analysis of the ECoG data measured during the calibration period revealed that the state and movement type of the patient's hand were predicted with an accuracy of 79.6% (chance 50%) and 68.3% (chance 33.3%). respectively. Using the trained decoders, the onset of the hand movement was detected within 0.37 +/- 0.29 seconds of the actual movement. At the detected onset timing. the type of movement was inferred with an accuracy of 69.2%. In the free-run period, the patient's hand movements were faithfully mimicked by the prosthetic hand in real time. Conclusions. The present integrated BMI system successfully decoded the hand movements of a poststroke patient and controlled a prosthetic hand in real time. This success paves the way for the restoration of the patient's motor function using a prosthetic arm controlled by a BMI using ECoG signals.

In order to form the feature tensor, electrocorticograms, recorded during behavioral experiments in freely moving animals (rats), were mapped to the spatial-temporal-frequency space using the continuous wavelet transformation. An N-way partial least squares (NPLS) method is applied for tensor factorization and the prediction of a movement intention depending on neuronal activity. To cope with the huge feature tensor dimension, an iterative NPLS (INPLS) algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments demonstrated the good accuracy and robustness of INPLS. The algorithm does not depend on any prior neurophysiological knowledge and allows fully automatic system calibration and extraction of the BCI-related features. Based on the analysis of time intervals preceding the BCI events, the calibration procedure constructs a predictive model of control. The BCI system was validated by experiments in freely moving animals under conditions close to those in a natural environment.

Ten subjects actively observed familiar biological motions embedded in point-light and video displays. Electroencephalograms were recorded from 64 electrodes. Activity was considered in three frequency bands (4-8 Hz, 8-10 Hz, and 10-13 Hz) using a non-linear measure of functional connectivity. In the 4-8 Hz and 8-10 Hz frequency bands, functional connectivity for the SMA was greater during the observation of biological motions presented in a point-light display compared to the observation of motions presented in a video display. The reverse was observed for the 4-8 Hz frequency band for the left temporal area. Explanations related to: (i) the task demands (i. e., attention and mental effort), (ii) the role(s) of theta and alpha oscillations in cognitive processes, and (iii) the function(s) of cortical areas are discussed. It has been suggested that attention was required to process human biological motions under unfamiliar viewing conditions such as point-light display.

Anatomical and functional imaging studies suggest that individual symptoms may represent malfunction of different segregated networks running in parallel through the basal ganglia. In this study, we use a newly described, electrophysiological method to describe cortico-subthalamic networks in humans. We performed combined magnetoencephalographic and subthalamic local field potential recordings in thirteen patients with Parkinson's disease at rest. Two spatially and spectrally separated networks were identified. A temporoparietal-brainstem network was coherent with the subthalamic nucleus in the alpha (7-13 Hz) band, whilst a predominantly frontal network was coherent in the beta (15-35 Hz) band. Dopaminergic medication modulated the resting beta network, by increasing beta coherence between the subthalamic region and prefrontal cortex. Subthalamic activity was predominantly led by activity in the cortex in both frequency bands. The cortical topography and frequencies involved in the alpha and beta networks suggest that these networks may be involved in attentional and executive, particularly motor planning, processes, respectively.

We show that the interactions between neurons can be used as a means of chaos generation or suppression to neuron's outputs when more adaptability or stability is required. Furthermore, a new set of sufficient conditions based on coupling weights is proposed so that the synchronization of all neuron's outputs with each other is guaranteed, when all neuron's have identical activation functions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by performing simulations on three illustrative examples.

To understand the basic idea what are sleep, we use the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and polysomnography to measure the depth of sleep. By using NIRS we can determine the neuron activities and brain activities. The purpose of this study was to determine the stages of sleep called "rapid eyes movement" (REM) and "non-rapid eyes movement" (NREM). The NIRS probes were placed in the frontal region. The subject slept in a dark room while the Oxy-hemoglobin and deOxy-hemoglobin were recorded by the NIRS. We found a clear difference in the change of deOxy-hemoglobin between these two stages.

This process has been labeled as perceptual learning, and implies that adult nervous systems can adaptively modify the way in which they process sensory stimulation. However, the mechanisms by which the brain modifies this capacity have not been sufficiently analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the neural mechanisms of human perceptual learning by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity and the assessment of psychophysical performance during training in a visual search task. All participants improved their perceptual performance as reflected by an increase in sensitivity (d') and a decrease in reaction time. The EEG signal was acquired throughout the entire experiment revealing amplitude increments, specific and unspecific to the trained stimulus, in event-related potential (ERP) components N2pc and P3 respectively. P3 unspecific modification can be related to context or task-based learning, while N2pc may be reflecting a more specific attentional-related boosting of target detection. Moreover, bell and U-shaped profiles of oscillatory brain activity in gamma (30-60 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) frequency bands may suggest the existence of two phases for learning acquisition, which can be understood as distinctive optimization mechanisms in stimulus processing. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that there are reorganizations in several neural processes that contribute differently to perceptual learning in a visual search task. We propose an integrative model of neural activity reorganization, whereby perceptual learning takes place as a two-stage phenomenon including perceptual, attentional and contextual processes.

Stereotypical spatiotemporal activity patterns during slow-wave activity in the neocortex. J Neurophysiol 106: 3035-3044, 2011. First published August 17, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00811.2010.-Alternating epochs of activity and silence are a characteristic feature of neocortical networks during certain sleep cycles and deep states of anesthesia. The mechanism and functional role of these slow oscillations (<1 Hz) have not yet been fully characterized. Experimental and theoretical studies show that slow-wave oscillations can be generated autonomously by neocortical tissue but become more regular through a thalamo-cortical feedback loop. Evidence for a functional role of slow-wave activity comes from EEG recordings in humans during sleep, which show that activity travels as stereotypical waves over the entire brain, thought to play a role in memory consolidation. We used an animal model to investigate activity wave propagation on a smaller scale, namely within the rat somatosensory cortex. Signals from multiple extracellular microelectrodes in combination with one intracellular recording in the anesthetized animal in vivo were utilized to monitor the spreading of activity. We found that activity propagation in most animals showed a clear preferred direction, suggesting that it often originated from a similar location in the cortex. In addition, the breakdown of active states followed a similar pattern with slightly weaker direction preference but a clear correlation to the direction of activity spreading, supporting the notion of a wave-like phenomenon similar to that observed after strong sensory stimulation in sensory areas. Taken together, our findings support the idea that activity waves during slow-wave sleep do not occur spontaneously at random locations within the network, as was suggested previously, but follow preferred synaptic pathways on a small spatial scale.

EEG correlates of song prosody: a new look at the relationship between linguistic and musical rhythm	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						rhythm; EEG; beta/gamma oscillations; song perception; textsetting; prosody; language; music	NEUROMAGNETIC ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; METRIC STRUCTURE; ENTRAINMENT; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE; MEMORY; METER; SEGMENTATION	Song composers incorporate linguistic prosody into their music when setting words to melody, a process called "textsetting." Composers tend to align the expected stress of the lyrics with strong metrical positions in the music. The present study was designed to explore the idea that temporal alignment helps listeners to better understand song lyrics by directing listeners' attention to instances where strong syllables occur on strong beats. Three types of textsettings were created by aligning metronome clicks with all, some or none of the strong syllables in sung sentences. Electroencephalographic recordings were taken while participants listened to the sung sentences (primes) and performed a lexical decision task on subsequent words and pseudowords (targets, presented visually). Comparison of misaligned and well-aligned sentences showed that temporal alignment between strong/weak syllables and strong/weak musical beats were associated with modulations of induced beta and evoked gamma power, which have been shown to fluctuate with rhythmic expectancies. Furthermore, targets that followed well-aligned primes elicited greater induced alpha and beta activity, and better lexical decision task performance, compared with targets that followed misaligned and varied sentences. Overall, these findings suggest that alignment of linguistic stress and musical meter in song enhances musical beat tracking and comprehension of lyrics by synchronizing neural activity with strong syllables. This approach may begin to explain the mechanisms underlying the relationship between linguistic and musical rhythm in songs, and how rhythmic attending facilitates learning and recall of song lyrics. Moreover, the observations reported here coincide with a growing number of studies reporting interactions between the linguistic and musical dimensions of song, which likely stem from shared neural resources for processing music and speech.

Presumably, these different dynamical states correspond to different mental states and functions, and to study transitions between such states could give us valuable insight in brain-mind relations that should also be of clinical interest. We use computational methods to address these problems, with an objective to find relations between structure, dynamics and function. In particular, we have developed models of paleo- and neocortical structures, in order to study their mesoscopic neurodynamics, as a link between the microscopic neuronal and macroscopic mental events and processes. In this presentation, I will describe different types of models, where the emphasis is on network connectivity and structure, but also including molecular and cellular properties at varying detail, depending on the particular problem and experimental data available. We use these models to study how phase transitions can be induced in the mesoscopic neurodynamics of cortical networks by internal (natural) and external (artificial) factors. We relate and discuss the models and simulation results to macroscopic phenomena, such as arousal, attention, anaesthesia, learning, and mental disorders.

In auditory processing, selective attention toward task-relevant stimuli and the inhibition of irrelevant information can be considered as aspects of top-down attentional control. Oscillatory rhythms in the alpha band have been found to play an important role during top-down processing. Because attention deficits have been noted in patients with schizophrenia, we examined alpha oscillations in schizophrenia and in the prodromal phase of psychosis. Methods: The present study compared alpha oscillations using measures of both spectral power and inter-trial coherence in 17 subjects at ultra-high-risk, 10 patients with schizophrenia, and 18 matched normal control subjects. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was conducted during an auditory oddball task to investigate alpha brain activity related to selective attention to target stimuli and selective inhibition of irrelevant stimuli. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed diminished alpha event-related desynchronization compared with the control subjects, while the ultra-high-risk subjects had values intermediate between the control subjects and schizophrenia patients. Similarly, alpha inter-trial phase coherence was lower in the schizophrenia patients than the ultra-high-risk subjects, and lower in the ultra-high-risk subjects than the normal control subjects. Furthermore, alpha band activity in the parieto-occipital region was more severely depressed in the schizophrenia patients than the ultra-high-risk subjects. Conclusions: The altered alpha band activity in the ultra-high-risk group indicates that a deficit in top-down attentional control exists before the onset of psychosis. The alpha event-related desynchronization and inter-trial coherence may reflect a functional decline in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The standard technique consists on monitoring various bio-physiological signals of the patient during sleep. The resulting recording, the polysomnography (PSG) is then analyzed offline by the physician. This supposes a very time-consuming task and therefore automation of these analyses is desirable. An arousal during sleep is defined as an abrupt shift in EEG frequency. Normal structure of sleep is altered by the presence of these events, thus being an important factor that influences on the quality of sleep. The use of computing assistance for the detection of these events on the PSG is aimed at reducing the cost of the PSG test, both in economical and human resources. In this work, a dataset containing PSGs of real patients was used for the detection of arousals in sleep. A total of 42 features were extracted from biosignals for the detection of these events. Our aim was to use different feature selection methods to eliminate the redundant features studying their influence on the identification of sleep arousals, checking whether classification could be improved. The objective is to reduce the number of features, identifying the subset of those with more relevance while preserving a good performance on the classifier. Two approximations are explored, wrappers and filters, using different methods of both, and also combinations of each of the methods by means of the union and the intersection of the relevant features obtained. The results showed that discarding the irrelevant features by these methods is feasible, reducing the dimensionality on the input space and also improving the accuracy of the classifiers.

Attentional selection of relative SF mediates global versus local processing: Evidence from EEG	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						global versus local processing; hemispheric asymmetry; spatial frequency; alpha reduction	TEMPORAL-PARIETAL JUNCTION; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; SPATIAL-FREQUENCIES; ALPHA-BAND; STIMULUS POSITION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; NEGLECT; SYNCHRONIZATION	Previous research on functional hemispheric differences in visual processing has associated global perception with low spatial frequency (LSF) processing biases of the right hemisphere (RH) and local perception with high spatial frequency (HSF) processing biases of the left hemisphere (LH). The Double Filtering by Frequency (DFF) theory expanded this hypothesis by proposing that visual attention selects and is directed to relatively LSFs by the RH and relatively HSFs by the LH, suggesting a direct causal relationship between SF selection and global versus local perception. We tested this idea in the current experiment by comparing activity in the EEG recorded at posterior right and posterior left hemisphere sites while participants' attention was directed to global or local levels of processing after selection of relatively LSFs versus HSFs in a previous stimulus. Hemispheric asymmetry in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) during preparation for global versus local processing was modulated by the selected SF. In contrast, preparatory activity associated with selection of SF was not modulated by the previously attended level (global/local). These results support the DFF theory that top-down attentional selection of SF mediates global and local processing.

Development of structural cortical connectivity is known to be altered in this group, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence indicates that very preterm children recruit different patterns of functional connectivity between cortical regions during cognition. Synchronization of neural oscillations across brain areas has been proposed as a mechanism for dynamically assigning functional coupling to support perceptual and cognitive processing, but little is known about what role oscillatory synchronization may play in the altered neurocognitive development of very preterm children. To investigate this, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity while 7-8 year old children born very preterm and age-matched full-term controls performed a visual short-term memory task. Very preterm children exhibited reduced long-range synchronization in the alpha-band during visual short-term memory retention, indicating that cortical alpha rhythms may play a critical role in altered patterns functional connectivity expressed by this population during cognitive and perceptual processing. Long-range alpha-band synchronization was also correlated with task performance and visual-perceptual ability within the very preterm group, indicating that altered alpha oscillatory mechanisms mediating transient functional integration between cortical regions may be relevant to selective problems in neurocognitive development in this vulnerable population at school age.

The Neuronal Transition Probability (NTP) Model for the Dynamic Progression of Non-REM Sleep EEG: The Role of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VENTROLATERAL PREOPTIC NUCLEUS; ASCENDING AROUSAL SYSTEM; BRAIN-STEM; CIRCADIAN REGULATION; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; DELTA-WAVES; SLOW; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS	Little attention has gone into linking to its neuronal substrates the dynamic structure of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, defined as the pattern of time-course power in all frequency bands across an entire episode. Using the spectral power time-courses in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), we showed in the typical first episode, several moves towards-and-away from deep sleep, each having an identical pattern linking the major frequency bands beta, sigma and delta. The neuronal transition probability model (NTP) - in fitting the data well - successfully explained the pattern as resulting from stochastic transitions of the firing-rates of the thalamically-projecting brainstem-activating neurons, alternating between two steady dynamic-states (towards-and-away from deep sleep) each initiated by a so-far unidentified flip-flop. The aims here are to identify this flip-flop and to demonstrate that the model fits well all NREM episodes, not just the first. Using published data on suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) activity we show that the SCN has the information required to provide a threshold-triggered flip-flop for TIMING the towards-and-away alternations, information provided by sleep-relevant feedback to the SCN. NTP then determines the PATTERN of spectral power within each dynamic-state. NTP was fitted to individual NREM episodes 1-4, using data from 30 healthy subjects aged 20-30 years, and the quality of fit for each NREM measured. We show that the model fits well all NREM episodes and the best-fit probability-set is found to be effectively the same in fitting all subject data. The significant model-data agreement, the constant probability parameter and the proposed role of the SCN add considerable strength to the model. With it we link for the first time findings at cellular level and detailed time-course data at EEG level, to give a coherent picture of NREM dynamics over the entire night and over hierarchic brain levels all the way from the SCN to the EEG.

Increased alpha-band power during the retention of shapes and shape-location associations in visual short-term memory	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						short-term memory; alpha band; oscillations; electroencephalography; inhibition		Studies exploring the role of neural oscillations in cognition have revealed sustained increases in alpha-band (similar to 8-14 Hz) power during the delay period of delayed-recognition short-term memory tasks. These increases have been proposed to reflect the inhibition, for example, of cortical areas representing task-irrelevant information, or of potentially interfering representations from previous trials. Another possibility, however, is that elevated delay-period alpha-band power (DPABP) reflects the selection and maintenance of information, rather than, or in addition to, the inhibition of task-irrelevant information. In the present study, we explored these possibilities using a delayed-recognition paradigm in which the presence and task relevance of shape information was systematically manipulated across trial blocks and electroencephalographic was used to measure alpha-band power. In the first trial block, participants remembered locations marked by identical black circles. The second block featured the same instructions, but locations were marked by unique shapes. The third block featured the same stimulus presentation as the second, but with pretrial instructions indicating, on a trial-by-trial basis, whether memory for shape or location was required, the other dimension being irrelevant. In the final block, participants remembered the unique pairing of shape and location for each stimulus. Results revealed minimal DPABP in each of the location-memory conditions, whether locations were marked with identical circles or with unique task-irrelevant shapes. In contrast, alpha-band power increases were observed in both the shape-memory condition, in which location was task irrelevant, and in the critical final condition, in which both shape and location were task relevant. These results provide support for the proposal that alpha-band oscillations reflect the retention of shape information and/or shape-location associations in short-term memory.

J	Kasevich, RS; LaBerge, D				Kasevich, Ray S.; LaBerge, David			Theory of Electric Resonance in the Neocortical Apical Dendrite	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; INFORMATION; PLASTICITY; LOCATION; CHANNEL; MODELS; NOISE; CAT	Pyramidal neurons of the neocortex display a wide range of synchronous EEG rhythms, which arise from electric activity along the apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons. Here we present a theoretical description of oscillation frequency profiles along apical dendrites which exhibit resonance frequencies in the range of 10 to 100 Hz. The apical dendrite is modeled as a leaky coaxial cable coated with a dielectric, in which a series of compartments act as coupled electric circuits that gradually narrow the resonance profile. The tuning of the peak frequency is assumed to be controlled by the average amplitude of voltage-gated outward currents, which in turn are regulated by the subthreshold noise in the thousands of synaptic spines that are continuously bombarded by local circuits. The results of simulations confirmed the ability of the model both to tune the peak frequency in the 10-100 Hz range and to gradually narrow the resonance profile. Considerable additional narrowing of the resonance profile is provided by repeated looping through the apical dendrite via the corticothalamocortical circuit, which reduced the width of each resonance curve (at half-maximum) to approximately 1 Hz. Synaptic noise in the neural circuit is discussed in relation to the ways it can influence the narrowing process.

J	Stevenson, CM; Brookes, MJ; Morris, PG				Stevenson, Claire M.; Brookes, Matthew J.; Morris, Peter G.			beta-Band Correlates of the fMRI BOLD Response	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						MEG; fMRI; oscillatory activity; beta band; contrast response; linearity	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; DEFAULT NETWORK; VISUAL-CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; FIELD; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SIGNATURES	Oscillatory activity in the beta-band (15-30 Hz) has been studied in detail in the sensorimotor cortex. It has been postulated that beta-activity acts as a localized gating of cortical activity. Here, the induced oscillatory response in the beta-band is measured by magnetoencephalography, and the hemodynamic response is measured by fMRI. We assess the linearity of the responses to stimuli of varying duration in the primary motor cortex and to a sinusoidal drifting grating of varying contrast amplitude and drift frequency in the visual cortex. In this way, we explore the nature of beta-oscillations and their relationship with hemodynamic effects. Excellent spatial colocalization of BOLD and beta-activity in both central and lateral (MT) visual areas and sensorimotor areas suggests that the two are intimately related. In contrast to the BOLD response, the level of beta-desynchronization is not modulated by stimulus contrast or by stimulus duration, consistent with a gating role. The amplitude of beta-desynchronization in the central visual area is however modulated by drift frequency, and this seems to parallel the modulation in BOLD amplitude at the same location.

The function of the sleep spindle: A physiological index of intelligence and a mechanism for sleep-dependent memory consolidation	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Sleep; Spindles; Non-REM; Memory; Consolidation; Learning; Intelligence	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; REM-SLEEP; NOCTURNAL SLEEP; STAGE-2 SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN PLASTICITY; MOTOR MEMORY	Until recently, the electrophysiological mechanisms involved in strengthening new memories into a more permanent form during sleep have been largely unknown. The sleep spindle is an event in the electroencephalogram (EEG) characterizing Stage 2 sleep. Sleep spindles may reflect, at the electrophysiological level, an ideal mechanism for inducing long-term synaptic changes in the neocortex. Recent evidence suggests the spindle is highly correlated with tests of intellectual ability (e.g.; IQtests) and may serve as a physiological index of intelligence. Further, spindles increase in number and duration in sleep following new learning and are correlated with performance improvements. Spindle density and sigma (14-16 Hz) spectral power have been found to be positively correlated with performance following a daytime nap, and animal studies suggest the spindle is involved in a hippocampal-neocortical dialogue necessary for memory consolidation. The findings reviewed here collectively provide a compelling body of evidence that the function of the sleep spindle is related to intellectual ability and memory consolidation.

We determined whether ictal HFOs at 80-200 Hz were coupled with a phase of slow-wave, whether ictal slow-waves were diffusely or locally synchronous signals, and whether the mode of coupling between HFOs and slow-wave phases differed between ictal and interictal states. We studied 11 children who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) recording. The phases and amplitudes of slow-waves were measured at the peak of ictal and interictal HFOs in the seizure-onset sites. Ictal HFOs were locked tightly to the phase of slow-wave at <= 1 Hz. Ictal slow-waves propagated from the seizure-onset site to other regions. In contrast, interictal HFOs in the seizure-onset site were loosely locked to the phase of slow-wave at <= 1 Hz but tightly to that of >= 3-Hz. Ictal slow-waves coupled with HFOs can be explained as near-field and locally synchronized potentials generated by the neocortex rather than far-field potentials generated by subcortical structures. Ictal slow-waves in epileptic spasms may be generated by a mechanism different from what generates interictal HFOs-slow-wave complexes.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is an MRI technique that allows for reconstruction of brain white matter tracts, which can be used to infer structural connectivity. This paper reports a novel merger of these two modalities. A processing stream is described in which fiber tracts near intracranial macroelectrodes showing task-related functional responses are isolated to explore structural networks related to working memory maintenance. Results show that ECoG-constrained tractography is useful for revealing structural connectivity patterns related to spatially- and temporally-specific functional responses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathophysiology of the transition to seizure still remains mysterious. Herein we review some of the key concepts and relevant literatures dealing with this enigmatic transitioning of brain states. At the "MACRO" level, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings at time display pre-ictal phenomena followed by pathological high-frequency oscillations at the seizure onset. Numerous seizure prediction algorithms predicated on identifying changes prior to seizure onset have met with little success, underscoring our lack of understanding of the dynamics of transition to seizure, amongst other inherent limitation. We then discuss the concept of synchronized hyperexcited oscillatory networks underlying seizure generation. We consider these networks as weakly coupled oscillators, a concept which forms the basis of some relevant mathematical modeling of seizure transitions. Next, the underlying "MICRO" processes involved in seizure generation are discussed. The depolarization of the GABA(A) chloride reversal potential is a major concept, facilitating epileptogenesis, particularly in immature brain. Also the balance of inhibitory and excitatory local neuronal networks plays an important role in the process of transitioning to seizure. Gap junctional communication, including that which occurs between glia, as well as ephaptic interactions are increasingly recognized as critical for seizure generation. In brief, this review examines the evidence regarding the characterization of the transition to seizure at both the "MACRO" and "MICRO" levels, trying to characterize this mysterious yet critical problem of the brain state transitioning into a seizure.

We examined interactions between SOs and spindles in human slow wave sleep, focusing on the presumed existence of 2 kinds of spindles, i.e., slow frontocortical and fast centro-parietal spindles. Design: Two experiments were performed in healthy humans (24.5 +/- 0.9 y) investigating undisturbed sleep (Experiment I) and the effects of prior learning (word paired associates) vs. non-learning (Experiment II) on multichannel EEG recordings during sleep. Measurements and Results: Only fast spindles (12-15 Hz) were synchronized to the depolarizing SO up-state. Slow spindles (9-12 Hz) occurred preferentially at the transition into the SO down-state, i.e., during waning depolarization. Slow spindles also revealed a higher probability to follow rather than precede fast spindles. For sequences of individual SOs, fast spindle activity was largest for "initial" SOs, whereas SO amplitude and slow spindle activity were largest for succeeding SOs. Prior learning enhanced this pattern. Conclusions: The finding that fast and slow spindles occur at different times of the SO cycle points to disparate generating mechanisms for the 2 kinds of spindles. The reported temporal relationships during SO sequences suggest that fast spindles, driven by the SO up-state feed back to enhance the likelihood of succeeding SOs together with slow spindles. By enforcing such SO-spindle cycles, particularly after prior learning, fast spindles possibly play a key role in sleep-dependent memory processing.

Extensive literature exists reporting on the effectiveness of neurofeedback in the treatment of autism, closed head injury, insomnia, migraine, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder. We speculated that neurofeedback might serve as a therapeutic modality for patients with medically refractory neurological disorders and have begun referring patients to train with clinical neurofeedback practitioners. The modality is not always covered by insurance. Confident their child's medical and neurological needs would continue to be met, the parents of 3 children with epilepsy spectrum disorder decided to have their child train in the modality. The children's individual progress following neurofeedback are each presented here. A proposed mechanism and practice implications are discussed.

A data-driven framework for neural field modeling	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural field model; Nonlinear estimation; Intracortical connectivity; Nonlinear dynamics	EEG; DYNAMICS; TIME; TRANSITION; GENERATION; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; ALPHA	This paper presents a framework for creating neural field models from electrophysiological data. The Wilson and Cowan or Amari style neural field equations are used to form a parametric model, where the parameters are estimated from data. To illustrate the estimation framework, data is generated using the neural field equations incorporating modeled sensors enabling a comparison between the estimated and true parameters. To facilitate state and parameter estimation, we introduce a method to reduce the continuum neural field model using a basis function decomposition to form a finite-dimensional state-space model. Spatial frequency analysis methods are introduced that systematically specify the basis function configuration required to capture the dominant characteristics of the neural field. The estimation procedure consists of a two-stage iterative algorithm incorporating the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother for state estimation and a least squares algorithm for parameter estimation. The results show that it is theoretically possible to reconstruct the neural field and estimate intracortical connectivity structure and synaptic dynamics with the proposed framework.

Relationships between pre-stimulus gamma power and subsequent P300 and reaction time breakdown in schizophrenia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Schizophrenia; P300; Gamma power; Reaction time	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BAND ACTIVITY; ANTICIPATORY ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; GESTALT PERCEPTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; MEMORY TASK; DUAL-TASK; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Introduction: Little is known about the relationship between gamma-band oscillations prior to the arrival of a target stimulus and subsequent sensory processing and response execution. Although schizophrenia has been associated with abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations, P300, and reaction time (RI), few studies have examined the possible correspondence between these three neurobiological and behavioral markers in schizophrenia. To characterize the relationship between preparatory processes, information processing, and subsequent behavioral performance in schizophrenia, the present study investigated the relationships between pre-stimulus gamma-band power, RI and P300 amplitude. Methods: EEG and behavioral data were collected from 18 schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy controls during a conventional auditory oddball task. Results: In controls, single-trial pre-stimulus gamma power was positively correlated with RI, and average P300 amplitude was positively correlated with average pre-stimulus gamma power. Discussion: We interpret these findings as evidence that gamma power enhancement reflects a state of greater pre-stimulus preparation resulting in fuller evaluation of the target stimulus and therefore slower RT, as proposed by Jokeit and Makeig (1994). Consistent with previous research, schizophrenia patients exhibited RI slowing and P300 amplitude reductions relative to controls. Importantly, neither RI nor P300 amplitude was related to pre-stimulus gamma power in schizophrenia, suggesting a breakdown in the preparatory brain state critical for stimulus processing and later motor execution. The present findings underscore the behavioral significance of gamma-band responses, and provide an additional link between gamma-band oscillations and information processing abnormalities in schizophrenia.

In the present chapter we first provide an introduction to the techniques and signals of non-invasive electrophysiology (Part 1) and then explain its application to perceptual (2) and cognitive processes (3). We discuss some of the most widely investigated and replicated electrophysiological features of schizophrenia, including the P50, P1, MMN and P3. Recent applications of time frequency analysis techniques have allowed for a more detailed investigation of the neural mechanisms of cognition and its dysfunction through measures of oscillatory activity (4). We finally introduce some of the current approaches that combine non-invasive neurophysiology, pharmacology and genetics. We will discuss their findings in the context of cellular and molecular models of schizophrenia, particularly in relation to several neurotransmitter systems (5). We argue that cognitive neurophysiology can provide interesting intermediate phenotypes of schizophrenia.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrate that measuring correlations between brain regions in resting-state activity can be used to reveal intrinsic neural networks. To study the oscillatory dynamics that underlie intrinsic functional connectivity between regions requires high temporal resolution measures of electrophysiological brain activity, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, there is a lack of consensus as to the best method for examining connectivity in resting-state MEG data. Here we adapted a wavelet-based method for measuring phase-locking with respect to Me frequency of neural oscillations. This method employs anatomical MRI information combined with MEG data using the minimum norm estimate inverse solution to produce functional connectivity maps from a "seed" region to all other locations on the cortical surface at any and all frequencies of interest. We test this method by simulating phase-locked oscillations at various points on the cortical surface, which illustrates a substantial artifact that results from imperfections in the inverse solution. We demonstrate that normalizing resting-state MEG data using phase-locking values computed on empty room data reduces much of the effects of this artifact. We then use this method with eight subjects to reveal intrinsic interhemispheric connectivity in the auditory network in the alpha frequency band in a silent environment. This spectral resting-state functional connectivity imaging method may allow us to better understand the oscillatory dynamics underlying intrinsic functional connectivity in the human brain.

Here, we analyzed the temporal and spatial evolution of interictal spikes with and without HFOs in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Depth electrode recordings from dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 region, subiculum and entorhinal cortex (EC), were obtained from rats between the 4th and 15th day after a status epilepticus (SE) induced by i.p. injection of pilocarpine. The first seizure occurred 6.1 +/- 2.5 days after SE (n = 7 rats). Five of 7 animals exhibited interictal spikes that co-occurred with fast ripples accounting for 4.9 +/- 4.6% of all analyzed interictal spikes (n = 12,886) while all rats showed interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples, accounting for 14.3 +/- 3.4% of all events. Increased rates of interictal spikes without HFOs in the EC predicted upcoming seizures on the following day, while rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples in CA3 reflected periods of high seizure occurrence. Finally, interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples did not show any specific relation to seizure occurrence. Our findings identify different temporal and spatial developmental patterns for the rates of interictal spikes with or without HFOs in relation with seizure occurrence. These distinct categories of interictal spikes point at dynamic processes that should bring neuronal networks close to seizure generation. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is partly achieved by the allocation of attention, allowing the visual system to process relevant input while blocking out irrelevant input. What is the physiological substrate of attentional allocation? It has been proposed that alpha activity reflects functional inhibition. Here we asked if inhibition by alpha oscillations has behavioral consequences for suppressing the perception of unattended input. To this end, we investigated the influence of alpha activity on motion processing in two attentional conditions using magneto-encephalography. The visual stimuli used consisted of two random-dot kinematograms presented simultaneously to the left and right visual hemifields. Subjects were cued to covertly attend the left or right kinematogram. After 1.5 sec, a second cue tested whether subjects could report the direction of coherent motion in the attended (80%) or unattended hemifield (20%). Occipital alpha power was higher contralateral to the unattended side than to the attended side, thus suggesting inhibition of the unattended hemifield. Our key finding is that this alpha lateralization in the 20% invalidly cued trials did correlate with the perception of motion direction: Subjects with pronounced alpha lateralization were worse at detecting motion direction in the unattended hemifield. In contrast, lateralization did not correlate with visual discrimination in the attended visual hemifield. Our findings emphasize the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and suggest that processing of inputs outside the field of attention is weakened by means of increased alpha activity.

In the present study, we continuously measured electrocortical dynamics in human visual cortex, as evoked by happy, neutral, fearful, and angry faces. Thirty-seven participants endorsing high versus low generalized social anxiety (upper and lower tertiles of 2104 screened undergraduates) viewed naturalistic faces flickering at 17.5 Hz to evoke steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), recorded from 129 scalp electrodes. Electrophysiological data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain after linear source space projection using the minimum norm method. Source estimation indicated an early visual cortical origin of the face-evoked ssVEP, which showed sustained amplitude enhancement for emotional expressions specifically in individuals with pervasive social anxiety. Participants in the low symptom group showed no such sensitivity, and a correlational analysis across the entire sample revealed a strong relationship between self-reported interpersonal anxiety/avoidance and enhanced visual cortical response amplitude for emotional, versus neutral expressions.

In contrast, less is known about the information exchange during the performance of such complex tasks. In this study, the propagation of brain activity during a transitive reasoning task was investigated and compared to the propagation during a simple memory task. We studied EEG transmission patterns obtained for physiological indicators of brain activity and determined whether there are frequency bands specifically related to this type of cognitive operations. The analysis was performed by means of the directed transfer function. The transmission patterns were determined in the theta, alpha and gamma bands. The results show stronger transmissions in theta and alpha bands from frontal to parietal as well as within frontal regions in reasoning trials comparing to memory trials. The increase in theta and alpha transmissions was accompanied by flows in gamma band from right posterior to left posterior and anterior sites. These results are consistent with previous neuroimaging (fMRI) data concerning fronto-parietal regions involvement in reasoning and working memory processes and also provide new evidence for the executive role of frontal theta waves in organizing the cognition.

Past efforts to determine effective connectivity mostly relied on model based approaches such as Granger causality or dynamic causal modeling. Transfer entropy (TE) is an alternative measure of effective connectivity based on information theory. TE does not require a model of the interaction and is inherently non-linear. We investigated the applicability of TE as a metric in a test for effective connectivity to electrophysiological data based on simulations and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in a simple motor task. In particular, we demonstrate that TE improved the detectability of effective connectivity for non-linear interactions, and for sensor level MEG signals where linear methods are hampered by signal-cross-talk due to volume conduction.

Popular feature types include logarithmic band power (logBP), autoregressive (AR) parameters, time-domain parameters, and wavelet-based methods. In this study, we focused on different variants of AR models and compare performance with logBP features. In particular, we analyzed univariate, vector, and bilinear AR models. We used four-class motor imagery data from nine healthy users over two sessions. We used the first session to optimize parameters such as model order and frequency bands. We then evaluated optimized feature extraction methods on the unseen second session. We found that band power yields significantly higher classification accuracies than AR methods. However, we did not update the bias of the classifiers for the second session in our analysis procedure. When updating the bias at the beginning of a new session, we found no significant differences between all methods anymore. Furthermore, our results indicate that subject-specific optimization is not better than globally optimized parameters. The comparison within the AR methods showed that the vector model is significantly better than both univariate and bilinear variants. Finally, adding the prediction error variance to the feature space significantly improved classification results.

There are important advantages of using random graph theory approach in addition to ordinary and partial differential equations. The mathematical theory of large-scale random graphs provides an efficient tool to describe transitions between high- and low-dimensional spaces. Recent advances in studying neural correlates of higher cognition indicate the significance of sudden changes in space-time neurodynamics, which can be efficiently described as phase transitions in the neuropil medium. Phase transitions are rigorously defined mathematically on random graph sequences and they can be naturally generalized to a class of percolation processes called neuropercolation. In this work we employ mean-field graphs with given vertex degree distribution and edge strength distribution. We demonstrate the emergence of collective oscillations in the style of brains.

In this paper, the human brain oscillatory response system associated with working memory performance is evaluated in an experimental and analysis setting involving 10 volunteers performing a visual 2-back task. Event-related dynamics in three bands: theta (3.5 - 7 Hz), alpha (7.5 - 12 Hz) and upper beta (17 - 29 Hz) at 32 locations distributed over the scalp are examined analyzing the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/synchronization (ERS) in these bands. Both global dynamics as well as trial-and subject-specific trends were considered. The overall across participants trend shows that the theta level synchronizes during working memory engagement, whereas beta and alpha desynchronizes. While common features seem to emerge, different subjects exhibit equally significant but opposite in direction correlation between reaction time and power dynamics.

In patients with negative symptoms, the spectral peak frequency of the alpha activity (8-13 Hz) was decreased at rest as compared to healthy subjects in all cortical areas. In patients with positive symptoms, the peak frequency of the alpha rhythm in the occipital cortical areas was higher than in healthy subjects. The performance-induced increase in the alpha-rhythm peak frequency during cognitive tasks was less expressed in schizophrenics than in healthy subjects. A correlation of these characteristics with psychopathological symptoms was revealed.

They are characterized by spike-wave (SW) or spike-wave/polyspike-wave (SW/PSW) complexes of 1.5-3 Hz, intermingled with episodes of fast runs at similar to 10-20 Hz. These seizures often develop during slow-wave sleep, transition from wake to slow-wave sleep or transition from slow-wave sleep to waking state. Intracellular studies on both anesthetized and non-anesthetized cats have shown that hyperpolarizing phase of the slow oscillation, a distinct feature of slow-wave sleep, is associated with disfacilitation, a temporal absence of synaptic activity in all cortical neurons. Periods of disfacilitation temporally increase network excitability. The hyperpolarizing components of SW-PSW complexes are mediated mainly by leak current (state similar to discfacilitation), Ca2+- and Na+-activated K+ currents. It is proposed that prolonged periods of disfacilitation up-regulate neuronal excitability that contributes to the seizure generation. Once seizure has started, fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons fire multiple action potentials during paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (EEG spike components of SW/PSW complexes). During seizure a set of cellular processes induces a shift of reversal potential of GABA toward depolarization. Intense firing of GABAergic neurons and depolarizing GABA responses largely contribute to the generation of paroxysmal EEG spikes. Inhibition does not play a role in other components of neocortical seizures. Neocortical trauma, in particular penetrating wounds, produces partial deafferentation of a subset of neurons that decreases excitability of network. Cortical neurons display occasional periods of disfacilitation in deafferented cortex during all states of vigilance. As in the case of slow-wave sleep, periods of disfacilitation up-regulate neuronal excitability. Synaptic volleys originating from preserved axons impinge hyperexcitable neurons of deafferented cortex that trigger seizures. I propose that any physiological or pathological condition that leads to repeated or prolonged periods of neuronal silence will increase neuronal hyperexcitability that favours development of seizures.

Reduced gamma range activity at REM sleep onset and termination in fear-conditioned Wistar-Kyoto rats	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Gamma power; Rapid eye movement sleep; Fear conditioning; Posttraumatic stress disorder	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; WKY RATS; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; DEPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY; TWIN; OSCILLATION; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; STATES	Recent investigations of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) continuity have emphasized the importance of transitions both into and out of REMS. We have previously reported that, compared to Wistar rats (WIS), Wistar-Kyoto rats (WIN) responded to fear conditioning (FC) with more fragmented REMS. Gamma oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are synchronized throughout the brain in periods of focused attention, and such synchronization of cell assemblies in the brain may represent a temporal binding mechanism. Therefore, we examined the effects of FC on EEG gamma range activity (30-50 Hz) at REMS transitions in WKY compared to WIS. Relative power in the gamma range (measured as a percent of total power) at Baseline and upon re-exposure to the fear-inducing conditioning stimulus was measured 35s before REMS onset to 105s after REMS onset (ARO) and 85s before REMS termination (BRT) to 35 s after REMS termination. After baseline recording, rats received 10 tones, each co-terminating with an electric foot shock. On Days 1 and 14 post-conditioning, rats were re-exposed to three tones. Fast-Fourier transforms created power spectral data in the gamma frequency domain. Relative power was extracted from an average of 4-5 REMS transitions. Relative gamma power was always higher in WIS. On Day 14, at 15 s and 25s ARO, WIN had significant increases in relative gamma power from Baseline. WIS had a significant increase on Day 1 at 25 s ARO. Despite the increases in relative gamma power, WIN never achieved levels attained by WIS. Moreover, at 5 s BRT, only WKY had a significant decrease in relative gamma power from Baseline to Day 14. Gamma range activity may indicate neural activity underlying maintenance of REMS continuity. Low relative gamma power at REMS transitions may be associated with increased REMS fragmentation in WKY after FC. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

FAST MODULATION OF ALPHA ACTIVITY DURING VISUAL PROCESSING AND MOTOR CONTROL	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha activity; idling hypothesis; visual-motor task	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Whereas some studies suggest that alpha rhythm promotes information processing in the human cortex (processing hypothesis), other studies suggest its involvement in an active cortical idling which prevents the interfering action of irrelevant information (idling hypothesis). In this study, this apparent contradiction was analyzed using a computing procedure which distinguishes phase-locked and nonphase-locked alpha response during the execution of a complex event-related visual-motor task. The electroencephalographies (EEGs) of 12 male volunteers were digitized (128 electrodes), band-pass filtered for isolating a wave, and event-related averaged during the execution of the visual-motor tasks. This procedure showed a phase-locked a response to stimuli and suppressed the non-phase-locked response. When EEG envelope of the a-wave was computed (Hilbert transformation) before the event-related average, the response of the alpha amplitude to stimuli was observed while the phase-locked a response vanished. Visual stimuli induced a short-lasting increase of phase-locked alpha activity and a long-lasting decrease of non-phase-locked alpha activity whose latency and amplitude changed with the cortical region (visual vs. parietal vs. frontal cortex), with the sensory-semantic information of visual stimuli, and with the tasks associated to them (comparing the alpha response to stimuli which were used for a visual-motor tasks with those passively observed). Alpha sub-bands around the individual alpha frequency peak showed a different phase-locked response. Finally, two early evoked potentials (C1-P1) showed a time latency similar to that computed for the phase-locked alpha response, suggesting that early evoked potentials are modified by the superposition of this alpha activity. Present data suggest that alpha activity promotes the cortical processing of information by increasing the phase-locked alpha activity and by decreasing the non-phase-locked alpha activity, and disturbs cortical processing under basal conditions when it is not phase-locked to any particular task.

J	Sen Bhattacharya, B; Coyle, D; Maguire, LP				Sen Bhattacharya, Basabdatta; Coyle, Damien; Maguire, Liam P.			A thalamo-cortico-thalamic neural mass model to study alpha rhythms in Alzheimer's disease	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; Alpha rhythms; Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuitry; Neural mass model; Synaptic connectivity	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	We present a lumped computational model of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuitry. The model essentially consists of two modules: a thalamic module and a cortical module. The thalamic module circuitry is a modified version of a classic neural mass computational model of the thalamic circuitry to simulate cortical alpha rhythms and which we have used in previous research to study EEG abnormality associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here, we introduce a modified synaptic structure representing a neuronal population in the thalamic model. Furthermore, the synaptic organisation and connectivity parameter values in the model are based on experimental data reported from the dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of different species. The cortical module circuitry is based on a recent work studying cortical brain rhythms. We vary the synaptic connectivity parameters in the thalamic module of the model to simulate the effects of AD on brain synaptic circuitry and study power within the alpha frequency bands. The power and dominant frequencies of the model output are studied in three sub-bands within the alpha band: lower alpha (7-9 Hz), middle alpha (9-11 Hz) and upper alpha (11-13 Hz). Such an analytical method conforms to recent comparative EEG studies on young adults, healthy aged adults and MCI or early stage AD patients. The results show a remarkable role of the synaptic connectivities in the inhibitory thalamic cell populations on the alpha band power and frequency. Furthermore, the total number of active synapses in the thalamic cell populations produces the slowing of alpha rhythms and a simultaneous decrease of alpha band power in the brain as a result of AD.

However, how these periodicities are represented in the brain remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether this function emerges from the entrainment of neurons resonating to the beat and meter. We recorded the electroencephalogram while participants listened to a musical beat and imagined a binary or a ternary meter on this beat (i.e., a march or a waltz). We found that the beat elicits a sustained periodic EEG response tuned to the beat frequency. Most importantly, we found that meter imagery elicits an additional frequency tuned to the corresponding metric interpretation of this beat. These results provide compelling evidence that neural entrainment to beat and meter can be captured directly in the electroencephalogram. More generally, our results suggest that music constitutes a unique context to explore entrainment phenomena in dynamic cognitive processing at the level of neural networks.

Over this time scale, the natural fluctuations in brain state or rapid learning effects could impact measured signals, but are seldom analyzed. Methods and Findings: We investigated within-session dynamics of neocortical alpha (7-14 Hz) rhythms and their allocation with cued-attention using MEG recorded from primary somatosensory neocortex (SI) in humans. We found that there were significant and systematic changes across a single similar to 1 hour recording session in several dimensions, including increased alpha power, increased differentiation in attention-induced alpha allocation, increased distinction in immediate time-locked post-cue evoked responses in SI to different visual cues, and enhanced power in the immediate cue-locked alpha band frequency response. Further, comparison of two commonly used baseline methods showed that conclusions on the evolution of alpha dynamics across a session were dependent on the normalization method used. Conclusions: These findings are important not only as they relate to studies of oscillations in SI, they also provide a robust example of the type of dynamic changes in brain measures within a single session that are overlooked in most human brain imaging/recording studies.

However, no previous studies have demonstrated a clear link between lateralized brain functional network and language performance in preschool children. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive brain imaging technique and is a practical neuroimaging method for use in young children. MEG produces a reference-free signal, and is therefore an ideal tool to compute coherence between two distant cortical rhythms. In the present study, using a custom child-sized MEG system, we investigated brain networks while 78 right-handed preschool human children (32-64 months; 96% were 3-4 years old) listened to stories with moving images. The results indicated that left dominance of parietotemporal coherence in theta band activity (6-8 Hz) was specifically correlated with higher performance of language-related tasks, whereas this laterality was not correlated with nonverbal cognitive performance, chronological age, or head circumference. Power analyses did not reveal any specific frequencies that contributed to higher language performance. Our results suggest that it is not the left dominance in theta oscillation per se, but the left-dominant phase-locked connectivity via theta oscillation that contributes to the development of language ability in young children.

Low frequency fluctuations reveal integrated and segregated processing among the cerebral hemispheres	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; HUMAN BRAIN; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; GLOBAL SIGNAL; EEG COHERENCE; CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; CAPACITY; OPTIMIZATION	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided a novel approach for examining interhemispheric interaction, demonstrating a high degree of functional connectivity between homotopic regions in opposite hemispheres. However, heterotopic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) remains relatively uncharacterized. In the present study, we examine non-homotopic regions, characterizing heterotopic RSFC and comparing it to intrahemispheric RSFC, to examine the impact of hemispheric separation on the integration and segregation of processing in the brain. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 59 healthy participants to examine inter-regional correlations in spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal. Using a probabilistic atlas, we correlated probability-weighted time series from 112 regions (56 per hemisphere) distributed throughout the entire cerebrum. We compared RSFC for pairings of non-homologous regions located in different hemispheres (heterotopic connectivity) to RSFC for the same pairings when located within hemisphere (intrahemispheric connectivity). For positive connections, connectivity strength was greater within each hemisphere, consistent with integrated intrahemispheric processing. However, for negative connections, RSFC strength was greater between the hemispheres, consistent with segregated interhemispheric processing. These patterns were particularly notable for connections involving frontal and heteromodal regions. The distribution of positive and negative connectivity was nearly identical within and between the hemispheres, though we demonstrated detailed regional variation in distribution. We discuss implications for leading models of interhemispheric interaction. The future application of our analyses may provide important insight into impaired interhemispheric processing in clinical and aging populations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

At larger spatial scales (similar to 2-30 cm), investigated by scalp EEG recordings, SWA has been shown to propagate globally over wide cortical regions as traveling waves, which has been proposed to serve as a temporal framework for neural plasticity. However, whether SWA dynamics at finer spatial scales also reflects the orderly propagation has not previously been investigated in humans. To reveal the local, finer spatial scale (similar to 1-6 cm) patterns of SWA propagation during non-REM sleep, electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings were conducted from subdurally implanted electrode grids and a nonlinear correlation technique [mutual information (MI)] was implemented. MI analysis revealed spatial maps of correlations between cortical areas demonstrating SWA propagation directions, speed, and association strength. Highest correlations, indicating significant coupling, were detected during the initial positive-going deflection of slow waves. SWA propagated predominantly between adjacent cortical areas, albeit spatial noncontinuities were also frequently observed. MI analysis further uncovered significant convergence and divergence patterns. Areas receiving the most convergent activity were similar to those with high divergence rate, while reciprocal and circular propagation of SWA was also frequent. We hypothesize that SWA is characterized by distinct attributes depending on the spatial scale observed. At larger spatial scales, the orderly SWA propagation dominates; at the finer scale of the ECoG recordings, non-REM sleep is characterized by complex SWA propagation patterns.

Understanding Perception Through Neural "Codes"	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Amplitude (AM) pattern; correlation length; electrocorticogram (ECoG); Hebbian assembly; neocortical population	OLFACTORY EEG; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SCALP EEG; BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS; ALPHA	A major challenge for cognitive scientists is to deduce and explain the neural mechanisms of the rapid transposition between stimulus energy and recalled memory-between the specific (sensation) and the generic (perception)-in both material and mental aspects. Researchers are attempting three explanations in terms of neural codes. The microscopic code: cellular neurobiologists correlate stimulus properties with the rates and frequencies of trains of action potentials induced by stimuli and carried by topologically organized axons. The mesoscopic code: cognitive scientists formulate symbolic codes in trains of action potentials from feature-detector neurons of phonemes, lines, odorants, vibrations, faces, etc., that object-detector neurons bind into representations of stimuli. The macroscopic code: neurodynamicists extract neural correlates of stimuli and associated behaviors in spatial patterns of oscillatory fields of dendritic activity, which self-organize and evolve on trajectories through high-dimensional brain state space. This multivariate code is expressed in landscapes of chaotic attractors. Unlike other scientific codes, such as DNA and the periodic table, these neural codes have no alphabet or syntax. They are epistemological metaphors that experimentalists need to measure neural activity and engineers need to model brain functions. My aim is to describe the main properties of the macroscopic code and the grand challenge it poses: how do very large patterns of textured synchronized oscillations form in cortex so quickly?

Two series of experiment - either with a 2-sec or a 9-sec inter-stimulus interval were conducted, each consisting of 60 trials. In both series, we observed an induced desynchronization of low alpha (8-10 Hz) at the first second after the warning stimulus and its desynchronization just before the target stimulus. In series with a 9-sec inter-stimulus interval at the 4-6 s of it we observed an alpha-band synchronization, especially distinct in high alpha (10.5-13 Hz). This synchronization gradually reduced towards the end of the inter-stimulus interval. We consider the above changes in alpha-band spectral power during the inter-stimulus interval to be induced by "inner impulsations" caused by an internal representation (set) of the stimuli time-sequence. Changes in the level of cognitive control during the inter-stimulus interval cause increases and decreases in fronto-thalamic system activity, which are manifested in changes of alpha-band spectral power. Analysis of theta-band dynamics suggests that cortico-hippocampal system doesn't participate in this process.	[Kostandov, E. A.; Cheremushkin, E. A.; Ashkinazi, M. L.; Yakovenko, I.

Here, we investigated a similar effect revealed in subdural intracranial recordings in humans. Our results show that the suppression of the subdural ERP is not associated with a reduction in the gamma frequency power, considered to reflect the underlying neural activity. Furthermore, the evoked potential suppression (EPS) phenomenon was not reflected in recognition behavior of the patients. Rather, the EPS was tightly linked to the level of gamma activity preceding the event, and this effect was independent of the interstimulus time interval. Analyzing other frequency bands failed to reveal a similar link. Our results thus show a consistent antagonism between subdural ERP and gamma power although both are considered markers for neural activity. We hypothesize that the ERP suppression is due to a desynchronization of neuronal firing resulting from recurrent neural activity in the vicinity of the freshly stimulated neurons and not an attenuation of the overall neural activity.

So far, on electroencephalographic data, only event-related potentials (ERPs) were considered. In this study, we examined the frequency properties of SON. Methods: Data of 17 healthy subjects were processed for equiprobable stimuli of SON, other- and own-name backwards by calculating ERPs, evoked and induced activity for a period of 2000 ms from stimulus onset in the delta, theta, lower and upper alpha bands and averaging for four consequent temporal segments of 500 ms each. Results: For SON, the N1 component's amplitude was larger, while induced activity in the alpha band decreased in the second temporal segment (of 500-1000 ms). No differences between other- and own-name backwards were found. Conclusions: The late reactivity may indicate responses to a stimulus after having recognised it. Alpha is known to play a role in attention and alertness. The results may reflect the fact that the SON stimulus enhances alertness. Significance: The findings correlate previous work about alertness and alpha activity with those about attention capturing of the SON stimulus. We suggest using frequency analysis in research on disorders of consciousness. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the characteristics of early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increase in theta band power (4-7 Hz). However, the mechanism(s) underlying the changes in theta oscillations are still unclear. To address this issue, we investigate the theta band power changes associated with beta-Amyloid (Ab) peptide (one of the main markers of AD) using a computational model, and by mediating the toxicity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We use an established biophysical hippocampal CA1-medial septum network model to evaluate four ionic channels in pyramidal neurons, which were demonstrated to be affected by Ab. They are the L-type Ca2+ channel, delayed rectifying K+ channel, A-type fast-inactivating K+ channel and large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel. Our simulation results demonstrate that only the Ab inhibited A-type fast-inactivating K+ channel can induce an increase in hippocampo-septal theta band power, while the other channels do not affect theta rhythm. We further deduce that this increased theta band power is due to enhanced synchrony of the pyramidal neurons. Our research may elucidate potential biomarkers and therapeutics for AD. Further investigation will be helpful for better understanding of AD-induced theta rhythm abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits.

The experiment was performed by inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) of the thalamocortical pathway after recording local field potential (LFP). Additionally, comparison of IM measurement between broad- and narrowbands was performed, while a numerical study was also carried out for assessing the number of data points. The results show that the instantaneous phases extracted from narrowband vary monotonically, while these phases are jagged in broadband. Our data show that there is a predominant driving effect (coupling directional index d>0) from the thalamus to the frontal cortex in normal animals; however, the value of d is significantly reduced in the chronic stressed group in both the delta and theta bands. Furthermore, the field LTP data show that chronic stress decreases medial prefrontal cortex synaptic plasticity, which is certainly in line with the LFP findings. Together, these data suggest that using an IM algorithm, the directionality index of NIF in specific oscillatory frequency bands will probably be used as a measure of synaptic plasticity.

Here, recording EEG in human participants (n = 25) performing a modified delayed match-to-sample task allowed us to disambiguate internally driven memory processing from encoding-related delay activity. After presentation of two distinct vibrotactile frequencies to different index fingers, a visual cue indicated which of the two previous stimuli had to be maintained in working memory throughout a retention interval for subsequent frequency discrimination against a probe stimulus. During cued stimulus maintenance, a activity (8-13 Hz) over early somatosensory cortices was lateralized according to the cued tactile stimulus, even though the location of the stimuli was task irrelevant. The task-relevant memory content, in contrast, was found to be represented in right prefrontal cortex. The key finding was that the visually presented instructions triggered systematic modulations of prefrontal beta-band activity (20-25 Hz), which selectively reflected the to-be-maintained frequency of the cued tactile vibration. The results expand previous evidence for parametric representations of vibrotactile frequency in the prefrontal cortex and corroborate a central role of dynamic beta-band synchronization during active processing of an analog stimulus quantity in human working memory. In particular, our findings suggest that such processing supports not only sustained maintenance but also purposeful modification and updating of the task-relevant working memory contents.

Long-range synchronization of oscillatory signals has been suggested to mediate these interactions within large-scale cortical networks, but direct evidence is sparse. Here we show that oscillatory synchronization is organized in such large-scale networks. We implemented an analysis approach that allows for imaging synchronized cortical networks and applied this technique to EEG recordings in humans. We identified two networks: beta-band synchronization (similar to 20 Hz) in a fronto-parieto-occipital network and gamma-band synchronization (similar to 80 Hz) in a centro-temporal network. Strong perceptual correlates support their functional relevance: the strength of synchronization within these networks predicted the subjects' percept of an ambiguous audiovisual stimulus as well as the integration of auditory and visual information. Our results provide evidence that oscillatory neuronal synchronization mediates neuronal communication within frequency-specific, large-scale cortical networks.

There is reliable evidence that the amplitude of mu rhythms is reduced when the participant performs a motor act (mu suppression). Recent studies found mu suppression not only in response to actual movements but also while the participant observes actions executed by someone else. This finding putatively associates the mu suppression to the activity of a mirror neurons system which, in humans, has been suggested to contribute to social skills. In the present study we explored the effects of different levels of social interaction on mu suppression. Participants observed dynamic displays of hand gestures performing actions used in the Rock-Scissors-Paper game. In different blocks, participants passively viewed identical video clips with no game context and in the context of a game, or while being actually engaged in the game either by imagining actions or by actual playing. As a baseline for calculating mu suppression we used a dynamic display of a rolling ball. In addition, to isolate the social aspect of the actual movements, participants performed the same acts outside the game context. Mu suppression was larger while participants were engaged in the social game than when they passively looked at the "opponent" actions or when they performed movements without the game context. This effect was found while viewing the opponent play as well as while actually playing, which supports the view that mu suppression is affected not only by motion, but also by the social context of the motion. However, we did not find differences in mu suppression between perception segments in which the participant did not actually play. Furthermore, in all perception segments occipital alpha suppression was more robust than mu suppression suggesting the involvement of a strong attentional component. While actually playing, however, mu suppression was stronger than alpha suppression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Felice			Modulation of Gamma and Theta Spectral Amplitude and Phase Synchronization Is Associated with the Development of Visuo-Motor Learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; BAND RESPONSES; BRAIN RESPONSES; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; OBJECT; PERFORMANCE; CORTEX; HUMANS	The formation of new motor memories, which is fundamental for efficient performance during adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation, occurs when accurate planning is achieved mostly with feedforward mechanisms. The dynamics of brain activity underlying the switch from feedback to feedforward control is still matter of debate. Based on the results of studies in declarative learning, it is likely that phase synchronization of low and high frequencies as well as their temporal modulation in power amplitude underlie the formation of new motor memories during visuo-motor adaptation. High-density EEG (256 electrodes) was recorded in 17 normal human subjects during adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation of 60 in four incremental steps of 15 degrees. We found that initial learning is associated with enhancement of gamma power in a right parietal region during movement execution as well as gamma/theta phase coherence during movement planning. Late stages of learning are instead accompanied by an increase of theta power over that same right parietal region during movement planning, which is correlated with the degree of learning and retention. Altogether, these results suggest that the formation of new motor memories and, thus, the switch from feedback to feedforward control is associated with the modulation of gamma and theta spectral activities, with respect to their amplitude and phase, during movement planning and execution. Specifically, we propose that gamma/theta phase coupling plays a pivotal role in the integration of a new representation into motor memories.

Prior Expectation Mediates Neural Adaptation to Repeated Sounds in the Auditory Cortex: An MEG Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG-DATA; REPETITION; EVENT; RESPONSES; BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	Repetition suppression, the phenomenon that the second presentation of a stimulus attenuates neural activity, is typically viewed as an automatic consequence of repeated stimulus presentation. However, a recent neuroimaging study has suggested that repetition suppression may be driven by top-down expectations. Here we examined whether and when repetition suppression can be modulated by top-down expectation. Participants listened to auditory stimuli in blocks where tone repetitions were either expected or unexpected, while we recorded ongoing neural activity using magnetoencephalography. We found robust repetition suppression in the auditory cortex for repeated tones. Interestingly, this reduction was significantly larger for expected than unexpected repetitions, both in terms of evoked activity and gamma-band synchrony. These findings indicate a role of top-down expectation in generating repetition suppression and are in line with predictive coding models of perception, in which the difference between expected and actual input is propagated from lower to higher cortical areas.

Neural synchrony and white matter variations in the human brain - Relation between evoked gamma frequency and corpus callosum morphology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Evoked gamma-band activity; VBM	OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; BEHAVIORAL NEUROLOGY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PHASE; TASK; ATTENTION; MUSICIANS	Synchronous gamma oscillations frame a general principle of functional connectivity and communication in the cortex. Efficient communication and coordination across neural networks rely upon the temporal precision of neural signals, which depends on the structural properties of the fibre bundles serving neural signal transmission. Therefore a direct relation between the geometry of cortical connections and the formation of stimulus-driven synchronous neural activity can be assumed. The aim of the present study was to identify the neuroanatomical correspondents of individual gamma frequency variations. For that purpose we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to correlate the frequency of visually evoked gamma band responses (eGBR) with local inter-individual variations in white matter (WM) density across a group of 17 individuals. Analyses demonstrate an association of eGBR frequency and white matter density in the individual human brain. Individuals with a higher eGBR frequency demonstrate increased white matter in fibres of the corpus callosum, whereas participants with low-density callosal WM show lower eGBR frequencies. The observed positive correlation between callosal white matter measure and frequency of visually evoked GBR may indicate that additional or better-myelinated callosal pathways facilitate a more efficient inter-hemispheric information transfer, which is likely to benefit the integration and processing of information and consequently to facilitate more efficient synchronization of neural activity between the two hemispheres.

Gamma-Band Activity as a Signature for Cross-Modal Priming of Auditory Object Recognition by Active Haptic Exploration	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EXPLICIT MEMORY; VISUAL PATHWAY; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; SOUNDS	When visual sensory information is restricted, we often rely on haptic and auditory information to recognize objects. Here we examined how haptic exploration of familiar objects affects neural processing of subsequently presented sounds of objects. Recent studies indicated that oscillatory responses, in particular in the gamma band (30-100 Hz), reflect cross-modal processing, but it is not clear which cortical networks are involved. In this high-density EEG study, we measured gamma-band activity (GBA) in humans performing a haptic-to-auditory priming paradigm. Haptic stimuli served as primes, and sounds of objects as targets. Haptic and auditory stimuli were either semantically congruent or incongruent, and participants were asked to categorize the objects represented by the sounds. Response times were shorter for semantically congruent compared with semantically incongruent inputs. This haptic-to-auditory priming effect was associated with enhanced total power GBA (250-350 ms) for semantically congruent inputs and additional effects of semantic congruency on evoked GBA (50-100 ms). Source reconstruction of total GBA using linear beamforming revealed effects of semantic congruency in the left lateral temporal lobe, possibly reflecting matching of information across modalities. For semantically incongruent inputs, total GBA was enhanced in middle frontal cortices, possibly indicating the processing or detection of conflicting information. Our findings demonstrate that semantic priming by haptic object exploration affects processing of auditory inputs in the lateral temporal lobe and suggest an important role of oscillatory activity for multisensory processing.

Studies in schizophrenia using functional neuroimaging, eventrelated potentials and EEG coherence indicate an impairment of cortical network coupling in this disorder. Previous electrophysiological investigations in animals and humans suggested that gamma activity (oscillations at around 30-100 Hz) is essential for cortical network binding. This is the first investigation of spontaneous gamma activity in schizophrenics and their first degree relatives as compared to normal controls. Method: Resting EEG was recorded in 20 drug nai "ve/drug free male schizophrenic patients, their pair matched male first degree relatives and 20 age-, sex-, education-and handedness-matched normal controls. Power spectrum and coherence of gamma band activity was analysed using MATLAB 6.5. Results: Schizophrenic patients had significantly less interhemispheric spontaneous gamma coherence and increased gamma power compared to normal controls. But there was no significant difference in gamma coherence between patients and their first degree relatives. Spontaneous gamma coherence had significant correlation with few PANSS subscale scores. Conclusions: There is cortical hyperactivation and a reduced spontaneous and induced gamma coherence abnormality in schizophrenia. The abnormal gamma coherence appears explaining the psychopathology and poor performance on cognitive task in schizophrenia. This study has also generated hypotheses that the gamma band abnormality may be a trait abnormality in schizophrenics as seen by the similarity between the patient and their clinically asymptomatic first degree relatives.

However, the results in a number of imaging and electrophysiological studies on the origins of AVH are not consistent, and the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. The authors enrolled a group of schizophrenia patients and normal-control subjects, age 18-45 years. Two patient groups participated in the study; 1) a group of 8 patients with drug-resistant spontaneous AVHs; and 2) a group of 7 patients whose AVHS were successfully controlled with neuroleptic medication; along with 16 normal-control subjects. The entire sample had EEG recording done, with the AVH group told to press a button when they experienced a hallucination, and the other two groups randomly told when to press the button. In the AVH group, hallucinations were longer in the "eyes-closed" than "eyes-open" condition. There was spreading phase-coupling in the AVH group, intra- and inter-hemispherically, at left and right frontal and temporal areas, under both eyes-closed and eyes-open condition, during the experience of AVH. There was a statistically significant increase of a-band frequency-specific synchrony maximum values in the AVH group. AVHs are considered to be complex features, and, as such, they reflect abnormal functional connectivity in multiple related regions in both intra- and inter-hemispherical brain sites, primarily defined by phase-integration.

The effect of hypercapnia on resting and stimulus induced MEG signals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Hypercapnia; Neural oscillations; Beamformer; fMRI; Calibrated BOLD	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BOLD-FMRI; HYPOCAPNIA; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	The effect of hypercapnia (an increase in CO2 concentration in the blood) on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) haemodynamic response has been well characterised and is commonly used for BOLD calibration. However, relatively little is known of the effect of hypercapnia on the electrical brain processes that underlie the BOLD response. Here, we investigate the effect of hypercapnia on resting and stimulus induced changes in neural oscillations using a feed-forward low gas flow system to deliver a reliable and repeatable level of hypercapnia. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is used in conjunction with beamformer source localisation algorithms to non-invasively image changes in oscillatory amplitude. At rest, we find robust oscillatory power loss in the alpha (8 Hz-13 Hz), beta (13 Hz-30 Hz) and low gamma (30 Hz-50 Hz) frequency bands in response to hypercapnia. Further, we show that the spatial signature of this power loss differs across frequency bands, with the largest effect being observed for the beta band in sensorimotor cortices. We also measure changes in oscillatory activity induced by visual and motor events, and the effect of hypercapnia on these changes; whilst the percentage change in oscillatory activity on activation was largely unaffected by hypercapnia, the absolute change in oscillatory amplitude differed between normocapnia and hypercapnia. This work supports invasive recordings made in animals, and the results have potential implications for calibrated BOLD studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Pre-Stimulus Activity Predicts the Winner of Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Attentional Selection	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS PREDICT; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; OCULOMOTOR CAPTURE; PARIETAL CORTICES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; COVERT SHIFTS	Our ability to process visual information is fundamentally limited. This leads to competition between sensory information that is relevant for top-down goals and sensory information that is perceptually salient, but task-irrelevant. The aim of the present study was to identify, from EEG recordings, pre-stimulus and pre-saccadic neural activity that could predict whether top-down or bottom-up processes would win the competition for attention on a trial-by-trial basis. We employed a visual search paradigm in which a lateralized low contrast target appeared alone, or with a low (i.e., non-salient) or high contrast (i.e., salient) distractor. Trials with a salient distractor were of primary interest due to the strong competition between top-down knowledge and bottom-up attentional capture. Our results demonstrated that 1) in the 1-sec pre-stimulus interval, frontal alpha (8-12 Hz) activity was higher on trials where the salient distractor captured attention and the first saccade (bottom-up win); and 2) there was a transient pre-saccadic increase in posterior-parietal alpha (7-8 Hz) activity on trials where the first saccade went to the target (top-down win). We propose that the high frontal alpha reflects a disengagement of attentional control whereas the transient posterior alpha time-locked to the saccade indicates sensory inhibition of the salient distractor and suppression of bottom-up oculomotor capture.

The Role of Sleep in Directed Forgetting and Remembering of Human Memories	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						consolidation; forgetting; memory; sleep; spindles	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; LEARNING-DEPENDENT CHANGES; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; UNWANTED MEMORIES; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRODE DENSITY; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; EMOTIONAL MEMORY	Ample evidence supports a role for sleep in the offline consolidation of memory. However, circumstances exist where forgetting can be as critical as remembering, both in daily life and clinically. Using a directed forgetting paradigm, here, we investigate the impact of explicit cue instruction during learning, prior to sleep, on subsequent remembering and forgetting of memory, after sleep. We demonstrate that sleep, relative to time awake, can selectively ignore the facilitation of items previously cued to be forgotten, yet preferentially enhance recall for items cued to be remembered; indicative of specificity based on prior waking instruction. Moreover, the success of this differential remember/forget effect is strongly correlated with fast sleep spindles over the left superior parietal cortex. Furthermore, electroencephalography source analysis of these spindles revealed a repeating loop of current density between selective memory-related regions of the superior parietal, medial temporal, and right prefrontal cortices. These findings move beyond the classical notion of sleep universally strengthening information. Instead, they suggest a model in which sleep may be more ecologically attuned to instructions present during learning while awake, supporting both remembering and targeted forgetting of human memories.

The current study aims at addressing this issue by investigating absolute theta power over the frontal cortex during the execution of random and fixed SEMs. Twelve healthy volunteers, performed two tasks involving different conditions in the planning, execution and cognitive control of SEMs while their brain activity pattern was recorded using quantitative electroencephalography. We found an interaction between SEM condition and electrode (F3, F4, Fz), and a main effect of time point and electrode. Our key finding revealed that the stimulus presentation induces different patterns over frontal theta power increase between the left and right hemisphere. We conclude that right and left frontal regions are an important factor to discriminate between memory- versus stimulus-driven SEMs, and speculate on their different contributions to visuospatial attention.

Recently, it was reported that the expression of the RARb (an RAR subtype) gene determines the contribution of the delta oscillation in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns in mice. We also reported that 4-week dietary deficiency of vitamin A (VAD) causes the attenuation of delta power in sleep and spontaneous activity in mice. However, our previous study could not clarify whether the attenuation of delta power by VAD is attributed to the suppression of RARs. To address this problem, we investigated whether the chronic administration of LE540 (30 mg/kg/day), an antagonist of RARs, for 1 or 4 weeks attenuated EEG delta power during sleep in mice. Consequently, 4-week LE540 administration induced a significant attenuation of wakefulness and delta power in non-rapid eye movement sleep. Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR) in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain of mice that were administered LE540 for 4 weeks. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of striatal tissue revealed a significant decrease in the homovanillic acid/dopamine ratio. Meanwhile, dopamine levels did not change in these mice. Our results suggest that the 4-week antagonism of RARs induces the attenuation of delta power. However, the attenuation of delta power may be elicited indirectly by the decrease of wakefulness followed by the hypo-expression of dopamine receptors especially D1DR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), SWDs are initiated by the paroxysmal discharges of ictogenic pyramidal neurones located in the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that control the ictal discharges of seizure-initiating neurones remain unclear. Here, by the means of in vivo paired electroencephalographic (EEG) and intracellular recordings in the GAERS cortical focus, we explored the participation of the intracortical inhibitory system in the control of paroxysmal activities in ictogenic neurones. We found that their firing during EEG paroxysms was interrupted by the occurrence of hyperpolarizing synaptic events that reversed in polarity below action potential threshold. Intracellular injection of Cl- dramatically increased the amplitude of the paroxysmal depolarizations and the number of generated action potentials, strongly suggesting that the inhibitory synaptic potentials were mediated by GABA(A) receptors. Consistently, we showed that intracellularly recorded GABAergic interneurones fired, during seizures, shortly after (similar to+8 ms) the discharge of ictogenic neurones and displayed a rhythmic bursting that coincided with the inhibitory synaptic events in neighbouring pyramidal ictogenic cells. In contrast with other forms of epilepsy, our findings suggest that paroxysmal activities in the cortical pyramidal cells initiating absence seizures are negatively controlled by a feedback Cl--mediated inhibition likely resulting from the fast recurrent activation of intracortical GABAergic interneurones by the ictogenic cells themselves.

Previous research has shown that in adults the involvement of one's own motor system is enhanced during observation of an action partner as compared to during observation of an individual actor. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar motor system involvement is present at early stages of joint action development and whether it is related to joint action performance. In an EEG experiment with 3-year-old children, we assessed the children's brain activity and performance during a joint game with an adult experimenter. We used a simple button-pressing game in which the two players acted in turns. Power in the mu- and beta-frequency bands was compared when children were not actively moving but observing the experimenter's actions when (1) they were engaged in the joint action game and (2) when they were not engaged. Enhanced motor involvement during action observation as indicated by attenuated sensorimotor mu- and beta-power was found when the 3-year-olds were engaged in the joint action. This enhanced motor activation during action observation was associated with better joint action performance. The findings suggest that already in early childhood the motor system is differentially activated during action observation depending on the involvement in a joint action. This motor system involvement might play an important role for children's joint action performance.

Measuring functional connectivity using MEG: Methodology and comparison with fcMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; fMRI; 7T; Functional connectivity; Neural oscillations; BOLD; Resting state; Coherence; Imaginary coherence; Envelope correlation	ADAPTIVE-BEAMFORMER; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; LOCALIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORKS; FMRI; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION	Functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions is thought to be central to the way in which the brain processes information. Abnormal connectivity is thought to be implicated in a number of diseases. The ability to study FC is therefore a key goal for neuroimaging. Functional connectivity (fc) MRI has become a popular tool to make connectivity measurements but the technique is limited by its indirect nature. A multimodal approach is therefore an attractive means to investigate the electrodynamic mechanisms underlying hemodynamic connectivity. In this paper, we investigate resting state FC using fcMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In fcMRI, we exploit the advantages afforded by ultra high magnetic field. In MEG we apply envelope correlation and coherence techniques to source space projected MEG signals. We show that beamforming provides an excellent means to measure FC in source space using MEG data. However, care must be taken when interpreting these measurements since cross talk between voxels in source space can potentially lead to spurious connectivity and this must be taken into account in all studies of this type. We show good spatial agreement between FC measured independently using MEG and fcMRI; FC between sensorimotor cortices was observed using both modalities, with the best spatial agreement when MEG data are filtered into the 5 band. This finding helps to reduce the potential confounds associated with each modality alone: while it helps reduce the uncertainties in spatial patterns generated by MEG (brought about by the ill posed inverse problem), addition of electrodynamic metric confirms the neural basis of fcMRI measurements. Finally, we show that multiple MEG based FC metrics allow the potential to move beyond what is possible using fcMRI, and investigate the nature of electrodynamic connectivity. Our results extend those from previous studies and add weight to the argument that neural oscillations are intimately related to functional connectivity and the BOLD response. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis predicts that the strength of synapses is decreased during sleep. The slope of slow waves during NREM sleep best reflects this "downscaling''. Methods: In a retrospective case control study, we analysed the time course of the slope of EEG slow waves of nine patients with ESES. The patients showed continuous spike waves (> 85%) associated with regression or stagnation of cognitive functions. The data of the patient group were compared to nine healthy age and gender matched controls. Results: In control subjects we found the expected decrease of the slope of slow waves from the first to the last hour of sleep (17.2% decrease, p < 0.001). In contrast, patients showed no significant change in slope across the night. Conclusions: This finding may reflect a disruption of the downscaling process during sleep, which may contribute to the developmental regression in these children. Significance: Thus, our findings contribute to the understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to the regression observed in children with ESES and support the view that the goal of the treatment in children with ESES should not only be to reduce seizures, but also to resolve the continuous spike wave activity.

Defeated males avoid their victorious adversaries for several hours before regaining aggressiveness. However, the defeated male does not regain aggressiveness if repeated fighting occurs. Loss of individual aggressiveness is limited by group size, which constrains the number of crickets fighting at any given time. Thus, group aggressive behaviour is modulated by an environmental factor, group size, which is ultimately determined by individual actions, i.e. fighting between two individuals. We developed a robot model to elucidate the mechanism of group-size-dependent behaviour alternation in crickets. The behaviour of individual robots was evaluated experimentally with mobile robots and the group behaviour of the robots was evaluated by computer simulation. We demonstrated that the group-size-dependent strategy in crickets could be generated by local interactions between robots, where the behaviour was governed by an oscillator and memory of the outcome of previous fights.

TNF alpha or IL1 beta injection enhances non-rapid eye movement sleep. Inhibition of TNF alpha or IL1 beta reduces spontaneous sleep. Mice lacking TNF alpha or IL1 beta receptors sleep less. In normal humans and in multiple disease states, plasma levels of TNF alpha covary with EEG slow wave activity (SWA) and sleep propensity. Many of the symptoms induced by sleep loss, for example, sleepiness, fatigue, poor cognition, enhanced sensitivity to pain, are elicited by injection of exogenous TNF alpha or IL1 beta. IL1 beta or TNF alpha applied unilaterally to the surface of the cortex induces state-dependent enhancement of EEG SWA ipsilaterally, suggesting greater regional sleep intensity. Interventions such as unilateral somatosensory stimulation enhance localized sleep EEG SWA, blood flow, and somatosensory cortical expression of IL1 beta and TNF alpha. State oscillations occur within cortical columns. One such state shares properties with whole animal sleep in that it is dependent on prior cellular activity, shows homeostasis, and is induced by TNF alpha. Extracellular ATP released during neuro- and gliotransmission enhances cytokine release via purine type 2 receptors. An ATP agonist enhances sleep, while ATP antagonists inhibit sleep. Mice lacking the P2X7 receptor have attenuated sleep rebound responses after sleep loss. TNF alpha and IL1 beta alter neuron sensitivity by changing neuromodulator/neurotransmitter receptor expression, allowing the neuron to scale its activity to the presynaptic neurons. TNF alpha's role in synaptic scaling is well characterized. Because the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron is changed, the same input will result in a different network output signal and this is a state change. The top-down paradigm of sleep regulation requires intentional action from sleep/wake regulatory brain circuits to initiate whole-organism sleep. This raises unresolved questions as to how such purposeful action might itself be initiated. In the new paradigm, sleep is initiated within networks and local sleep is a direct consequence of prior local cell activity. Whole-organism sleep is a bottom-up, self-organizing, and emergent property of the collective states of networks throughout the brain.

While most classical views adhere to a thalamic oscillatory machinery and an active role of the cortex in modifying normal oscillations into pathological SWDs, recent studies in genetic models such as WAG/Rij and GAERS rats have challenged this proposal. It seems now well established that SWDs originate from the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex, that the activity quickly spreads over the cortex and invades the thalamus. The reticular thalamic nucleus and other thalamic nuclei provide a resonance circuitry for the amplification, spreading and entrainment of the SWDs. Conclusive evidence has been found that the changed functionality of HCN1 channels is a causative factor for the changes in local excitability and age-dependent increase in SWD. Furthermore, upregulation of two subtypes of Na+ channels, reduction of GABA(B) and mGlu 2/3 receptors might also play a role in the local increased excitability in WAG/Rij rats. Signal analytical studies have also challenged the view that SWDs occur suddenly from a normal background EEG. SWDs are recruited cortical responses and they develop from increasing associations within and between cortical layers and subsequently subcortical regions, triggered by the simultaneous occurrence of theta and delta precursor activity in the cortex and thalamus in case both structures are in a favorable condition, and increased directional coupling between cortex and thalamus. It is hypothesized that the cortex is the driving force throughout the whole SWD and is also responsible for its end.

This corticospinal coherence is thought to favor stationary motor states, but its mode of operation remains elusive. We hypothesized that corticospinal beta-range coherence depends on the sensorimotor processing state before a steady force task and may thus increase after sensorimotor tuning to dynamic force generation. To test this hypothesis we instructed 16 human subjects to compensate static force after rest as well as after compensating predictable or unpredictable dynamic force with their right index finger. We calculated EEG-EMG coherence, cortical motor spectral power, and the motor performance during the force conditions. Corticospinal beta-coherence during stationary force was excessively elevated if the steady-state contraction was preceded by predictable dynamic force instead of rest, and was highest after unpredictable dynamic force. The beta-power decreased from rest to predictable dynamic force, and was lowest during unpredictable dynamic force. The increase in corticospinal beta-coherence showed a significant negative correlation with the preceding change in beta-power. The tuning to dynamic force did not entail an inferior motor performance during static force. The results imply a correlation between corticospinal beta-range coherence and the computational load of the preceding isometric motor engagement. We suggest beta-range coherence provides a functional corticospinal gateway for steady force-related processing that can override cortical states tuned to dynamic force. The modulation of corticospinal beta-range coherence might thus ensure comparable precision of static force in various motor contexts.

Induced and evoked neural correlates of orientation selectivity in human visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Orientation; Magnetoencephalography; Primary visual cortex; Gamma oscillations; Event-related fields; Oblique effect	CORTICAL AREA 21A; STRIATE CORTEX; STIMULUS ORIENTATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PATTERN-REVERSAL; UNEQUAL REPRESENTATION; GABA CONCENTRATION; OBLIQUE CONTOURS; NATURAL SCENES; CAT	Orientation discrimination is much better for patterns oriented along the horizontal or vertical (cardinal) axes than for patterns oriented obliquely, but the neural basis for this is not known. Previous animal neurophysiology and human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated only a moderate bias for cardinal versus oblique orientations, with fMRI showing a larger response to cardinals in primary visual cortex (VI) and EEG demonstrating both increased magnitudes and reduced latencies of transient evoked responses. Here, using MEG, we localised and characterised induced gamma and transient evoked responses to stationary circular grating patches of three orientations (0, 45, and 90 from vertical). Surprisingly, we found that the sustained gamma response was larger for oblique, compared to cardinal, stimuli. This "inverse oblique effect" was also observed in the earliest (80 ms) evoked response, whereas later responses (120 ms) showed a trend towards the reverse, "classic", oblique response. Source localisation demonstrated that the sustained gamma and early evoked responses were localised to medial visual cortex, whilst the later evoked responses came from both this early visual area and a source in a more inferolateral extrastriate region. These results suggest that (1) the early evoked and sustained gamma responses manifest the initial tuning of V1 neurons, with the stronger response to oblique stimuli possibly reflecting increased tuning widths for these orientations, and (2) the classic behavioural oblique effect is mediated by an extrastriate cortical area and may also implicate feedback from extrastriate to primary visual cortex.

Resting frontal gamma power at 16, 24 and 36 months predicts individual differences in language and cognition at 4 and 5 years	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Resting EEG; Gamma power; Working memory; Language; Cognitive development		Gamma activity has been linked to a variety of different cognitive processes and exists in both transient and persistent forms. Across studies, different brain regions have been suggested to contribute to gamma activity. Multiple studies have shown that the function of gamma oscillations may be related to temporal binding of early sensory information to relevant top-down processes. Given this hypothesis, we expected gamma oscillations to subserve general brain mechanisms that contribute to the development of cognitive and linguistic systems. The present study aims to examine the predictive relations between resting-state cortical gamma power density at a critical point in language and cognitive acquisition (i.e. 16,24 and 36 months), and cognitive and language output at ages 4 and 5 years. Our findings show that both 24- and 36-month gamma power are significantly correlated with later language scores, notably Non-Word Repetition. Further, 16-, 24- and 36-month gamma were all significantly correlated with 4-year PLS-3 and CELF-P sentence structure scores. Although associations reported here do not reflect a direct cause and effect of early resting gamma power on later language outcomes, capacity to generate higher power in the gamma range at crucial developmental periods may index better modulation of attention and allow easier access to working memory, thus providing an advantage for overall development, particularly in the linguistic domain. Moreover, measuring abilities at times when these abilities are still emergent may allow better prediction of later outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particularly, Lempel-Ziv's Complexity (LZC) has proven to be useful in exploring the complexity of the brain electromagnetic activity. However, an important problem is the lack of knowledge about the physiological determinants of these measures. Although a correlation between complexity and connectivity has been proposed, this hypothesis was never tested in vivo. Thus, the correlation between the microstructure of the anatomic connectivity and the functional complexity of the brain needs to be inspected. In this study we analyzed the correlation between LZC and fractional anisotropy (FA), a scalar quantity derived from diffusion tensors that is particularly useful as an estimate of the functional integrity of myelinated axonal fibers, in a group of sixteen healthy adults (all female, mean age 65.56 +/- 6.06 years, intervals 58-82). Our results showed a positive correlation between FA and LZC scores in regions including clusters in the splenium of the corpus callosum, cingulum, parahipocampal regions and the sagittal stratum. This study supports the notion of a positive correlation between the functional complexity of the brain and the microstructure of its anatomical connectivity. Our investigation proved that a combination of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological techniques may shed some light on the underlying physiological determinants of brain's oscillations.

Clinical Symptoms and Alpha Band Resting-State Functional Connectivity Imaging in Patients With Schizophrenia: Implications for Novel Approaches to Treatment	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Functional connectivity; magnetoencephalography; neuroimaging; resting-state; schizophrenia; symptoms	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOOD-REGULATING CIRCUIT; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NONLINEAR INTERDEPENDENCE; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS	Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with functional decoupling between cortical regions, but we do not know whether and where this occurs in low-frequency electromagnetic oscillations. The goal of this study was to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to identify brain regions that exhibit abnormal resting-state connectivity in the alpha frequency range in patients with schizophrenia and investigate associations between functional connectivity and clinical symptoms in stable outpatient participants. Methods: Thirty patients with SZ and 15 healthy comparison participants were scanned in resting-state MEG (eyes closed). Functional connectivity MEG source data were reconstructed globally in the alpha range, quantified by the mean imaginary coherence between a voxel and the rest of the brain. Results: In patients, decreased connectivity was observed in left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right superior temporal cortex, whereas increased connectivity was observed in left extrastriate cortex and the right inferior PFC. Functional connectivity of left inferior parietal cortex was negatively related to positive symptoms. Low left PFC connectivity was associated with negative symptoms. Functional connectivity of midline PFC was negatively correlated with depressed symptoms. Functional connectivity of right PFC was associated with other (cognitive) symptoms. Conclusions: This study demonstrates direct functional disconnection in SZ between specific cortical fields within low-frequency resting-state oscillations. Impaired alpha coupling in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions is associated with clinical symptoms in these stable outpatients. Our findings indicate that this level of functional disconnection between cortical regions is an important treatment target in SZ.	[Hinkley, Leighton B.

The Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Gamma Oscillatory Activity in Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; POTENTIALLY DELETERIOUS IMPACT; HEALTHY-HUMAN SUBJECTS; WORKING-MEMORY; HOMEOSTATIC PLASTICITY; TMS-EEG; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; INTERNEURON NETWORKS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE	Background: Gamma (c) oscillations (30-50 Hz) have been shown to be excessive in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) during working memory (WM). WM is a cognitive process that involves the online maintenance and manipulation of information that is mediated largely by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a non-invasive method to stimulate the cortex that has been shown to enhance cognition and c oscillatory activity during WM. Methodology and Principal Findings: We examined the effect of 20 Hz rTMS over the DLPFC on gamma oscillatory activity elicited during the N-back task in 24 patients with SCZ compared to 22 healthy subjects. Prior to rTMS, patients with SCZ elicited excessive gamma oscillatory activity compared to healthy subjects across WM load. Active rTMS resulted in the reduction of frontal gamma oscillatory activity in patients with SCZ, while potentiating activity in healthy subjects in the 3-back, the most difficult condition. Further, these effects on gamma oscillatory activity were found to be specific to the frontal brain region and were absent in the parieto-occipital brain region. Conclusions and Significance: We suggest that this opposing effect of rTMS on gamma oscillatory activity in patients with SCZ versus healthy subjects may be related to homeostatic plasticity leading to differential effects of rTMS on gamma oscillatory activity depending on baseline differences. These findings provide important insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying WM deficits in SCZ and demonstrated that rTMS can modulate gamma oscillatory activity that may be a possible avenue for cognitive potentiation in this disorder.

Quasi-periodic Fluctuations in Default Mode Network Electrophysiology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ANATOMY; DISEASE	The study of human brain electrophysiology has extended beyond traditional frequency ranges identified by the classical EEG rhythms, encompassing both higher and lower frequencies. Changes in high-gamma-band (>70 Hz) power have been identified as markers of local cortical activity. Fluctuations at infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) frequencies have been associated with functionally significant cortical networks elucidated using fMRI studies. In this study, we examined infra-slow changes in band-limited power across a range of frequencies (1-120 Hz) in the default mode network (DMN). Measuring the coherence in band-limited power fluctuations between spatially separated electrodes makes it possible to detect small, spatially extended, and temporally coherent fluctuating components in the presence of much larger incoherent fluctuations. We show that the default network is characterized by significant high-gamma-band (65-110 Hz) coherence at infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) frequencies. This coherence occurs over a narrow frequency range, centered at 0.015 Hz, commensurate with the frequency of BOLD signal fluctuations seen by fMRI, suggesting that quasi-periodic, infra-slow changes in local cortical activity form the neurophysiological basis for this network.

The performance of this index was tested in patients with carotid artery stenting and in the EuroBavar data set according to the following criteria: (1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; (2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and (3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in the physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. The new index from independent component analysis better fulfilled the criteria than the commonly used sympathovagal index, the ratio of low-to-high frequency spectra power of heart rate variability, and had higher discrimination power in distinguishing the autonomic status of the patients who had undergone carotid artery stenting from that of the control subjects.

Induced Synchronization/Desynchronization of the Theta and Alpha Cortical Electrical Activity to a Face Stimuli with Increasing Visual Working Memory Load	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						induced synchronization/desynchronizanion; theta - and alpha-band cortical brain potentials; facial expression recognition; working memory; cognitive set; cortico-hippocampal and fronto-thalamic integration systems; tonic and phasic forms of cortex activation	EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; SET; HIPPOCAMPAL; MOTIVATION; CONTEXT	Using a cognitive set to emotional facial expression as a model, induced synchronization/desynchronization of the cortical theta- and alpha-activities were studied in adult healthy people under conditions of increased load on the working memory (additional task of the verbal stimuli recognition). A correlation was found between behavioral (increase in the set rigidity) and electrophysiological (decrease of the induced theta-rhythm synchronization) data. A hypothesis is suggested that the earlier revealed increase in the tonic prestimulus theta-activity and suppression of the poststimulus phasic activation of the cortico-hippocampal system are one of the mechanisms of the decrease in plasticity of the cognitive function of the emotional facial expression recognition under conditions of the increased load on the working memory Reciprocal relations between two functional systems of the brain activity integration (cortico-hippocampal and fronto-thalamic) in the process of recognition of emotional facial expression are discussed.

Six light emitting diode (LED) flickers with high flickering rates (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35 Hz) functioned as visual stimulators to induce the subjects' SSVEPs. EEG signals recorded in the Oz channel were segmented into data epochs (0.75 s). Each epoch was then decomposed into a series of oscillation components, representing fine-to-coarse information of the signal, called intrinsic mode functions (IMEs). The instantaneous frequencies in each IMF were calculated by refined generalized zero-crossing (rGZC). IMEs with mean instantaneous frequencies ((f) over bar (GZC)) within 29.5 Hz and 35.5 Hz (i.e., 29.5 <= (f) over bar (GZC) <= 35.5 Hz) were designated as SSVEP-related IMEs. Due to the time-locked and phase-locked characteristics of SSVEP, the induced SSVEPs had the same frequency as the gazing visual stimulator. The LED flicker that contributed the majority of the frequency content in SSVEP-related IMEs was chosen as the gaze target. This study tests the proposed system in five male subjects (mean age = 25.4 +/- .07 y/o). Each subject attempted to activate four virtual commands by inputting a sequence of cursor commands on an LCD screen. The average information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy were 36.99 bits/min and 84.63%. This study demonstrates that EMD is capable of extracting SSVEP data in SSVEP-based BCI system.

Frontal Oscillatory Dynamics Predict Feedback Learning and Action Adjustment	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; REWARD PREDICTION; NEURONAL COHERENCE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA	Frontal oscillatory dynamics in the theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (20-30 Hz) frequency bands have been implicated in cognitive control processes. Here we investigated the changes in coordinated activity within and between frontal brain areas during feedback-based response learning. In a time estimation task, participants learned to press a button after specific, randomly selected time intervals (300-2000 msec) using the feedback after each button press (correct, too fast, too slow). Consistent with previous findings, theta-band activity over medial frontal scalp sites (presumably reflecting medial frontal cortex activity) was stronger after negative feedback, whereas beta-band activity was stronger after positive feedback. Theta-band power predicted learning only after negative feedback, and beta-band power predicted learning after positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, negative feedback increased theta-band intersite phase synchrony (a millisecond resolution measure of functional connectivity) among right lateral prefrontal, medial frontal, and sensorimotor sites. These results demonstrate the importance of frontal theta-and beta-band oscillations and intersite communication in the realization of reinforcement learning.

Although perception of biological motion is known to be mediated by the mirror neuron system, there have been few empirical studies of this system in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Using magnetoencephalography, we examined whether antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients displayed mirror neuron system dysfunction during observation of biological motion (jaw movement of another individual). Results: Compared with normal controls, the patients with schizophrenia had fewer components of both the waveform and equivalent current dipole, suggesting aberrant brain activity resulting from dysfunction of the right inferior parietal cortex. They also lacked the changes of alpha band and gamma band oscillation seen in normal controls, and had weaker phase-locking factors and gamma-synchronization predominantly in right parietal cortex. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that untreated patients with schizophrenia exhibit aberrant mirror neuron system function based on the right inferior parietal cortex, which is characterized by dysfunction of gamma-synchronization in the right parietal lobe during observation of biological motion.

Effects of mindfulness meditation training on anticipatory alpha modulation in primary somatosensory cortex	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Mindfulness; Meditation; Alpha rhythm modulation; Attention; MEG; Alpha rhythm; Somatosensory cortex; Anticipatory	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; BAND POWER; MU RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INCREASES; DENSITY	During selective attention, similar to 7-14 Hz alpha rhythms are modulated in early sensory cortices, suggesting a mechanistic role for these dynamics in perception. Here, we investigated whether alpha modulation can be enhanced by "mindfulness" meditation (MM), a program training practitioners in sustained attention to body and breath-related sensations. We hypothesized that participants in the MM group would exhibit enhanced alpha power modulation in a localized representation in the primary somatosensory neocortex in response to a cue, as compared to participants in the control group. Healthy subjects were randomized to 8-weeks of MM training or a control group. Using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recording of the SI finger representation, we found meditators demonstrated enhanced alpha power modulation in response to a cue. This finding is the first to show enhanced local alpha modulation following sustained attentional training, and implicates this form of enhanced dynamic neural regulation in the behavioral effects of meditative practice.

However, it is still not clear which medial temporal lobe processes precede effective memory formation. Here, our aim was to investigate whether such prestimulus markers for successful memory encoding can be specified based on intracranial recordings directly from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex. For this purpose, we analyzed subsequent memory effects during a continuous word recognition paradigm in 31 presurgical epilepsy patients. We found that rhinal and hippocampal theta and successive alpha power enhancement before word presentation predicted successful memory encoding. Previous studies suggest that stimulus-triggered hippocampal theta activity is particularly related to memory retrieval and activation of a mnemonic context, whereas the alpha rhythm reflects inhibitory top-down control of task processing and executive functioning. In line with these suggestions, we propose that the observed medial temporal theta and alpha power increases before stimulus presentation reflect activation of contextual information and inhibitory top-down control processes preparing for stimulus-triggered memory processing.

This is a crucial issue as coherent fluctuations of fMRI signals between remote brain areas are now widely used to define functional connectivity in physiology and in pathophysiology. We quantified functional connectivity using non-linear measures of cross-correlation between signals obtained from intracerebral EEG (iEEG) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) in 5 patients suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Functional connectivity was quantified with both modalities in areas exhibiting different electrophysiological states (epileptic and non affected regions) during the interictal period. Functional connectivity as measured from the iEEG signal was higher in regions affected by electrical epileptiform abnormalities relative to non-affected areas, whereas an opposite pattern was found for functional connectivity measured from the BOLD signal. Significant negative correlations were found between the functional connectivities of iEEG and BOLD signal when considering all pairs of signals (theta, alpha, beta and broadband) and when considering pairs of signals in regions spared by epileptiform discharges (in broadband signal). This suggests differential effects of epileptic phenomena on electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals and/or an alteration of the neurovascular coupling secondary to pathological plasticity in TLE even in regions spared by epileptiform discharges. In addition, indices of directionality calculated from both modalities were consistent showing that the epileptogenic regions exert a significant influence onto the non epileptic areas during the interictal period. This study shows that functional connectivity measured by iEEG and BOLD signals give complementary but sometimes inconsistent information in TLE.

Inclusion of biological parameters into multilevel prediction models is thought to improve predictive accuracy of models on the basis of clinical variables. To this aim, mismatch negativity (MMN) was investigated in a sample clinically at high risk, comparing individuals with and without subsequent conversion to psychosis. Methods: At baseline, an auditory oddball paradigm was used in 62 subjects meeting criteria of a late risk at-state who remained antipsychotic-naive throughout the study. Median follow-up period was 32 months (minimum of 24 months in nonconverters, n = 37). Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was employed to analyze the MMN recorded at frontocentral electrodes; additional comparisons with healthy controls (HC, n = 67) and first-episode schizophrenia patients (FES, n = 33) were performed. Predictive value was evaluated by a Cox regression model. Results: Compared with nonconverters, duration MMN in converters (n = 25) showed significantly reduced amplitudes across the six frontocentral electrodes; the same applied in comparison with HC, but not FES, whereas the duration MMN in in nonconverters was comparable to HC and larger than in FES. A prognostic score was calculated based on a Cox regression model and stratified into two risk classes, which showed significantly different survival curves. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the duration MMN is significantly reduced in at-risk subjects converting to first-episode psychosis compared with nonconverters and may contribute not only to the prediction of conversion but also to a more individualized risk estimation and thus risk-adapted prevention.

Hippocampal-dependent learning can be affected by a number of neurotransmitters including the activation of mu-opioid receptors (MOR). It has been shown that MOR activation can alter synaptic plasticity and network oscillations in the hippocampus, both of which are thought to be important for the encoding of information and formation of memories. One hippocampal oscillation that has been correlated with learning and memory formation is the 4-10 Hz theta rhythm. During theta rhythms, inputs to hippocampal CA1 from CA3 (Schaffer collaterals, SC) and the entorhinal cortex (perforant path) can integrate at different times within an individual theta cycle. Consequently, when excitatory inputs in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (the temporo-ammonic pathway (TA), which includes the perforant path) are stimulated approximately one theta period before SC inputs, the TA can indirectly inhibit SC inputs. This inhibition is due to the activation of postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Importantly, MOR activation has been shown to suppress GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Therefore, we examined how MOR activation affects the integration between TA inputs and SC inputs in hippocampal CA1. To do this we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging and whole cell patch clamping from acute hippocampal slices taken from young adult rats. Here we show that MOR activation has no effect on the integration between TA and SC inputs when activation of the TA precedes SC by less than one half of a theta cycle (< 75 ms). However, MOR activation completely blocked the inhibitory action of TA on SC inputs when TA stimulation occurred approximately one theta cycle before SC activation (> 150 ms). This MOR suppression of TA driven inhibition occurred in both the SC input layer of hippocampal CA1 (stratum radiatum) and the output layer of CA1 pyramidal neurons (stratum pyramidale). Thus MOR activation can have profound effects on the temporal integration between two primary excitatory pathways to hippocampal CA1 and subsequently the resultant output from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These data provide important information for understanding how acute or chronic MOR activation may affect the integration of activity within hippocampal CA1 during theta rhythm.

An equivalent system in humans has been proposed to mediate action and emotion understanding, being therefore related to theory of mind. Theory of mind (TOM) is the ability to infer our own or, more frequently, other person's mental states. It is severely impaired in disorders of the autistic spectrum, but it is also affected in other neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Two recent studies have shown that the basal ganglia may be involved in action observation, as the subthalamic nucleus shows changes in activity during movement observation similar to those observed during movement execution. These findings suggest that the basal ganglia may be involved in mirror circuit activity, which might be affected in PD in a similar way to normal movement execution. Given the relationship between the mirror system and theory of mind, we hypothesize that TOM deficits in PD might be at least partially mediated by mirror system dysfunction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These networks of spontaneous activity correlation or resting state networks (RSN) are closely related to the underlying anatomical connectivity, but their topography is also gated by the history of prior task activation. Network coherence does not depend on covert cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems both at rest and during tasks. Computational studies show that one of such dynamics, the anticorrelation between networks, depends on noise-driven transitions between different multistable cluster synchronization states. These multistable states emerge because of transmission delays between regions that are modeled as coupled oscillators systems. Large-scale systems dynamics are useful for keeping different functional subnetworks in a state of heightened competition, which can be stabilized and fired by even small modulations of either sensory or internal signals.

Changes in spontaneous local field potentials and seizure afteerdischarges evoked by the electrical stimulation of the perforant path were recorded simultaneously in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, medial septal region, and amygdala after a preliminary intraventricular injection of WIN 55.212-2. It was found that WIN 55.212-2 blocked the stimulation-elicited seizures in 80% of tests. A repeated injection of the agonist within 30 days caused an increase in the amplitude of local field potentials and the power of the theta rhythm in all the structures under study. The infusion of kainic acid provoked the onset of status epilepticus in control animals, whereas guinea pigs injected with the agonist (daily, during 25-30 days) did not develop the status. Possible mechanisms of the protective influence of WIN 55.212-2 are discussed.	[Shubina, L. V.; Kitchigina, V.

Resting state brain activity measured by fMRI might evaluate the synchronization of the disorder. To investigate the alteration of the haemodynamic synchronization in epilepsy, resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) was performed on 25 patients with primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), along with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measurement of the synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels, was examined. Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with GTCS showed bilaterally and symmetrically altered ReHo in the cortical and subcortical structures. In addition, a correlation analysis of the ReHo measurement versus the epilepsy duration was performed, and highly negative correlations were observed in thalamus, insula and the regions followed the pattern of 'default' state of brain function. The current findings demonstrate that altered regional synchronization of brain activity exists in the patients with GTCS during interictal period, and there is potential in utilizing the ReHo method in RS-fMRI analyses of epilepsy.

Beta band oscillations (15-30 Hz) are hypothesized to originate largely from primary motor cortex, and are reduced during dynamic relative to static motor tasks. It has yet to be established whether motor imagery modulates beta intermuscular coherence. Using visual feedback, 10 unimpaired participants completed eighteen trials of pinching their right thumb and index finger at a constant force. During the 60-second trials, participants simultaneously engaged in one of three types of kinesthetic imagery: the right thumb and index finger executing a constant force pinch (static), the fingers of the right hand sequentially flexing and extending (dynamic), and the right foot pushing down with constant force (foot). Motor imagery of a dynamic motor task resulted in significantly lower intermuscular beta coherence than imagery of a static motor pinch task, without any difference in task performance or root-mean-square EMG. Thus, motor imagery affects intermuscular coherence in the beta band, even while measures of task performance remain constant. This finding provides insight for incorporation of beta band intermuscular coherence in future motor rehabilitation schemes and brain computer interface design.

Detection of activity from the amygdala with magnetoencephalography	IRBM			English	Article						MEG; MRI; Inverse problem; Amygdala; Event-Related Fields; Face perception	EEG/MEG INVERSE PROBLEM; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MEG; EMOTION; HUMANS; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; NEURONS; SIGNALS	Combining excellent temporal resolution with accurate source localization is a challenge for brain imaging studies in humans. In this domain, showing evidence for the contribution of deep brain structures to magneto-encephalographic (MEG) signal may represent an important step. The amygdala, is an example of such structure that is essential for social cognition and emotional processes. To date, MEG studies have been mainly focused on cortical activities. Under the impulsion of Line Garnero, we tackled the challenge of detecting the activation of deep brain structures with non-invasive electromagnetic brain imaging methods and developed a new method to localize amygdala sources. Here, we first review amygdala structural and histological properties that argue in favour of the detection of its activity with MEG. Then we present a simulation study of amygdala contribution to MEG signal. This study was based on an original anatomical segmentation technique, which allowed distributing sources within the amygdala volume of each subject. Finally, we present preliminary data from a face perception experiment where amygdala activity was examined with this new distributed source imaging method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The feeling within the scientific community was that his passing was not only a great loss for Mexican science but also the loss of a beloved friend. He will be missed and forever remembered for his brilliant mind and noble heart. His scientific career was focused, since the beginning, on the study of protein malnutrition effects on brain morphometry, somato-sensory transmission, sleep, circadian rhythms and behavior. His findings showed that malnutrition has long lasting adverse effects on morphometry of systems involved in sleep regulation such as locus coeruleus, nucleus raphe dorsalis and susprachiasmatic nucleus, and on hippocampal circuit implicated in theta activity generation. His results on spectral analysis of electrical field potential at every 4 sec from 24-h baseline recording and 72-h of recovery sleep after total sleep deprivation or selective REM sleep deprivation demonstrated that protein malnutrition induced alterations on homeostatic as well as on circadian sleep regulation; brain oscillations and theta coherent activity between left and right hemisphere and between hippocampus and cerebral cortex are also affected by malnutrition.

These SW comprise a negative phase, during which cortical neurons are mostly silent, and a positive phase, in which most neurons fire intensively. Previous work showed, using EEG spectral analysis as an index of cortical synchrony, that Morning-types (M-types) present faster dynamics of sleep pressure than Evening-types (E-types). We thus hypothesized that single SW properties will also show larger changes in M-types than in E-types in response to increased sleep pressure. SW density (number per minute) and characteristics (amplitude, slope between negative and positive peaks, frequency and duration of negative and positive phases) were compared between chronotypes for a baseline sleep episode (BL) and for recovery sleep (REC) after two nights of sleep fragmentation. While SW density did not differ between chronotypes, M-types showed higher SW amplitude and steeper slope than E-types, especially during REC. SW properties were also averaged for 3 NREM sleep periods selected for their decreasing level of sleep pressure (first cycle of REC [REC1], first cycle of BL [BL1] and fourth cycle of BL [BL4]). Slope was significantly steeper in M-types than in E-types in REC1 and BL1. SW frequency was consistently higher and duration of positive and negative phases constantly shorter in M-types than in E-types. Our data reveal that specific properties of cortical synchrony during sleep differ between M-types and E-types, although chronotypes show a similar capacity to generate SW. These differences may involve 1) stable trait characteristics independent of sleep pressure (i.e., frequency and durations) likely linked to the length of silent and burst-firing phases of individual neurons, and 2) specific responses to increased sleep pressure (i.e., slope and amplitude) expected to depend on the synchrony between neurons.

First published March 17, 2011; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00165.2011.-Many people spend an increasing amount of time in front of computer screens equipped with light-emitting diodes (LED) with a short wavelength (blue range). Thus we investigated the repercussions on melatonin (a marker of the circadian clock), alertness, and cognitive performance levels in 13 young male volunteers under controlled laboratory conditions in a balanced crossover design. A 5-h evening exposure to a white LED-backlit screen with more than twice as much 464 nm light emission {irradiance of 0,241 Watt/(steradian X m(2)) [W/(sr X m(2))], 2.1 X 10(13) photons/(cm(2) X s), in the wavelength range of 454 and 474 nm} than a white non-LED-backlit screen [ irradiance of 0,099 W/(sr X m(2)), 0.7 X 10(13) photons/(cm(2) X s), in the wavelength range of 454 and 474 nm] elicited a significant suppression of the evening rise in endogenous melatonin and subjective as well as objective sleepiness, as indexed by a reduced incidence of slow eye movements and EEG low-frequency activity (1-7 Hz) in frontal brain regions. Concomitantly, sustained attention, as determined by the GO/NOGO task; working memory/attention, as assessed by "explicit timing"; and declarative memory performance in a word-learning paradigm were significantly enhanced in the LED-backlit screen compared with the non-LED condition. Screen quality and visual comfort were rated the same in both screen conditions, whereas the non-LED screen tended to be considered brighter. Our data indicate that the spectral profile of light emitted by computer screens impacts on circadian physiology, alertness, and cognitive performance levels. The challenge will be to design a computer screen with a spectral profile that can be individually programmed to add timed, essential light information to the circadian system in humans.

Estimation of electrode location in a rat motor cortex by laminar analysis of electrophysiology and intracortical electrical stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CELL-BODIES; SUBSTRATE; AXONS; RECOVERY; NEURONS; ORIGIN; REPRESENTATION	While the development of microelectrode arrays has enabled access to disparate regions of a cortex for neurorehabilitation, neuroprosthetic and basic neuroscience research, accurate interpretation of the signals and manipulation of the cortical neurons depend upon the anatomical placement of the electrode arrays in a layered cortex. Toward this end, this report compares two in vivo methods for identifying the placement of electrodes in a linear array spaced 100 mu m apart based on in situ laminar analysis of (1) ketamine-xylazine-induced field potential oscillations in a rat motor cortex and (2) an intracortical electrical stimulation-induced movement threshold. The first method is based on finding the polarity reversal in laminar oscillations which is reported to appear at the transition between layers IV and V in laminar 'high voltage spindles' of the rat cortical column. Analysis of histological images in our dataset indicates that polarity reversal is detected 150.1 +/- 104.2 mu m below the start of layer V. The second method compares the intracortical microstimulation currents that elicit a physical movement for anodic versus cathodic stimulation. It is based on the hypothesis that neural elements perpendicular to the electrode surface are preferentially excited by anodic stimulation while cathodic stimulation excites those with a direction component parallel to its surface. With this method, we expect to see a change in the stimulation currents that elicits a movement at the beginning of layer V when comparing anodic versus cathodic stimulation as the upper cortical layers contain neuronal structures that are primarily parallel to the cortical surface and lower layers contain structures that are primarily perpendicular. Using this method, there was a 78.7 +/- 68 mu m offset in the estimate of the depth of the start of layer V. The polarity reversal method estimates the beginning of layer V within +/- 90 mu m with 95% confidence and the intracortical stimulation method estimates it within +/- 69.3 mu m. We propose that these methods can be used to estimate the in situ location of laminar electrodes implanted in the rat motor cortex.	[Yazdan-Shahmorad, A.; Gage, G. J.; Marzullo, T.

Sustained versus transient brain responses in schizophrenia: the role of intrinsic neural activity	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual; VEP; Steady-state; Wavelets; Baseline correction; Intrinsic neural activity	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; STATE; DISCRIMINATION; FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULATION	Schizophrenia patients (SZ) show early visual processing deficits in many, but not all, tasks. These deficits may be associated with dysregulation of intrinsic oscillatory activity that compromises signal-to-noise in the SZ brain. This question was studied using visual steady-state stimulation and post-steady-state presentation of transient visual stimuli. SZ had higher intrinsic oscillatory activity at the steady-state stimulation frequency (12.5 Hz) and at the 6.25 Hz subharmonic, showed a significant decrease in visual steady-state magnitude over 2 s of stimulation, and were unable to promptly terminate the steady-state response following stimulation offset. If adjustment for levels of intrinsic brain activity were made, however, it would have appeared that SZ had activity of similar magnitude as healthy subjects following steady-state stimulus termination, indicating that such adjustments could substantially alter theoretical interpretations. Visual evoked potential abnormalities (N1/P2 amplitudes) present among SZ at the initiation of steady-state stimulation were less apparent in the 750 ms immediately following steady-state stimulation offset. Higher intrinsic oscillatory brain activity may be a fundamental characteristic of SZ that merits further evaluation for understanding this disorder's neuropathological correlates and associated symptomatology.

Moreover, a novel methodology to adaptively extract brain rhythms from the MEG is introduced. This methodology relies on the ability of empirical mode decomposition to isolate local signal oscillations and constrained blind source separation to extract the activity that jointly represents a subset of channels. Inter-regional MEG connectivity was analysed for 36 AD, 18 MCI and 26 control subjects in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands over left and right central, anterior, lateral and posterior regions with magnitude squared coherence-c(f). For the sake of comparison, c(f) was calculated from the original MEG channels and from the adaptively extracted rhythms. The results indicated that AD and MCI cause slight alterations in the MEG connectivity. Computed from the extracted rhythms, c(f) distinguished AD and MCI subjects from controls with 69.4% and 77.3% accuracies, respectively, in a full leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation. These values were higher than those obtained without the proposed extraction methodology.

J	Ocklenburg, S; Gunturkun, O; Beste, C				Ocklenburg, Sebastian; Guentuerkuen, Onur; Beste, Christian			Lateralized neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of response inhibition processes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional cerebral asymmetries; Executive functions; EEG; sLORETA	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; UPPER ALPHA; CONFLICT; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; RESOLUTION; SYSTEMS; COMPATIBILITY	Functional cerebral asymmetries (FCAs) are an important modulator of cognitive functions. Here, we investigated the temporal and spectral dynamics as well as the cortical networks underlying the lateralized modulation of executive functions related to response inhibition. To this end, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during tachistoscopic presentation of verbal 'Go' and 'Nogo' stimuli in the left (LVF) and the right visual field (RVF). Participants committed fewer false alarms to verbal Nogo stimuli presented in the RVF than to stimuli presented in the LVF. This asymmetry was paralleled by neurophysiological data. The Nogo-N2 and related delta frequency band power were stronger when response inhibition was driven by stimuli presented in the LVF, implying a stronger response conflict. This effect was mediated by stronger activations in bilateral medial-prefrontal and especially left parietal networks. This shows that asymmetries in behavioural performance do not necessarily reflect differences in the overall capability of one hemisphere to solve a task. Even though information is initially confined to one hemisphere after tachistoscopic presentation, this does not primarily cause behavioural asymmetries. Instead, hemispheric dominances in information processing can induce differences in demands on cognitive processes operating via bilateral networks that ultimately drive behavioural asymmetries.

Single-trial reconstruction of auditory evoked magnetic fields by means of Template Matching Pursuit	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Evoked responses; Magnetoencephalography; Matching Pursuit; Single-trial analysis; Template matching	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; BRAIN; VARIABILITY; EEG; LATENCY; DECOMPOSITION; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION	We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (IMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (similar to 4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modulation of Neck Intermuscular Beta Coherence During Voice and Speech Production	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						voice; speech disorders; electromyography	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG-EMG; TENSION DYSPHONIA; MUSCLE; FRAMEWORK; SPEAKING; HUMANS; FORCES; CORTEX; TASK	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand neck intermuscular beta coherence (15-35 Hz; NIBcoh) in healthy individuals, with respect to modulation by behavioral tasks. Method: Mean NIBcoh was measured using surface electromyography at 2 anterior neck locations in 10 individuals during normal speech, static nonspeech maneuvers, "clear" speech (intentionally produced to maximize intelligibility), divided-attention speech, singing, and mimicked hyperfunctional speech. Results: An analysis of variance showed significant effects of both individual and condition (p = .001) on the mean beta-band intermuscular coherence. Dunnett's simultaneous paired t tests found decreased NIBcoh during low-attention speech, singing, and hyperfunctional speech (padj < .05), but no significant difference in NIBcoh during nonspeech tasks or clear speech production relative to normal speech. Conclusions: Compared with normal speech, mean NIBcoh was decreased in a divided-attention speech task, but clear speech did not result in increased mean coherence relative to normal speech, possibly due to ceiling effects caused by heightened attention and precision during experimental recording. Mimicking a strained, hyperfunctional voice resulted in a reduction in mean beta intermuscular coherence quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the lowered values of mean beta coherence seen in individuals with vocal nodules relative to individuals with normal voice.

This suggests at least that processes in these two areas are coordinated during behavioral adaptation. We analyzed local field potentials recorded in both regions in two monkeys performing a problem-solving task that alternated exploration and repetitive behaviors with the specific prediction that neural activity should reveal interareal coordination mainly during exploration. Both areas showed increased high gamma power after errors in exploration and after rewards in exploitation. We found that high gamma (60 - 140 Hz) power increases in ACC were followed by a later increase in LPFC only after negative feedback (errors) or first positive feedback (correct) during the exploration period. The difference in latencies between the two structures disappeared in repetition period. Simultaneous recordings revealed correlations between high gamma power in the two areas around feedback; however, correlations were observed in both exploration and repetition. In contrast, postfeedback beta (10 - 20 Hz) power in ACC and LPFC correlated more frequently during repetition. Together, our data suggest that the coordination between ACC and LPFC activity is expressed during adaptive as well as stable behavioral periods but with different modes depending on the behavioral period.

An early and accurate diagnosis of AD would enable to develop new strategies for managing the disease; however, nowadays there is no single test that can accurately predict the development of AD. In this sense, only a few studies have focused on the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) AD connectivity patterns. This study compares brain connectivity in terms of linear and nonlinear couplings by means of spectral coherence and cross mutual information function (CMIF), respectively. The variables defined from these functions provide statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between AD patients and control subjects, especially the variables obtained from CMIF. The results suggest that AD is characterized by both decreases and increases of functional couplings in different frequency bands as well as by an increase in regularity, that is, more evident statistical deterministic relationships in AD patients' MEG connectivity. The significant differences obtained indicate that AD could disturb brain interactions causing abnormal brain connectivity and operation. Furthermore, the combination of coherence and CMIF features to perform a diagnostic test based on logistic regression improved the tests based on individual variables for its robustness.

However it is not known whether acetazolamide may positively affect the excitability of neurons in the brain in vivo or cortical processing abilities. To test these possibilities we intravenously administered a low dose (7 mg/kg) acetazolamide to volunteers who performed a demanding visual signal detection task while undergoing whole brain electroencephalographic examinations. Two groups were tested twice on the same task, while receiving acetazolamide or a saline treatment in between the two sessions. Our data indicate that, while the control group showed a decrease in global gamma (30-49 Hz) power across sessions, with no correlation to performance, the acetazolamide group showed increased global gamma power that strongly related to their performance in the signal detection task. This was accompanied by a decrease in the early part of the event related potential in the control group, a decrease not seen in the acetazolamide group. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, ventilation rate, or heart rate between the two groups. It is possible that the differences between the groups, observed in this study, are related to the enhancing effect of acetazolamide on the nitric oxide generation catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, or to other actions of acetazolamide, e.g. opening of Ca2+ activated K+ channels and inhibition of Ca2+ channels.

The role of DMN deactivation remains enigmatic in part because its electrophysiological correlates, temporal dynamics, and link to behavior are poorly understood. Using extensive depth electrode recordings in humans, we provide first electrophysiological evidence for a direct correlation between the dynamics of power decreases in the DMN and individual subject behavior. We found that all DMN areas displayed transient suppressions of broadband gamma (60-140 Hz) power during performance of a visual search task and, critically, we show for the first time that the millisecond range duration and extent of the transient gamma suppressions are correlated with task complexity and subject performance. In addition, trial-by-trial correlations revealed that spatially distributed gamma power increases and decreases formed distinct anticorrelated large-scale networks. Beyond unraveling the electrophysiological basis of DMN dynamics, our results suggest that, rather than indicating a mere switch to a global exteroceptive mode, DMN deactivation encodes the extent and efficiency of our engagement with the external world. Furthermore, our findings reveal a pivotal role for broadband gamma modulations in the interplay between task-positive and task-negative networks mediating efficient goal-directed behavior and facilitate our understanding of the relationship between electrophysiology and neuroimaging studies of intrinsic brain networks.

As has been shown in other fields that study learning processes, synchronization mechanisms between neuronal assemblies might have a key role during language learning. In particular, studying these dynamics may help uncover whether different oscillatory patterns sustain more item-based learning of words and rule-based learning from speech input. Therefore, we tracked the modulation of oscillatory neural activity during the initial exposure to an artificial language, which contained embedded rules. We analyzed both spectral power variations, as a measure of local neuronal ensemble synchronization, as well as phase coherence patterns, as an index of the long-range coordination of these local groups of neurons. Synchronized activity in the gamma band (20-40 Hz), previously reported to be related to the engagement of selective attention, showed a clear dissociation of local power and phase coherence between distant regions. In this frequency range, local synchrony characterized the subjects who were focused on word identification and was accompanied by increased coherence in the theta band (4-8 Hz). Only those subjects who were able to learn the embedded rules showed increased gamma band phase coherence between frontal, temporal, and parietal regions.

Tinnitus however can be perceived exclusively uni- or bilaterally. Methods: The neurophysiological differences were investigated between unilateral and bilateral tinnitus using LORETA source localized resting state EEG recordings. Results: The difference between unilateral and bilateral tinnitus is reflected by high frequency activity (beta and gamma) in the superior prefrontal gurus, right parahippocampus, right angular gyrus and right auditory cortex. Unilateral tinnitus is characterized by contralateral beta2 in the superior prefrontal gyrus in comparison to bilateral tinnitus, but gamma in comparison to non-tinnitus subjects. Bilateral tinnitus has delta activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in comparison to unilateral tinnitus, and bilateral beta1 in comparison to non-tinnitus subjects. Bilateral tinnitus is also characterized by bilateral fronto-polar beta1 activity. Conclusions: Unilateral and bilateral tinnitus can be differentiated based on their resting state oscillation patterns: beta3 and gamma-band activity in the superior premotor cortex, parahippocampal area and angular gyrus seem to form the core of a spatial localization network involved in tinnitus. Significance: These differences should be taken into account when evaluating functional neuroimaging data relating to tinnitus. (c) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We used topological measures to qualify and quantify the functional connectivity of the networks used under various comprehension conditions. To that aim we developed a technique to represent functional networks based on EEG recordings, taking advantage of their excellent time resolution in order to capture the fast processes that occur during language comprehension. Networks were created by searching for a specific causal relation between areas, the negative feedback loop, which is ubiquitous in many systems. This method is a simple way to construct directed graphs using event-related activity, which can then be analyzed topologically. Brain activity was recorded while subjects read expressions of various types and indicated whether they found them meaningful. Slightly different functional networks were obtained for event-related activity evoked by each expression type. The differences reflect the special contribution of specific regions in each condition and the balance of hemispheric activity involved in comprehending different types of expressions and are consistent with the literature in the field. Our results indicate that representing event-related brain activity as a network using a simple temporal relation, such as the negative feedback loop, to indicate directional connectivity is a viable option for investigation which also derives new information about aspects not reflected in the classical methods for investigating brain activity.

However, the influence of the mutation on the central nervous system (CNS) remains largely unclear. In this study, we have conducted behavioral, morphological and electrophysiological investigations to clarify the CNS dysfunction in bv/bv mice. These mutant mice exhibited heightened levels of anxiety with normal levels of motor activity. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant reduction in parvalbumin-containing GABAergic interneurons in the anterior cingulate, somatosensory and auditory cortices of bv/bv mice. The current results suggest that interneuron development may be disrupted in the bv/bv cerebrum. Moreover, the high-frequency electroencephalogram components of the cortical activity, including the frequency range containing high gamma, were markedly decreased in bv/bv mice compared with controls, probably indicating a disturbance in cortical inhibitory function. Together, these results suggest that the cortical development of interneurons and their electrophysiological profiles are altered in bv/bv mice. We propose that these novel phenotypes identified in bv/bv mice provide new perspectives on the basic neuronal mechanisms of developmental disorders. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we evaluate the promise of event-related potentials (ERPs) as biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We conclude that ERPs have several desirable properties: 1) they provide a direct measure of electrical activity during neurotransmission; 2) their high temporal resolutions make it possible to measure neural synchrony and oscillations; 3) they are relatively inexpensive and convenient to record; 4) animal models are readily available for several ERP components; 5) decades of research has established the sensitivity and reliability of ERP measures in psychiatric illnesses; and 6) feasibility of large N (>500) multisite studies has been demonstrated for key measures. Consequently, ERPs may be useful for identifying endophenotypes and defining treatment targets, for evaluating new compounds in animals and in humans, and for identifying individuals who are good candidates for early interventions or for specific treatments. However, several challenges must be overcome before ERPs gain widespread use as biomarkers in schizophrenia research, and we make several recommendations for the research that is necessary to develop and validate ERP-based biomarkers that can have a real impact on treatment development.

Functional Communication Within a Perceptual Network Processing Letters and Pseudoletters	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cortical oscillations; Event-related fields; Functional connectivity; Magnetoencephalography; Phase coherence	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; WORD FORM AREA; HUMAN EEG; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FACE PERCEPTION; FUSIFORM GYRUS; SINGLE LETTERS; HUMANS; TASK; ATTENTION	Many studies have identified regions within human ventral visual stream to be important for object identification and categorization; however, knowledge of how perceptual information is communicated within the visual network is still limited. Current theories posit that if a high correspondence between incoming sensory information and internal representations exists, then the object is rapidly identified, and if there is not, then the object requires extra detailed processing. Event-related responses from the present magnetoencephalography study showed two main effects. The N1m peak latencies were approximately 15 milliseconds earlier to familiar letters than to unfamiliar pseudoletters, and the N2m was more negative to pseudoletters than to letters. Event-related beamforming analyses identified these effects to be within bilateral visual cortices with a right lateralization for the N2m effect. Furthermore, functional connectivity analyses revealed that gamma-band (50-80 Hz) oscillatory phase synchronizations among occipital regions were greater to letters than to pseudoletters (around 85 milliseconds). However, during a later time interval between 245 and 375 milliseconds, pseudoletters elicited greater gamma-band phase synchronizations among a more distributed occipital network than did letters. These findings indicate that familiar object processing begins by at least 85 milliseconds, which could represent an initial match to an internal template. In addition, unfamiliar object processing persisted longer than that for familiar objects, which could reflect greater attention to inexperienced objects to determine their identity and/or to consolidate a new template to aid in future identification.

Young healthy subjects underwent simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements at 1.5 T under resting conditions in the descent to deep sleep. Continuous 5 min epochs representing a unique sleep stage (i.e., wakefulness, sleep stages 1 and 2, or slow-wave sleep) were extracted. fMRI time series of subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) (cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, and subiculum) were extracted based on cytoarchitectonical probability maps. We observed sleep stage-dependent changes in HF functional coupling. The HF was integrated to variable strength in the default mode network (DMN) in wakefulness and light sleep stages but not in slow-wave sleep. The strongest functional connectivity between the HF and neocortex was observed in sleep stage 2 (compared with both slow-wave sleep and wakefulness). We observed a strong interaction of sleep spindle occurrence and HF functional connectivity in sleep stage 2, with increased HF/neocortical connectivity during spindles. Moreover, the cornu ammonis exhibited strongest functional connectivity with the DMN during wakefulness, while the subiculum dominated hippocampal functional connectivity to frontal brain regions during sleep stage 2. Increased connectivity between HF and neocortical regions in sleep stage 2 suggests an increased capacity for possible global information transfer, while connectivity in slow-wave sleep is reflecting a functional system optimal for segregated information reprocessing. Our data may be relevant to differentiating sleep stage-specific contributions to neural plasticity as proposed in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

Reconstruction of gastric slow wave from finger photoplethysmographic signal using radial basis function neural network	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Gastric myoelectric activity; Photoplethysmography; Discrete wavelet transform; Radial basis function neural network; Time-series modeling	TIME-SERIES; RESPIRATORY VOLUMES; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; TRANSFORM	Extraction of extra-cardiac information from photoplethysmography (PPG) signal is a challenging research problem with significant clinical applications. In this study, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to reconstruct the gastric myoelectric activity (GMA) slow wave from finger PPG signal. Finger PPG and GMA (measured using Electrogastrogram, EGG) signals were acquired simultaneously at the sampling rate of 100 Hz from ten healthy subjects. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to extract slow wave (0-0.1953 Hz) component from the finger PPG signal; this slow wave PPG was used to reconstruct EGG. A RBFNN is trained on signals obtained from six subjects in both fasting and postprandial conditions. The trained network is tested on data obtained from the remaining four subjects. In the earlier study, we have shown the presence of GMA information in finger PPG signal using DWT and cross-correlation method. In this study, we explicitly reconstruct gastric slow wave from finger PPG signal by the proposed RBFNN-based method. It was found that the network-reconstructed slow wave provided significantly higher (P < 0.0001) correlation (>= 0.9) with the subject's EGG slow wave than the correlation obtained (approximate to 0.7) between the PPG slow wave from DWT and the EEG slow wave. Our results showed that a simple finger PPG signal can be used to reconstruct gastric slow wave using RBFNN method.	[Yacin, S.

Cyclic alternating pattern in narcolepsy patients and healthy controls after partial and total sleep deprivation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Narcolepsy; Sleep microstructure; Sleep deprivation; Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP); Sleep homeostasis	NON-REM SLEEP; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EEG AROUSALS; CAP; CATAPLEXY; DISORDERS; SLOW; OSCILLATIONS; HOMEOSTASIS; VALIDATION	Objective: To investigate the regulation NREM sleep at baseline and in morning recovery sleep after partial and total sleep deprivation (SD) in narcolepsy-cataplexy (NC) using cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). Methods: Daytime sleep under either increased (no sleep in the previous night) or decreased sleep pressure (allowing 4 h of sleep, 23:00-3:00 h) was recorded in ten drug-free, HLA-positive, hypocretin deficient NC patients and ten age, gender and body mass index matched healthy controls. Baseline sleep was also recorded and used for comparison purposes. CAP parameters were scored and analyzed for each subject. Results: Narcolepsy patients had significantly lower CAP rate, CAP index, CAP time, number of CAP cycles, A1 index and number of A1 cycles in comparison to healthy controls at baseline as well as after partial and total SD. In both narcolepsy patients and healthy control subjects there was a significant decrease in these parameters after partial and total SD but the changes followed a similar pattern. Conclusion: The persistence of baseline differences in CAP parameters between narcolepsy patients and healthy controls and their similar behavior after partial and total SD suggests similar homeostatic NREM sleep regulation but on a different level. Significance: CAP analysis demonstrates that NREM sleep homeostasis although altered, is functional in narcolepsy patients.

L-Dopa activates histaminergic neurons	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; RAT SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HISTIDINE-DECARBOXYLASE; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; IN-VITRO; TUBEROMAMMILLARY NEURONS; MEDIOBASAL HYPOTHALAMUS	Non-technical summary L-Dopa is an effective medication for Parkinson's disease (PD), but loses efficiency with time. This can be delayed by treatment with histamine antagonists. We show histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus controlling wakefulness are excited by L-Dopa, which they can take up and transform to dopamine. They innervate the whole brain, in particular the striatum which is deficient of dopamine in PD. We revealed mechanisms of excitation of histaminergic neurons by L-Dopa and dopamine opening new avenues for the treatment of PD and sleep disorders.l-Dopa is the most effective treatment of early and advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its chronic use leads to loss of efficiency and dyskinesia. This is delayed by lower dosage at early stages, made possible by additional treatment with histamine antagonists. We present here evidence that histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) neurons, involved in the control of wakefulness, are excited under l-Dopa (EC50 15 mu m), express Dopa decarboxylase and show dopamine immunoreactivity. Dopaergic excitation was investigated with patch-clamp recordings from brain slices combined with single-cell RT-PCR analysis of dopamine receptor expression. In addition to the excitatory dopamine 1 (D1)-like receptors, TMN neurons express D2-like receptors, which are coupled through phospholipase C (PLC) to transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. D2 receptor activation enhances firing frequency, histamine release in freely moving rats (microdialysis) and wakefulness (EEG recordings). In histamine deficient mice the wake-promoting action of the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) is missing. Thus the histamine neurons can, subsequent to l-Dopa uptake, co-release dopamine and histamine from their widely projecting axons. Taking into consideration the high density of histaminergic fibres and the histamine H3 receptor heteromerization either with D1 or with D2 receptors in the striatum, this study predicts new avenues for PD therapy.

CARDEA [1] is an environmental monitoring and control system suitable for implementing AAL services, aimed at low cost and fostering device interoperability. The adoption of standardized and massively diffused communication protocols, together with the implementation of hardware abstraction strategies, enhances CARDEA versatility and makes it open to "plugin" modules for implementing additional features. In this abstract, CARDEA extensions are presented, aimed at making home control functionalities accessible to people with severe motion and communication impairment. In particular, voice-and brain-control modules were added to CARDEA. The voice extension is based on open-source speech recognition tools, allowing the user for introducing his own acoustic and language models. A set of models suitable for the locale has been developed, and the speech recognizer has been connected to the CARDEA control module. The adoption of an open-source module allows for more flexibility in the system personalization, reducing the need for user training. The brain-control module is based on an inexpensive, single-channel EEG device, originally conceived for entertainment purposes. Different control techniques were investigated: first by looking at amplitude of "emotion" signal worked out by the BCI system, which can be controlled by the user, after a short training, by means of a visual feedback. A scan interface can be used for selecting one choice among different options. Although working, the system suffers from the relatively long time needed for attaining the required amplitude threshold, which need to be high enough to enable reliable command recognition. Hence, a different approach has been investigated, based on the SSVEP (Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential) analysis. When the user's retina is exposed to a low-frequency stimulus, brainwaves exhibit the onset of correlated frequency components. The user is shown a set of modulated light sources, each light corresponding to a given action. Then he simply look at the light corresponding to the required action for a few seconds: by means of spectral decomposition of the brainwave signals, the system infers the chosen option and triggers the corresponding action. With respect to the amplitude-based approach, such a frequency-domain approach is significantly faster and requires almost no training to the user. Moreover, being not based on scan sequences, it is more suitable for the implementation of complex decision trees. On the other hand, it obviously requires the user retains visual ability and needs control of the extraocular muscles. All of the above approaches were tested in a lab environment with a set of volunteers. Voice and brain interfaces were connected to CARDEA, allowing for controlling a demo room. So doing, users were able to trigger simple functions (such as switching on or off an appliance) in many different ways. Lab test shows fairly satisfactory performance and functionality for the proposed techniques, making them promising solutions for effective, low-cost implementation of multi-modal interaction in AAL environments.

Transfer entropy is an information theoretic implementation of Wiener's principle of observational causality. It offers an approach to the detection of neuronal interactions that is free of an explicit model of the interactions. Hence, it offers the power to analyze linear and nonlinear interactions alike. This allows for example the comprehensive analysis of directed interactions in neural networks at various levels of description. Here we present the open-source MATLAB toolbox TRENTOOL that allows the user to handle the considerable complexity of this measure and to validate the obtained results using non-parametrical statistical testing. We demonstrate the use of the toolbox and the performance of the algorithm on simulated data with nonlinear (quadratic) coupling and on local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the retina and the optic tectum of the turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) where a neuronal one-way connection is likely present. Results: In simulated data TE detected information flow in the simulated direction reliably with false positives not exceeding the rates expected under the null hypothesis. In the LFP data we found directed interactions from the retina to the tectum, despite the complicated signal transformations between these stages. No false positive interactions in the reverse directions were detected. Conclusions: TRENTOOL is an implementation of transfer entropy and mutual information analysis that aims to support the user in the application of this information theoretic measure. TRENTOOL is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and available under an open source license (GPL v3). For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly integrates with the popular FieldTrip toolbox.

The effect of age on human motor electrocorticographic signals and implications for brain-computer interface applications	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTEX; SPECTRA; DECLINE; NEURONS; LIFE; EEG	Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have emerged as a new signal platform for neuroprosthetic application. ECoG-based platforms have shown significant promise for clinical application due to the high level of information that can be derived from the ECoG signal, the signal's stability, and its intermediate nature of surgical invasiveness. However, before long-term BCI applications can be realized it will be important to also understand how the cortical physiology alters with age. Such understanding may provide an appreciation for how this may affect the control signals utilized by a chronic implant. In this study, we report on a large population of adult and pediatric invasively monitored subjects to determine the impact that age will have on surface cortical physiology. We evaluated six frequency bands-delta (<4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), low gamma band (30-50 Hz), and high gamma band (76-100 Hz)-to evaluate the effect of age on the magnitude of power change, cortical area of activation, and cortical networks. When significant trends are evaluated as a whole, it appears that the aging process appears to more substantively alter thalamocortical interactions leading to an increase in cortical inefficiency. Despite this, we find that higher gamma rhythms appear to be more anatomically constrained with age, while lower frequency rhythms appear to broaden in cortical involvement as time progresses. From an independent signal standpoint, this would favor high gamma rhythms' utilization as a separable signal that could be maintained chronically.

During the complex process of the wake to sleep transition, various electrophysiological, cognitive and behavioural alterations take place, all linked to states of consciousness. Together, these states have been interpreted as the hypnagogic state. It is no longer believed that sleep onset just acts as a buffer between the awake and sleep processes characterised by the gain and loss of sensory functioning, respectively. On the contrary, the sleep onset phenomenon addresses many issues surrounding some of the most common sleep and mental disorders. What is the moment of sleep onset? How can sleep onset be characterised from the brain, heart and respiration activity during sleep in humans? These are some of the questions that have no clear and definite answers. Neural synchrony and its interaction and coupling with cardio-respiratory synchrony is very much related to its role as a mechanism for integrating brain, heart and respiration, which are all responsible for consciousness, in both humans and animals. The phase synchrony between neural, cardio and respiratory activities and environment provides a signature of subjective experiences, linked to various states of consciousness. Technological advances have led to a gradual shift in the approach adopted by the scientific community towards unravelling and understanding this sleep onset phenomenon as an altered state of consciousness. This chapter presents research from the scientific community, explores some new objective indices that can be adopted to measure sleep onset, and demonstrates how sleep onset can be voluntarily altered and induced using biofeedback technology.

In people with schizophrenia and controls, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine accuracy and practice-related changes in parameters indexing neural network structure and activity, to determine whether these might be useful assays of the efficacy of cognitive remediation. Two MEG recordings were acquired during performance of a tone discrimination task used to improve the acuity of auditory processing, before and after similar to 2.5 h of task practice. Accuracy before practice was negatively correlated with beta-band cost efficiency, a graph theoretical measure of network organization. Synthetic aperture magnetometry was used to localize brain oscillations with high spatial accuracy; results demonstrated sound and sensorimotor modulations of the beta band in temporo-parietal regions and the sensorimotor cortex respectively. High-gamma activity also correlated with sensorimotor processing during the task, with activation of auditory regions following sound stimulation, and activation of the left sensorimotor cortex preceding the button press. High-gamma power in the left frontal cortex was also found to correlate with accuracy. Following practice, sound-induced broad-band power in the left angular gyri increased. Accuracy improved and was found to correlate with increased mutual information (MI) between sensors in temporal-parietal regions in the beta band but not global cost efficiency. Based on these results, we conclude that hours of task practice can induce meso-scale changes such as increased power in relevant brain regions as well as changes in MI that correlate with improved accuracy.

The working memory items were composed of spatially arranged dots supposedly requiring both the dorsal and the ventral stream to be engaged during maintenance. Using a beamforming technique, we localized memory-dependent sources in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. After the single-trial power values were extracted from these frequency bands with respect to each source, we calculated the correlations within- and cross-frequency bands. The following general picture emerged: gamma power in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) during working memory maintenance was correlated with numerous other sources in the alpha band in prefrontal, parietal, and posterior regions. In addition, the power correlations within the alpha band showed correlations across posterior-parietal-frontal regions. From these findings, we suggest that the STG dominated by gamma activity serves as a hub region for the network nodes responsible for the retention of the stimulus used in this study, which is likely to depend on both the "where-'' and the "what-'' visual system simultaneously. The present study demonstrates how oscillatory dynamics reflecting the interaction between cortical areas can be investigated by means of cross-frequency power correlations in source space. This methodological framework could be of general utility when studying functional network properties of the working brain.

This method is utilized to guide surgical intervention in cases of medically intractable epilepsy by identifying the location and extent of the epileptogenic focus. Recent studies have proposed mechanisms in which the activity of epileptogenic cortical networks, rather than discrete focal sources, contributes to the generation of the ictal state. If true, selective modulation of key network components could be employed for the prevention and termination of the ictal state. Methods: Here, we have applied graph theory methods as a means to identify critical network nodes in cortical networks during both ictal and interictal states. ECoG recordings were obtained from a cohort of 25 patients undergoing presurgical monitoring for the treatment of intractable epilepsy at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, U.S.A.). Key Findings: One graph measure, the betweenness centrality, was found to correlate with the location of the resected cortical regions in patients who were seizure-free following surgical intervention. Furthermore, these network interactions were also observed during random nonictal periods as well as during interictal spike activity. These network characteristics were found to be frequency dependent, with high frequency gamma band activity most closely correlated with improved postsurgical outcome as has been reported in previous literature. Significance: These findings could lead to improved understanding of epileptogenesis. In addition, this theoretically allows for more targeted therapeutic interventions through the selected modulation or disruption of these epileptogenic networks.

We here report how a selective disruption of deep sleep only, that is, selective slow-wave activity (SWA) reduction, affects the performance of healthy well-sleeping subjects on several tasks: a "simple" and a "complex" vigilance task, a declarative learning task, and an implicit learning task despite unchanged duration of sleep. We used automated electroencephalogram (EEG) dependent acoustic feedback aimed at selective interference with-and reduction of-SWA. In a within-subject repeated measures crossover design, performance on the tasks was assessed in 13 elderly adults without sleep complaints after either SWA-reduction or after normal sleep. The number of vigilance lapses increased as a result of SWA reduction, irrespective of the type of vigilance task. Recognition on the declarative memory task was also affected by SWA reduction, associated with a decreased activation of the right hippocampus on encoding (measured with fMRI) suggesting a weaker memory trace. SWA reduction, however, did not affect reaction time on either of the vigilance tasks or implicit memory task performance. These findings suggest a specific role of slow oscillations in the subsequent daytime ability to maintain sustained attention and to encode novel declarative information but not to maintain response speed or to build implicit memories. Of particular interest is that selective SWA reduction can mimic some of the effects of total sleep deprivation, while not affecting sleep duration.

This relationship has generally been assumed to be invariant regardless of the brain region and the cognitive task being studied. We critically evaluated these assumptions by comparing the BOLD-fMRI response with local field potential (LFP) measurements during visually cued common noun and verb generation in 11 humans in whom 1210 subdural electrodes were implanted. As expected, power in the mid-gamma band (60-120 Hz) correlated positively (r(2) = 0.16, p < 10(-16)) and power in the beta band (13-30 Hz) correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.09, p < 10(-16)) with the BOLD signal change. Beta and mid-gamma band activity independently explain different components of the observed BOLD signal. Importantly, we found that the location (i.e., lobe) of the recording site modulates the relationship between the electrocorticographic (ECoG) signal and the observed fMRI response (p < 10(-16), F-21,F-1830 = 52.7), while the type of language task does not. Across all brain regions, ECoG activity in the gamma and beta bands explains 22% of the fMRI response, but if the lobar location is considered, 28% of the variance can be explained. Further evaluation of this relationship at the level of individual gyri provides additional evidence of differences in the BOLD-LFP relationship by cortical locus. This spatial variability in the relationship between the fMRI signal and neural activity carries implications for modeling of the hemodynamic response function, an essential step for interregional fMRI comparisons.

We conducted a memory experiment composed of 35 blocks each having three parts: LTM encoding, working memory (WM) maintenance and LTM retrieval. In the LTM encoding and WM maintenance parts, participants had to respectively encode or maintain the order of three sequentially presented words. During LTM retrieval subjects had to reproduce these sequences. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we identified significant differences in the gamma and beta activity. Robust gamma activity (55-65 Hz) in left BA6 (supplementary motor area (SMA)/pre-SMA) was stronger during LTM rehearsal than during WM maintenance. The gamma activity was sustained throughout the 3.4 s rehearsal period during which a fixation cross was presented. Importantly, the difference in gamma band activity correlated with memory performance over subjects. Further we observed a weak gamma power difference in left BA6 during the first half of the LTM rehearsal interval larger for successfully than unsuccessfully reproduced word triplets. In the beta band, we found a power decrease in left anterior regions during LTM rehearsal compared to WM maintenance. Also this suppression of beta power correlated with memory performance over subjects. Our findings show that an extended network of brain areas, characterized by oscillatory activity in different frequency bands, supports the encoding of word sequences in LTM. Gamma band activity in BA6 possibly reflects memory processes associated with language and timing, and suppression of beta activity at left frontal sensors is likely to reflect the release of inhibition directly associated with the engagement of language functions.

The front-end circuit consisting of a preamplifier followed by a 6th-order bandpass filter is designed for signal sensing in a future epileptic deep brain stimulator. A current-splitting technique is combined with an output-branch current scaling technique in a folded-cascode amplifier structure to improve the noise and power tradeoff in the preamplifier. In measurements, the preamplifier exhibits 39.4 dB DC gain, 0.36 Hz to 1.3 kHz of -3 dB bandwidth, and 3.07 mu V-rms total input-referred noise while consuming 2.4 mu W from a 2.8 V power supply provided by an on-chip regulator circuit. A noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 3.09 is achieved with minimal power consumption and is one of the lowest published to date. The 6th-order follow-the-leader feedback elliptic bandpass filter passes FR signals and provides -110 dB/decade attenuation to out-of-band frequency components. In measurements, the entire front-end circuit achieves a mid-band gain of 38.5 dB, a bandwidth from 250 to 486 Hz, and a total input-referred noise of 2.48 mu V-rms while consuming 4.5 mu W from the 2.8 V power supply. The front-end NEF achieved is 7.6. To the authors' knowledge, the proposed epileptic seizure-detection system is the first to achieve the FR-recording functionality. The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.6 mu m CMOS process. Die size is 0.45 mm(2).

Development of Mu Rhythm in Infants and Preschool Children	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Spontaneous cortical oscillation; Human brain development; Maturation of cortical rhythm; Prehension; Pediatric magnetoencephalography	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; HAND MOUTH COORDINATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA RHYTHMS; YOUNG INFANTS; HUMAN BRAIN; IMITATION; EEG; REPRESENTATION; PERCEPTION	Mu rhythm is an idling rhythm that originates in the sensorimotor cortex during rest. The frequency of mu rhythm, which is well established in adults, is 8-12 Hz, whereas the limited results available from children suggest a frequency as low as 5.4 Hz at 6 months of age, which gradually increases to the adult value. Understanding the normal development of mu rhythm has important theoretical and clinical implications since we still know very little about this signal in infants and how it develops with age. We measured mu rhythm over the left hemisphere using a pediatric magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in 25 infants (11-47 weeks), 18 preschool children (2-5 years) and 6 adults (20-39 years) for two 5-min sessions during two intermixed conditions: a rest condition in which the hands were at rest, and a prehension condition in which the subject squeezed a pipette with his/her right hand. In all participants, mu rhythm was present over the frontoparietal area during the rest condition, but was clearly suppressed during the prehension condition. Mu rhythm peak frequency, determined from the amplitude spectra, increased rapidly as a function of age from 2.75 Hz at 11 weeks to 8.25 Hz at 47 weeks (r(2) = 0.83). It increased very slowly during the preschool period (3.1 +/- 8 0.9 years; 8.5 +/- 8 0.54 Hz). The frequency in these children was, however, lower than in adults (10.3 +/- 8 1.2 Hz). Our results show a rapid maturation in spontaneous mu rhythm during the first year of life. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Following microinjection of K+ onto the surface of the brain, changes in electroencephalogram (EEG). DC potential and tissue optical density were all compatible with the occurrence of a transient spreading neuronal depression. RBC flow in single capillaries was not stationary. Unpredictable redistribution of RBCs at branches of capillaries was commonly observed, even though no change in diameter was apparent at the reported site of the capillary sphincter and no change of arteriolar-venule pressure difference was detected. There appeared to be a slow morphological change of astroglial endfeet. When local neurons were stunned transiently by K+ injection, the velocity and oscillation frequency of RBCs flowing in nearby capillaries started to decrease. The flow in such capillaries was rectified, losing oscillatory components. Sluggish-floating movements of RBCs in pertinent capillaries were visualized, with occasional full stops. When CSD subsided, RBC movements recovered to the original state. We postulate that neuronal depolarization blocks oscillatory signaling to local capillaries via low-shear plasma viscosity increases in the capillary channels, and a complex interaction between the RBC surface and the buffy coat on the capillary wall surface increases the capillary flow resistance. Then, when CSD subsides and oscillatory neuronal function is recovered, the normal physiological conditions are restored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ebner, M; Hameroff, S				Ebner, Marc; Hameroff, Stuart			Lateral Information Processing by Spiking Neurons: A Theoretical Model of the Neural Correlate of Consciousness	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY FORMATION; ANALYTICALLY SOLUBLE MODEL; COLLECTIVE OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION REWARD; COLOR CONSTANCY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; SERVO CONTROL; NETWORK; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Cognitive brain functions, for example, sensory perception, motor control and learning, are understood as computation by axonal-dendritic chemical synapses in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. Cognitive brain functions may occur either consciously or nonconsciously (on "autopilot"). Conscious cognition is marked by gamma synchrony EEG, mediated largely by dendritic-dendritic gap junctions, sideways connections in input/integration layers. Gap-junction-connected neurons define a sub-network within a larger neural network. A theoreticalmodel (the "conscious pilot") suggests that as gap junctions open and close, a gamma-synchronized subnetwork, or zone moves through the brain as an executive agent, converting nonconscious "auto-pilot" cognition to consciousness, and enhancing computation by coherent processing and collective integration. In this study we implemented sideways "gap junctions" in a single-layer artificial neural network to perform figure/ground separation. The set of neurons connected through gap junctions form a reconfigurable resistive grid or sub-network zone. In the model, outgoing spikes are temporally integrated and spatially averaged using the fixed resistive grid set up by neurons of similar function which are connected through gap-junctions. This spatial average, essentially a feedback signal from the neuron's output, determines whether particular gap junctions between neurons will open or close. Neurons connected through open gap junctions synchronize their output spikes. We have tested our gap-junction-defined sub-network in a one-layer neural network on artificial retinal inputs using real-world images. Our system is able to perform figure/ground separation where the laterally connected sub-network of neurons represents a perceived object. Even though we only show results for visual stimuli, our approach should generalize to other modalities. The system demonstrates a moving sub-network zone of synchrony, within which the contents of perception are represented and contained. This mobile zone can be viewed as a model of the neural correlate of consciousness in the brain.

During development, this activity is important for the migration and differentiation of cortex cell types and the formation of neuronal connections1. In the mature animal, ongoing activity reflects the past and the present state of an animal into which sensory stimuli are seamlessly integrated to compute future actions. Thus, a clear understanding of the organization of ongoing i.e. spontaneous activity is a prerequisite to understand cortex function. Numerous recording techniques revealed that ongoing activity in cortex is comprised of many neurons whose individual activities transiently sum to larger events that can be detected in the local field potential (LFP) with extracellular microelectrodes, or in the electroencephalogram (EEG), the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and the BOLD signal from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The LFP is currently the method of choice when studying neuronal population activity with high temporal and spatial resolution at the mesoscopic scale (several thousands of neurons). At the extracellular microelectrode, locally synchronized activities of spatially neighbored neurons result in rapid deflections in the LFP up to several hundreds of microvolts. When using an array of microelectrodes, the organizations of such deflections can be conveniently monitored in space and time. Neuronal avalanches describe the scale-invariant spatiotemporal organization of ongoing neuronal activity in the brain2,3. They are specific to the superficial layers of cortex as established in vitro4,5, in vivo in the anesthetized rat 6, and in the awake monkey7. Importantly, both theoretical and empirical studies2,8-10 suggest that neuronal avalanches indicate an exquisitely balanced critical state dynamics of cortex that optimizes information transfer and information processing. In order to study the mechanisms of neuronal avalanche development, maintenance, and regulation, in vitro preparations are highly beneficial, as they allow for stable recordings of avalanche activity under precisely controlled conditions. The current protocol describes how to study neuronal avalanches in vitro by taking advantage of superficial layer development in organotypic cortex cultures, i.e. slice cultures, grown on planar, integrated microelectrode arrays (MEA; see also 11-14).

A mutual information analysis of neural coding of speech by low-frequency MEG phase information. J Neurophysiol 106: 554-563, 2011. First published May 11, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00075.2011.-Recent work has implicated low-frequency (< 20 Hz) neuronal phase information as important for both auditory (< 10 Hz) and speech [theta (similar to 4-8 Hz)] perception. Activity on the timescale of theta corresponds linguistically to the average length of a syllable, suggesting that information within this range has consequences for segmentation of meaningful units of speech. Longer timescales that correspond to lower frequencies [delta (1-3 Hz)] also reflect important linguistic features-prosodic/suprasegmental-but it is unknown whether the patterns of activity in this range are similar to theta. We investigate low-frequency activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and mutual information (MI), an analysis that has not yet been applied to noninvasive electrophysiological recordings. We find that during speech perception each frequency subband examined [delta (1-3 Hz), theta(low) (3-5 Hz), theta(high) (5-7 Hz)] processes independent information from the speech stream. This contrasts with hypotheses that either delta and theta reflect their corresponding linguistic levels of analysis or each band is part of a single holistic onset response that tracks global acoustic transitions in the speech stream. Single-trial template-based classifier results further validate this finding: information from each subband can be used to classify individual sentences, and classifier results that utilize the combination of frequency bands provide better results than single bands alone. Our results suggest that during speech perception low-frequency phase of the MEG signal corresponds to neither abstract linguistic units nor holistic evoked potentials but rather tracks different aspects of the input signal. This study also validates a new method of analysis for noninvasive electrophysiological recordings that can be used to formally characterize information content of neural responses and interactions between these responses. Furthermore, it bridges results from different levels of neurophysiological study: small-scale multiunit recordings and local field potentials and macroscopic magneto/electrophysiological noninvasive recordings.

Wavelet-based Gaussian-mixture hidden Markov model for the detection of multistage seizure dynamics: A proof-of-concept study	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; EEG; PREDICTION; EVENTS; ONSET; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CLASSIFICATION	Background: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent electrophysiological activities, known as seizures. Without the appropriate detection strategies, these seizure episodes can dramatically affect the quality of life for those afflicted. The rationale of this study is to develop an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of seizure states so that it may be implemented along with potential intervention strategies. Methods: Hidden Markov model (HMM) was developed to interpret the state transitions of the in vitro rat hippocampal slice local field potentials (LFPs) during seizure episodes. It can be used to estimate the probability of state transitions and the corresponding characteristics of each state. Wavelet features were clustered and used to differentiate the electrophysiological characteristics at each corresponding HMM states. Using unsupervised training method, the HMM and the clustering parameters were obtained simultaneously. The HMM states were then assigned to the electrophysiological data using expert guided technique. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) analysis and Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) were applied to reduce the effect of over-fitting. The sensitivity, specificity and optimality index of chronic seizure detection were compared for various HMM topologies. The ability of distinguishing early and late tonic firing patterns prior to chronic seizures were also evaluated. Results: Significant improvement in state detection performance was achieved when additional wavelet coefficient rates of change information were used as features. The final HMM topology obtained using mRMR and AICc was able to detect non-ictal (interictal), early and late tonic firing, chronic seizures and postictal activities. A mean sensitivity of 95.7%, mean specificity of 98.9% and optimality index of 0.995 in the detection of chronic seizures was achieved. The detection of early and late tonic firing was validated with experimental intracellular electrical recordings of seizures. Conclusions: The HMM implementation of a seizure dynamics detector is an improvement over existing approaches using visual detection and complexity measures. The subjectivity involved in partitioning the observed data prior to training can be eliminated. It can also decipher the probabilities of seizure state transitions using the magnitude and rate of change wavelet information of the LFPs.	[Chiu, Alan W.

It is known that the temporal synchronization of neural ensembles is involved in the generation of specific motor, sensory or cognitive processes. Also, the intersegmental coherence of spinal spontaneous activity may indicate the existence of synaptic neural pathways between different pairs of lumbar segments. In this study we present a multichannel version of the detrended fluctuation analysis method (mDFA) to analyze the correlation dynamics of spontaneous spinal activity (SSA) from time series analysis. This method together with the classical detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were used to find out whether the SSA recorded in one or several segments in the spinal cord of the anesthetized cat occurs either in a random or in an organized manner. Our results are consistent with a non-random organization of the sets of neurons involved in the generation of spontaneous cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) recorded either from one lumbar segment (DFA-alpha mean = 1.04 +/- 0.09) or simultaneously from several lumbar segments (mDFA-alpha mean = 1.01 +/- 0.06), where alpha=0.5 indicates randomness while alpha>0.5 indicates long-term correlations. To test the sensitivity of the mDFA method we also examined the effects of small spinal lesions aimed to partially interrupt connectivity between neighboring lumbosacral segments. We found that the synchronization and correlation between the CDPs recorded from the L5 and L6 segments in both sides of the spinal cord were reduced when a lesion comprising the left dorsal quadrant was performed between the segments L5 and L6 (mDFA-alpha=0.992 as compared to initial conditions mDFA-alpha=1.186). The synchronization and correlation were reduced even further after a similar additional right spinal lesion (mDFA-alpha=0.924). In contrast to the classical methods, such as correlation and coherence quantification that define a relation between two sets of data, the mDFA method properly reveals the synchronization of multiple groups of neurons in several segments of the spinal cord. This method is envisaged as a useful tool to characterize the structure of higher order ensembles of cord dorsum spontaneous potentials after spinal cord or peripheral nerve lesions.
