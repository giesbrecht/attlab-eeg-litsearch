Accordingly, oscillatory activity detected by magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) should be analyzed along frequency, time, and spatial dimensions. MEG data were obtained from 19 healthy individuals while performing a modified Sternberg paradigm. The stimuli were letters, which constituted words or pronounceable nonwords. We applied tridimensional analysis of oscillations and also computed event-related fields (ERFs) in areas where significant changes in oscillatory activity were observed. Verbal working memory for visual verbal stimuli was associated with oscillatory interplay between the bilateral occipital lobes and the left frontoparietotemporal areas. Spatially stable occipital desynchrony was noted during information encoding, while a left hemisphere desynchronization, increasing in amplitude and spatial extent over time, was observed during information encoding and maintenance. No ERF changes were detected during information maintenance. Oscillatory activity associated with verbal working memory is consistent with the above hypothesis. These findings underscore the importance of multidimensional evaluation of oscillations. The findings also indicate that combining electrophysiological methods increase the chance of signal detection.

Different individuals perceive the very same painful event largely differently. Here, we aimed to predict the individual pain sensitivity from brain activity. We repeatedly applied identical painful stimuli to healthy human subjects and recorded brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG). We applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the time-frequency transformed single-trial EEG responses. Our results show that a classifier trained on a group of healthy individuals can predict another individual's pain sensitivity with an accuracy of 83%. Classification accuracy depended on pain-evoked responses at about 8 Hz and pain-induced gamma oscillations at about 80 Hz. These results reveal that the temporal-spectral pattern of pain-related neuronal responses provides valuable information about the perception of pain. Beyond, our approach may help to establish an objective neuronal marker of pain sensitivity which can potentially be recorded from a single EEG electrode.

Resection of ictal high-frequency oscillations leads to favorable surgical outcome in pediatric epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						High-frequency oscillations; Intracranial EEG; Time-frequency analysis; Surgical outcome; Nonlesional epilepsy	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EXTRATEMPORAL EPILEPSY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; 100-500 HZ; SURGERY; EEG; LOCALIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; CHILDREN	Purpose: Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) is performed as part of an epilepsy surgery evaluation when noninvasive tests are incongruent or the putative seizure-onset zone is near eloquent cortex. Determining the seizure-onset zone using intracranial EEG has been conventionally based on identification of specific ictal patterns with visual inspection. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80 Hz) have been recognized recently as highly correlated with the epileptogenic zone. However, HFOs can be difficult to detect because of their low amplitude. Therefore, the prevalence of ictal HFOs and their role in localization of epileptogenic zone on intracranial EEG are unknown. Methods: We identified 48 patients who underwent surgical treatment after the surgical evaluation with intracranial EEG, and 44 patients met criteria for this retrospective study. Results were not used in surgical decision making. Intracranial EEG recordings were collected with a sampling rate of 2,000 Hz. Recordings were first inspected visually to determine ictal onset and then analyzed further with time-frequency analysis. Forty-one (93%) of 44 patients had ictal HFOs determined with time-frequency analysis of intracranial EEG. Key Findings: Twenty-two (54%) of the 41 patients with ictal HFOs had complete resection of HFO regions, regardless of frequency bands. Complete resection of HFOs (n = 22) resulted in a seizure-free outcome in 18 (82%) of 22 patients, significantly higher than the seizure-free outcome with incomplete HFO resection (4/19, 21%). Significance: Our study shows that ictal HFOs are commonly found with intracranial EEG in our population largely of children with cortical dysplasia, and have localizing value. The use of ictal HFOs may add more promising information compared to interictal HFOs because of the evidence of ictal propagation and followed by clinical aspect of seizures. Complete resection of HFOs is a favorable prognostic indicator for surgical outcome.

We investigated whether the ictal HFOs on scalp EEG seen during spasms contributed to identification of the epileptogenic zone in symptomatic West syndrome (S-WS). Methods: In S-WS, ictal scalp EEGs were recorded during a series of spasms. The HFOs associated with spasms were visualized in the temporally expanded EEG traces and subjected to time-frequency analysis. The results on the distribution of HFOs were compared with that of cortical lesions indicated by neuroimaging. Results: In the 4 children examined, HFOs at 80-150 Hz preceded the clinical onsets of spasms. The maximum augmentation of these HFOs was larger than that of HFOs at 20-70 Hz. The regions of the maximum augmentation of HFOs at 80-150 Hz were identical to the lesions detected by neuroimaging. Two patients who underwent dissection of the area including the area with HFOs resulted in Engel class I. Conclusion: Ictal HFOs of spasms on scalp EEG showed a strong association with neuroimaging abnormalities presumed to be the epileptogenic zone in S-WS. Ictal HFOs can thus be a useful marker for exploring lesions for epilepsy surgery. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Starting from a time-frequency analysis of oscillations' amplitudes, time-variant approaches for quantification of phase locking, n: m phase synchronization, and quadratic phase coupling are applied. Trace discontinue patterns from premature newborns and trace alternant patterns from full-term newborns were investigated using bipolar EEG recordings. Maturation-related differences between the burst generation mechanisms can be shown, which are reflected in group-specific patterns of augmentation, timing, and grouping of time-varying phase characteristics of the EEG burst oscillations. We demonstrate for both groups (premature and full-term newborns) that phase-locked low-frequency oscillations are pronounced in the frequency range of 0.5-1.5 Hz. Phase-locked oscillations also occur in a frequency range of >3 Hz. The amplitude of a phase-locked 2-Hz oscillation is higher in full-term than in premature newborns. After onset, n: m synchronization and an increase in bicoherence occur earlier in the premature group (between 0.5-1.5 Hz and 3.0-6.0 Hz). It can be suggested that during the maturation process, the driving force of thalamic structures decreases and that cortical activity plays an increasingly important role in the process of burst generation.

Since conventional time or frequency domain analysis is found inadequate to describe the characteristics of a non-stationary signal, such as electroencephalography (EEG), in this paper, we propose to transform the EEG data using twelve Cohen class kernel functions in order to facilitate the time-frequency analysis. The transformed data thus obtained is exploited to formulate a feature vector consists of modular energy and modular entropy that can better model the time-frequency behavior of the EEG data. The feature vector is fed to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier in order to classify epileptic seizure data originating from different parts and state of the brain. A number of simulations is carried out using a benchmark EEG dataset. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of producing greater accuracy in comparison to that obtained by using a state-of-the-art method of epileptic seizure classification using the same EEG dataset and classifier.

The spectrogram and the scalogram are reviewed as tools for evaluating spike activity. A statistical evaluation of the continuous wavelet transform across trials is used to quantify phase-locking events. For simultaneously improving the time and frequency resolution, and for representing the EEG of several channels or trials in a single time-frequency plane, a multichannel matching pursuit algorithm is used.

Gamma oscillations are involved in the sensorimotor transformation of pain. J Neurophysiol 108: 1025-1031, 2012. First published May 23, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00186.2012.-Pain signals threat and initiates motor responses to avoid harm. The transformation of pain into a motor response is thus an essential part of pain. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms subserving the sensorimotor transformation of pain at the cortical level by using electroencephalography. In a simple reaction time experiment, brief painful stimuli were delivered to the left hand of healthy human subjects who responded with button presses of the right hand. The results show that the simple reaction time task was associated with neuronal responses at delta/theta, alpha/beta, and gamma frequencies. The analysis of the relationship between neuronal activity and response speed revealed that gamma oscillations, which were temporally coupled to the painful stimuli, but not temporally coupled to the motor response, predicted reaction times. Lateralization of gamma oscillations indicates that they originate from motor areas rather than from sensory areas. We conclude that gamma oscillations are involved in the sensorimotor transformation of pain whose efficiency they reflect. We hypothesize that the relationship between stimulus-locked gamma oscillations and reaction times reflects a direct thalamo-motor route of nociceptive information that is central to the biological function of pain.

A multiblock PLS model of cortico-cortical and corticomuscular interactions in Parkinson's disease	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multiblock partial least squares (PLS); Group analysis; Electroencephalography (EEG); Electromyography (EMG); Parkinson's disease (PD); Corticomuscular analysis	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; MOTOR CORTEX; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; COHERENCE; MATLAB; MUSCLE	Electroencephalography (EEG) and simultaneously-recorded electromyography (EMG) data are a means to assess integrity of the functional connection between the cortex and the muscle during movement. EEG-EMG coupling is typically assessed with pair-wise squared coherence, resulting in a small, but statistically-significant coherence between a single EEG and a single EMG channel. However, a means to combine results across subjects is not straightforward with this approach because the exact frequency of maximal EEG-EMG coupling may vary between individuals, and it emphasizes the role of an individual locus in the brain in driving the muscle activity, when interactions between head regions may in fact be more influential on ongoing EMG activity. To deal with these issues, we implemented a multiblock Partial Least Squares (mbPLS) procedure, previously proposed in chemical applications, which incorporates a hierarchical structure into the ordinary two-block PLS often used in neuroimaging studies. In the current implementation, each subject's data features are collected in individual data blocks on a sub-level, while simultaneously aggregating the sub-level information to obtain a super-level group "consensus". We further extended the mbPLS model to include 3-dimensional matrices: time-frequency-EEG channel and a time-frequency-connection utilizing Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). We applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected from ten normal subjects and nine patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease (PD) performing a dynamic motor task that of sinusoidal squeezing. The results demonstrate that connections between EEG electrodes, rather than activity at individual electrodes, correspond more closely to ongoing EMG activity. In PD subjects, there was enhanced connectivity to and from occipital regions, likely related to the previously-described enhanced use of visual information during motor performance in this group. The proposed mbPLS framework is a promising technique for performing multi-subject, multi-modal data analysis and it allows for robust group inferences even in the face of large inter-subject variability.

We investigated the correlation between the extent of removal of ictal HGO generating areas and postoperative seizure outcome in neocortical epilepsy (NE). Methods: Twenty three patients with medically intractable NE underwent chronic intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) using subdural electrodes. Ictal HGOs and superimposed undersampled ripples within +/- 3 s of video-iEEG ictal onset were extracted by wavelet clustering and thresholding. Cluster epileptogenicity indices (CEIs) were calculated. The temporal analysis window was locked to the timing of the maximum CEI wavecluster. Root mean square amplitudes, cross-correlation synchronies and the local focus indices within the temporal window were calculated. Results: Percentages of resected maximum CEI waveclusters and HGO zones with high standardised amplitudes (>3), high cross-correlation synchronies (>0.9) and high local focus indices (>2) were significantly higher in the seizure-free group compared to the not seizure-free group (p = 0.036, p = 0.018, and p = 0.026, respectively). Conclusions: The automatic quantitative ictal HGO analysis may be effective in delineating the epileptogenic zone. Significance: HGO analysis may be helpful for improving post-resection seizure outcome in NE in the future. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Epileptic Seizure Detection in EEG Using Time Variant Autoregressive Models	5TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, PTS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	5th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering	SEP 14-18, 2011	Budapest, HUNGARY			Epilepsy detection; EEG rhythms; Parametric power spectral density PSD; Time-Variant Autoregressive models; BIC criterion		Epilepsy represents an important health problem with evident repercussion in work and social activities on people with this condition. The use of time series decomposition into sub--bands of frequency to accomplish the oscillation modes in nonstationary signals is proposed. Specifically, electroencephalolgraphy (EEG) signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands, and the most relevant of them are employed for the detection of epilepsy seizures. Since the computation of oscillation modes is carried out based on Time-Variant Autoregressive model parameters, both approaches for searching an optimal order are studied: estimation over the entire database, and over each database recording. The feature set appraises parametric power spectral density in each frequency band of the Time-Variant Autoregressive models. Developed dimension reduction approach of high dimensional spectral space that is based on principal component analysis searches for frequency bands holding the higher values of relevance, in terms of performed accuracy of detection. Attained outcomes for k-nn classifier over 29 epilepsy patients reach a performed accuracy as high as 95% when is used an optimal order for each signal. The advantage of the proposed methodology is the interpretations, since each oscillation mode can be associated with one of the EEG rhythms.	[Duque Munoz, L.; Avendano-Valencia, L.

The Effect of Chronic Cannabinoids on Broadband EEG Neural Oscillations in Humans	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cannabis; cannabinoid; neural oscillations; neural synchrony; EEG; auditory steady-state response	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; AUDITORY-STIMULATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PHASE-LOCKING; GABA RELEASE; CB1 RECEPTOR; RAT-BRAIN; 40 HZ; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTEX	Animal and cellular work has shown that central cannabinoid-1 receptors modulate neural oscillations in the gamma range (40 Hz), which may be important for normal perceptual and cognitive processes. In order to assess the effect of cannabinoids on broadband-frequency neural oscillations in humans, the current study examined the effect of chronic cannabis use on auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) utilizing electroencephalography (EEG). Passive ASSRs were assessed using varying rates of binaural stimulation (auditory click-trains; 10-50 Hz in increments of 5 Hz; 80 dB SPL) in carefully screened cannabis users and controls. Chronic cannabis users (n = 22; 12 h abstinence before study; positive 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol urine levels) and cannabis naive controls (n = 24) were evaluated. Time X frequency analyses on EEG data were performed using Fourier-based mean trial power (MTP) and phase-locking (inter-trial coherence; ITC). Transient ERPs to stimulus onset (auditory N100 components) were also evaluated. As predicted, a decrease in spectral power (MTP) at 40 Hz was observed in the cannabis group (p < 0.018). No effects on phase-locking (ITC) or the N100 were observed. Further, within the cannabis group, lower 40 Hz power correlated with an earlier age of onset of cannabis use (p < 0.04). These data suggest that chronic exposure to exogenous cannabinoids can alter the ability to generate neural oscillations, particularly in the gamma range. This is consistent with preclinical animal and cellular data, which may have implications for understanding the short- and long-term psychopharmacological effects of cannabis.

However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, new diagnostic and treatment strategies are needed to both ascertain the biological underpinning of cognitive deficits and to restore them. Modulation of gamma oscillations (30-50 Hz) has been associated with cognitive performance, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In this manuscript, we review evidence for gamma modulation deficits during cognitive performance in schizophrenia. We demonstrate that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) is a reliable method that permits systematic quantification of gamma modulation in the cortex. Using TMS-EEG, we show that patients with schizophrenia have selective gamma inhibition deficits in the DLPFC. Finally, we demonstrate that repetitive TMS therapy over the DLPFC can normalize excessive gamma oscillations and ultimately cognitive performance in patients. We suggest that restoring gamma impairments in the DLPFC may be a potential strategy for improving cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

In order to improve the results of source localisation algorithms applied to EEG or MEG data, tensor-based preprocessing techniques can be used to separate the sources and reduce the noise. These methods are based on the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition (also called Parafac) of space-time-frequency (STF) or space-time-wave-vector (STWV) data. In this paper, we analyse the combination of EEG and MEG data to enhance the performance of the tensor-based preprocessing. To this end, we consider the joint CP decomposition of two (or more) third order tensors with one or two identical loading matrices. We present the necessary modifications for several classical CP decomposition algorithms and examine the gain on performance in the EEG/MEG context by means of simulations.

In this paper, we attempt to analyze EEG energy of three different conscious states such as normal awake, comatose and brain death based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) algorithm. The MEMD is a fully data-driven time-frequency technique which adaptively decomposes a set of signals into a finite set of amplitude-frequency modulated components, namely intrinsic mode functions (IMEs). By selecting suitable IMEs, we can calculate and evaluate the EEG energy of the decomposed brain activities. The analyzed results illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method in calculation of EEG energy for the healthy human, comatose patient and brain death.

A total of 56 consecutive patients, aged 17 to 78 years, who had a routine EEG recording, were included, and they were grouped as patients with epilepsy (Ep) and without epilepsy (nEp). Five different methods were used for alpha frequency estimation: visually guided manual counting and visually guided Fourier transform, and 3 methods were fully automated: time domain estimation of alpha (automatic assessment of alpha waves in time domain [ATD]) and 2 fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods, a segmented (automatic assessment of EEG segments by FFT) and one full FFT (automatic assessment of whole EEG by one FFT of the full recording [AWF]). The AWF discriminated significantly between Ep and nEp. Visually guided manual counting showed an almost significant difference independently in the 2 occipital electrodes. The ATD underestimated high frequencies and returned a too low mean frequency. This study shows that AWF is the best suited method for automatic assessment of the alpha frequency.

In this paper, event-related EEG oscillations to semantically related and unrelated pairs of words were studied in a group of 18 children with LD not otherwise specified (LD-NOS) and in 16 children with normal academic achievement. We propose that EEG oscillations may be different in LD NOS children versus normal control children that may explain some of the deficits observed in the LD-NOS group. The EEGs were recorded using the 10/20 system. EEG segments were edited by visual inspection 1000 ms before and after the stimulus, and only correct responses were considered in the analysis. Time-frequency (1-50 Hz) topographic maps were obtained for the increases and decreases of power after the event with respect to the pre-stimulus average values. Significant differences between groups were observed in the behavioral responses. LD-NOS children show less number of correct responses and more omissions and false alarms than the control group. The event-induced EEG responses showed significant differences between groups. The control group showed greater power increases in the frequencies 1-6 Hz than the LD-NOS group from 300 to 700 ms. These differences were mainly observed in frontal regions, both to related and non-related words. This was interpreted as a deficit in attention, both to internal and external events, deficits in activation of working memory and deficits in encoding and memory retrieval in the LD-NOS children. Differences between groups were also observed in the suppression of alpha and beta rhythms in the occipital regions to related words in frequencies between 8 and 17 Hz from 450 to 750 ms. LD-NOS children showed shorter durations of the decreases in power than the control group. These results suggest also deficits in attention and memory retrieval. It may be concluded that LD-NOS children showed physiological differences from normal children that may explain their cognitive deficiencies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The use of an approach, such as electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with tES, could allow for a more detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in these observed changes. Co-registration of tES and EEG might provide high temporal resolution information regarding tES-induced modifications/modulations to cortical activity that corresponds to different stages of processing. This article aims at presenting new knowledge about this recent and innovative approach that can possibly provide information about the dynamics of human brain functions beyond what is possible by the use of either method alone.

Coupling between Intrinsic Prefrontal HbO2 and Central EEG Beta Power Oscillations in the Resting Brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIOVASCULAR-SYSTEM; CONSCIOUS INTENTION; TIME; RHYTHMS; MODEL; STATE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY	There is increasing interest in the intrinsic activity in the resting brain, especially that of ultraslow and slow oscillations. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure (BP), respiration and heart rate recordings during 5 minutes of rest, combined with cross spectral and sliding cross correlation calculations, we identified a short-lasting coupling (duration approximate to 100 s) between prefrontal oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) in the frequency band between 0.07 and 0.13 Hz and central EEG alpha and/or beta power oscillations in 8 of the 9 subjects investigated. The HbO2 peaks preceded the EEG band power peaks by 3.7 s in 6 subjects, with moderate or no coupling between BP and HbO2 oscillations. HbO2 and EEG band power oscillations were approximately in phase with BP oscillations in the 2 subjects with an extremely high coupling (squared coherence >0.8) between BP and HbO2 oscillation. No coupling was identified in one subject. These results indicate that slow precentral (de) oxyhemoglobin concentration oscillations during awake rest can be temporarily coupled with EEG fluctuations in sensorimotor areas and modulate the excitability level in the brains' motor areas, respectively. Therefore, this provides support for the idea that resting state networks fluctuate with frequencies of between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz (Mantini et. al. PNAS 2007).

Tracking time-varying shifts in the oscillation modes of an evolving seizure may be useful for both seizure onset detection as well as for improved non-surgical interventions such as microstimulation. In this report we apply a multivariate eigendecomposition method to analyze the time-varying principal oscillation patterns (POPs, or eigenmodes) of maximally-independent (ICA) sources of intracranial EEG data recorded from subdural electrodes implanted in a human patient for evaluation of surgery for epilepsy. Our analysis of a subset of the most dynamically important eigenmodes reveals distinct shifts in characteristic frequency and damping time before, throughout, and following seizures providing insight into the dynamical structure of the system throughout seizure evolution.

Especially frequency analysis of EEG signal is the most preferred method to detect the migraine by using flash stimulation. Different flash stimulation frequencies at wide frequency range have been used in migraine detection. But the effects of these flash stimulation frequencies and the most effective frequency can be determined by analyzing these frequencies separately. Since each stimulation frequency has been implemented in different time periods, it is necessary to determine the time period to detect magnitude increase in migraine patients. The aim of this study is to determine the most effective flash stimulation frequency and time duration to detect the migraine. In this study, we analyzed the flash stimulation frequencies and time duration separately for detecting migraine. Performance of each flash stimulation frequency has been determined to detect the migraine by analyzing the power spectrums obtained under 2 Hz, 4 Hz and 6 Hz and artificial neural network has been used to determine the which data has a superior performance. Afterwards we analyzed the 2 s, 4 s, 6 s, 8 s and 10 s of flash stimulation periods separately by observing the power spectrums and the results are verified by using artificial neural network. As a result of this study we proposed the 4 Hz of flash stimulation frequency is the most effective frequency and 8 s time period is necessary to detect the migraine at the beta band of EEG's T5-T3 channel.

J	de Cheveigne, A				de Cheveigne, Alain			Quadratic component analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Magnetoencephalography; EEG; Electroencephalography; Noise reduction; Artifact removal; Principal component analysis		I present a method for analyzing multichannel recordings in response to repeated stimulus presentation. Quadratic Component Analysis (QCA) extracts responses that are stimulus-induced (triggered by the stimulus but not precisely locked in time), as opposed to stimulus-evoked (time-locked to the stimulus). Induced responses are often found in neural response data from magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), or multichannel electrophysiological and optical recordings. The instantaneous power of a linear combination of channels can be expressed as a weighted sum of instantaneous cross-products between channel waveforms. Based on this fact, a technique known as Denoising Source Separation (DSS) is used to find the most reproducible "quadratic component" (linear combination of cross-products). The linear component with a square most similar to this quadratic component is taken to approximate the most reproducible evoked activity. Projecting out the component and repeating the analysis allows multiple induced components to be extracted by deflation. The method is illustrated with synthetic data, as well as real MEG data. At unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios, it can reveal stimulus-induced activity that is invisible to other approaches such as time-frequency analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In principle, this may result in stimulus-locked periodicity in behavioral performance [6]. Here we considered this possible cross-modal impact of a sound for one of the best-characterized rhythms arising from the visual system, namely occipital alpha-oscillations (8-14 Hz) [7-9]. We presented brief sounds and concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and/or probed visual cortex excitability (phosphene perception) through occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In a first, TMS-only experiment, phosphene perception rate against time postsound showed a periodic pattern cycling at similar to 10 Hz phase-aligned to the sound. In a second, combined TMS-EEG experiment, TMS-trials reproduced the cyclical phosphene pattern and revealed a similar to 10 Hz pattern also for EEG-derived measures of occipital cortex reactivity to the TMS pulses. Crucially, EEG-data from intermingled trials without TMS established cross-modal phase-locking of occipitoparietal alpha oscillations. These independently recorded variables, i.e., occipital cortex excitability and reactivity and EEG phase dynamics, were significantly correlated. This shows that cross-modal phase locking of oscillatory visual cortex activity can arise in the human brain to affect perceptual and EEG measures of visual processing in a cyclical manner, consistent with occipital alpha oscillations underlying a rapid cycling of neural excitability in visual areas.

The traditional method of EEG analysis relies mostly on its visual inspection. Due to the fact that visual inspection is very subjective, several methods were proposed in order to quantify the information of the EEG. These methods include time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time-frequency methods. This work discusses the appropriateness of Time Frequency Analysis(TFA) to classify EEG signals for epileptic seizures and compares several methods for time frequency analysis. The methods are evaluated using three classification problems. The Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN) is used for classification of EEG segments. To the knowledge of authors, there exists no similar work in literature.	[Madhu, Aswathy; Jayasree, V.

Coherence, Phase Differences, Phase Shift, and Phase Lock in EEG/ERP Analyses	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY TASK; EEG COHERENCE; NONLINEAR INTERDEPENDENCE; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; STATE TRANSITIONS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; INFORMATION-FLOW; BRAIN STRUCTURES; VISUAL-CORTEX	Electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence is a mixture of phase locking interrupted by phase shifts in the spontaneous EEG. Average reference, Laplacian transforms, and independent component (ICA) reconstruction of time series can distort physiologically generated phase differences and invalidate the computation of coherence and phase differences as well as in the computation of directed coherence and phase reset. Time domain measures of phase shift and phase lock are less prone to artifact and are independent of volume conduction. Cross-frequency synchrony in the surface EEG and in Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) provides insights into dynamic functions of the brain.

Noradrenergic Neurons of the Locus Coeruleus Are Phase Locked to Cortical Up-Down States during Sleep	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						locus coeruleus; memory consolidation; neuromodulation; noradrenergic system; prefrontal cortex; sleep; slow oscillations	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; DENTATE GYRUS; ANESTHETIZED RATS; SPINDLE DENSITY; VISUAL-CORTEX	Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterized by periodic changes in cortical excitability that are reflected in the electroencephalography (EEG) as high-amplitude slow oscillations, indicative of cortical Up/Down states. These slow oscillations are thought to be involved in NREM sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Although the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system is known to play a role in off-line memory consolidation (that may occur during NREM sleep), cortico-coerulear interactions during NREM sleep have not yet been studied in detail. Here, we investigated the timing of LC spikes as a function of sleep-associated slow oscillations. Cortical EEG was monitored, along with activity of LC neurons recorded extracellularly, in nonanesthetized naturally sleeping rats. LC spike-triggered averaging of EEG, together with phase-locking analysis, revealed preferential firing of LC neurons along the ascending edge of the EEG slow oscillation, correlating with Down-to-Up state transition. LC neurons were locked best when spikes were shifted forward similar to 50 ms in time with respect to the EEG slow oscillation. These results suggest that during NREM sleep, firing of LC neurons may contribute to the rising phase of the EEG slow wave by providing a neuromodulatory input that increases cortical excitability, thereby promoting plasticity within these circuits.

Correlated components of ongoing EEG point to emotionally laden attention - a possible marker of engagement?	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; engagement; attention; canonical correlation analysis; brain reading	DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; CORTEX	Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests that cortical hemodynamic responses coincide in different subjects experiencing a common naturalistic stimulus. Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram( EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.

The methodology combines methods adapted from three complementary areas: time-frequency signal analysis, multichannel signal analysis and image processing. The latter three combine in a new methodology referred to as multichannel time-frequency image processing which is applied to the problem of classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities in both adults and newborns. A combination of signal related features and image related features are used by merging key instantaneous frequency descriptors which characterize the signal non-stationarities. The results obtained show that, firstly, the features based on time-frequency image processing techniques such as image segmentation, improve the performance of EEG abnormalities detection in the classification systems based on multi-SVM and neural network classifiers. Secondly, these discriminating features are able to better detect the correlation between newborn EEG signals in a multichannel-based newborn EEG seizure detection for the purpose of localizing EEG abnormalities on the scalp.

Synchronization of neuronal oscillations may regulate network communication and could thus serve as such a mechanism. Evidence for this hypothesis, however, was until recently sparse, as methodological challenges limit the investigation of interareal interactions with non-invasive magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) recordings. Nevertheless, recent advances in M/EEG source reconstruction and clustering methods support complete phase-interaction mappings that are essential for uncovering the large-scale neuronal assemblies and their functional roles. These data show that synchronization is a robust and behaviorally significant phenomenon in task-relevant cortical networks and could hence bind distributed neuronal processing to coherent cognitive states.

The slow performance of conventional BCI spellers is overcome by combining the fast motor evoked potentials (MEPs) with the accuracy of P300 event related potentials. The .mu rhythms associated with motor imagery are extracted using morlet wavalet based time-frequency analysis. Selected features were subsequently classified using minimum Mahalanobis distance. A hybrid MEP-P300 algorithm incorporating text prediction was proposed and experiments were conducted to gauge its accuracy and speed. Results show significantly faster performance when compared with conventional P300 spellers while comparable, but reduced accuracy was also noted.	[Roula, M.

This traditional approach represents sleep architecture in a static way, but it cannot reflect variations in sleep across time and across the cortex. To investigate these dynamic aspects of sleep, we analyzed sleep recordings in 14 healthy volunteers with a novel, frequency-based EEG analysis. This approach enabled comparison of sleep patterns with low inter-individual variability. We then implemented a new probability dependent, automatic classification of sleep states that agreed closely with conventional manual scoring during consolidated sleep. Furthermore, this analysis revealed a previously unrecognized, interhemispheric oscillation during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This quantitative approach provides a new way of examining the dynamic aspects of sleep, shedding new light on the physiology of human sleep.

Age-Related Changes in Time-Frequency Structure of Sleep Spindles in EEG in Rats with Genetic Predisposition to Absence Epilepsy (WAG/Rij)	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						sleep spindles; genetic model of absence epilepsy; age-dependent changes in EEG; rhythmic brain activity; time-frequency analysis of EEG; wavelet analysis; continuous wavelet transform	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; SEIZURES; FEATURES; MODELS	It is known that sleep spindles are produced by thalamo-cortical system spontaneously during the slow-wave sleep; pathological processes in thalamo-cortical network might cause absence epilepsy. The aim of this study was to examine age-dependent changes in time-frequency structure of sleep spindles in parallel to a progressive increase in amount of absence seizures in WAG/Rij rat model. EEG was consistently recorded at the age of 5, 7 and 9 months by means of epidural electrodes implanted in the frontal cortex. Continuous wavelet transform was used for automatic identification and further time-frequency analysis of sleep spindles in EEG. It was found that the mean duration of epileptic discharges and total duration of epileptic activity increased with age, whereas the length of sleep spindles decreased. Mean frequency of oscillations within a spindle was used as a criterion for dividing sleep spindles in three categories: "slow" (9.3 Hz), "transitional" (11.4 Hz) and "fast" (13.5 Hz). "Slow" and "transitional" spindles in 5-months animals displayed an increase in frequency from the beginning towards the end. It was shown that the higher incidence of epilepsy corresponded to the lower duration of sleep spindles (all types). Mean frequency of "transitional" and "fast" spindles was higher in rats with more intensive epileptic discharges. In general, high epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats corresponded to the most substantial changes within "transitional" spindles, whereas changes within slow and fast spindles were moderate.

Though hearing one's own name well has been studied, the relationship between hearing one's own name and self-awareness is not understood. In this study, we focused on brain responses to hearing one's own name. In order to assess the pattern of ERP and the power of EEG frequency during hearing one's own name, we used a passive oddball paradigm that included the subject's own name (SON). The grand average ERP showed that mismatch negativity and novelty p300 were elicited by SON. Time frequency analysis revealed that theta power and beta power were increased around 400-600 ms after stimulus by SON.

Individual Differences in EEG Spectral Power Reflect Genetic Variance in Gray and White Matter Volumes	TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Gray matter volume; white matter volume; electroencephalography; endophenotype; MRI; development	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN VOLUMES; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; HERITABILITY; INTELLIGENCE; ACTIVATION; ORGANIZATION; METAANALYSIS	The human electroencephalogram (EEG) consists of oscillations that reflect the summation of postsynaptic potentials at the dendritic tree of cortical neurons. The strength of the oscillations (EEG power) is a highly genetic trait that has been related to individual differences in many phenotypes, including intelligence and liability for psychopathology. Here, we investigated whether brain anatomy underlies these EEG power differences by correlating it to gray and white matter volumes (GMV, WMV), and additionally investigated whether this association can be attributed to genes or environmental factors. EEG was measured in a sample of 405 young adult twins and their siblings, and power in the theta (similar to 4 Hz), alpha (similar to 10 Hz), and beta (similar to 20 Hz) frequency bands determined. A subset of 121 subjects were also scanned in a 1.5 T MRI scanner, and gray and white matter volumes defined as the total of cortical and subcortical volumes, excluding cerebellum. Both MRI-based volumes and EEG power spectra were highly heritable. GMV and WMV correlated .25 to .29 with EEG power for the slower oscillations (theta, alpha). Moreover, these phenotypic correlations largely reflected genetic covariation, irrespective of oscillation frequency and volume type. Genetic correlations (.31 < r(A) < .43) revealed that only moderate proportions of the heritable variance overlapped between MRI volumes and EEG power. The results suggest that MRI volumes and EEG power share genetic sources of variation, which may reflect such processes as myelination, synaptic density, and dendritic outgrowth.	[Smit, Dirk J.

However, given that the coordination of neuronal processes in time represents an essential aspect of practically all cognitive operations, it might be strongly affected in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study we aimed at quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in patients (18 with schizophrenia: 3 with schizoaffective disorder) and 28 healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. Ongoing neuronal oscillations were recorded with multi-channel EEG at rest condition. LRTC in the range 5-50 s were analyzed with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The amplitude of neuronal oscillations in alpha and beta frequency ranges did not differ between patients and control subjects. However, LRTC were strongly attenuated in patients with schizophrenia in both alpha and beta frequency ranges. Moreover, the cross-frequency correlation between LRTC belonging to alpha and beta oscillations was stronger for patients than healthy controls, indicating that similar neurophysiological processes affect neuronal dynamics in both frequency ranges. We believe that the attenuation of LRTC is most likely due to the increased variability in neuronal activity, which was previously hypothesized to underlie an excessive switching between the neuronal states in patients with schizophrenia. Attenuated LRTC might allow for more random associations between neuronal activations, which in turn might relate to the occurrence of thought disorders in schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We introduce a multivariate approach to EEG analysis with which we can perform a comprehensive search for the neural correlate of dynamics predicted by accumulator models. We show that the dynamics of evidence accumulation are most strongly correlated with ramping of oscillatory power in the 4-9 Hz theta band over the course of a trial, although it also correlates with oscillatory power in other frequency bands. The rate of power decrease in the theta band correlates with individual differences in the parameters of drift diffusion models fitted to individuals' behavioral data.	[van Vugt, M.

This research highlights the merging of two major detection algorithms for the identification of High-Frequency Oscillations (HFO), also known as ripples, and Interictal Spikes (IIS) in both the spatial and temporal domain. IIS and HFO have become recognized as reliable biomarkers in identification of the epileptic focus in the cortex of epileptic patients. While IIS, commonly referred to as spikes, have classically been used for the diagnosis of epilepsy and for source localization techniques, ripples have been associated with more generalized cortex regions of interest and surrogate biomarkers for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This research aims to combine these two analyses by correlating HFO and IIS events in the time domain for each electrode recording with the goal of yielding a more complete understanding of the abnormal electrical activity of the cortex in epileptic patients. Results are offered in the form HFO and IIS events per electrode as well as a surface representation of the number of temporally superimposed HFO and IIS per electrode.

Methodological problems on quantifying functional connectivity with PS analysis have been investigated extensively, but some of them have not been fully solved yet. For example, how long a segment of EEG signal should be used in estimating PS index? Which methods are more suitable to infer the significant level of estimated PS index? To address these questions, this paper performs an intensive computation study on PS analysis based on surrogate tests with 1) artificial surrogate data generated by shuffling the rank order, the phase spectra, or the instantaneous frequency of original EEG signals, and 2) intersubject EEG pairs under the assumption that the EEG signals of different subjects are independent. Results show that 1) the phase-shuffled surrogate method is workable for significance test of estimated PS index and yields results similar to those by intersubject EEG surrogate test; 2) generally, a duration of EEG waves covering about 3 similar to 16 cycles is suitable for PS analysis; and 3) the PS index based on mean phase coherence is more suitable for PS analysis of EEG signals recorded at relatively low sampling rate.

However, these measures are conventionally limited to the motor cortex and recorded from peripheral muscles. This represents a significant limitation when non-motor neurophysiological processes are of primary interest. In the last several years, TMS has been combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to derive such measures directly from the cortex. Initial studies demonstrated that meaningful recordings could be derived without being substantially affected by TMS stimulus artifact due to advancements in EEG amplifier technology. Subsequently, TMS measures of cortical excitability were reliably recorded and found to be related with more conventional TMS electromyography recordings of excitability in the cortex. More recently, other key neurophysiological indices including cortical inhibition and interhemispheric connectivity have also been reported. In this article, such findings will be reviewed and their importance discussed vis a vis healthy and disease states. We will conclude by highlighting the limitations of this work and discuss their potential future applications as a biomarker of disease states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mechanism of SPS in multistable perception has not yet been determined. Although early psychological studies suggested that SPS may be caused by fatigue or satiation of orientation, the neural mechanism of SPS is still unknown. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that the dorsal attention network (DAN), which mainly controls voluntary attention, is involved in bistable perception of the Necker cube. To determine whether neural dynamics along the DAN cause SPS, we performed simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI during an SPS task with the Necker cube, with every SPS reported by pressing a button. This EEG-fMRI integrated analysis showed that (a) 3-4 Hz spectral EEG power modulation at fronto-central, parietal, and centro-parietal electrode sites sequentially appeared from 750 to 350 ms prior to the button press; and (b) activations correlating with the EEG modulation traveled along the DAN from the frontal to the parietal regions. These findings suggest that slow oscillation initiates SPS through global dynamics along the attentional system such as the DAN.

Neurophysiological and behavioral effects of a 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T magnetic field in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Time-varying magnetic field; 60 Hz; Human; Electroencephalography; Tremor; Standing balance	BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; DOMAIN CHARACTERISTICS; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; DYSTONIC SYNDROMES; RESTING EEG; EXPOSURE; HYPERSENSITIVITY; RESPONSES	The effects of time-varying magnetic fields (MF) on humans have been actively investigated for the past three decades. One important unanswered question is the potential for MF exposure to have acute effects on human biology. Different strategies have been used to tackle this question using various physiological, neurophysiological and behavioral indicators. For example, researchers investigating electroencephalography (EEG) have reported that extremely low frequency (ELF, < 300 Hz) MF can increase resting occipital alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). Interestingly, other studies have demonstrated that human motricity can be modulated by ELF MF: a reduction of anteroposterior standing balance or a decrease of physiological tremor intensity have been reported as consequences of exposure. However, the main limitation in this domain lies in the lack of results replication, possibly originating from the large variety of experimental approaches employed. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T MF exposure on neurophysiological (EEG) and neuromotor (standing balance, voluntary motor function, and physiological tremor) aspects in humans using a single experimental procedure. Though results from this study suggest a reduction of human standing balance with MF exposure, as well as an increase of physiological tremor amplitude within the frequency range associated with central nervous system contribution, no exposure effect appeared on other investigated parameters (e.g., EEG or voluntary motor control). These results suggest that 1 h of 60 Hz, 1,800 mu T MF exposure may modulate human involuntary motor control without being detected in the cortical electrical activity.

Time-frequency representation (TFR) is a proper tool for such non-stationary signals. In the present paper, TFR-based quantitative methods that can translate complicated and subjective waveform-based EEG analysis into objective measures are introduced to characterize EEG recorded from normal subjects and cerebral infarction (CI) patients. Relative frequency band energy (RFBE) is computed from time-frequency plane for the five subbands: delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Moreover, we propose the Shannon entropy (SE) of TFR to detect the difference in EEG for the two kinds of subjects. Finally, the temporal evolutions of these quantitative parameters are presented to trace EEG changes. The experiment results show that CI results in the RFBE changes of the five rhythms; however, the RFBEs of some rhythms have stronger association with CI. Increase in EEG SE of CI patients is obvious. The time evolutions of RFBE and SE as valuable objective measures can be displayed in real time and be used as helpful references in detection and monitoring of CI.

It is explained why electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an ideal tool to study spontaneous brain activity such as spontaneously occurring interictal epileptic discharges, typical sleep graphoelements, or characteristic EEG oscillations. This is closely related to resting state brain activity in healthy subjects and has been studied via analysis of spontaneous neuronal oscillations and their fMRI correlates. The application of EEG/fMRI to disease, with epilepsy as the primary example, is reviewed. It starts from the original goal, the identification of the region of the brain in which interictal epileptic activity arises, moves on to studies not in line with this idea but introducing the new concept that fMRI maps may reflect entire epileptic networks, and finally to the clinical applicability of EEG/fMRI patient studies and publications suggesting the method may provide insight into the neurobiology of epilepsy. The chapter concludes with a look into the future: intracranial EEG/fMRI.

Such investigations have been limited, however, by quantifying only event-related potential peaks and/or broad frequency bands at limited scalp locations without considering possible mediating factors (e.g., baseline differences). Results from 64-sensor EEG collected in 180 age- and gender-matched participants reveal (i) accentuated prestimulus gamma oscillations and (ii) reduced P2 amplitudes and theta/alpha oscillations to S1 among participants with both SZ and BPP. Conversely, (iii) N1s in those with SZ to S1 were reduced compared to healthy volunteers and those with BPP, whereas (iv) beta range oscillations 200300?ms following S2 were accentuated in those with BPP but not those with SZ. Results reveal a pattern of both unique and shared neurophysiological phenotypes occurring within major psychotic diagnoses.

Three time-frequency techniques were deployed for the analysis of the EEG signal: Choi-Williams distribution (CWD), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Polysomnographic recordings from sixteen subjects were used in this study and features were extracted from the time-frequency representation of the EEG signal using Renyi's entropy. The classification of the extracted features was done using random forest classifier. The performance of the new approach was tested by evaluating the accuracy and the kappa coefficient for the three time-frequency distributions: CWD, CWT, and HHT. The CWT time-frequency distribution outperformed the other two distributions and showed excellent performance with an accuracy of 0.83 and a kappa coefficient of 0.76. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Studies employing these advanced techniques revealed that synchronization of oscillatory responses in the beta- and gamma-band is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, routing of signals across distributed cortical networks, sensory-motor integration, working memory, and perceptual awareness. Here, we review evidence that certain brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's are associated with abnormal neural synchronization. The data suggest close correlations between abnormalities in neuronal synchronization and cognitive dysfunctions, emphasizing the importance of temporal coordination. Thus, a focused search for abnormalities in temporal patterning may be of considerable clinical relevance.

Density and Frequency Caudo-Rostral Gradients of Sleep Spindles Recorded in the Human Cortex	SLEEP			English	Article						Sleep spindles; human; stereo-electro-encephalography; intra-cortical recording; frequency and density analysis	THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; CONNECTIONS; EEG; PROJECTIONS; EPILEPSY; HZ	Study Objective: This study aims at providing a quantitative description of intrinsic spindle frequency and density (number of spindles/min) in cortical areas using deep intracerebral recordings in humans. Patients or Participants: Thirteen patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy and investigated through deep intracortical EEG in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, insular, and limbic cortices including the hippocampus were included. Methods: Spindle waves were detected from the ongoing EEG during slow wave sleep (SWS) by performing a time-frequency analysis on filtered signals (band-pass filter: 10-16 Hz). Then, spindle intrinsic frequency was determined using a fast Fourier transform, and spindle density (number of spindles per minute) was computed. Results: Firstly, we showed that sleep spindles were recorded in all explored cortical areas, except temporal neocortex. In particular, we observed the presence of spindles during SWS in areas such as the insular cortex, medial parietal cortex, occipital cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Secondly, we demonstrated that both spindle frequency and density smoothly change along the caudo-rostral axis, from fast frequent posterior spindles to slower and less frequent anterior spindles. Thirdly, we identified the presence of spindle frequency oscillations in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Conclusions: Spindling activity is widespread among cortical areas, which argues for the fundamental role of spindles in cortical functions. Mechanisms of caudo-rostral gradient modulation in spindle frequency and density may result from a complex interplay of intrinsic properties and extrinsic modulation of thalamocortical and corticothalamic neurons.

These rhythms are readily observed using electroencephalography (EEG). Clinical EEG data shows that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) alters these rhythms. Researchers have developed lumped parameter neural mass models (NMM) that can reproduce these various brain rhythms. This paper proposes an NMM based computational model of mild TBI that recreates the clinical EEG changes observed after injury. Specifically, the focus is on recreating changes observed after TBI in the 8-12 Hz alpha and the 4-8Hz theta frequency ranges. Mild TBI is simulated by increasing membrane reactivity and by decreasing synaptic connectivity in the NMM. These results indicate that clinically observed EEG changes with mild TBI are likely due to traumatic synaptic disruption and that with appropriate data, EEG may be used to quantify the extent of TBI in the future.

Analysis of cross-correlations in electroencephalogram signals as an approach to proactive diagnosis of schizophrenia	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Flicker-noise spectroscopy; Frequency-phase synchronization; Cross-correlations; Electroencephalogram signals; Schizophrenia	FLICKER-NOISE SPECTROSCOPY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	We apply flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS), a time series analysis method operating on structure functions and power spectrum estimates, to study the clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded in children/adolescents (11 to 14 years of age) with diagnosed schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms at the National Center for Psychiatric Health (NCPH) of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The EEG signals for these subjects were compared with the signals for a control sample of chronically depressed children/adolescents. The purpose of the study is to look for diagnostic signs of subjects' susceptibility to schizophrenia in the FNS parameters for specific electrodes and cross-correlations between the signals simultaneously measured at different points on the scalp. Our analysis of EEG signals from scalp-mounted electrodes at locations F-3 and F-4, which are symmetrically positioned in the left and right frontal areas of cerebral cortex, respectively, demonstrates an essential role of frequency-phase synchronization, a phenomenon representing specific correlations between the characteristic frequencies and phases of excitations in the brain. We introduce quantitative measures of frequency-phase synchronization and systematize the values of FNS parameters for the EEG data. The comparison of our results with the medical diagnoses for 84 subjects performed at NCPH makes it possible to group the EEG signals into 4 categories corresponding to different risk levels of subjects' susceptibility to schizophrenia. We suggest that the introduced quantitative characteristics and classification of cross-correlations may be used for the diagnosis of schizophrenia at the early stages of its development.

This is a novel and important time-frequency approach to study the phase coupling between two or more different spatially recorded entities with non-stationary characteristics. The basic method includes a cross-spectral analysis to study the phase synchrony of non-stationary signals, and relies on some properties of the MST, such as phase preservation. We demonstrate the usefulness of the technique using simulated examples and real newborn EEG data. The results show the advantage of using the cross-MST in the study of the connectivity between different signals using the time-frequency coherence. The MST led to improvements in resolution of almost twofold over the standard S-Transform in the examples presented in the article.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been successfully applied to event related electroencephalography (EEG) to decompose it into a sum of spatially fixed and temporally independent components that can be attributed to underlying cortical activity. A major problem in the application of ICA is the stability of estimated independent components. In this paper we exploited the split-half approach to assess component stability. We used different measures quantifying both phase and energy aspects of the ERP, in order to distinguish evoked from induced oscillations. We applied these measures to the stable independent components derived from a dataset of progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (PMCI) and elderly controls. We found reduced energy in the induced theta activity in PMCI subjects, in accordance with previous studies. In addition, PMCI subjects presented lower phase-locking values and diminished late alpha band energy in contrast to controls.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used as measures of error processing, two such response-locked ERPs being the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error-related positivity (Pe). The ERN and Pe occur following committed error in reaction time tasks as low frequency (4-8 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations registered at the midline fronto-central sites. We created an alternative method for analyzing error processing using time-frequency analysis in the form of a wavelet transform. A study was conducted in which subjects with PTSD and healthy control completed a forced-choice task. Single trial EEG data from errors in the task were processed using a continuous wavelet transform. Coefficients from the transform that corresponded to the theta range were averaged to isolate a theta waveform in the time-frequency domain. Measures called the time-frequency ERN and Pe were obtained from these waveforms for five different channels and then averaged to obtain a single time-frequency ERN and Pe for each error trial. A comparison of the amplitude and latency for the time-frequency ERN and Pe between the PTSD and control group was performed. A significant group effect was found on the amplitude of both measures. These results indicate that the developed single trial time-frequency error analysis method is suitable for examining error processing in PTSD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.

After providing a comprehensive time-domain definition of the various forms of connectivity observed in MV processes, we particularize them to MV autoregressive (MVAR) processes and derive the corresponding frequency-domain measures. Then, we discuss the theoretical interpretation of these MVAR-based connectivity measures, showing that each of them reflects a specific time-domain connectivity definition and how this results in the description of peculiar aspects of the information transfer in MV processes. Furthermore, issues related to the practical utilization of these measures on real-time series are pointed out, including MVAR model estimation and significance assessment. Finally, limitations and pitfalls arising from model mis-specification are discussed, indicating possible solutions and providing practical recommendations for a safe computation of the connectivity measures. An example of estimation of the presented measures from multiple EEG signals recorded during a combined visuomotor task is also reported, showing how evaluation of coupling and causality in the frequency domain may help describing specific neurophysiological mechanisms.

In the present study, the role of oscillations in the upper alpha-band (12 Hz) was investigated during a change-detection test of short-term visual memory. If alpha oscillations arise from a purely inhibitory process, higher alpha power before sample stimulus presentation would be expected to correlate with poorer performance. Instead, participants with faster reaction-times showed stronger alpha power before the sample stimulus in frontal and posterior regions. Additionally, faster participants showed stronger alpha desynchronization after the stimulus in a group of right frontal and left posterior electrodes. The same pattern of electrodes showed stronger alpha with higher working-memory load, so that when more items were processed, alpha power desynchronized faster after the stimulus. During memory maintenance, alpha power was greater when more items were held in memory, likely due to a faster resynchronization. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of suppression of alpha power by stimulus presentation is an important factor for successfully encoding visual stimuli. The data are also consistent with a role for alpha as actively participating in attentional processes.

Previous studies have identified an increase in beta-gamma oscillatory activity after the processing of positive feedback stimuli but the functional role of this electroencephalographic (EEG) correlate remains unclear. In the present study, we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and trial-by-trial wavelet-based time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal to investigate the effects of expectancy and magnitude of positive and negative feedbacks associated with monetary gains and losses in a gambling task. Large increase of beta-gamma oscillatory activity only in unexpected monetary gains was observed, irrespective of its magnitude. Based on recent findings we propose that this increase in betagamma oscillatory activity might reflect a general cognitive mechanism in charge of monitoring unexpected positive events based on feedback processing.

However, the effects of TBS on neuronal oscillations remain unclear. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate changes of neuronal oscillations after continuous TBS (cTBS), the protocol that emulates long-term depression (LTD) form of synaptic plasticity. We randomly divided 26 healthy humans into two groups receiving either Active or Sham cTBS as control over the left primary motor cortex (M1). Post-cTBS aftereffects were assessed with behavioural measurements at rest using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and at active state during the execution of a choice reaction time (RT) task in combination with continuous electrophysiological recordings. The cTBS-induced EEG oscillations were assessed using event-related power (ERPow), which reflected regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies of theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-9.5 Hz), mu (10-12.5 Hz), low beta (13-19.5 Hz), and high beta (20-30 Hz) brain rhythms. Results revealed 20-min suppression of MEPs and at least 30-min increase of ERPow modulation, suggesting that besides MEPs, EEG has the potential to provide an accurate cortical readout to assess cortical excitability and to investigate the interference of cortical oscillations in the human brain post-cTBS. We also observed a predominant modulation of beta frequency band, supporting the hypothesis that cTBS acts more on cortical level. Theta oscillations were also modulated during rest implying the involvement of independent cortical theta generators over the motor network post cTBS. This work provided more insights into the underlying mechanisms of cTBS, providing a possible link between synchronised neural oscillations and LTD in humans.

Age-Related Changes in the Energy and Spectral Composition of EEG	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography; power spectral density; energy; aging; normal values		Age-related changes in the EEG energy and spectral composition were examined in 17,722 healthy subjects (truck drivers), 20 to 70 years old. Linear correlations between age vs global EEG energy and spectral powers (SPs) of EEG frequency ranges were estimated by linear regression analysis. Significant dependences of the global EEG energy and SPs of all EEG rhythms on age (age-related decreases) were found (most significant for the alpha range). An age-related decline of the EEG energy may be, in part, explained by age-related generalized brain atrophy and increased thickness of the scalp. While similarity measures show an age-related decrease of the correlation between different sources of EEG, activity phase cancellation should also be taken into account. Smaller decreases in the absolute SPs of the beta and gamma ranges together with a general drop in the overall EEG power result in a trend toward relatively higher normalized representation of these frequency components with aging. The highest significance of decline in the alpha range can be related to a slowing oscillation frequency of alpha generators toward the theta band.

Pairwise electrode wavelet coherence is calculated over each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). For comparing the synchronization fraction of 2 EEG signals, a wavelet coherence fraction is proposed which is defined as the fraction of the signal time during which the wavelet coherence value is above a certain threshold. A one-way analysis of variance test shows a set of statistically significant differences in wavelet coherence between AD and controls. The wavelet coherence method is effective for studying cortical connectivity at a high temporal resolution. Compared with other conventional AD coherence studies, this study takes into account the time-frequency changes in coherence of EEG signals and thus provides more correlational details. A set of statistically significant differences was found in the wavelet coherence among AD and controls. In particular, temporocentral regions show a significant decrease in wavelet coherence in AD in the delta band, and the parietal and central regions show significant declines in cortical connectivity with most of their neighbors in the theta and alpha bands. This research shows that wavelet coherence can be used as a powerful tool to differentiate between healthy elderly individuals and probable AD patients.

J	Shou, GF; Ding, L; Dasari, D				Shou, Guofa; Ding, Lei; Dasari, Deepika			Probing neural activations from continuous EEG in a real-world task: Time-frequency independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Data-driven method; EEG; Time-frequency independent component analysis; Air traffic control task	SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; MENTAL FATIGUE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; STIMULATION; INCREASES; RHYTHMS; CORTEX	It is of fundamental significance to study human brain functions using neuroimaging technologies, such as electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in real-world tasks. The present study explores the feasibility of using EEG to identify networked brain activations when subjects perform a realistic task. To robustly identify physiologically plausible EEG patterns related to brain activations involved in the task, a novel data-driven method, i.e., time-frequency independent component analysis (tfICA), is developed to analyze high-density EEG data, which combines the time-frequency analysis and complex-valued ICA method. Six classes of independent components (ICs) of various spatio-temporal-spectral patterns were identified across subjects, relating to frontal, motor, premotor, supplementary motor, secondary somatosensory, and occipital cortices, which suggest a networked brain activation involving visual perception and processing, movement planning and execution, working memory, performance monitoring, and decision making to accomplish the task. Our results indicate that temporal patterns of these ICs are consistent, show causal relationship among them, and of significant correlation to behavioral performance data recorded in same task sessions. Furthermore, the time-on-task effect that indicates the phenomenon of mental fatigue in sustained tasks for a long duration (i.e., 1 h) was observed. The present study demonstrates the capability of the tfICA method in distinguishing various brain processes from continuous EEG data obtained in a realistic task and it is thus promising to address real-world problems, such as time-on-task fatigue.

Due to their nonstationary and multi-component nature, newborn EEG seizures are better represented in the joint time-frequency domain than in either the time domain or the frequency domain. Characterising newborn EEG seizure nonstationarities helps to better understand their time-varying nature and, therefore, allow developing efficient signal processing methods for both modelling and seizure detection and classification. In this article, we used the instantaneous frequency (IF) extracted from a time-frequency distribution to characterise newborn EEG seizures. We fitted four frequency modulated (FM) models to the extracted IFs, namely a linear FM, a piecewise-linear FM, a sinusoidal FM, and a hyperbolic FM. Using a database of 30-s EEG seizure epochs acquired from 35 newborns, we were able to show that, depending on EEG channel, the sinusoidal and piecewise-linear FM models best fitted 80-98% of seizure epochs. To further characterise the EEG seizures, we calculated the mean frequency and frequency span of the extracted IFs. We showed that in the majority of the cases (>95%), the mean frequency resides in the 0.6-3 Hz band with a frequency span of 0.2-1 Hz. In terms of the frequency of occurrence of the four seizure models, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference (p = 0.332) between the two hemispheres. The results also indicate that there is no significant differences between the two hemispheres in terms of the mean frequency (p = 0.186) and the frequency span (p = 0.302).

A further specification of the functional role of gamma oscillations in language comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						language comprehension; prediction; semantic unification; neuronal oscillations; network dynamics; gamma; theta; EEG	THETA-POWER INCREASES; NEURONAL COMMUNICATION; EEG COHERENCE; MEMORY; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; UNIFICATION; MECHANISMS; RETRIEVAL	Gamma-band neuronal synchronization during sentence-level language comprehension has previously been linked with semantic unification. Here, we attempt to further narrow down the functional significance of gamma during language comprehension, by distinguishing between two aspects of semantic unification: successful integration of word meaning into the sentence context, and prediction of upcoming words. We computed event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency band-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) power changes while participants read sentences that contained a critical word (CW) that was (1) both semantically congruent and predictable (high doze, HC), (2) semantically congruent but unpredictable (low cloze, LC), or (3) semantically incongruent (and therefore also unpredictable; semantic violation, SV). The ERR analysis showed the expected parametric N400 modulation (HC < LC < SV). The time-frequency analysis showed qualitatively different results. In the gamma-frequency range, we observed a power increase in response to the CW in the HC condition, but not in the LC and the SV conditions. Additionally, in the theta frequency range we observed a power increase in the SV condition only. Our data provide evidence that gamma power increases are related to the predictability of an upcoming word based on the preceding sentence context, rather than to the integration of the incoming word's semantics into the preceding context. Further, our theta band data are compatible with the notion that theta band synchronization in sentence comprehension might be related to the detection of an error in the language input.

Event-related EEG time-frequency analysis and the Orienting Reflex to auditory stimuli	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Orienting Reflex (OR); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Time; frequency analysis; Habituation	RESTING-STATE AROUSAL; HABITUATION; PARADIGM; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; INDEXES	Sokolov's classic works discussed electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha desynchronization as a measure of the Orienting Reflex (OR). Early studies confirmed that this reduced with repeated auditory stimulation, but without reliable stimulus-significance effects. We presented an auditory habituation series with counterbalanced indifferent and significant (counting) instructions. Timefrequency analysis of electrooculogram (EOG)-corrected EEG was used to explore prestimulus levels and the timing and amplitude of event-related increases and decreases in 4 classic EEG bands. Decrement over trials and response recovery were substantial for the transient increase (in delta, theta, and alpha) and subsequent desynchronization (in theta, alpha, and beta). There was little evidence of dishabituation and few effects of counting. Expected effects in stimulus-induced alpha desynchronization were confirmed. Two EEG response patterns over trials and conditions, distinct from the full OR pattern, warrant further research.

Although incentive motivations are proposed to increase our limited visual working memory (VWM) capacity, much less is known about the effects of subjective preferences on VWM-related brain systems, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices. Here, we investigate the differences in VWM capacities and brain activities during presentation of preferred and non-preferred colors. To this end, we used time-frequency (TF) analyses of electroencephalograph (EEG) data recorded during a delayed-response task. Behavioral results showed that the individual VWM capacities of preferred colors were significantly higher than those of non-preferred colors. The EEG results showed that the frontal theta and beta amplitudes for maintenance of preferred colors were higher than those of non-preferred colors. Interestingly, the frontal beta amplitudes were consistent with recent EEG recordings of the effects of reward on VWM systems, in that they were strongly and individually correlated with increasing VWM capacities from non-preferred to preferred colors. These results suggest that subjective preferences affect VWM systems in a similar manner to reward-incentive motivations.

Automatic artefact removal in a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface system	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENTS	Background: A novel artefact removal algorithm is proposed for a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This hybrid system combines a self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a virtual keyboard. To select a letter, the user must gaze at the target for at least a specific period of time (dwell time) and then activate the BCI by performing a mental task. Unfortunately, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often contaminated with artefacts. Artefacts change the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade the BCI's performance. Methods: To remove artefacts in EEG signals, the proposed algorithm uses the stationary wavelet transform combined with a new adaptive thresholding mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and other artefact handling/removal methods, semi-simulated EEG signals (i.e., real EEG signals mixed with simulated artefacts) and real EEG signals obtained from seven participants are used. For real EEG signals, the hybrid BCI system's performance is evaluated in an online-like manner, i.e., using the continuous data from the last session as in a real-time environment. Results: With semi-simulated EEG signals, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves lower signal distortion in both time and frequency domains. With real EEG signals, we demonstrate that for dwell time of 0.0s, the number of false-positives/minute is 2 and the true positive rate (TPR) achieved by the proposed algorithm is 44.7%, which is more than 15.0% higher compared to other state-of-the-art artefact handling methods. As dwell time increases to 1.0s, the TPR increases to 73.1%. Conclusions: The proposed artefact removal algorithm greatly improves the BCI's performance. It also has the following advantages: a) it does not require additional electrooculogram/electromyogram channels, long data segments or a large number of EEG channels, b) it allows real-time processing, and c) it reduces signal distortion.

Adaptive estimation of EEG-rhythms for optimal band identification in BCI	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG classification; Time-frequency analysis; Adaptive estimation; BCI	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	The amplitude of EEG mu-rhythm is large when the subject does not perform or imagine movement and attenuates when the subject either performs or imagines movement. The knowledge of EEG individual frequency components in the time-domain provides useful insight into the classification process. Identification of subject-specific reactive band is crucial for accurate event classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This work develops a simple time-frequency decomposition method for EEG rhythm by adaptive modeling. With the time-domain decomposition of the signal, subject-specific reactive band identification method is proposed. Study is conducted on 30 subjects for optimal band selection for four movement classes. Our results show that over 93% the subjects have an optimal band and selection of this band improves the relative power spectral density by 200% with respect to normalized power.

The major goal of the present study was to apply principal component analysis to the wake electroencephalographic (EEG) spectrum in order to establish an objective measure of sleepiness. The present analysis was led by the hypothesis that in sleep-deprived individuals, the time course of self-rated sleepiness correlates with the time course score on the 2nd principal component of the EEG spectrum. The resting EEG of 15 young subjects was recorded at 2-h intervals for 32-50 h. Principal component analysis was performed on the sets of 16 single-Hz log-transformed EEG powers (1-16 Hz frequency range). The time course of self-perceived sleepiness correlated strongly with the time course of the 2nd principal component score, irrespective of derivation (frontal or occipital) and of analyzed section of the 7-min EEG record (2-min section with eyes open or any of the five 1-min sections with eyes closed). This result indicates the possibility of deriving an objective index of physiological sleepiness by applying principal component analysis to the wake EEG spectrum.

We used a trial-by-trial wavelet-based time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal to provide amplitude and inter-site phase synchrony measures from 30 electrodes in theta (4-8 Hz, 350-500 ms), alpha (8-12 Hz, 100-200 ms), beta (13-25 Hz, 100-200 ms), and gamma (30-40 Hz, 350-450 ms) time-frequency ranges. Oscillatory amplitude and inter-site phase synchrony were both greater following loss signals as compared to gain signals in theta, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Low Att-Imp subjects had higher theta activity within a 350-500 ms time window over frontocentral, and centroparietal sites than high Att-Imp subjects. Monetary gain signals elicited higher theta and gamma activities in high Att-Imp individuals and loss signals elicited higher activities to loss signals in low Att-Imp individuals. Good learners showed enhanced intrahemispheric theta synchrony between frontoparietal, and fronto-occipital sites to monetary loss compared to gain signals. In good learners, monetary loss produced an increase of gamma synchrony that enhanced in the second stage of learning. In low Att-Imp individuals, there was a reduction of theta synchrony during the second stage, as compared with the first stage of learning, between temporal, parietal and fronto-parietal brain regions. These findings may offer valuable clues to understand outcome processing, attentional impulsivity, and learning ability. We propose that the punishment-related theta and gamma waves play a leading role in learning process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we hypothesize that this interaction may direct adjustments in perception and action via the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We recorded EEG while participants performed an arrow flanker task with monetary gain or loss as arbitrary reward feedback between trials. As predicted, we found a reduction in conflict-driven adaptation for trials in which conflict was followed by monetary gain (vs. monetary loss), a behavioral effect accompanied by a modulation in early visual processing related to the processing of the distracters. Moreover, time-frequency analyses showed that ongoing fronto-central theta oscillations induced by previous conflict sustained longer after loss than after gain, an interaction presumably reflecting ACC modulation. These data provide a first important step toward understanding the neural mechanism underlying the affective regulation of conflict-driven behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Characterising the dynamics of EEG waveforms as the path through parameter space of a neural mass model: Application to epilepsy seizure evolution	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural mass model; Nonlinear parameter estimation; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Time-domain estimation; Bifurcation analysis; Nonlinear dynamics	MEAN-FIELD MODEL; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES; FREQUENCY; INHIBITION; TRANSITION; ONSET	In this paper we propose that the dynamic evolution of EEG activity during epileptic seizures may be characterised as a path through parameter space of a neural mass model, reflecting gradual changes in underlying physiological mechanisms. Previous theoretical studies have shown how boundaries in parameter space of the model (so-called bifurcations) correspond to transitions in EEG waveforms between apparently normal, spike and wave and subsequently poly-spike and wave activity. In the present manuscript, we develop a multi-objective genetic algorithm that can estimate parameters of an underlying model from clinical data recordings. A standard approach to this problem is to transform both clinical data and model output into the frequency domain and then choose parameters that minimise the difference in their respective power spectra. Instead in the present manuscript, we estimate parameters in the time domain, their choice being determined according to the best fit obtained between the model output and specific features of the observed EEG waveform. This results in an approximate path through the bifurcation plane of the model obtained from clinical data. We present comparisons of such paths through parameter space from separate seizures from an individual subject, as well as between different subjects. Differences in the path reflect subtleties of variation in the dynamics of EEG, which at present appear indistinguishable using standard clinical techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, one factor that has limited practical applications for EEG-based BCI so far is the difficulty to decode brain signals in a reliable and efficient way. This paper proposes a new robust processing framework for decoding of multi-class motor imagery (MI) that is based on five main processing steps. (i) Raw EEG segmentation without the need of visual artifact inspection. (ii) Considering that EEG recordings are often contaminated not just by electrooculography (EOG) but also other types of artifacts, we propose to first implement an automatic artifact correction method that combines regression analysis with independent component analysis for recovering the original source signals. (iii) The significant difference between frequency components based on event-related (de-) synchronization and sample entropy is then used to find noncontiguous discriminating rhythms. After spectral filtering using the discriminating rhythms, a channel selection algorithm is used to select only relevant channels. (iv) Feature vectors are extracted based on the inter-class diversity and time-varying dynamic characteristics of the signals. (v) Finally, a support vector machine is employed for four-class classification. We tested our proposed algorithm on experimental data that was obtained from dataset 2a of BCI competition IV (2008). The overall four-class kappa values (between 0.41 and 0.80) were comparable to other models but without requiring any artifact-contaminated trial removal. The performance showed that multi-class MI tasks can be reliably discriminated using artifact-contaminated EEG recordings from a few channels. This may be a promising avenue for online robust EEG-based BCI applications.

The current experiment goes beyond previous work in this domain by addressing two thus far unanswered questions. First, how general is neural entrainment to environmental rhythms: Can neural oscillations be entrained by temporal dynamics of ongoing rhythmic stimuli with-out abrupt onsets? Second, does neural entrainment optimize performance of the perceptual system: Does human auditory perception benefit from neural phase reorganization? In a human electroencephalography study, listeners detected short gaps distributed uniformly with respect to the phase angle of a 3-Hz frequency-modulated stimulus. Listeners' ability to detect gaps in the frequency-modulated sound was not uniformly distributed in time, but clustered in certain preferred phases of the modulation. Moreover, the optimal stimulus phase was individually determined by the neural delta oscillation entrained by the stimulus. Finally, delta phase predicted behavior better than stimulus phase or the event-related potential after the gap. This study demonstrates behavioral benefits of phase realignment in response to frequency-modulated auditory stimuli, overall suggesting that frequency fluctuations in natural environmental input provide a pacing signal for endogenous neural oscillations, thereby influencing perceptual processing.

We propose a novel method to separate preictal and interictal states based on the analysis of the high frequency activity of intracerebral EEGs in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Wavelet energy and entropy were computed in sliding window fashion from preictal and interictal epochs. A comparison of their organization in a 2 dimensional space was carried out using three features quantifying the similarities between their underlying states and a reference state. A discriminant analysis was then used in the features space to classify epochs. Performance was assessed based on sensitivity and false positive rates and validation was performed using a bootstrapping approach. Results: Preictal and interictal epochs were discriminable in most patients on a subset of channels that were found to be close or within the seizure onset zone. Conclusions: Preictal and interictal states were separable using measures of similarity with the reference state. Discriminability varies with frequency bands. Significance: This method is useful to discriminate preictal from interictal states in intracerebral EEGs and could be useful for seizure prediction.

The seizure is a process of rhythmic discharge in brain and occurs rarely and unpredictably. This behavior generates a need of an automatic detection of seizures by using the signals of long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Due to the non-stationary character of EEG signals, the conventional methods of frequency analysis are not the best alternative to obtain good results in diagnostic purpose. The present work proposes a method of EEG signal analysis based on star graph topological indices (SGTIs) for the first time. The signal information, such as amplitude and time occurrence, is codified into invariant SGTIs which are the basis for the classification models that can discriminate the epileptic EEG records from the non-epileptic ones. The method with SGTIs and the simplest linear discriminant methods provide similar results to those previously published, which are based on the time-frequency analysis and artificial neural networks. Thus, this work proposes a simpler and faster alternative for automatic detection of seizures from the EEG recordings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To understand what is occurring in the brain during seizure we investigated the time progression of the brain's state from seizure onset to seizure suppression. Knowledge of a seizure's dynamics and the associated spatial structure is important for localizing the seizure foci and determining the optimal location and timing of electrical stimulation to mitigate seizure development. In this study, we analyzed intracranial EEG data recorded in 2 human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery using network analyses. Specifically, we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from iEEG (intracranial electroencephalography) recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient, connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in the band of frequencies with the strongest modulation during seizure. The connectivity matrices' structure was analyzed using an eigen-decomposition. The leading eigenvector was used to estimate each electrode's time dependent centrality (importance to the network's connectivity). The electrode centralities were clustered over the course of each seizure and the cluster centroids were compared across seizures. We found, for each patient, there was a consistent set of centroids that occurred during each seizure. Further, the brain reliably evolved through the same progression of states across multiple seizures including characteristic onset and suppression states.

"Too many betas do not spoil the broth": the role of beta brain oscillations in language processing	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						brain oscillations; beta; frequency; language; power; coherence	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; NEURONAL COMMUNICATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA RHYTHMS; ALPHA-BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; ACTIVATION	Over the past 20 years, brain oscillations have proven to be a gateway to the understanding of cognitive processes. It has been shown that different neurocognitive aspects of language processing are associated with brain oscillations at various frequencies. Frequencies in the beta range (13-30 Hz) turned out to be particularly important with respect to cognitive and linguistic manipulations during language processing. Beta activity has been involved in higher-order linguistic functions such as the discrimination of word categories and the retrieval of action semantics as well as semantic memory, and syntactic binding processes, which support meaning construction during sentence processing. From a neurophysiological point of view, the important role of the beta frequencies for such a complex cognitive task as language processing seems reasonable. Experimental evidence suggests that frequencies in the beta range are ideal for maintaining and preserving the activity of neuronal assemblies over time. In particular, recent computational and experimental evidence suggest that beta frequencies are important for linking past and present input and the detection of novelty of stimuli, which are essential processes for language perception as well as production. In addition, the beta frequency's role in the formation of cell assemblies underlying short-term memory seems indispensable for language analysis. Probably the most important point is the well-known relation of beta oscillations with motor processes. It can be speculated that beta activities reflect the close relationship between language comprehension and motor functions, which is one of the core claims of current theories on embodied cognition. In this article, the importance of beta oscillations for language processing is reviewed based both on findings in psychophysiological and neurophysiological literature.

Beta- and gamma-range human lower limb corticomuscular coherence	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; EMG; beta band; gamma band; coherence; isometric; isotonic; muscle contraction	MUSCLE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONTRACTION; ARTIFACTS; MOVEMENT; REMOVAL; FORCE	Coherence between electroencephalography (EEG) recorded on the scalp above the motor cortex and electromyography (EMG) recorded on the skin of the limbs is thought to reflect corticospinal coupling between motor cortex and muscle motor units. Beta-range (13-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence has been extensively documented during static force output while gamma-range (31-45 Hz) coherence has been linked to dynamic force output. However, the explanation for this beta-to-gamma coherence shift remains unclear. We recorded 264-channel EEG and 8-channel lower limb EMG while eight healthy subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee, and ankle exercises. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We computed magnitude squared coherence between electrocortical source signals and EMG. Significant coherence between contralateral motor cortex electrocortical signals and lower limb EMG was observed in the beta- and gamma-range for all exercise types. Gamma-range coherence was significantly greater for isotonic exercises than for isometric exercises. We conclude that active muscle movement modulates the speed of corticospinal oscillations. Specifically, isotonic contractions shift corticospinal oscillations toward the gamma-range while isometric contractions favor beta-range oscillations. Prior research has suggested that tasks requiring increased integration of visual and somatosensory information may shift corticomuscular coherence to the gamma-range. The isometric and isotonic tasks studied here likely required similar amounts of visual and somatosensory integration. This suggests that muscle dynamics, including the amount and type of proprioception, may play a role in the beta-to-gamma shift.

Developmental Trajectories of Resting EEG Power: An Endophenotype of Autism Spectrum Disorder	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; JOINT ATTENTION; INTERNEURON DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; GAP-JUNCTIONS; CHILDREN; RISK; ABNORMALITIES	Current research suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by asynchronous neural oscillations. However, it is unclear whether changes in neural oscillations represent an index of the disorder or are shared more broadly among both affected and unaffected family members. Additionally, it remains unclear how early these differences emerge in development and whether they remain constant or change over time. In this study we examined developmental trajectories in spectral power in infants at high-or low-risk for ASD. Spectral power was extracted from resting EEG recorded over frontal regions of the scalp when infants were 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. We used multilevel modeling to assess change over time between risk groups in the delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The results indicated that across all bands, spectral power was lower in high-risk infants as compared to low-risk infants at 6-months of age. Furthermore high-risk infants showed different trajectories of change in spectral power in the subsequent developmental window indicating that not only are the patterns of change different, but that group differences are dynamic within the first two years of life. These findings remained the same after removing data from a subset of participants who displayed ASD related behaviors at 24 or 36 months. These differences in the nature of the trajectories of EEG power represent important endophenotypes of ASD.

An improved Hilbert-Huang transform method was applied to time-frequency analysis of non-stable EEG signals for the sleep staging in this paper. In order to settle the frequency overlapping problem of intrinsic mode function obtained from traditional HHT, wavelet package transform was introduced to bandwidth refinement of EEG before the empirical mode decomposition was conducted. This method improved the time-frequency resolution effectively. Then the intrinsic mode functions and their marginal spectrums would be calculated. Six common spectrum energies (or spectral energy ratios) were selected as characteristic parameters. Finally, a probabilistic nearest neighbor method for statistical pattern recognition was applied to optimal decision. The experiment data was from the Sleep-EDF database of MIT-BIH. The classification results showed that the automatic sleep staging decisions based on this method conformed roughly with the manual staging results and were better than those obtained from traditional HHT obviously. Therefore, the method in this paper could be applied to extract features of sleep stages and provided necessary dependence for automatic sleep staging.

Here we tested the hypothesis that different unimanual motor tasks are specifically associated with distinct patterns of oscillatory coupling in human sensorimotor cortical areas. In 13 healthy, right-handed subjects, we recorded task-induced neural activity with 122-channel electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects performed fast self-paced extension-flexion movements with the right index finger and an isometric contraction of the right forearm. Task-related modulations of inter-regional coupling within a core motor network comprising the left primary motor cortex (M1), lateral premotor cortex (IPM) and supplementary motor area (SMA) were then modeled using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). A network model postulating coupling both within and across frequencies best captured observed spectral responses according to Bayesian model selection. DCM revealed dominant coupling within the beta-band (13-30 Hz) between M1 and SMA during isometric contraction of the forearm, whereas fast repetitive finger movements were characterized by strong coupling within the gamma-band (31-48 Hz) and between the theta- (4-7 Hz) and the gamma-band. This coupling pattem was mainly expressed in connections from IPM to SMA and from IPM to M1. We infer that human manual motor control involves task-specific modulation of inter-regional oscillatory coupling both within and across distinct frequency bands. The results highlight the potential of DCM to characterize context-specific changes in coupling within functional brain networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Topography-specific spindle frequency changes in Obstructive Sleep Apnea	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Time series; Matching pursuit; EEG; Sleep spindles; OSA	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; EEG; TIME; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; PARAMETRIZATION; AMPLITUDE; DEFICITS	Background: Sleep spindles, as detected on scalp electroencephalography (EEG), are considered to be markers of thalamo-cortical network integrity. Since obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known cause of brain dysfunction, the aim of this study was to investigate sleep spindle frequency distribution in OSA. Seven non-OSA subjects and 21 patients with OSA (11 mild and 10 moderate) were studied. A matching pursuit procedure was used for automatic detection of fast (>= 13Hz) and slow(< 13Hz) spindles obtained from 30min samples of NREM sleep stage 2 taken from initial, middle and final night thirds (sections I, II and III) of frontal, central and parietal scalp regions. Results: Compared to non-OSA subjects, Moderate OSA patients had higher central and parietal slow spindle percentage (SSP) in all night sections studied, and higher frontal SSP in sections II and III. As the night progressed, there was a reduction in central and parietal SSP, while frontal SSP remained high. Frontal slow spindle percentage in night section III predicted OSA with good accuracy, with OSA likelihood increased by 12.1% for every SSP unit increase (OR 1.121, 95% CI 1.013 - 1.239, p=0.027). Conclusions: These results are consistent with diffuse, predominantly frontal thalamo-cortical dysfunction during sleep in OSA, as more posterior brain regions appear to maintain some physiological spindle frequency modulation across the night. Displaying changes in an opposite direction to what is expected from the aging process itself, spindle frequency appears to be informative in OSA even with small sample sizes, and to represent a sensitive electrophysiological marker of brain dysfunction in OSA.

However, identifying spectral power modulations suitable for single-trial analysis for non-invasive approaches remains a challenge. We recorded non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) during a self-paced center-out and center-in arm movement task, resulting in eight reaching movement classes (four center-out, four center-in). We found distinct slow (<= 5 Hz), mu (7.5-10 Hz), beta (12.5-25 Hz), low-gamma (approximately 275-50 Hz), and high-gamma (above 50 Hz) movement onset- and end-related responses. Movement class-specific spectral power modulations were restricted to the beta band at approximately 1 s after movement end and could be explained by the sensitivity of this response to different static, post-movement electromyography (EMG) levels. Based on the beta band, significant single-trial inference of reaching movement endpoints was possible. The findings of the present study support the idea that single-trial decoding of different reaching movements from non-invasive EEG spectral power modulations is possible, but also suggest that the informative time window is after movement end and that the informative frequency range is restricted to the beta band.

In this study we applied the HE index, extracted from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, as a measure of anesthetic drug effects on brain activity. Methods: In 19 adult patients undergoing sevoflurane general anesthesia, we calculated the HE of the raw EEG; comparing the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with the traditional rescaled range (R/S) analysis techniques, and with a commercial index of depth of anesthesia - the response entropy (RE). We analyzed each wavelet-decomposed sub-band as well as the combined low frequency bands (HEOLFBs). The methods were compared in regard to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, and prediction probability. Results: All the low frequency band HE indices decreased when anesthesia deepened. However the HEOLFB was the best index because: it was less sensitive to artifacts, most closely tracked the exact point of loss of consciousness, showed a better prediction probability in separating the awake and unconscious states, and tracked sevoflurane concentration better - as estimated by the PK/PD models. Conclusions: The HE is a useful measure for estimating the depth of anesthesia. It was noted that HEOLFB showed the best performance for tracking drug effect. Significance: The HEOLFB could be used as an index for accurately estimating the effect of anesthesia on brain activity. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. This literature review describes the morphology, clinical meaning, and pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs. To record HFOs, the intracranial EEG needs to be sampled at least at 2,000Hz. The oscillatory events can be visualized by applying a high-pass filter and increasing the time and amplitude scales, or EEG time-frequency maps can show the amount of high-frequency activity. HFOs appear excellent markers for the epileptogenic zone. In patients with focal epilepsy who can benefit from surgery, invasive EEG is often required to identify the epileptic cortex, but current information is sometimes inadequate. Removal of brain tissue generating HFOs has been related to better postsurgical outcome than removing the seizure onset zone, indicating that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs is challenging, probably involving populations of neurons firing asynchronously. They differ from physiological HFOs in not being paced by rhythmic inhibitory activity and in their possible origin from population spikes. Their link to the epileptogenic zone argues that their study will teach us much about the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. HFOs show promise for improving surgical outcome and accelerating intracranial EEG investigations. Their potential needs to be assessed by future research.

Knowing the origin of this high frequency activity is crucial if localisation of epileptogenic brain tissue is the query. We attempt to differentiate cerebral from muscular origin of such activity. Methods: We postulate that EEG and MEG have similar sensitivity to brain activity, but different sensitivity to muscle activity, and compare co-recorded EEG and MEG signals in a group of five patients who had received short-lasting barbiturates to induce sleep. We performed principal components analysis over time and subtract the results for MEG from the EEG to see where the frequency spectra differ. Results: The EEG showed activity in the gamma bands up to 270 Hz for all patients; the MEG significantly less. We find no differences in the lower frequency bands. Topographically the differences localized over the frontotemporal regions. Conclusions: In the EEG benzodiazepines and/or barbiturates are not only associated with frequencies in the beta band, but also with wide range gamma activity. The latter seems to be of muscular origin. Significance: Our study suggests that gamma activity in such measurements may not be cerebral in origin. MEG is less susceptible to contamination from muscle activity than the EEG. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Haptic feedback with deviation-related forces was used throughout tracking experiments in which subjects' behavioral responses and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were simultaneously measured. Independent component analysis was employed to decompose the acquired EEG signals into temporally independent time courses arising from distinct brain sources. Clustering analysis was used to extract independent components that were comparable across participants. The resultant independent brain processes were further analyzed via time-frequency analysis (event-related spectral perturbation) and event-related coherence (ERCOH) to contrast brain activity during tracking experiments with or without haptic feedback. Across subjects, in epochs with haptic feedback, components with equivalent dipoles in or near the right motor region exhibited greater alpha band power suppression. Components with equivalent dipoles in or near the left frontal, central, left motor, right motor, and parietal regions exhibited greater beta-band power suppression, while components with equivalent dipoles in or near the left frontal, left motor, and right motor regions showed greater gamma-band power suppression relative to non-haptic conditions. In contrast, the right occipital component cluster exhibited less beta-band power suppression in epochs with haptic feedback compared to non-haptic conditions. The results of ERCOH analysis of the six component clusters showed that there were significant increases in coherence between different brain networks in response to haptic feedback relative to the coherence observed when haptic feedback was not present. The results of this study provide novel insight into the effects of haptic feedback on the brain and may aid the development of new tools to facilitate the learning of motor skills.

In this work we present a case study where we compare two quantitative paradigms for automated detection of biomarkers, one based on spontaneous SEEG recordings of HFOs and the other using activity induced by direct electrical stimulation (relative Phase Clustering Index algorithm). We compare the performance of these automated methods with manually detected HFO ripples by a trained EEG analyst and explore their potential diagnostic relevance. Intracranial recordings from patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation are processed with a combination of morphological filtering and the analysis of the auto-correlation function. The results were compared to those obtained by visual inspection and to results from an active paradigm involving stimulation with 20 Hz trains of biphasic pulses. The quantity of HFOs, estimated automatically, or "rippleness", was found to correspond to the findings of a trained EEG analyst. The relative phase clustering index (rPCI) obtained using periodic stimulation appeared to be associated with the closeness to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) detected from ictal epochs. The HFO estimates were also indicative for the SOZ but with less specificity.

J	Sanger, J; Muller, V; Lindenberger, U				Saenger, Johanna; Mueller, Viktor; Lindenberger, Ulman			Intra- and interbrain synchronization and network properties when playing guitar in duets	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional connectivity; graph theory; EEG hyperscanning; joint action; cortical phase synchronization; social interaction; music	SMALL-WORLD; GLOBAL WORKSPACE; INTEGRATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ARTIFACTS; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; MUSIC	To further test and explore the hypothesis that synchronous oscillatory brain activity supports interpersonally coordinated behavior during dyadic music performance, we simultaneously recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from the brains of each of 12 guitar duets repeatedly playing a modified Rondo in two voices by C.G. Scheidler. Indicators of phase locking and of within-brain and between-brain phase coherence were obtained from complex time-frequency signals based on the Gabor transform. Analyses were restricted to the delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency bands. We found that phase locking as well as within-brain and between-brain phase-coherence connection strengths were enhanced at frontal and central electrodes during periods that put particularly high demands on musical coordination. Phase locking was modulated in relation to the experimentally assigned musical roles of leader and follower, corroborating the functional significance of synchronous oscillations in dyadic music performance. Graph theory analyses revealed within-brain and hyperbrain networks with small-worldness peoperties that were enhanced during musical coordination periods, and community structures encompassing electrodes from both brains (hyperbrain modules). We conclude that brain mechanisms indexed by phase locking, phase coherence, and structural properties of within-brain and hyperbrain networks support interpersonal action coordination (IAC).

The efficacy was compared in a pre- and post analysis over a treatment period of 3 month with a control group and a group of patients with an EEG-based neurofeedback therapy. The number of impulsivity errors in a stop-signal paradigm at several distinct times during and after the therapy was used as a quality marker. The main feature of this method uses real-time-EEG data derived parameters for a controlled manipulation of EEG patterns with persistently strong audio-visual stimuli. It is based upon a direct feedback of changes in short-term coherences in the context of central nervous stimulus processing to control the stimulating frequency. The real-time EEG processing is done on the basis of time-dependent coherence analysis of the theta and beta band.

Synchrony of phase (phase locking) of event-related oscillations (EROs) within and between different brain areas has been suggested to reflect communication exchange between neural networks and as such may be a sensitive and translational measure of ethanol's effects. Using a similar auditory event-related potential paradigm in both rats and humans we investigated the phase variability of EROs collected from 38 young men who had participated in an ethanol/placebo challenge protocol, and 46 adult male rats given intraperitoneal injections of ethanol/saline. Phase locking was significantly higher in the delta frequencies in humans than in rats. Phase locking was also higher for the rare (target) tone than the frequent (non-target) tone in both species. Significant reductions in phase locking to the rare (target) tone in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies, within and between brain sites, was found at 1 h following ethanol as compared to placebo/saline administration in both rats and humans. Reductions in phase locking in the alpha frequencies in the parietal cortex were found to be correlated with blood ethanol concentrations. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol's intoxicating actions in the brain include reducing synchrony within and between neuronal networks, perhaps by increasing the level of noise in key neuromolecular interactions.

Using the multidimensional directed information analysis supported by the frontal brain asymmetry in the case of emotional reaction, a criterion, namely asymmetry index (AsI), is used to realize the proposed segmentation processes that take into account both the time and frequency (in the empirical mode decomposition domain) emotionally related EEG components. The efficiency of the AsI-based "emotional" filters was justified through an extensive classification process, using higher-order crossings and cross-correlation as feature-vector extraction techniques and a support vector machine classifier for six different classification scenarios in the valence/arousal space. This resulted in mean classification rates from 64.17% up to 82.91% in a user-independent base, revealing the potential of establishing such a filtering for reliable EEG-based emotion recognition systems.

Neural Signatures of Economic Parameters During Decision-Making: A Functional MRI (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Autonomic Monitoring Study	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Decision making; Prospect theory; Functional MRI (fMRI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Autonomic monitoring	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; SOMATIC MARKER HYPOTHESIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PROSPECT-THEORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; LOSS AVERSION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; REWARD EXPECTATION	Adaptive behaviour requires an ability to obtain rewards by choosing between different risky options. Financial gambles can be used to study effective decision-making experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients.

Atypical electrophysiological activity during pain observation in amputees who experience synaesthetic pain	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synaesthesia for pain; empathy for pain; phantom pain; electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED THETA; EEG-ALPHA; TOUCH SYNAESTHESIA; NEURAL PROCESSES; EMPATHY; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; OTHERS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	There are increasing reports of people experiencing pain when observing pain in another. This describes the phenomenon of synaesthetic pain which, until recently, had been primarily reported in amputees with phantom pain. In the current study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how amputees who experience synaesthetic pain process pain observed in another. Participants were grouped according to amputees who experience phantom and synaesthetic pain (n=8), amputees who experience phantom pain but not synaesthetic pain (n=10) and healthy controls (n=10). Participants underwent EEG as they observed still images of hands and feet in potentially painful and non-painful situations. We found that pain synaesthetes showed some reduced event-related potential (ERP) components at certain electrode sites, and reduced theta- and alpha band power amplitude at a central electrode. The finding of reduced ERP amplitude and theta band power may reflect inhibition of the processing of observed pain (e.g. avoidance/guarding as a protective strategy), and reduced alpha band power may indicate a disinhibition in control processes that may result in synaesthetic pain. These results provide the first documentation of atypical neurophysiological activity in amputees who experience synaesthetic pain when processing pain in another.

Assessing Traumatic Brain Injuries Using EEG Power Spectral Analysis and Instantaneous Phase	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE				Although mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs commonly, little is known about how multiple mTBI incidents accumulate over time to produce serious morbidity or how the extent of injury can be quantified. This work presents a rat model that uses deceleration-induced brain trauma and an implantable EEG system for recording injury-induced changes in brain activity. Specifically, we present an analysis method to assess and quantify mTBI by combining information derived from EEG power spectral analysis and EEG phase shifts. We found that in different frequency bands, both EEG power spectra and the instantaneous phases of the two EEG channels before the impact were different from those measured after the impact. This study shows that EEG analysis can be used as a tool to identify and assess brain related injuries.

Here, we analyze in detail the possibilities to construct measures of true brain interactions which are strictly invariant to linear spatial transformations of the sensor data. Specifically, such measures can be constructed from maximization of imaginary coherency in virtual channels, bivariate measures as a corrected variate of imaginary coherence, and global measures indicating the total interaction contained within a space or between two spaces. A complete theoretic framework on this question is provided for second order statistical moments. Relations to existing linear and nonlinear approaches are presented. We applied the methods to resting state EEG data, showing clear interactions at all bands, and to a combined measurement of EEG and MEG during rest condition and a finger tapping task. We found that MEG was capable of observing brain interactions which were not observable in the EEG data (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Twenty-two healthy subjects were assessed for their neurotic states using the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) and assigned to two groups: normal (I) or potentially neurotic (II-IV) group. EEG was measured under emotional tasks (resting sessions, and pleasant and unpleasant sessions) using audio-visual stimuli and analyzed using coherence analysis. The coherence values of the potentially neurotic group in theta 2 band in the unpleasant session were significantly larger than those of the normal group. The coherence values of the potentially neurotic group in beta 2 and beta 3 bands in resting session were significantly larger than those of the normal group. These events suggest that the information processing mechanism resulting from the emotional stimuli in the brain will be different depending on the individual psychosomatic state.

Motion-related artefacts in EEG predict neuronally plausible patterns of activation in fMRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/fMRI; Artefacts; Motion; Attention; Network	WORKING-MEMORY; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; SIMULTANEOUS EEG/FMRI; IMAGING-ARTIFACT; PULSE ARTIFACT; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN BRAIN; RECORDINGS; REMOVAL; MRI	The simultaneous acquisition and subsequent analysis of EEG and fMRI data is challenging owing to increased noise levels in the EEG data. A common method to integrate data from these two modalities is to use aspects of the EEG data, such as the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERP) or oscillatory EEG activity, to predict fluctuations in the fMRI data. However, this relies on the acquisition of high quality datasets to ensure that only the correlates of neuronal activity are being studied. In this study, we investigate the effects of head-motion-related artefacts in the EEG signal on the predicted T2*-weighted signal variation. We apply our analyses to two independent datasets: 1) four participants were asked to move their feet in the scanner to generate small head movements, and 2) four participants performed an episodic memory task. We created T2*-weighted signal predictors from indicators of abrupt head motion using derivatives of the realignment parameters, from visually detected artefacts in the EEG as well as from three EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha and beta). In both datasets, we found little correlation between the T2*-weighted signal and EEG predictors that were not convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (cHRF). However, all convolved EEG predictors strongly correlated with the T2*-weighted signal variation in various regions including the bilateral superior temporal cortex, supplementary motor area, medial parietal cortex and cerebellum. The finding that movement onset spikes in the EEG predict T2*-weighted signal intensity only when the time course of movements is convolved with the cHRF, suggests that the correlated signal might reflect a BOLD response to neural activity associated with head movement. Furthermore, the observation that broad-spectral EEG spikes tend to occur at the same time as abrupt head movements, together with the finding that abrupt movements and EEG spikes show similar correlations with the T2*-weighted signal, indicates that the EEG spikes are produced by abrupt movement and that continuous regressors of EEG oscillations contain motion-related noise even after stringent correction of the EEG data. If not properly removed, these artefacts complicate the use of EEG data as a predictor of T2*-weighted signal variation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the dependence on a physiological parameter is unknown. In this study, we performed simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in 12 Wistar rats using a conventional forepaw stimulation paradigm and concurrently monitored the systemic physiological parameters of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, pH, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate through the rat femoral artery. The high frequency bands in the artifact-free EEG signals, especially those in the gamma range, demonstrated a maximum correlation with fMRI signals in the rat somatosensory cortex. A multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the correlation coefficient between the gamma power and fMRI signal depended on the actual values of the physiological parameters (R-2=0.20, p<0.05), whereas the gamma power and fMRI signal by itself were independent. Among the parameters, the heart rate had a statistically significant slope (95% CI: 0.00027-0.0016, p<0.01) in a multiple linear regression model. These results indicate that neurovascular coupling is mainly driven by gamma oscillations, as expected, but coupling or potential decoupling is strongly influenced by systemic physiological parameters, which dynamically reflect the baseline vital status of the subject.

A specific challenge for non-invasive recording methods are activations confined to small spatial areas on the cortex such as the finger representation of one hand. Here we study the information content of single trial brain activity in non-invasive MEG and EEG recordings elicited by finger movements of one hand. We investigate the feasibility of decoding which of four fingers of one hand performed a slight button press. With MEG we demonstrate reliable discrimination of single button presses performed with the thumb, the index, the middle or the little finger (average over all subjects and fingers 57%, best subject 70%, empirical guessing level: 25.1%). EEG decoding performance was less robust (average over all subjects and fingers 43%, best subject 54%, empirical guessing level 25.1%). Spatiotemporal patterns of amplitude variations in the time series provided best information for discriminating finger movements. Non-phase-locked changes of mu and beta oscillations were less predictive. Movement related high gamma oscillations were observed in average induced oscillation amplitudes in the MEG but did not provide sufficient information about the finger's identity in single trials. Importantly, pre-movement neuronal activity provided information about the preparation of the movement of a specific finger. Our study demonstrates the potential of non-invasive MEG to provide informative features for individual finger control in a Brain-Machine Interface neuroprosthesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This method overcomes the need for the EEG signal to be linear and stationary, assumptions necessary for the application of Fourier spectral analysis. The HHT method comprises two components: empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of the signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF's); and the Hilbert transform of the IMF's. This technique is applied here in the study of consecutive eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC) EEG signals of able bodied and spinal cord injured participants. The study found that in this EO, EC pair the instantaneous frequencies in the EO state were higher compared to the EC state. The Hilbert weighted frequency, a measure of the mean of the instantaneous frequencies present in an IMF, is used here to detect these changes from EO to the EC state in an EEG signal. Although there was a good detection of this change with information obtained from just one IMF (94% in able-bodied persons and 84% in SCI persons), almost 100% success in detecting between group differences was achieved using all the IMF's. This result has implications for assistive technology that rely on EEG changes in EO and EC states.

An EEG-based study of discrete isometric and isotonic human lower limb muscle contractions	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ARTIFACTS; FOOT; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with independent component analysis enables functional neuroimaging in dynamic environments including during human locomotion. This type of functional neuroimaging could be a powerful tool for neurological rehabilitation. It could enable clinicians to monitor changes in motor control related cortical dynamics associated with a therapeutic intervention, and it could facilitate noninvasive electrocortical control of devices for assisting limb movement to stimulate activity dependent plasticity. Understanding the relationship between electrocortical dynamics and muscle activity will be helpful for incorporating EEG-based functional neuroimaging into clinical practice. The goal of this study was to use independent component analysis of high-density EEG to test whether we could relate electrocortical dynamics to lower limb muscle activation in a constrained motor task. A secondary goal was to assess the trial-by-trial consistency of the electrocortical dynamics by decoding the type of muscle action. Methods: We recorded 264-channel EEG while 8 neurologically intact subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee and ankle exercises at two different effort levels. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We generated spectrograms for all electrocortical source signals and used a nave Bayesian classifier to decode exercise type from trial-by-trial time-frequency data. Results: AMICA captured different electrocortical source distributions for ankle and knee tasks. The fit of single-trial EEG to these models distinguished knee from ankle tasks with 80% accuracy. Electrocortical spectral modulations in the supplementary motor area were significantly different for isometric and isotonic tasks (p < 0.05). Isometric contractions elicited an event related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (12-30 Hz) at joint torque onset and offset. Isotonic contractions elicited a sustained alpha- and beta-band ERD throughout the trial. Classifiers based on supplementary motor area sources achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 69% while classifiers based on electrocortical sources in multiple brain regions achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 87%. Conclusions: Independent component analysis of EEG reveals unique spatial and spectro-temporal electrocortical properties for different lower limb motor tasks. Using a broad distribution of electrocortical signals may improve classification of human lower limb movements from single-trial EEG.

First, the independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate single-trial ERPs into a set of independent components (ICs), which were then clustered into three groups (symmetrically distributed ICs, non-symmetrically distributed ICs, and noise-related ICs). Second, the time-frequency distributions of each clustered group were calculated using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Third, the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to extract time-frequency features from all single-trial time-frequency distributions across all channels. Altogether, the developed approach would help effectively extracting nociceptive-related time-frequency features, thus yielding to an important: contribution to the study of nociceptive-specific neural activities.

INTERINDIVIDUAL REACTION TIME VARIABILITY IS RELATED TO RESTING-STATE NETWORK TOPOLOGY: AN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive function; EEG; functional connectivity; phase lag index; graph analysis	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALPHA-FREQUENCY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Both anatomical and functional brain network studies have drawn great attention recently. Previous studies have suggested the significant impacts of brain network topology on cognitive function. However, the relationship between non-task related resting-state functional brain network topology and overall efficiency of sensorimotor processing has not been well identified. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between non-task related resting-state functional brain network topology and reaction time (RT) in a Go/Nogo task using an electroencephalogram (EEG). After estimating the functional connectivity between each pair of electrodes, graph analysis was applied to characterize the network topology. Two fundamental measures, clustering coefficient (functional segregation) and characteristic path length (functional integration), as well as "small-world-ness" (the ratio between the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length) were calculated in five frequency bands. Then, the correlations between the network measures and RT were evaluated in each band separately. The present results showed that increased overall functional connectivity in alpha and gamma frequency bands was correlated with a longer RT. Furthermore, shorter RT was correlated with a shorter characteristic path length in the gamma band. This result suggested that human RTs were likely to be related to the efficiency of the brain integrating information across distributed brain regions. The results also showed that a longer RT was related to an increased gamma clustering coefficient and decreased small-world-ness. These results provided further evidence of the association between the resting-state functional brain network and cognitive function. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During wake-to-drowsy transition they change unevenly, depending on the brain region. To explore their dynamics, we recorded ten adult healthy individuals in these two states. Alpha waves were treated as stable frequency and variable amplitude signals with one carrier frequency (CF). A method for calculating their CF phase shifts (CFPS) and CF phase potentials (CFPP) was developed and verified on surrogate signals as more accurate than phase shifts of Fourier components. Probability density estimate (PDE) of CFPS, CFPP and CF phase locking showed that frontal and fronto-temporal areas of the cortex underwent more extensive changes than posterior regions. The greatest differences were found between pairs of channels involving F7, F8, F3 and F4 (PDE of CFPS); F7, F8. T3 and 14 (CFPP); F7, F8, F3, F4, C3, C4 and T3 (decrease in CF phase locking). A topographic distribution of channels with above the average phase locking in the wake state revealed two separate regions occupying anterior and posterior brain areas (with intra regional and inter hemispheric connections). These regions merged and became mutually phase locked longitudinally in the drowsy state. Changes occurring primarily in the frontal and fronto-temporal regions correlated with an early decrease of alertness. Areas of increased phase locking might be correlated with topography of synchronous neuronal assemblies conceptualized within neural correlates of consciousness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We modified time-varying partial directed coherence (tv-PDC) based on orthogonalization of the MVAR model coefficients to deal with the effect of mutual independent sources. The novel measure was then tested using a simulated signal with feature dimensions relevant to EEG activity. From the neonatal EEG responses evoked by flash light stimuli (1Hz), we extracted the directional interactions over time within each hemisphere. The results suggest that the method is able to detect directed information flow within a sub-second time scale in nonstationary multichannel signals (such as newborn EEG) and attenuate the problematic effect of volume conduction for multichannel EEG connectivity analysis.

On the macroscopic level, these wave forms have been modeled by different mechanistic models which share canonical features. Here we derive a minimal model of excitatory and inhibitory processes with features common to all previous models. We can infer that at least three interacting processes are required to support the prototypic epileptic dynamics. Based on a separation of time scales we analyze the model in terms of interacting manifolds in phase space. This allows qualitative reverse engineering of all epileptic wave forms and transitions between them. We propose this method as a complement to traditional approaches to modeling epileptiform rhythms.

Methods Two auditory tones of different probabilities (oddball paradigm) and the same probability (control paradigm) were used. The average dynamic changes in amplitude were evaluated, and the in-phase consistency of the EEG spectrum at each frequency and time window across trials, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were computed. Results Subtraction of the ERPs of standard stimuli from the ERPs of deviant stimuli revealed a clear MMN component in the oddball paradigm. However, no discernible MMN component was observed in the control paradigm. Statistical tests showed that in the oddball paradigm, deviant tones produced significant increases of theta ERSPs and ITC at around 250 ms as compared with the standard tone, while no significant difference between the two stimuli was observed in the control paradigm. Conclusions Our results confirm that the auditory discriminatory process reflected in MMN is accompanied by phase resetting and power modulation at the theta frequency.

Reliability of quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures and LORETA current source density at 30 days	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						EEG reliability; LORETA; Current source density; Neuroimaging reliability	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PSYCHIATRY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NEUROFEEDBACK; SYMPTOMS; SPIKES; INDEX; POWER	There is a growing interest for using quantitative EEG and LORETA current source density in clinical and research settings. Importantly, if these indices are to be employed in clinical settings then the reliability of these measures is of great concern. Neuroguide (Applied Neurosciences) is sophisticated software developed for the analyses of power, and connectivity measures of the EEG as well as LORETA current source density. To date there are relatively few data evaluating topographical EEG reliability contrasts for all 19 channels and no studies have evaluated reliability for LORETA calculations. We obtained 4 min eyes-closed and eyes-opened EEG recordings at 30-day intervals. The EEG was analyzed in Neuroguide and FFT power, coherence and phase was computed for traditional frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) and LORETA current source density was calculated in 1 Hz increments and summed for total power in eight regions of interest (ROI). In order to obtain a robust measure of reliability we utilized a random effects model with an absolute agreement definition. The results show very good reproducibility for total absolute power and coherence. Phase shows lower reliability coefficients. LORETA current source density shows very good reliability with an average 0.81 for ECB and 0.82 for EOB. Similarly, the eight regions of interest show good to very good agreement across time. Implications for future directions and use of gEEG and LORETA in clinical populations are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Toward an EEG-Based Recognition of Music Liking Using Time-Frequency Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); machine learning; music liking/disliking; time-frequency (TF) analysis	EMOTION; ASYMMETRY; AROUSAL; STANDARDIZE; EXPRESSIONS; INTENSITY	Affective phenomena, as reflected through brain activity, could constitute an effective index for the detection of music preference. In this vein, this paper focuses on the discrimination between subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music, acquired during an experimental procedure, by evaluating different feature extraction approaches and classifiers to this end. Feature extraction is based on time-frequency (TF) analysis by implementing three TF techniques, i.e., spectrogram, Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution and Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS). Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries. Classification is performed by employing four classifiers, i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), quadratic and Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analyses. According to the experimental results across nine subjects, best classification accuracy {86.52 (+/-0.76)%} was achieved using k-NN and HHS-based feature vectors (FVs) representing a bilateral average activity, referred to a resting period, in beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-49 Hz) bands. Activity in these bands may point to a connection between music preference and emotional arousal phenomena. Furthermore, HHS-based FVs were found to be robust against noise corruption. The outcomes of this study provide early evidence and pave the way for the development of a generalized brain computer interface for music preference recognition.

This work presents a rat model that combines deceleration-induced brain trauma with an implantable EEG system for recording injury-induced changes in brain activity. Specifically, we present an analysis method to assess and quantify mTBI by combining information derived from EEG power spectral analysis and EEG phase shifts. We found that in different frequency bands, the correlation coefficient before the crash was notably different from the same coefficient after the crash. This study shows that EEG analysis can be used as a tool to identify and assess brain related injuries.

NMDA antagonists recreate signal-to-noise ratio and timing perturbations present in schizophrenia	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Electrophysiology; Endophenotype; Animal models; NMDA antagonist	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; EEG; FREQUENCY; DEFICITS; SYNCHRONY; KETAMINE; BRAIN	Rationale: There is increasing evidence that functional deficits in schizophrenia may be driven by a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consistent timing of neural signals. This study examined the extent to which exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and MK801, frequently used pharmacological models of schizophrenia, recreate deficits in electrophysiological markers of disturbed brain circuits that are thought to underlie the illness. Furthermore, this study characterizes the specificity of these differences across the frequency spectrum so as to help identify the nature of selective circuit abnormalities that mediate each oscillatory response as relevant to schizophrenia. Design: Mouse EEG was recorded during exposure to repeated auditory stimuli after injection of either vehicle or drug. The dose-response relationship for each electrophysiological measure was determined for ketamine and MK-801. Time-frequency analyses were performed to assess baseline, total, and evoked power and intertrial coherence (ITC) at low (5-10 Hz) and high (35-80 Hz)-frequencies. Results: High frequency evoked and total power was decreased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. High frequency baseline power was increased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar to evoked power, high frequency inter-trial coherence was dose-dependently decreased by both drugs. Low frequency ITC was only decreased by ketamine. Conclusions: Both ketamine and MK-801 cause alterations in high-frequency baseline (noise), total (signal), and evoked (signal) power resulting in a loss of high frequency SNR that is thought to primarily reflect local circuit activity. These changes indicate an inappropriate increase in baseline activity, which can also be interpreted as non-task related activity. Ketamine induced a loss of intertrial coherence at low frequencies, indicating a loss of consistency in low-frequency circuit mechanisms. As a proportion of baseline power, both drugs had a relative shift from low to high frequencies, reflecting a change in the balance of brain activity from coordination of global regions to a pattern of discoordinated, autonomous local activity. These changes are consistent with a pattern of fragmented regional brain activity seen in schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The processing of this type of construction gives new insights into the understanding of agreement processes during language comprehension. Here, we contrasted oscillatory brain activity triggered by Unagreement in different EEG bands with those triggered by Standard Agreement and Person Mismatch sentences. In Spectral Power analysis, a similar pattern for Unagreement to that elicited by Person Mismatch was found in lower beta and alpha bands, approximately around 600 ms. This suggests that fast oscillations reflect the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality). In an equivalent time window, the Unagreement condition behaves similarly to the Standard Agreement condition in the theta band, but different from the Person Mismatch condition that shows an enhanced spectral power. In addition, an enhanced phase synchrony in lower beta frequency around 600 ms is associated to standard agreement patterns, while beta-high frequencies at 800 ms characterize processing of Unagreement sentences. These results support the functional dissociation between the evaluation of the feature match between two structurally related constituents (independently of its grammaticality in fast oscillatory bands) and integration of linguistic material in working memory (reflected by theta oscillations). Successful resolution of an agreement dependency is better reflected in phase synchronizations at beta band. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From August, 2008 to October, 2010, 9 patients were diagnosed with PKD in the Department of Neurology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China. The data involving clinical demographic characteristics, somatosensory evoked potentials, results of electromyography, video electroencephalography (EEG), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) were collected. All PKD patients exhibited unilateral or bilateral recurrent episodic dyskinetic attacks triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The duration of the attacks ranged from several seconds to one minute. The attack frequency ranged from approximately once in several months to more than 10 times in a day. Patients suffered from no conscious disorders during the attack, and no neurological signs were found during the period between attacks. No abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials were found. Routine EEG, video EEG monitoring or brain imaging showed normal findings. Classical treatment for anti-epilepsy, including carbamazepine and topiramate, was administered to the patients and proved to be effective. It was concluded that PKD is characteristically triggered by sudden voluntary movement; no abnormal electroneurophysiological findings are observed in PKD, and antiepileptic drugs are effective in treating the disorder.

EEG Alpha Power Modulation of fMRI Resting-State Connectivity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						alpha; EEG; fMRI; PPI; resting state		In the past decade, the fast and transient coupling and uncoupling of functionally related brain regions into networks has received much attention in cognitive neuroscience. Empirical tools to study network coupling include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based functional and/or effective connectivity, and electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography-based measures of neuronal synchronization. Here we use simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI to assess whether fMRI-based connectivity and frequency-specific EEG power are related. Using data collected during resting state, we studied whether posterior EEG alpha power fluctuations are correlated with connectivity within the visual network and between the visual cortex and the rest of the brain. The results show that when alpha power increases, BOLD connectivity between the primary visual cortex and occipital brain regions decreases and that the negative relation of the visual cortex with the anterior/medial thalamus decreases and the ventral-medial prefrontal cortex is reduced in strength. These effects were specific for the alpha band, and not observed in other frequency bands. The decreased connectivity within the visual system may indicate an enhanced functional inhibition during a higher alpha activity. This higher inhibition level also attenuates long-range intrinsic functional antagonism between the visual cortex and the other thalamic and cortical regions. Together, these results illustrate that power fluctuations in posterior alpha oscillations result in local and long-range neural connectivity changes.

Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; hippocampus; EEG; neurophysiology; nocal seizures; epilepsy surgery	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL-ATROPHY; SEIZURE PROPAGATION; INTERICTAL EEG; LOCALIZATION; SEMIOLOGY; LOBECTOMY; SURGERY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LATERALIZATION	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of adult localization-related epilepsy. Hippocampal onset accounts for at least 80% of all temporal lobe seizures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) of mesial TLE contains interictal features often associated with anterior temporal epileptiform discharges with a maximal voltage over the basal temporal electrodes. Localized ictal patterns on scalp EEGs characteristically reveal unilateral 5- to 9-Hz rhythmic ictal theta or alpha epileptiform activity maximal in the anterior temporal scalp electrodes. Invasive-scalp EEG comparisons have yielded direct information about mesial temporal sources and their corresponding electrical fields. Refinement of macroscopic spatial and the temporal resolution suggest that a more precise seizure localization may exist beyond 1- to 35-Hz frequencies observed in routine scalp recording. Defining the focal areas of ictogenesis within the medial temporal lobe demonstrates a rich connection to a broad network that goes beyond the medial structures and even the temporal lobe itself. Advanced electrophysiologic application in TLE may further our understanding of ictogenesis to perfect surgical treatment and to elucidate the neurophysiologic corollaries of epileptogensis itself.

Specifically, human subjects are presented with audio whose quality varies with time while being monitored by a 128-channel EEG; some of the time, they move a slider bar up and down to indicate their perception of the changing quality while at other times they listen passively. Our focus here is to identify low-level features in the brainwave responses that correlate well with temporal quality variations across multiple base audio sequences and different test subjects with our ultimate goal being to implement a classifier based on such features. The results presented here attempt to quantify the quality classification performance versus the perceptual uncertainty of the subjective data. We find that the proposed approach is much more effective in estimating the perceptual quality for one of the two distortion types considered, frequency truncation, than it is for the other type, scalar quantization.

Older adults, unlike younger adults, do not modulate alpha power to suppress irrelevant information	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Aging; Attention; EEG; Oscillations; Sensory gating; Visual working memory	TOP-DOWN SUPPRESSION; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; INCREASES; MECHANISM	This study examines the neural mechanisms through which younger and older adults ignore irrelevant information, a process that is necessary to effectively encode new memories. Some age-related memory deficits have been linked to a diminished ability to dynamically gate sensory input, resulting in problems inhibiting the processing of distracting stimuli. Whereas oscillatory power in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) over visual cortical areas is thought to dynamically gate sensory input in younger adults, it is not known whether older adults use the same mechanism to gate out sensory input. Here we identified a task in which both older and younger adults could suppress the processing of irrelevant sensory stimuli, allowing us to use electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the neural activity associated with suppression of visual processing. As expected, we found that the younger adults' suppression of visual processing was correlated with robust modulation of alpha oscillatory power. However, older adults did not modulate alpha power to suppress processing of visual information. These results demonstrate that suppression of alpha power is not necessary to inhibit the processing of distracting stimuli in older adults, suggesting the existence of alternative strategies for suppressing irrelevant, potentially distracting information.

Since large volume of data need to be analyzed, visual analysis has been proven to be time consuming and subsequently automated detection techniques have gained importance in the recent years. For the biomedical research community, the major challenge lies in providing a solution to neurologists in terms of diagnosis and EEG database management. This paper discusses the automated detection of epileptic seizure using frequency domain and entropy parameters which helps in the construction of epileptic database for handling EEG data. Experimental study indicates that the suggested mode of operation can be used for internet based framework which contains pure epileptic patterns in the server. This can be retrieved and analyzed for detection and annotation of epileptic spikes in extensive EEG recordings.

Emergence of Stable Functional Networks in Long-Term Human Electroencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; CORTICAL NETWORKS; BRAIN NETWORKS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE ANALYSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; SLEEP	Functional connectivity networks have become a central focus in neuroscience because they reveal key higher-dimensional features of normal and abnormal nervous system physiology. Functional networks reflect activity-based coupling between brain regions that may be constrained by relatively static anatomical connections, yet these networks appear to support tremendously dynamic behaviors. Within this growing field, the stability and temporal characteristics of functional connectivity brain networks have not been well characterized. We evaluated the temporal stability of spontaneous functional connectivity networks derived from multi-day scalp encephalogram (EEG) recordings in five healthy human subjects. Topological stability and graph characteristics of networks derived from averaged data epochs ranging from 1 s to multiple hours across different states of consciousness were compared. We show that, although functional networks are highly variable on the order of seconds, stable network templates emerge after as little as similar to 100 s of recording and persist across different states and frequency bands (albeit with slightly different characteristics in different states and frequencies). Within these network templates, the most common edges are markedly consistent, constituting a network "core." Although average network topologies persist across time, measures of global network connectivity, density and clustering coefficient, are state and frequency specific, with sparsest but most highly clustered networks seen during sleep and in the gamma frequency band. These findings support the notion that a core functional organization underlies spontaneous cortical processing and may provide a reference template on which unstable, transient, and rapidly adaptive long-range assemblies are overlaid in a frequency-dependent manner.

In this research, we assess the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on spatial cognitive function by measuring physiological signals, including brain waves measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Through physiological signals such as brain waves, we can objectively understand a subject's cognitive state. Moreover, we use virtual reality technology to build 3D scenery that provides navigation clues in an environment with no visual reference frame. Using the virtual environment, we confirm that TENS lessens spatial disorientation. Across subjects and sessions, the parietal component of brain activity exhibited baseline elevation predominantly in the theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band as the subjects navigated. This study also found that subjects performed better after TENS in terms of behavioral and EEG data. The results facilitate understanding of the cognitive function of maintaining spatial orientation and development of a device for assisting pilots and reducing the occurrence of spatial disorientation.

EEG delta oscillations as a correlate of basic homeostatic and motivational processes	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Delta oscillations; EEG; Evolution; Motivation; Salience detection; Attention	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; POWER SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; PROLONGED P300 LATENCY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; PALLIOPALLIAL CONNECTIVITY	Functional significance of delta oscillations is not fully understood. One way to approach this question would be from an evolutionary perspective. Delta oscillations dominate the EEG of waking reptiles. In humans, they are prominent only in early developmental stages and during slow-wave sleep. Increase of delta power has been documented in a wide array of developmental disorders and pathological conditions. Considerable evidence on the association between delta waves and autonomic and metabolic processes hints that they may be involved in integration of cerebral activity with homeostatic processes. Much evidence suggests the involvement of delta oscillations in motivation. They increase during hunger, sexual arousal, and in substance users. They also increase during panic attacks and sustained pain. In cognitive domain, they are implicated in attention, salience detection, and subliminal perception. This evidence shows that delta oscillations are associated with evolutionary old basic processes, which in waking adults are overshadowed by more advanced processes associated with higher frequency oscillations. The former processes rise in activity, however, when the latter are dysfunctional. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this combined rTMS/EEG study, we aimed to investigate changes in oscillatory activity after high-frequency (similar to 11 Hz) rTMS relative to the number of applied pulses. Twenty intermittent trains of 20 or 60 rTMS pulses were delivered over the human primary motor cortex at rest and tuned to individual mu frequency. The regional and interregional oscillatory neural activity after stimulation were evaluated using event-related power (ERPow) and event-related coherence (ERCoh) transformations. The most prominent changes for ERPow were observed in the theta band (4-7 Hz), as an increase in ERPow up to 20 s following 60 rTMS pulses, whereas ERPow increases were smaller in mu (1012 Hz) and beta (1330 Hz). ERCoh revealed that rTMS 60 modulated the connectivity in the theta band for up to 20 s. The topography of mu and theta changes were not identical; mu was more focal and theta was more global. Our data suggested the presence of independent cortical theta and mu generators with different reactivity to rTMS but could not rule out possible thalamocortical contributions in generating theta and mu over the motor network.

EEG signals related to the confidence level (uncertainty) of the subject about given responses remain to be clarified. Methods: Two discrimination tasks that create difficulty in stimulus processing and response selection stages of decision making were used. Conditions were certain-hit (hit trials where subjects were certain), certain-error (trials where subject was aware of the error), uncertain (trials where subject was uncertain). Analyzes of event-related potentials (ERP) (ERN, Pe, P3) in the time domain were extended by time-frequency analysis of both phase-locked and non-phase-locked oscillatory activities. Results: Errors caused by difficulty in stimulus processing led more uncertainty than the ones related to the response selection, and tended to elicit ERN with shorter latency. Each condition was discriminated from the others by at least one parameter. Uncertainty was discriminated by total theta activity following response, total delta activity following stimulus and mean P3 amplitude. Conclusions: Subjective confidence levels of decision making can be discriminated by time and time-frequency analyses of ERPs and EEG. Significance: Time-frequency parameters of EEG can be useful in the detection of subjective confidence in single-trials, which might be efficiently used for faster human-computer interaction.

The results of a visual-semantic categorization task show that three early ERP components including the P1-N1 complex had a dominant frequency characteristic in the alpha range and behaved like traveling waves do. They exhibited a traveling direction from midline occipital to right lateral parietal sites. Phase analyses revealed that this traveling behavior of ERP components could be explained by phase-delays in the alpha but not theta and beta frequency range. Most importantly, we found that the speed of the traveling alpha wave was significantly and negatively correlated with reaction time indicating that slow traveling speed was associated with fast picture-categorization. We conclude that evoked alpha oscillations are functionally associated with early access to visual-semantic information and generate - or at least modulate - the early waveforms of the visual ERP.

In several cortical areas, high-gamma amplitudes are coupled with low-frequency phases, e. g., alpha and theta (phase-amplitude coupling, PAC). However, such coupling has not been studied in the sensorimotor cortex; thus, its potential functional role has yet to be explored. We investigated PAC of high-gamma amplitude in the sensorimotor cortex during waiting for and the execution of movements using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in humans. ECoG signals were recorded from the sensorimotor cortices of 4 epilepsy patients while they performed three different hand movements. A subset of electrodes showed high-gamma activity selective to movement type around the timing of motor execution, while the same electrodes showed nonselective high-gamma activity during the waiting period (>2 s before execution). Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed that the high-gamma amplitude during waiting was strongly coupled with the alpha phase (10-14 Hz) at the electrodes with movement-selective high-gamma amplitudes during execution. This coupling constituted the high-gamma amplitude peaking around the trough of the alpha oscillation, and its strength and phase were not predictive of movement type. As the coupling attenuated toward the timing of motor execution, the high-gamma amplitude appeared to be released from the alpha phase to build a motor representation with phase-independent activity. Our results suggest that PAC modulates motor representation in the sensorimotor cortex by holding and releasing high-gamma activity in movement-selective cortical regions.

How these two scales of analysis split functions across hemispheres is unclear. We analyzed cortical responses from an epileptic patient with a rare bilateral electrode implantation (stereotactic EEG) in primary (A1/BA41 and A2/BA42) and association auditory cortices (BA22). Using time-frequency analyses, we confirmed the dominance of a 5-6 Hz theta activity in right and of a low-gamma (25-45 Hz) activity in left primary auditory cortices (A1/A2), during both resting state and syllable processing. We further detected high-theta (7-8 Hz) resting activity in left primary, but also associative auditory regions. In left BA22, its phase correlated with high-gamma induced power. Such a hierarchical relationship across theta and gamma frequency bands (theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling) could index the process by which the neural code shifts from stimulus feature- to phonological-encoding, and is associated with the transition from evoked to induced power responses. These data suggest that theta and gamma activity in right and left auditory cortices bear different functions. They support a scheme where slow parsing of the acoustic information dominates in right hemisphere at a syllabic (5-6 Hz) rate, and left auditory cortex exhibits a more complex cascade of oscillations, reflecting the possible extraction of transient acoustic cues at a fast (similar to 25-45 Hz) rate, subsequently integrated at a slower, e.g., syllabic one. Slow oscillations could functionally participate to speech processing by structuring gamma activity in left BA22, where abstract percepts emerge.

The olfactory stimulus in this study was a mixture of 60 % humidity air and 40 % phenyl ethanol alcohol generated by a computer-controlled olfactometer with a constant flow rate of 8 L/min. A 32-channel whole-head EEG system was utilized to investigate the olfactory responses in 12 healthy subjects. Each EEG epoch was segmented based on the olfactory stimulus onset and subsequently decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using EMD. Only IMFs that met both frequency and spatial dual criteria were chosen as OERP-related IMFs for reconstructing the noise-suppressed single-trial activity, and those significant trials with N1/P2 amplitudes lower/greater than the mean minus/plus two times the standard deviations of baseline amplitudes were denoted as single-trial OERP for intertrial variability analysis. The present approach enables the capability to study intertrial OERP features, such as the latencies and amplitudes of N1 and P2 peaks, on trial-by-trial basis, which may be helpful to shed light on future olfactory dysfunction studies.

We review recent studies where electroencephalography (EEG) has been combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in order to investigate possible neuronal substrates of visual perception and attention. TMS-EEG has been used to study both pre-stimulus brain activity patterns that affect upcoming perception, and also the stimulus-evoked and task-related inter-regional interactions within the extended visual-attentional network from which attention and perception emerge. Local processes in visual areas have been probed by directly stimulating occipital cortex while monitoring EEG activity and perception. Interactions within the attention network have been probed by concurrently stimulating frontal or parietal areas. The use of tasks manipulating implicit and explicit memory has revealed in addition a role for attentional processes in memory. Taken together, these studies helped to reveal that visual selection relies on spontaneous intrinsic activity in visual cortex prior to the incoming stimulus, their control by attention, and post-stimulus processes incorporating a re-entrant bias from frontal and parietal areas that depends on the task.

EEG correlates of P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; MEMORY; COMMUNICATION; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; DEVICE; SIGNAL; ALPHA; HOME	The purpose of this study was to identify electroencephalography (EEG) features that correlate with P300-based brain-computer interface (P300 BCI) performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Twenty people with ALS used a P300 BCI spelling application in copy-spelling mode. Three types of EEG features were found to be good predictors of P300 BCI performance: (1) the root-mean-square amplitude and (2) the negative peak amplitude of the event-related potential to target stimuli (target ERP) at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, and P4; and (3) EEG theta frequency (4.5-8 Hz) power at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, P4, PO7, PO8 and Oz. A statistical prediction model that used a subset of these features accounted for >60% of the variance in copy-spelling performance (p < 0.001, mean R-2 = 0.6175). The correlations reflected between-subject, rather than within-subject, effects. The results enhance understanding of performance differences among P300 BCI users. The predictors found in this study might help in: (1) identifying suitable candidates for long-term P300 BCI operation; (2) assessing performance online. Further work on within-subject effects needs to be done to establish whether P300 BCI user performance could be improved by optimizing one or more of these EEG features.

Recently, we reported that NVHL resulted in dendritic retraction and spine loss in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, the hippocampus and PFC are important structures in the regulation of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Patients with PFC lesions show deficits in the EEG activity. This study aimed to determine whether the EEG activity was altered in NVHL rats. In addition, we also analyzed the locomotor activity induced by a novel environment and exploratory behavior using the hole-board test. Consistent with the behavioral findings, the EEG analysis of the cortical regions showed that the NVHL rats displayed a lower power in cortical bands. At 1-8 Hz, 9-14 Hz, and 15-30 Hz bands, our findings showed a decrease in the absolute power of the parietal and occipital cortices recordings. In addition, the NVHL rats also showed a reduction in the exploratory behavior tested using the hole-board test. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the EEG activity was reduced in adult NVHL rats and suggests that this may play a role in the behavioral changes observed in this neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

Power of low frequency EEG activity [2 Hertz (Hz) bands in the 2-12 Hz range] was determined from recordings over frontal and parietal brain regions associated with mathematical thinking during mental calculation of correctly answered problems. Analyses were adjusted for background variables known to influence or reflect the development of mathematical skills, i.e., age and measures of math competence and math fluency. Relative to fed children, those who continued to fast showed greater power increases in upper theta (6-8 Hz) and both alpha bands (8-10 Hz; 10-12 Hz) across sites. Increased theta suggests greater demands on working memory. Increased alpha may facilitate task-essential activity by suppressing non-task-essential activity. Fasting children also had greater delta (2-4 Hz) and greater lower-theta (4-6 Hz) power in left frontal recordings-indicating a region-specific emphasis on both working memory for mental calculation (theta) and activation of processes that suppress interfering activity (delta). Fed children also showed a significant increase in correct responses while children who continued to fast did not. Taken together the findings suggest that neural network activity involved in processing numerical information is functionally enhanced and performance is improved in children who have eaten breakfast, whereas greater mental effort is required for this mathematical thinking in children who skip breakfast.

Oscillating central motor networks in pathological tremors and voluntary movements. What makes the difference?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Central networks; Diencephalon; Source analysis; Thalamic stimulation; Voluntary control	PARKINSONIAN TREMOR; COHERENT SOURCES; EEG; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DISEASE; SYSTEMS; ATAXIA; DELAY	Parkinsonian tremor (PD), essential tremor (ET) and voluntarily mimicked tremor represent fundamentally different motor phenomena, yet, magnetoencephalographic and imaging data suggest their origin in the same motor centers of the brain. Using EEG-EMG coherence and coherent source analysis we found a different pattern of corticomuscular delays, time courses and central representations for the basic and double tremor frequencies typical for PD suggesting a wider range defective oscillatory activity. For the basic tremor frequency similar central representations in primary sensorimotor, prefrontal/premotor and diencephalic (e.g. thalamic) areas were reproduced for all three tremors. But renormalized partial directed coherence of the spatially filtered (source) signals revealed a mainly unidirectional flow of information from the diencephalon to cortex in voluntary tremor, e.g. a thalamocortical relay, as opposed to a bidirectional subcortico-cortical flow in PD and ET promoting uncontrollable, e.g. thalamocortical, loop oscillations. Our results help to understand why pathological tremors although originating from the physiological motor network are not under voluntary control and they may contribute to the solution of the puzzle why high frequency thalamic stimulation has a selective effect on pathological tremor leaving voluntary movement performance almost unaltered.

Trend analysis for such suppression was found useful for intraoperative monitoring during carotid endarterectomy, or as a screening tool to detect delayed cerebral ischaemia after aneurismal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Nevertheless, pathogenesis of such suppression of activity has remained unclear. In five patients with aneurismal subarachnoid haemorrhage and four patients with decompressive hemicraniectomy after malignant hemispheric stroke due to middle cerebral artery occlusion, we here performed simultaneously full-band direct and alternating current electroencephalography at the scalp and direct and alternating current electrocorticography at the cortical surface. After subarachnoid haemorrhage, 275 slow potential changes, identifying spreading depolarizations, were recorded electrocorticographically over 694 h. Visual inspection of time-compressed scalp electroencephalography identified 193 (70.2%) slow potential changes [amplitude: -272 (-174, -375) mu V (median quartiles), duration: 5.4 (4.0, 7.1) min, electrocorticography-electroencephalography delay: 1.8 (0.8, 3.5) min]. Intervals between successive spreading depolarizations were significantly shorter for depolarizations with electroencephalographically identified slow potential change [33.0 (27.0, 76.5) versus 53.0 (28.0, 130.5) min, P = 0.009]. Electroencephalography was thus more likely to display slow potential changes of clustered than isolated spreading depolarizations. In contrast to electrocorticography, no spread of electroencephalographic slow potential changes was seen, presumably due to superposition of volume-conducted electroencephalographic signals from widespread cortical generators. In two of five patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage, serial magnetic resonance imaging revealed large delayed infarcts at the recording site, while electrocorticography showed clusters of spreading depolarizations with persistent depression of spontaneous activity. Alternating current electroencephalography similarly displayed persistent depression of spontaneous activity, and direct current electroencephalography slow potential changes riding on a shallow negative ultraslow potential. Isolated spreading depolarizations with depression of both spontaneous electrocorticographic and electroencephalographic activity displayed significantly longer intervals between successive spreading depolarizations than isolated depolarizations with only depression of electrocorticographic activity [44.0 (28.0, 132.0) min, n = 96, versus 30.0 (26.5, 51.5) min, n = 109, P = 0.001]. This suggests fusion of electroencephalographic depression periods at high depolarization frequency. No propagation of electroencephalographic depression was seen between scalp electrodes. Durations/magnitudes of isolated electroencephalographic and corresponding electrocorticographic depression periods correlated significantly. Fewer spreading depolarizations were recorded in patients with malignant hemispheric stroke but characteristics were similar to those after subarachnoid haemorrhage. In conclusion, spreading depolarizations and depressions of spontaneous activity display correlates in time-compressed human scalp direct and alternating current electroencephalography that may serve for their non-invasive detection.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Blood pressure oscillations; (De)oxyhemoglobin oscillations; EEG oscillations; Resting brain; Voluntary movement	BETA RHYTHMS; MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; CORTEX; TIME; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS	Characteristically within the resting brain there are slow fluctuations (around 0.1 Hz) of EEG and NIRS-(de)oxyhemoglobin ([deoxy-Hb], [oxy-Hb]) signals. An interesting question is whether such slow oscillations can be related to the intention to perform a motor act. To obtain an answer we analyzed continuous blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), prefrontal [oxy-Hb], [deoxy-Hb] and EEG signals over sensorimotor areas in 10 healthy subjects during 5 min of rest and during 10 min of voluntary finger movements. Analyses of prefrontal [oxy-Hb]/[deoxy-Hb] oscillations around 0.1 Hz and central EEG band power changes in the beta (alpha) band revealed that the positive [oxy-Hb] peaks preceded the central EEG beta (alpha) power peak by 3.6 +/- 0.9 s in the majority of subjects. A similar relationship between prefrontal [oxy-Hb] and central EEG beta power was found during voluntary movements whereby the post movement beta power increase (beta rebound) is known to coexist with a decreased excitability of cortico-spinal neurons. Therefore, we speculate that the beta power increase similar to 3 s after slow fluctuating [oxy-Hb] peaks during rest is indicative for a slow excitability change of central motor cortex neurons. This work provides the first evidence that initiation of finger movements at free will in relatively constant intervals around 10 s could be temporally related to slow oscillations of prefrontal [oxy-Hb] and autonomic blood pressure in the resting brain.

In 10 patients with extraoccipital lobe epilepsy, we compared the spectral-spatial characteristics of HFOs spontaneously arising from the nonepileptic occipital cortex with those of HFOs driven by a visual task as well as epileptogenic HFOs arising from the extraoccipital seizure focus. We identified spontaneous HFOs at =80 Hz with a mean duration of 330 ms intermittently emerging from the occipital cortex during interictal slow-wave sleep. The spectral frequency band of spontaneous occipital HFOs was similar to that of visually driven HFOs. Spontaneous occipital HFOs were spatially sparse and confined to smaller areas, whereas visually driven HFOs involved the larger areas including the more rostral sites. Neither spectral frequency band nor amplitude of spontaneous occipital HFOs significantly differed from those of epileptogenic HFOs. Spontaneous occipital HFOs were strongly locked to the phase of delta activity, but the strength of d-phase coupling decayed from 1 to 3 Hz. Conversely, epileptogenic extraoccipital HFOs were locked to the phase of delta activity about equally in the range from 1 to 3 Hz. The occipital cortex spontaneously generates physiological HFOs which may stand out on electrocorticography traces as prominently as pathological HFOs arising from elsewhere; this observation should be taken into consideration during presurgical evaluation. Coupling of spontaneous delta and HFOs may increase the understanding of significance of d-oscillations during slow-wave sleep. Further studies are warranted to determine whether d-phase coupling distinguishes physiological from pathological HFOs or simply differs across anatomical locations. Hum Brain Mapp , 2012.

However, its effectiveness depends on the subject-specific time segment relative to the visual cue and on the temporal frequency band that is often selected manually or heuristically. This paper presents a novel statistical method to automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment and temporal frequency band based on the mutual information between the spatial-temporal patterns from the EEG signals and the corresponding neuronal activities. The proposed method comprises four progressive stages: multi-time segment and temporal frequency band-pass filtering, CSP spatial filtering, mutual information-based feature selection and nave Bayesian classification. The proposed mutual information-based selection of optimal spatial-temporal patterns and its one-versus-rest multi-class extension were evaluated on single-trial EEG from the BCI Competition IV Datasets IIb and IIa respectively. The results showed that the proposed method yielded relatively better session-to-session classification results compared against the best submission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Coronary" Type of Personality: Peculiarities of the Coherence of Ongoing EEG	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						behavioral types A and B; Jenkins questionnaire; coherence; spectral power; EEG frequency components	OSCILLATIONS	We studied spatial organization of ongoing EEG activity in 60 adults of both sexes using multichannel recording and estimation of the coherence of EEG oscillations in different cortical loci. Behavioral types of the personality were qualified using the Jenkins questionnaire; opposite types A and B and an intermediate type AB were differentiated. Recording of EEG (21 leads, localization of the electrodes according to the 10-20 system) was performed in the resting state with the eyes closed. The subgroup of subjects belonging to the AB behavioral type, despite high interindividual variability, was in general characterized by greater values of the coherence coefficients K-coh of low-frequency (delta and theta) oscillations. The subgroup of persons of the "coronary" behavioral type A demonstrated, as a whole, greater mean values of the K-coh for alpha and beta 1 oscillations, while greater values of this coefficient for gamma activity were found in type-B persons. Values of the K-coh calculated for the entire EEG spectrum were higher in type-A subjects. The latter individuals differed significantly from type-B persons by smaller K-coh values for delta oscillations in the Fp1-F3 lead pair, for gamma oscillations, in the T3-T5 pair, and for alpha oscillations, in the O1-O2 pair. Simultaneously, greater K-coh values in these subjects (type A) for the theta rhythm were found in the C3-C4, P3-O1, and C4-P4 pairs; similar differences for the alpha range were found in the P3-O1 and P4-O2. For beta 1 oscillations, this was observed in the C3-C4, F3-C3, P3-O1, and C4-P4, and for beta 2 oscillations, in the C3-C4 pair. Thus, a greatest number of significant differences between the K-coh values in persons of the behavioral types A and B were observed for oscillations of the theta, alpha, and beta 1 ranges with an emphasis in the C3-C4 and P3-O1 lead pairs.

First published February 1, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00543.2011.-Dynamic changes in spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms can be seen to occur with a high rate of variability. An innovative method to study brain function is by triggering oscillatory brain activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). EEG-TMS coregistration was performed on five healthy subjects during a 1-day experimental session that involved four steps: baseline acquisition, unconditioned single-pulse TMS, intracortical inhibition (ICI, 3 ms) paired-pulse TMS, and transcallosal stimulation over left and right primary motor cortex (M1). A time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet method was used to characterize rapid modifications of oscillatory EEG rhythms induced by TMS. Single, paired, and transcallosal TMS applied on the sensorimotor areas induced rapid desynchronization over the frontal and central-parietal electrodes mainly in the alpha and beta bands, followed by a rebound of synchronization, and rapid synchronization of delta and theta activity. Wavelet analysis after a perturbation approach is a novel way to investigate modulation of oscillatory brain activity. The main findings are consistent with the concept that the human motor system may be based on networklike oscillatory cortical activity and might be modulated by single, paired, and transcallosal magnetic pulses applied to M1, suggesting a phenomenon of fast brain activity resetting and triggering of slow activity.

Multiweek Resting EEG Cordance Change Patterns from Repeated Olfactory Activation with Two Constitutionally Salient Homeopathic Remedies in Healthy Young Adults	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							TIME-DEPENDENT SENSITIZATION; BRAIN FUNCTIONAL-CHANGES; CHEMICAL-SENSITIVITY; CLINICAL RESPONDERS; PATHOGENETIC TRIALS; CEREBRAL PERFUSION; POSSIBLE MODEL; OSCILLATION; SYMPTOMS; PLACEBO	Objectives: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers psychophysiologic tools to improve sensitivity for detecting objective effects in complementary and alternative medicine. This current investigation extended prior clinical research studies to evaluate effects of one of two different homeopathic remedies on resting EEG cordance after an olfactory activation protocol on healthy young adults with remedy-relevant, self-perceived characteristics. Methods: Ninety-seven (7) young adults (N=97, mean age 19 years, 55% women) with good self-rated global health and screened for homeopathic constitutional types consistent with one of two remedies (either Sulphur or Pulsatilla) underwent three weekly laboratory sessions. At each visit, subjects had 5-minute resting, eyes-closed EEG recordings before and after a placebo-controlled olfactory activation task with their constitutionally relevant verum remedy. One remedy potency (6c, 12c, or 30c) used per week, was presented in a randomized order over the 3 sessions. Prefrontal resting EEG cordance values at Fp1 and Fp2 were computed from artifact-free 2-minute EEG samples from the presniffing and postsniffing rest periods. Cordance derives from an algorithm that incorporates absolute and relative EEG values. Results: The data showed significant two-way oscillatory interactions of remedy by time for beta, alpha, theta, and delta cordance, controlling for gender and chemical sensitivity. Conclusions: EEG cordance provided a minimally invasive technique for assessing objective nonlinear physiologic effects of two different homeopathic remedies salient to the individuals who received them. Time factors modulated the direction of effects. Given previous evidence of correlations between cordance and single-photon emission computed tomography, these findings encourage additional neuroimaging research on nonlinear psychophysiologic effects of specific homeopathic remedies.

We report the work on autism by our international group, on the growing attention paid to EEG based diagnosis and the interest in tracing EEG changes to brain electromagnetic signals (BEMS), seeking the cause of autism and the brain regions of its origin. The time- and frequency domain and principal component analysis (PCA) of these EEG signals with a Multilayer Perception Neural Network (MLP) identifies an autistic subject and helps improve classification accuracy. We show differences between a working brain and a relaxed brain, especially in the Alpha waves used for diagnosis.	[Hoole, P. R.

Until now, the responses have been characterized mainly using across-trial averaging in the time domain. Unfortunately, chemosensory ERPs, in particular, olfactory ERPs, exhibit a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, although the technique is increasingly used in basic research as well as in clinical practice to evaluate people suffering from olfactory disorders, its current clinical relevance remains very limited. Here, we used a time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform to reveal EEG responses that are not strictly phase-locked to onset of the chemosensory stimulus. We hypothesized that this approach would significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG responses to chemosensory stimulation because, as compared to conventional time-domain averaging, (1) it is less sensitive to temporal jitter and (2) it can reveal non phase-locked EEG responses such as event-related synchronization and desynchronization. Methodology/Principal Findings: EEG responses to selective trigeminal and olfactory stimulation were recorded in 11 normosmic subjects. A Morlet wavelet was used to characterize the elicited responses in the time-frequency domain. We found that this approach markedly improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the obtained EEG responses, in particular, following olfactory stimulation. Furthermore, the approach allowed characterizing non phase-locked components that could not be identified using conventional time-domain averaging. Conclusion/Significance: By providing a more robust and complete view of how odors are represented in the human brain, our approach could constitute the basis for a robust tool to study olfaction, both for basic research and clinicians.

This paper proposes improvements to a previously described method of seizure detection based on atomic decomposition by developing a new time-frequency (TF) dictionary that is highly coherent with the newborn EEG seizure. We compare the performance of the proposed dictionary on neonatal EEG signals with that achieved using Gabor, Fourier and wavelet dictionaries. Through the analysis of real newborn EEG data, we show first, that dictionary selection can influence the seizure detection accuracy and second, that the proposed dictionary outperforms other dictionaries by at least 10% in seizure detection accuracy and 5% improvement in the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve.

The EpiScan [1-4] seizure detection algorithm developed by the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) has proven to achieve high detection performance with a robust false alarm rate in the clinical setting. This paper introduces a novel time domain method for detection of epileptic seizure patterns with focus on irregular and distorted rhythmic activity. The method scans the EEG for sequences of similar epileptiform discharges and uses a combination of duration and similarity measure to decide for a seizure. The resulting method was tested on an EEG database with 275 patients including over 22000h of unselected and uncut EEG recording and 623 seizures. Used in combination with the EpiScan algorithm we increased the overall sensitivity from 70% to 73% while reducing the false alarm rate from 0.33 to 0.30 alarms per hour.

Among these artifacts, blinks and eye movements are the most common of them. In this paper, we introduce a new method, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), for removal of blink contamination from EEG signal. The proposed method is compared to a fourth order Butterworth high-pass filtering with cutoff frequency at 2 Hz. The performance index of our experiment is mean square error (MSE) between bands of pure EEG and corrected EEG. Results obtained from the analysis of contaminated EEG signal show that EMD method outperforms the high pass filtering for elimination of blink contamination from EEG. However, EMD could not be applied on-line.

In the present study, we employed time-frequency analysis to investigate the neural activity associated with CD and change blindness (CB). Observers were presented with two successive visual displays and had to look for a change in orientation in any one of four sinusoid gratings between both displays. Theta power increased widely over the scalp after the second display when a change was consciously detected. Relative to no-change and CD, CB was associated with a pronounced theta power enhancement at parietal-occipital and occipital sites and broadly distributed alpha power suppression during the processing of the prechange display. Finally, power suppressions in the beta band following the second display show that, even when a change is not consciously detected, it might be represented to a certain degree. These results show the potential of time-frequency analysis to deepen our knowledge of the temporal curse of the neural events underlying CD. The results further reveal that the process resulting in CB begins even before the occurrence of the change itself.

Neurophysiological studies have recently begun to investigate the brain correlates of these strategies. The existing body of data, however, reflect static end points of the learning process and do not provide information on how brain activity changes in response to training or intervention. In this study, we explicitly address this issue by training participants in using fact retrieval strategies. We also investigate whether brain activity related to arithmetic fact learning is domain-specific or whether this generalizes to other learning materials, such as the solution of figural-spatial problems. Twenty adult students were trained on sets of two-digit multiplication problems and figural-spatial problems. After the training, they were presented with the trained and untrained problems while their brain activity was recorded by means of electroencephalography (EEG). In both problem types, the training resulted in accuracies over 90% and significant decreases in solution times. Analyses of the oscillatory EEG data also revealed training effects across both problem types. Specifically, we observed training-related activity increases in the theta band (3-6 Hz) and decreases in the lower alpha band (8-10 Hz), especially over parietooccipital and parietal brain regions. These results provide the first evidence that a short-term fact retrieval training results in significant changes in oscillatory EEG activity. These findings further corroborate the role of the theta band in the retrieval of semantic information from memory and suggest that theta activity is sensitive to fact retrieval not only in mental arithmetic but also in other domains.

In this work we present a novel classification framework based on Regularized Linear Regression classifier constructed from time-frequency decomposition of an EEG (electro-encephalography) signal. The regression is then used to derive a model of frequency distributions that identifies brain states. The process of classifier construction, preprocessing and selection of optimal regularization parameter by means of cross-validation is presented and discussed. The framework and the feature selection technique are demonstrated on EEG data recorded from 10 healthy subjects while requested to open and close their eyes every 30 s. This paradigm is well known in inducing Alpha power modulations that differ from low power (during eyes opened) to high (during eyes closed). The classifier was trained to infer eyes opened or eyes closed states and achieved higher than 90% classification accuracy. Furthermore, our findings reveal interesting patterns of relations between experimental conditions, EEG frequencies, regularization parameters and classifier choice. This viable tool enables identification of the most contributing frequency bands to any given brain state and their optimal combination in inferring this state. These features allow for much greater detail than the standard Fourier Transform power analysis, making it an essential method for both BCI proposes and neuroimaging research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

ANXIETY LEVEL AND EEG INDEXES	EKSPERIMENTALNAYA PSIKHOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						EEG rhythms; system.genesis; age; anxiety		The aim of this research was to study EEG maturation in children in different social groups (O orphans, C - control). In this article we present results of spectral power density (SPD) of EEG rhythms in age groups (O - 2 groups, C - 4 groups). According to the literature, the main direction of changes of the EEG rhythms in ontogenesis is a decline in the slow oscillations and enhance in the fast oscillations. We predicted that EEG maturation would be different in two groups. As we have expected our results showed that the slow frequency SPD was higher in O group in comparison to C group in the same age. No significant differences in the fast frequency were found. In addition, we revealed the high level of anxiety in 11- 2 years-old orphans group which was reflected in the Alpha/Delta index.

These transformations can be used to discuss the frequency characteristics of linear and stationary signals, the time-frequency features of linear and non-stationary signals, the time-frequency features of non-linear and non-stationary signals, respectively. The Hilbert-Huang transformation is a combination of empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert spectral analysis. The empirical mode decomposition uses the characteristics of signals to adaptively decompose them to several intrinsic mode functions. Hilbert transforms are then used to transform the intrinsic mode functions into instantaneous frequencies, to obtain the signal's time-frequency-energy distributions and features. Hilbert-Huang transformation-based time-frequency analysis can be applied to natural physical signals such as earthquake waves, winds, ocean acoustic signals, mechanical diagnosis signals, and biomedical signals. In previous studies, we examined Hilbert-Huang transformation-based time-frequency analysis of the electroencephalogram FP1 signals of clinical alcoholics, and 'sharp I' wave-based Hilbert-Huang transformation time-frequency features. In this paper, we discuss the application of Hilbert-Huang transformation-based time-frequency analysis to biomedical signals, such as electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram signals, electrogastrogram recordings, and speech signals.

The algorithm combines the universal approximation characteristics of neural networks and the time/frequency property of wavelet transform, where the neural network was trained on a simulated dataset with known ground truths. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, many EEG artifact removal algorithms, including regression based methods, require reference EOG signals, which are not always available. The WNN algorithm tries to learn the characteristics of EOG from training data and once trained, the algorithm does not need EOG recordings for artifact removal. Second, the proposed method is computationally efficient, making it a reliable real time algorithm. We compared the proposed algorithm to the independent component analysis (ICA) technique and an adaptive wavelet thresholding method on both simulated and real EEG datasets. Experimental results show that the WNN algorithm can remove EEG artifacts effectively without diminishing useful EEG information even for very noisy datasets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Several authors have shown that the canonical polyadic decomposition (also called ParaFac) of space-time-frequency (STF) data can be used to fit equivalent dipoles to the electric potential data. In this paper we propose a new multi-way approach based on space-time-wave-vector (STWV) data obtained by a 3D local Fourier transform over space accomplished on the measured data. This method can be seen as a preprocessing step that separates the sources, reduces noise as well as interference and extracts the source time signals. The results can further be used to localize either equivalent dipoles or distributed sources increasing the performance of conventional source localization techniques like, for example, LORETA. Moreover, we propose a new, iterative source localization algorithm, called Binary Coefficient Matching Pursuit (BCMP), which is based on a realistic distributed source model. Computer simulations are used to examine the performance of the STWV analysis in comparison to the STF technique for equivalent dipole fitting and to evaluate the efficiency of the STWV approach in combination with LORETA and BCMP, which leads to better results in case of the considered distributed source scenarios.

In this work, we aim to understand the nature of the event related oscillation (ERO) components which form the basis for N170 wave (face marker) and how these components may be used to differentiates domain specific nature of the brain in recognizing animate objects (faces) from inanimate objects (house). Event related potentials (ERPs) studies along with S-Transform decomposition method are used to pin down the ERO measures integrating with temporal integration. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA to find out the differences of specific regions for object processing in human brain. The results indicate that effect of face recognition is better compared to objects in right occipito and occipito-temporal region than left hemisphere and the time of differentiation is more in case of inanimate objects compared to faces (animate). Secondly, N170 ERP waveform, known as the face-marker is composed of contribution from various brain waves in unique pattern. ERO measures which underlie and compose N170 wave provide additional information to that offered by conventional ERP amplitude measures and serve as a useful genetic markers in the study of prosopagnosia. Studies on object and face processing using ERP integrating with time-frequency analysis opens a new avenue of research in neuroelectrophysiology. This may lead to better understanding of cognitive processing lead to improved clinical diagnosis and provide pathways to understand early visual differences in object recognition in human brain.

To infer functional connectivity from observed neural signals, various methods have been proposed. Among them, phase synchronization analysis is an important and effective one which examines the relationship of instantaneous phase between neural signals but neglecting the influence of their amplitudes. In this paper, we review the advances in methodologies of phase synchronization analysis. In particular, we discuss the definitions of instantaneous phase, the indexes of phase synchronization and their significance test, the issues that may affect the detection of phase synchronization and the extensions of phase synchronization analysis. In practice, phase synchronization analysis may be affected by observational noise, insufficient samples of the signals, volume conduction, and reference in recording neural signals. We make comments and suggestions on these issues so as to better apply phase synchronization analysis to inferring functional connectivity from neural signals.

Previous studies have suggested that resting state brain activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) may represent an objective biomarker of changes in neural function associated with supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs. It has also been proposed that although resting state EEG cannot, by itself, predict transition to psychosis in UHR individuals, the combination of resting state EEG with negative symptoms may be a valid predictor of transition. The present study investigated whether treatment with omega-3 PUFAs influenced resting state EEG in UHR participants, and whether or not the association of the participants' resting state EEG with their levels of negative symptoms was dependent on their transition status. The brain activity of 73 UHR participants was recorded in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs. The UHR participants who subsequently transitioned to psychosis (UHR+) did not differ from those who did not transition (UHR-) in terms of resting state EEG power in any frequency band. However, negative symptom scores were associated with increased delta activity in the frontal region of the UHR+ participants, but not in the UHR- participants. Treatment with omega-3 PUFAs did not induce changes in resting state EEG in either group. The results suggest that decreased frontal delta activity, in combination with high levels of negative symptoms, may be a risk factor for subsequent transition to psychosis in UHR individuals.

These evoked the specific related frequency rhythms. But the problem appears as theses rhythms change due subject and imagination task. While some subject is fast induce the electrical signal rhythms, other has long latency in induce them. This related time temporal problem of imagination. To boost the accuracy of EEG signal translation for reliable system, in this paper, we proposed a method for extracting optimal feature. First, EEG signals were extracted and apply to Laplace filter and band pass filter with pass band frequency of 7Hz to 40Hz. Channels C3, Cz, and C4 were applied to Short-Time Fourier Transform with frequency band of 1Hz. R-square correlation coefficient of three channels were found and selected the best frequency and time parameter. Finally, with the selected parameters, optimal STFT feature extracted. We simulated the classification accuracy with linear discriminant analysis with BCI competition IV, III and our laboratory dataset.

At the macroscopic EEG level in the human brain, no evidences were reported so far. In this study, by using simultaneous scalp and intracranial EEG recordings in 20 epileptic subjects, we examined gamma oscillations in cerebral cortex during SWS. We report that gamma oscillations in low (30-50 Hz) and high (60-120 Hz) frequency bands recurrently emerged in all investigated regions and their amplitudes coincided with specific phases of the cortical slow wave. In most of the cases, multiple oscillatory bursts in different frequency bands from 30 to 120 Hz were correlated with positive peaks of scalp slow waves ("IN-phase'' pattern), confirming previous animal findings. In addition, we report another gamma pattern that appears preferentially during the negative phase of the slow wave ("ANTI-phase'' pattern). This new pattern presented dominant peaks in the high gamma range and was preferentially expressed in the temporal cortex. Finally, we found that the spatial coherence between cortical sites exhibiting gamma activities was local and fell off quickly when computed between distant sites. Overall, these results provide the first human evidences that gamma oscillations can be observed in macroscopic EEG recordings during sleep. They support the concept that these high-frequency activities might be associated with phasic increases of neural activity during slow oscillations. Such patterned activity in the sleeping brain could play a role in off-line processing of cortical networks.

In this work, we tried to calculate signal FD directly from its Fourier amplitudes. First, dependence of Higuchi's FD of mathematical sinusoids on their individual frequencies was modeled with a two-parameter exponential function. Next, FD of a finite sum of sinusoids was found to be a weighted average of their FDs, weighting factors being their Fourier amplitudes raised to a fractal degree. Exponent dependence on frequency was modeled with exponential, power and logarithmic functions. A set of 280 EEG signals and Weierstrass functions were analyzed. Cross-validation was done within EEG signals and between them and Weierstrass functions. Exponential dependence of fractal exponents on frequency was found to be the most accurate. In this work, signal FD was for the first time expressed as a fractal weighted average of FD values of its Fourier components, also allowing researchers to perform direct estimation of signal fractal dimension from its FFT spectrum.

Hierarchical Organization of Gamma and Theta Oscillatory Dynamics in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory steady-state response; cross-frequency coupling; gamma oscillations; neural oscillations; schizophrenia; theta oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BAND RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE; EEG	Background: Schizophrenia patients have deficits across a broad range of important cognitive and clinical domains. Synchronization of oscillations in the gamma frequency range (similar to 40 Hz) is associated with many normal cognitive functions and underlies at least some of the deficits observed in schizophrenia patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that gamma oscillations are modulated by the phase of theta waves, and this cross-frequency coupling indicates that a complex and hierarchical organization governs neural oscillatory dynamics. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have abnormalities in the amplitude, synchrony, and cross-frequency coupling of gamma and theta oscillations in response to gamma-frequency steady-state stimulation and if abnormal neural oscillatory dynamics are associated with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Methods: Schizophrenia patients (n = 234) and healthy control subjects (n = 188) underwent electroencephalography testing in response to 40-Hz auditory steady-state stimulation. Cognitive functions were assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results: Schizophrenia patients had significantly reduced gamma intertrial phase coherence, increased theta amplitude, and intact cross-frequency coupling relative to healthy control subjects. In schizophrenia patients, increased theta amplitude was associated with poor verbal memory performance. Conclusions: Results suggest that schizophrenia patients have specific alterations in both gamma and theta oscillations, but these deficits occur in the context of an intact hierarchical organization of their cross-frequency modulation in response to 40-Hz steady-state stimulation. Cortical oscillatory dynamics may be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie the disparate cognitive and functional impairments of schizophrenia.

Methods: The detector first finds localized increments of the signal power in narrow frequency bands. A simple classification based on two features, a narrowband to wideband signal amplitude ratio and an absolute narrowband signal amplitude, then allows for an important reduction in the number of false positives. Results: When compared to an expert, the performance in 15 focal epilepsy patients resulted in 3.6 false positives per minute at 95% sensitivity, with at least 40% of the detected events being true positives. In most of the patients the channels showing the highest number of events according to the expert and the automatic detector were the same. Conclusions: A high sensitivity is achieved with the proposed automatic detector, but results should be reviewed by an expert to remove false positives. Significance: The time required to mark fast oscillations on scalp EEG recordings is drastically reduced with the use of the proposed detector. Thus, the automatic detector is a useful tool in studies aiming to create a better understanding of the fast oscillations visible on the scalp.

Sleep staging is clinically important in the assessment of sleep quality. The usual method for sleep staging is time consuming and laborious procedure since it depends on the experience and visual inspection of sleep experts. Different characteristic waves like k-complex, sleep spindles, vertex and slow waves are often found in EEG signal during different sleep stages. Detection of these characteristic waveforms in the EEG is an important component of sleep staging. These characteristic waves are having typical signature waveforms, which are non-stationary in nature. Therefore, in this work, an attempt was made to identify these characteristic waves using continuous wavelet transform. Finally, it is emphasized that the features extracted from the time frequency analysis is quite robust in identifying these characteristic waves.

Magnetoencephalography with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer	BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							RESPONSES; FIELD	We report on the measurement of somatosensory-evoked and spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer (CSAM) based on optical spectroscopy of alkali atoms. The uncooled, fiber-coupled CSAM has a sensitive volume of 0.77 mm(3) inside a sensor head of volume 1 cm(3) and enabled convenient handling, similar to an electroencephalography (EEG) electrode. When positioned over O1 of a healthy human subject, alpha-oscillations were observed in the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the scalp surface. Furthermore, by stimulation at the right wrist of the subject, somatosensory-evoked fields were measured with the sensors placed over C3. Higher noise levels of the CSAM were partly compensated by higher signal amplitudes due to the shorter distance between CSAM and scalp. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America	[Sander, T.

Methods: The algorithm used a wavelet packet-based independent component analysis (WPICA) method to extract the ERD/ERS patterns in different frequency bands. Time-frequency decomposition in the wavelet packet domain was designed to avoid the statistical correlation between different electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. The subband-specific principal components were extracted after independent component analysis and projected back to the time-frequency domain of corresponding electrodes for better fitting the varying EEG spatial distributions. Results: The present method was tested with the EEG data from 10 human subjects performing three complex mental tasks (i.e., imagery standing up, imagery left/right foot movement combined with homolateral hand movement). A classification rate of about 80% was achieved using the WPICA-based technique, which is better than the traditional ICA method with the rate of 72.30% and the non-spatial filtering condition of 68.34%. Conclusions: We developed a novel spatial filtering method based on WPICA to extract the ERD/ERS patterns in different frequency bands. The overall performance of this algorithm was better than that of the conventional methods. Significance: The current method promised to provide an effective way for ERD/ERS patterns recognition and thus could improve the pattern classification performance of complex mental tasks from scalp EEGs.

Detection of hypoglycemia associated EEG changes during sleep in type 1 diabetes mellitus	DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						Type 1 diabetes; Hypoglycemia; Alarm; Real-time EEG; Unawareness	INSULIN-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA; IMPAIRED AWARENESS; FREQUENCY; ADULTS; RISK	Objective: Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a feared complication to insulin treated diabetes. Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia. EEG changes are demonstrated during daytime hypoglycemia. In this explorative study, we test the hypothesis that specific hypoglycemia-associated EEG-changes occur during sleep and are detectable in time for the patient to take action. Research design and methods: Ten patients with type 1 diabetes (duration 23.7 years) with IAH were exposed to insulin-induced hypoglycemia during the daytime and during sleep. EEG was recorded and analyzed real-time by an automated multi-parameter algorithm. Participants received an auditory alarm when EEG changes met a predefined threshold, and were instructed to consume a meal. Results: Seven out of eight participants developed hypoglycemia-associated EEG changes during daytime. During sleep, nine out of ten developed EEG changes (mean BG 2.0 mmol/l). Eight were awakened by the alarm. Four corrected hypoglycemia (mean BG 2.2 mmol/l), while four (mean BG 1.9 mmol/l) received glucose infusion. Two had false alarms. EEG-changes occurred irrespective of sleep stage. Post hoc improvement indicates the possibility of earlier detection of hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Continuous EEG monitoring and automated real-time analysis may constitute a novel technique for a hypoglycemia alarm in patients with IAH. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In experienced meditators (13 Tibetan Buddhists, 15 QiGong, 14 Sahaja Yoga, 14 Ananda Marga Yoga, 15 Zen), 19-channel EEG was recorded before, during and after that meditation exercise which their respective tradition regards as route to the most desirable meditative state. The head surface EEG data were recomputed (sLORETA) into 19 cortical regional source model time series. All 171 functional connectivities between regions were computed as 'lagged coherence' for the eight EEG frequency bands (delta through gamma). This analysis removes ambiguities of localization, volume conduction-induced inflation of coherence, and reference-dependence. All significant differences (corrected for multiple testing) between meditation compared to no-task rest before and after meditation showed lower coherence during meditation, in all five traditions and eight (inhibitory as well as excitatory) frequency bands. Conventional coherence between the original head surface EEG time series very predominantly also showed reduced coherence during meditation. The topography of the functional connectivities was examined via PCA-based computation of principal connectivities. When going into and out of meditation, significantly different connectivities revealed clearly different topographies in the delta frequency band and minor differences in the beta-2 band. The globally reduced functional interdependence between brain regions in meditation suggests that interaction between the self process functions is minimized, and that constraints on the self process by other processes are minimized, thereby leading to the subjective experience of non-involvement, detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution of ego borders during meditation.

Most studies on hemianopia stroke have mainly focused on cortical activation during visual stimulation, leaving the pattern of functional connectivity between different brain regions uncovered yet. In the present study, we investigate the resting neural networks of hemianopia stroke patients by graph theoretical analysis of functional brain networks constructed with phase synchronization indexes of multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our results showed that although the global network topological metrics, i.e., weighted clustering coefficient and characteristic path length of patients and healthy controls are comparable, the left primary visual cortex of patients tend to be less active than that of age-matched healthy subjects. However, hemianopia patients showed greater activation in the ipsilesional (left) temporopolar and orbit frontal areas and the contralesional (right) associative visual cortex. These results may offer new insight into neural substrates of the hemianopia stroke, and the further study of neural plasticity and brain reorganization after hemianopia.

Neural Activations During Auditory Oddball Processing Discriminating Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory oddball; ERP; P300; PCA; psychosis; time-frequency	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; EVOKED-RESPONSE; CANDIDATE GENE; GAMMA; ABNORMALITIES; DISC1; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ENDOPHENOTYPES	Background: Reduced amplitude of the P300 event-related potential in auditory oddball tasks may characterize schizophrenia (SZ) but is also reported in bipolar disorder. Similarity of auditory processing abnormalities between these diagnoses is uncertain, given the frequent combination of both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients in bipolar samples; abnormalities may be restricted to psychosis. In addition, typically only latency and amplitude of brain responses at selected sensors and singular time points are used to characterize neural responses. Comprehensive quantification of brain activations involving both spatiotemporal and time-frequency analyses could better identify unique auditory oddball responses among patients with different psychotic disorders. Methods: Sixty SZ, 60 bipolar I with psychosis (BPP), and 60 healthy subjects (H) were compared on neural responses during an auditory oddball task using multisensor electroencephalography. Principal components analysis was used to reduce multisensor data before evaluating group differences on voltage and frequency of neural responses over time. Results: Linear discriminant analysis revealed five variables that best differentiated groups: 1) late beta activity to standard stimuli; 2) late beta/gamma activity to targets discriminated BPP from other groups; 3) midlatency theta/alpha activity to standards; 4) target-related voltage at the late N2 response discriminated both psychosis groups from H; and 5) target-related voltage during early N2 discriminated BPP from H. Conclusions: Although the P300 significantly differentiated psychotic groups from H, it did not uniquely discriminate groups beyond the above variables. No variable uniquely discriminated SZ, perhaps indicating utility of this task for studying psychosis-associated neurophysiology generally and BPP specifically.

Seven subjects participated in a task in which attention was cued to one of two spatial locations at left and right. Subjects were instructed to report the speech stimulus at the cued location and to ignore a simultaneous speech stream originating from the uncued location. EEG was recorded from the onset of the directional cue through the offset of the inter-stimulus interval (ISI), during which attention was directed toward the cued location. Using a wavelet spectrum, each frequency band was then normalized by the mean level of power observed in the early part of the cue interval to obtain a measure of induced power related to the deployment of attention. Topographies of band specific induced power during the cue and inter-stimulus intervals showed peaks over symmetric bilateral scalp areas. We used a bootstrap analysis of a lateralization measure defined for symmetric groups of channels in each band to identify specific lateralization events throughout the ISI. Our results suggest that the deployment and maintenance of spatially oriented attention throughout a period of 1,100 ms is marked by distinct episodes of reliable hemispheric lateralization ipsilateral to the direction in which attention is oriented. An early theta lateralization was evident over posterior parietal electrodes and was sustained throughout the ISI. In the alpha and mu bands punctuated episodes of parietal power lateralization were observed roughly 500 ms after attentional deployment, consistent with previous studies of visual attention. In the beta band these episodes show similar patterns of lateralization over frontal motor areas. These results indicate that spatial attention involves similar mechanisms in the auditory and visual modalities.

LEXICAL DECISION MAKING IN ADULTS WITH DYSLEXIA: AN EVENT RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY	ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH AND CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						developmental dyslexia; English; bilingual; electrophysiology; oscillation; theta; gamma; coherence; EEG; ErP; reading; cerebral laterality	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; EEG COHERENCE; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; PROFICIENCY; MECHANISMS; LATERALITY; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS	Performance on a lexical decision task was investigated in 12 English speaking adults with dyslexia. two age-matched comparison groups of unimpaired readers were included: 14 monolingual adults and 15 late proficient bilinguals. The aim of the study was to determine the timing of neural events with event-related potentials (ErPs) during lexical decisionmaking between individuals with dyslexia and unimpaired readers (both unilingual and bilingual). ErPs were calculated for posterior sites in the left and right hemispheres and the P1 and n170 components were compared between groups. Eventrelated EEG coherence (measuring the synchrony of neural events during lexical tasks both between and within cerebral hemispheres) was also calculated for seven electrode pairs (three pairs at symmetrical locations between hemispheres, and two pairs within each hemisphere). We chose to recruit two comparison groups of unimpaired readers to better clarify the findings resulting from the right hemisphere (EEG) coherence analysis. That is, both late-proficient bilinguals and adults with dyslexia are thought to rely on right hemisphere resources during reading. We hypothesized that those with dyslexia would show less within-hemisphere coherence and more betweenhemisphere coherence than bilingual individuals. dyslexics had both lower amplitude and longer latency n170 activation than unimpaired readers, suggesting asynchronous neural activity. dyslexics showed greater synchrony between hemispheres in gamma range frequencies whereas the bilingual group showed greater synchrony in the theta frequency band (both within and between hemispheres). This study demonstrates that individuals with developmental dyslexia have reduced amplitudes in the n170 and higher synchrony between hemispheres during a reading task. The differences may be due to an asynchrony of neuronal activity at the point where word form features are distinguished.

J	Chandran, V				Chandran, Vinod			Time-varying bispectral analysis of visually evoked multi-channel EEG	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						EEG; HOS; Human vision; Bicoherence; Time-varying	SPECTRA; STATISTICS; SIGNALS	Theoretical foundations of higher order spectral analysis are revisited to examine the use of time-varying bicoherence on non-stationary signals using a classical short-time Fourier approach. A methodology is developed to apply this to evoked EEG responses where a stimulus-locked time reference is available. Short-time windowed ensembles of the response at the same offset from the reference are considered as ergodic cyclostationary processes within a non-stationary random process. Bicoherence can be estimated reliably with known levels at which it is significantly different from zero and can be tracked as a function of offset from the stimulus. When this methodology is applied to multi-channel EEG, it is possible to obtain information about phase synchronization at different regions of the brain as the neural response develops. The methodology is applied to analyze evoked EEG response to flash visual stimulii to the left and right eye separately. The EEG electrode array is segmented based on bicoherence evolution with time using the mean absolute difference as a measure of dissimilarity. Segment maps confirm the importance of the occipital region in visual processing and demonstrate a link between the frontal and occipital regions during the response. Maps are constructed using bicoherence at bifrequencies that include the alpha band frequency of 8Hz as well as 4 and 20Hz. Differences are observed between responses from the left eye and the right eye, and also between subjects. The methodology shows potential as a neurological functional imaging technique that can be further developed for diagnosis and monitoring using scalp EEG which is less invasive and less expensive than magnetic resonance imaging.

J	Engell, AD; Huettel, S; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; Huettel, Scott; McCarthy, Gregory			The fMRI BOLD signal tracks electrophysiological spectral perturbations, not event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ECoG; ERP; Gamma; Hemodynamic	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREAS; EEG	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are primary tools of the psychological neurosciences. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses. An early study by Huettel and colleagues found that the coupling of fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal (BOLD) and subdurally-recorded signal-averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) was not consistent across brain regions. Instead, a growing body of evidence now indicates that hemodynamic changes measured by fMRI reflect non-phase-locked changes in high frequency power rather than the phase-locked ERP. Here, we revisit the data from Huettel and colleagues and measure event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) to examine the time course of frequency changes. We found that, unlike the ERP, gamma-ERSP power was consistently coupled with the hemodynamic response across three visual cortical regions. Stimulus duration modulated the BOLD signal and the gamma-ERSP in the peri-calcarine and fusiform cortices, whereas there was no such modulation of either physiological signal in the lateral temporal-occipital cortex. This finding reconciles the original report with the more recent literature and demonstrates that the ERP and ERSP reflect dissociable aspects of neural activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

EEG-Guided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Reveals Rapid Shifts in Motor Cortical Excitability during the Human Sleep Slow Oscillation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; NREM SLEEP; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULUS DETECTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; LOW-FREQUENCY; WAVE ACTIVITY	Evoked cortical responses do not follow a rigid input-output function but are dynamically shaped by intrinsic neural properties at the time of stimulation. Recent research has emphasized the role of oscillatory activity in determining cortical excitability. Here we employed EEG-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during non-rapid eye movement sleep to examine whether the spontaneous <1Hz neocortical slow oscillation (SO) is associated with corresponding fluctuations of evoked responses. Whereas the SO's alternating phases of global depolarization (up-state) and hyperpolarization (down-state) are clearly associated with fluctuations in spontaneous neuronal excitation, less is known about state-dependent shifts in neocortical excitability. In 12 human volunteers, single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortical hand area (M1(HAND)) was triggered online by automatic detection of SO up-states and down-states in the EEG. State-dependent changes in cortical excitability were traced by simultaneously recording motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). Compared to wakefulness and regardless of SO state, sleep MEPs were smaller and delayed whereas sleep TEPs were fundamentally altered, closely resembling a spontaneous SO. However, both MEPs and TEPs were consistently larger when evoked during SO up-states than during down-states, and ampliudes within each SO state depended on the actual EEG potential at the time and site of stimulation. These results provide first-time evidence for a rapid state-dependent shift in neocortical excitability during a neuronal oscillation in the human brain. We further demonstrate that EEG-guided temporal neuronavigation is a powerful tool to investigate the phase-dependent effects of neuronal oscillations on perception, cognition, and motor control.

HHT is employed because most biomedical signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound signals are non-stationary signals. Heart sound signals recordings are often contaminated with the spike noise caused by the front-end circuits or measurement instruments in the real situations. A digital median filter is firstly employed to remove the spike noise of the heart sound signals. Then, the time series data are decomposed into several IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Function) using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm. Hilbert transformation algorithm is utilized to acquire the instantaneous frequency for every IMF. Simulation results show that time-frequency domain analysis of heart sounds signals based on HHT algorithm is able to offer higher frequency resolution.

Neural Correlates of True and False Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; OLDER-ADULTS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; HILBERT SPECTRUM	The goal of this research was to investigate the changes in neural processing in mild cognitive impairment. We measured phase synchrony, amplitudes, and event-related potentials in veridical and false memory to determine whether these differed in participants with mild cognitive impairment compared with typical, age-matched controls. Empirical mode decomposition phase locking analysis was used to assess synchrony, which is the first time this analysis technique has been applied in a complex cognitive task such as memory processing. The technique allowed assessment of changes in frontal and parietal cortex connectivity over time during a memory task, without a priori selection of frequency ranges, which has been shown previously to influence synchrony detection. Phase synchrony differed significantly in its timing and degree between participant groups in the theta and alpha frequency ranges. Timing differences suggested greater dependence on gist memory in the presence of mild cognitive impairment. The group with mild cognitive impairment had significantly more frontal theta phase locking than the controls in the absence of a significant behavioural difference in the task, providing new evidence for compensatory processing in the former group. Both groups showed greater frontal phase locking during false than true memory, suggesting increased searching when no actual memory trace was found. Significant inter-group differences in frontal alpha phase locking provided support for a role for lower and upper alpha oscillations in memory processing. Finally, fronto-parietal interaction was significantly reduced in the group with mild cognitive impairment, supporting the notion that mild cognitive impairment could represent an early stage in Alzheimer's disease, which has been described as a 'disconnection syndrome'.

Participants preferentially using an allocentric or an egocentric reference frame navigated through virtual tunnels and reported their homing direction at the end of each trial based on their spatial representation of the passage. Task-related electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics were analyzed based on independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequent clustering of independent components. Parietal alpha desynchronization during encoding of spatial information predicted homing performance for participants using an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, retrosplenial and occipital alpha desynchronization during retrieval covaried with homing performance of participants using an allocentric reference frame. These results support the assumption of distinct neural networks underlying the computation of distinct reference frames and reveal a direct relationship of alpha modulation in parietal and retrosplenial areas with encoding and retrieval of spatial information for homing behavior.

Long-Range Temporal Correlations in the EEG Bursts of Human Preterm Babies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PREMATURE-INFANTS; CORTICAL CIRCUITS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SCALING BEHAVIOR	The electrical activity in the very early human preterm brain, as recorded by scalp EEG, is mostly discontinuous and has bursts of high-frequency oscillatory activity nested within slow-wave depolarisations of high amplitude. The temporal organisation of the occurrence of these EEG bursts has not been previously investigated. We analysed the distribution of the EEG bursts in 11 very preterm (23-30 weeks gestational age) human babies through two estimates of the Hurst exponent. We found long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the occurrence of these EEG bursts demonstrating that even in the very immature human brain, when the cerebral cortical structure is far from fully developed, there is non-trivial temporal structuring of electrical activity.

In the present study, the analysis is extented to include auditory ERO and EO in AD. The rationale is to reveal whether the auditory ERO delta responses are also reduced, and whether this is a general phenomenon in Alzheimer patients upon applying stimuli with cognitive load. Methods.: Thirty-four mild AD subjects 117 de-novo and 17 medicated (cholinergic)l and seventeen healthy controls were included. Auditory oddball paradigm and sensory auditory stimuli were applied to the subjects. Oscillatory responses were analyzed by measuring maximum amplitudes in delta frequency range (0.5-3.5 Hz). Results: Auditory delta ERO (0.5-3.5 Hz) responses of healthy controls were higher than either de-novo AD or medicated AD group, without a difference between two AD subgroups. Furthermore, the auditory EO after presentation of tone bursts yielded no group difference. Conclusion: Our findings imply that delta ERO is highly unstable in AD patients in comparison to age-matched healthy controls only during the cognitive paradigm. Our results favor the hypothesis that neural delta networks are activated during cognitive tasks and that the reduced delta response is a general phenomenon in AD, due to cognitive impairment.

Methods: In general the method can be applied for the detection of phase interactions between components with frequencies f1 and f2, where f2 approximate to rf1 and r is some integer. We refer to the method as cross-frequency decomposition (CFD), which consists of the following steps: (a) extraction of f1-oscillations with the spatio-spectral decomposition algorithm (SSD); (b) frequency modification of the f1-oscillations obtained with SSD; and (c) finding f2-oscillations synchronous with f1-oscillations using least-squares estimation. Results: Our simulations showed that CFD was capable of recovering interacting components even when the signal-to-noise ratio was as low as 0.01. An application of CFD to the real EEG data demonstrated that cross-frequency phase synchronization between alpha and beta oscillations can originate from the same or remote neuronal populations. Conclusions: CFD allows a compact representation of the sets of interacting components. The application of CFD to EEG data allows differentiating cross-frequency synchronization arising due to genuine neurophysiological interactions from interactions occurring due to quasi-sinusoidal waveform of neuronal oscillations. Significance: CFD is a method capable of extracting cross-frequency coupled neuronal oscillations even in the presence of strong noise. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

ATROPINE-SENSITIVE HIPPOCAMPAL THETA OSCILLATIONS ARE MEDIATED BY Ca(v)2.3 R-TYPE Ca2+ CHANNELS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						calcium; cognition; theta	CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; VOLTAGE-CLAMP ANALYSIS; GATED CALCIUM-CHANNEL; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; II-III LOOP; GABAERGIC NEURONS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; IN-VITRO	Hippocampal theta oscillations are key elements in numerous behavioral and cognitive processes. Based on the dualistic theory of theta oscillations, one can differentiate between atropine-sensitive and atropine-insensitive theta subtypes. Urethane-induced atropine-sensitive theta oscillations are driven by muscarinic signal transduction pathways through G protein q/11 alpha subunit (G alpha(q/11)), phospholipase beta(1/4) (PLC beta(1/4)), inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)), diacylglycerole (DAG), and protein kinase C (PKC). Recent findings illustrate that Ca(v)2.3 Ca2+ channels are important targets of muscarinic signaling in the hippocampus mediating plateau potential generation, epileptiform burst activity, and complex rhythm generation in the septohippocampal network. To investigate the physiological implications of Ca(v)2.3 Ca2+ channels in hippocampal theta oscillations we performed radiotelemetric intrahippocampal (cornu ammonis (CA1)) recordings in urethane (800 mg/kg, i.p.) and atropine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) treated Ca(v)2.3(+/+) and Ca(v)2.3(-/-) mice followed by wavelet analysis of EEG data. Our results demonstrate that Ca(v)2.3 ablation, unlike PLC beta(1) deletion, does not result in complete abolishment of urethane-induced theta oscillations and that both mean and total theta duration is not significantly inhibited by subsequent atropine treatment, indicating that Ca(v)2.3 Ca2+ channels are important mediators of atropine-sensitive theta. Although theta frequency remained unchanged between both genotypes, the temporal characteristics of theta distribution, that is, theta architecture were significantly affected by the loss of Ca(v)2.3 Ca2+ channels. Our data suggest, for the first time, that Ca(v)2.3 voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) are an important factor in septohippocampal synchronization associated with theta oscillation. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Striving for objectively characterizing clinical pain states using more natural, prolonged stimuli, tonic pain has been recently associated with the individual peak frequency of alpha oscillations. This finding encouraged us to explore whether alpha power, reflecting the magnitude of the synchronized activity within this frequency range, will demonstrate a corresponding relationship with subjective perception of tonic pain. Methods: Five-minute-long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with alpha-1 and alpha-2 power. Results: NPSs and alpha power remained stable throughout the recording conditions (Ps >= 0.381). In the noxious condition, alpha-1 power obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp was negatively correlated with NPSs (Ps <= 0.04). Additionally, resting-state alpha-1 power recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp was negatively correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps <= 0.038). Conclusions: Current findings suggest alpha-1 power may serve as a direct, objective and experimentally stable measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Furthermore, resting-state alpha-1 power might reflect individuals' inherent tonic pain responsiveness. Significance: The relevance of alpha-1 power to tonic pain perception may deepen the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the processing of prolonged noxious stimulation.

In contrast, object recognition by touch is much slower. Furthermore, haptics usually serially accumulates information from different parts of objects, whereas vision typically processes object information in parallel. Is haptic object identification slower simply due to sequential information acquisition and the resulting memory load or due to more fundamental processing differences between the senses? To compare the time course of visual and haptic object recognition, we slowed visual processing using a novel, restricted viewing technique. In an electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) experiment, participants discriminated familiar, nameable from unfamiliar, unnamable objects both visually and haptically. Analyses focused on the evoked and total fronto-central theta-band (5-7 Hz; a marker of working memory) and the occipital upper alpha-band (10-12 Hz; a marker of perceptual processing) locked to the onset of classification. Decreases in total upper alpha-band activity for haptic identification of objects indicate a likely processing role of multisensory extrastriate areas. Long-latency modulations of alpha-band activity differentiated between familiar and unfamiliar objects in haptics but not in vision. In contrast, theta-band activity showed a general increase over time for the slowed-down visual recognition task only. We conclude that haptic object recognition relies on common representations with vision but also that there are fundamental differences between the senses that do not merely arise from differences in their speed of processing.

Two activation techniques, namely photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were evaluated for their potential to enhance the diagnostic validity of these recordings. Sixty-one dogs suffering from idiopathic epilepsy and 28 dogs suffering from symptomatic epilepsy were included. Electroencephalograms were recorded using five subdermal EEG electrodes (F3, F4, Cz, O1 and O2). All 89 EEGs were analysed visually and 61 were also evaluated quantitatively with fast Fourier transformation. Interictal paroxysmal epileptiform activity was found in 25% of idiopathic and in 29% of symptomatic epileptic dogs. Quantitative analysis of the EEGs (qEEGs) detected significant differences of frequency analysis in single reading points without any continuous changes of frequency bands. A comparison between healthy and affected brain hemispheres in seven dogs with focal lesions of one hemisphere did not show any significant differences in qEEG analysis. qEEG was not more sensitive than visual evaluation. Despite the use of activation techniques, the results showed that short time EEG recordings in epileptic dogs can detect interictal epileptic activity in less than one third of all seizuring dogs and is not a useful screening method.

While most studies on music perception used Western music as an acoustic stimulus, Guqin music, representative of Eastern music, was selected for this experiment to increase our knowledge of music perception. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from non-musician volunteers in three conditions: Guqin music, noise and silence backgrounds. Phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and between all pairs of EEG channels to construct correlation matrices. Each resulting matrix was converted into a weighted graph using a threshold, and two network measures: the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length were calculated. Music perception was found to display a higher level mean phase coherence. Over the whole range of thresholds, the clustering coefficient was larger while listening to music, whereas the path length was smaller. Networks in music background still had a shorter characteristic path length even after the correction for differences in mean synchronization level among background conditions. This topological change indicated a more optimal structure under music perception. Thus, prominent small-world properties are confirmed in functional brain networks. Furthermore, music perception shows an increase of functional connectivity and an enhancement of small-world network organizations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In epileptic patients investigated with intracerebral electrodes, deja vu can be more readily induced by stimulation of the rhinal cortices (RCs) than the hippocampus (H). Whether deja vu results from acute dysfunction of the familiarity system alone (sustained by RC) or from more extensive involvement of the MTL region (including H) is debatable. Methods: We analysed the synchronisation of intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from RC, H and amygdala (A) in epileptic patients in whom deja vu was induced by electrical stimulation. EEG signal correlations (between signals from RC, A and H) were evaluated using a nonlinear regression. Results: In comparison with RC stimulations that did not lead to deja vu (DV-), stimulations triggering deja vu (DV+) were associated with increased broadband EEG correlation (p = 0.01). Changes in correlations were significantly different in the theta band for RC-A (p = 0.007) and RC-H (p = 0.01) and in the beta band for RC-H (p = 0.001) interactions. Conclusion: Deja vu is associated with increased EEG signal correlation between MTL structures. Significance: Results are in favour of a mechanism involving transient co-operation between various MTL structures, not limited to RC alone.

The cognitive effects of interictal epileptiform EEG discharges and short nonconvulsive epileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Transient cognitive impairment; Seizures; Cognition; Fepsy	ANTIEPILEPTIC MEDICATION; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; RELATIVE INFLUENCE; CHILDREN; IMPAIRMENT; ACTIVATION	Purpose: Educational difficulties or even severe cognitive deterioration is seen in many childhood epilepsy syndromes. Many of those cognitive deficits are related directly to the brain disorder underlying the epilepsy syndrome. However, in other types of epilepsy, the epileptic seizures and/or epileptiform activity can be the dominant factor. This is especially unknown for the more subtle short nonconvulsive seizure types. For this reason, we analyzed a new cohort of children. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 188 children with epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG)video recordings and cognitive testing were performed simultaneously. The results of children with short nonconvulsive seizures during a 2-h testing session were compared with all children with epilepsy without seizures during the 2-h cognitive testing session and with controls without epilepsy. In a second analysis the cognitive effects of frequency of epileptiform EEG discharges were analyzed. Key Findings: The cognitive effects of short nonconvulsive seizures were large, ranging from 0.5 to 1 standard deviation and concerned global cognitive function, speed of central information processing, and memory function. In children without seizures during cognitive testing, the occurrence of frequent epileptiform discharges showed more subtle effects. These effects were independent from the occurrence of short nonconvulsive seizures. Significance: We concluded that although the effect is less pronounced in number of areas involved and magnitude, the type of association between frequent epileptiform activity (>1% of the time) and cognitive function in children with epilepsy is comparable to the association between short nonconvulsive seizures and cognitive function.

Understanding these abilities has the potential to facilitate their enhancement. The purpose of this study was to identify the functional brain network characteristics and their relation to psychometric intelligence. In particular, we examined whether the functional network exhibits efficient small-world network attributes (high clustering and short path length) and whether these small-world network parameters are associated with intellectual performance. High-density resting state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 74 healthy subjects to analyze graph-theoretical functional network characteristics at an intracortical level. Ravens advanced progressive matrices were used to assess intelligence. We found that the clustering coefficient and path length of the functional network are strongly related to intelligence. Thus, the more intelligent the subjects are the more the functional brain network resembles a small-world network. We further identified the parietal cortex as a main hub of this resting state network as indicated by increased degree centrality that is associated with higher intelligence. Taken together, this is the first study that substantiates the neural efficiency hypothesis as well as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) of intelligence in the context of functional brain network characteristics. These theories are currently the most established intelligence theories in neuroscience. Our findings revealed robust evidence of an efficiently organized resting state functional brain network for highly productive cognitions. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to register brain activity while participants decided about the beauty of visual stimuli. The data were analyzed with event-related field (ERF) and Time Frequency (TF) procedures. ERFs revealed no significant differences between brain activity related with stimuli rated as "beautiful" and "not beautiful." TF analysis showed clear differences between both conditions 400 ms after stimulus onset. Oscillatory power was greater for stimuli rated as "beautiful" than those regarded as "not beautiful" in the four frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). These results are interpreted in the frame of synchronization studies.

The P3b event-related potential (ERP), evoked when an infrequent target stimulus is presented, indexes cognitive function and is typically compared across subjects' scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, the clustering of independent components (ICs) is superior to scalp-based EEG methods because it can accommodate the spatiotemporal overlap inherent in scalp EEG data. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; event-related mean power spectral changes) and inter-trial coherence (ITCs; event-related consistency of spectral phase) reveal a more comprehensive overview of EEG activity. Ninety-five subjects (56 MS patients, 39 controls) completed visual and auditory two-stimulus P3b event-related potential tasks and the PASAT. MS patients were also divided into CI and non-CI groups (n = 18 in each) based on PASAT scores. Data were recorded from 128-scalp EEG channels and 4 IC clusters in the visual, and 5 IC clusters in the auditory, modality were identified. In general, MS patients had significantly reduced ERSP theta power versus controls, and a similar pattern was observed for CI vs. non-CI MS patients. The ITC measures were also significantly different in the theta band for some clusters. The finding that MS patients had reduced P3b task-related theta power in both modalities is a reflection of compromised connectivity, likely due to demyelination, that may have disrupted early processes essential to P3b generation, such as orientating and signal detection. However, for posterior sources, MS patients had a greater decrease in alpha power, normally associated with enhanced cognitive function, which may reflect a compensatory mechanism in response to the compromised early cognitive processing.

J	Howard, MF; Poeppel, D				Howard, Mary F.; Poeppel, David			The neuromagnetic response to spoken sentences: Co-modulation of theta band amplitude and phase	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory; Speech; MEG; Evoked; Phase; Amplitude	SPECTRAL DYNAMICS; SPEECH STIMULI; EEG; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; INFORMATION; POTENTIALS; GENERATION; MECHANISM; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Speech elicits a phase-locked response in the auditory cortex that is dominated by theta (3-7 Hz) frequencies when observed via magnetoencephalography (MEG). This phase-locked response is potentially explained as new phase-locked activity superimposed on the ongoing theta oscillation or, alternatively, as phase-resetting of the ongoing oscillation. The conventional method used to distinguish between the two hypotheses is the comparison of post- to prestimulus amplitude for the phase-locked frequency across a set of trials. In theory, increased amplitude indicates the presence of additive activity, while unchanged amplitude points to phase-resetting. However, this interpretation may not be valid if the amplitude of ongoing background activity also changes following the stimulus. In this study, we employ a new approach that circumvents this problem. Specifically, we utilize a fine-grained time-frequency analysis of MEG channel data to examine the co-modulation of amplitude change and phase coherence in the post-stimulus theta-band response. If the phase-locked response is attributable solely to phase-resetting of the ongoing theta oscillation, then amplitude and phase coherence should be uncorrelated. In contrast, additive activity should produce a positive correlation. We find significant positive correlation not only during the onset response but also throughout the response period. In fact, transient increases in phase coherence are accompanied by transient increases in amplitude in accordance with a "signal plus background" model of the evoked response. The results support the hypothesis that the theta-band phase-locked response to attended speech observed using MEG is dominated by additive phase-locked activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A novel method that aims at identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The results show that, the target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i.e., a theta band (4.3 Hz) power boost 300-700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) power repression 500-1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) power boost after 500 ms. The discriminate time-frequency features are mostly power boost and relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. These features are visualized for later analysis. For classification of target and non-target images, our LDA classifier was based on the uncorrelated features, which was constructed from original correlated features using clustering method. With feature clustering, the performance (area under ROC) was improved from 0.85 to 0.89 for within-session tests, and from 0.76 to 0.84 for cross-subject tests. Meanwhile, the constructed uncorrelated features were shown more robust than the original discriminant features, and corresponding to a local region in time-frequency.

Here we asked whether this phenomenon applies to the observation of gesture. Would the sensorimotor experiences we gain when performing. an action on an object influence activation in our own motor systems when we observe others performing a gesture for that object? Participants were given sensorimotor experience with objects that varied in weight, and then observed video clips of an actor producing gestures for those objects. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants first observed either an iconic gesture (pantomiming lifting an object) or a deictic gesture (pointing to an object) for an object, and then grasped and lifted the object indicated by the gesture. We analyzed EEG during gesture observation to determine whether oscillatory activity was affected by the observer's sensorimotor experiences with the object represented in the gesture. Seeing a gesture for an object previously experienced as light was associated with a suppression of power in alpha and beta frequency bands, particularly at posterior electrodes. A similar pattern was found when participants lifted the light object, but over more diffuse electrodes. Moreover, alpha and beta bands at right parieto-occipital electrodes were sensitive to the type of gesture observed (iconic vs. deictic). These results demonstrate that sensorimotor experience with an object affects how a gesture for that object is processed, as measured by the gesture-observer's EEG, and suggest that different types of gestures recruit the observer's own motor system in different ways.

J	Mari, F; Zelmann, R; Andrade-Valenca, L; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J				Mari, Francesco; Zelmann, Rina; Andrade-Valenca, Luciana; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean			Continuous high-frequency activity in mesial temporal lobe structures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						High-frequency EEG; Mesial temporal structures; High-frequency oscillations; Intracerebral electrodes	OSCILLATIONS 100-500 HZ; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; RIPPLES; MACROELECTRODES; SPIKES	Purpose: Many recent studies have reported the importance of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) of patients with epilepsy. These HFOs have been defined as events that stand out from the background. We have noticed that this background often consists itself of high-frequency rhythmic activity. The purpose of this study is to perform a first evaluation of the characteristics of high-frequency continuous or semicontinuous background activity. Methods: Because the continuous high-frequency pattern was noted mainly in mesial temporal structures, we reviewed the EEG studies from these structures in 24 unselected patients with electrodes implanted in these regions. Sections of background away from interictal spikes were marked visually during periods of slow-wave sleep and wakefulness. They were then high-passed filtered at 80 Hz and categorized as having high-frequency rhythmic activity in one of three patterns: continuous/semicontinuous, irregular, sporadic. Wavelet entropy, which measures the degree of rhythmicity of a signal, was calculated for the marked background sections. Key Findings: Ninety-six bipolar channels were analyzed. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was found frequently (29/96 channels during wake and 34/96 during sleep). The different patterns were consistent between sleep and wakefulness. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was found significantly more often in the hippocampus than in the parahippocampal gyrus and was rarely found in the amygdala. The types of pattern were not influenced by whether a channel was within the seizure-onset zone, or whether it was a lesional channel. The continuous/semicontinuous pattern was associated with a higher frequency of spikes and with high rates of ripples and fast ripples. Significance: It appears that high-frequency activity (above 80 Hz) does not appear only in the form of brief paroxysmal events but also in the form of continuous rhythmic activity or very long bursts. In this study limited to mesial temporal structures, we found a clear anatomic preference for the hippocampus. Although associated with spikes and with distinct HFOs, this pattern was not clearly associated with the seizure-onset zone. Future studies will need to evaluate systematically the presence of this pattern, as it may have a pathophysiologic significance and it will also have an important influence on the very definition of HFOs.

J	Schindler, K; Gast, H; Goodfellow, M; Rummel, C				Schindler, Kaspar; Gast, Heidemarie; Goodfellow, Marc; Rummel, Christian			On seeing the trees and the forest: Single-signal and multisignal analysis of periictal intracranial EEG	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Quantitative EEG; Information theory; Symbolic dynamics; Human epileptic seizure; Bit pattern	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ONSET ZONE; EPILEPSY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; SEIZURES	Purpose: Epileptic seizures are associated with a dysregulation of electrical brain activity on many different spatial scales. To better understand the dynamics of epileptic seizures, that is, how the seizures initiate, propagate, and terminate, it is important to consider changes of electrical brain activity on different spatial scales. Herein we set out to analyze periictal electrical brain activity on comparatively small and large spatial scales by assessing changes in single intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) signals and of averaged interdependences of pairs of EEG signals. Methods: Single and multiple EEG signals are analyzed by combining methods from symbolic dynamics and information theory. This computationally efficient approach is chosen because at its core it consists of analyzing the occurrence of patterns and bears analogy to classical visual EEG reading. Symbolization is achieved by first mapping the EEG signals into bit strings, that is, long sequences of zeros and ones, depending solely on whether their amplitudes increase or decrease. Bit strings reflect relational aspects between consecutive values of the original EEG signals, but not the values themselves. For each bit string the relative frequencies of the different constituent short bit patterns are then determined and used to compute two information theoretical measures: (1) redundancy (R) of single bit strings characterizes electrical brain activity on a comparatively small spatial scale represented by a single EEG signal and (2) averaged pair-wise mutual information with all other bit strings (M), which allows tracking of larger-scale EEG dynamics. Key Findings: We analyzed 20 periictal intracranial EEG recordings from five patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. At seizure onset, R first strongly increased and then decreased toward seizure termination, whereas M gradually increased throughout the seizure. Bit strings with maximal R were always derived from EEG signals recorded from the visually identified seizure-onset zone. When compared to the bit strings derived from other EEG signals, their M was relatively smaller. These findings are consistent with a strong but transient occurrence of information-poor, that is, redundant electrical brain activity on a smaller spatial scale, which is particularly pronounced in the seizure-onset zone. On a larger spatial scale, a progressively more collective state emerges, as revealed by increasing amounts of mutual information. Significance: Information theoretical analysis of bit patterns derived from EEG signals helps to characterize periictal brain activity on different spatial scales in a quantitative and efficient way and may provide clinically relevant results.

Neural oscillations carry speech rhythm through to comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						intelligibility; language; oscillations; phase locking; speech comprehension; speech rate; theta	TIME-COMPRESSED SPEECH; BRAIN-WAVE RECOGNITION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL ENVELOPE; INTELLIGIBLE SPEECH; BASAL GANGLIA; PERCEPTION; FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE	A key feature of speech is the quasi-regular rhythmic information contained in its slow amplitude modulations. In this article we review the information conveyed by speech rhythm, and the role of ongoing brain oscillations in listeners' processing of this content. Our starting point is the fact that speech is inherently temporal, and that rhythmic information conveyed by the amplitude envelope contains important markers for place and manner of articulation, segmental information, and speech rate. Behavioral studies demonstrate that amplitude envelope information is relied upon by listeners and plays a key role in speech intelligibility. Extending behavioral findings, data from neuroimaging - particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) - point to phase locking by ongoing cortical oscillations to low-frequency information (similar to 4-8 Hz) in the speech envelope. This phase modulation effectively encodes a prediction of when important events (such as stressed syllables) are likely to occur, and acts to increase sensitivity to these relevant acoustic cues. We suggest a framework through which such neural entrainment to speech rhythm can explain effects of speech rate on word and segment perception (i.e., that the perception of phonemes and words in connected speech is influenced by preceding speech rate). Neuroanatomically, acoustic amplitude modulations are processed largely bilaterally in auditory cortex, with intelligible speech resulting in differential recruitment of left-hemisphere regions. Notable among these is lateral anterior temporal cortex, which we propose functions in a domain-general fashion to support ongoing memory and integration of meaningful input. Together, the reviewed evidence suggests that low-frequency oscillations in the acoustic speech signal form the foundation of a rhythmic hierarchy supporting spoken language, mirrored by phase-locked oscillations in the human brain.

Inhibition of the cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatric populations: current and future directions	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IMPAIRED CORTICAL INHIBITION; FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; TRANSPORTER GENE SLC1A1; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM	Several lines of evidence suggest that deficits in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Cortical inhibition refers to a neurophysiological process, whereby GABA inhibitory interneurons selectively attenuate pyramidal neurons. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) represents a noninvasive technique to measure cortical inhibition, excitability and plasticity in the cortex. These measures were traditionally specific to the motor cortex, which is an important limitation when nonmotor neurophysiological processes are of primary interest. Recently, TMS has been combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to derive such measurements directly from the cortex. This review focuses on neurophysiological studies related to inhibitory and excitatory TMS paradigms, linking dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission to disease states. We review evidence that suggests cortical inhibition deficits among psychiatric populations and demonstrate how each disorder has a specific neurophysiological response to treatment. We conclude by discussing the future directions of TMS combined with EEG, demonstrating the potential to identify biological markers of neuropsychiatric disorders.

A brief overview is given of the hardware development followed by a discussion of EEG-fMRI applications. The technique's development was clinically motivated in the context of epilepsy. Accordingly, the evolution of studies trying to identify with EEG-fMRI the origin of individual epileptiform discharges up to those revealing general mechanisms of epilepsy syndromes is sketched. In epilepsy centers experienced with the methodology, EEG-fMRI has found its place in the presurgical evaluation of patients. In cognitive neuroscience, the multimodal technique has significantly contributed to the understanding of phenomena of the resting state and neuronal oscillations. While most of the studies discussed relate EEG to fMRI by means of prediction, the development of forward models facilitating the symmetrical 'fusion' of EEG and fMRI data is the subject of current neuro-computational research. Recently, intracranial EEG has been safely recorded during (functional) MRI broadly extending the perspectives for epilepsy and research into neurovascular coupling. EEG-fMRI has evolved into a mature, generally accessible and in principle easily applicable technique, which is a great achievement. Because this at the same time bears the risk of unreflected use. EEG-fMRI safety issues are also highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the influences of top-down control on the neural responses to multisensory stimulation using EEG recording and time-frequency analyses. Participants were stimulated at the index or thumb of the left hand, using tactile vibrators mounted on a foam cube. Simultaneously they received a visual distractor from a light emitting diode adjacent to the active vibrator (spatially congruent trial) or adjacent to the inactive vibrator (spatially incongruent trial). The task was to respond to the elevation of the tactile stimulus (upper or lower), while ignoring the simultaneous visual distractor. To manipulate top-down control on this multisensory stimulation, the proportion of spatially congruent (vs. incongruent) trials was changed across blocks. Our results reveal that the behavioral cost of responding to incongruent than congruent trials (i.e., the crossmodal congruency effect) was modulated by the proportion of congruent trials. Most importantly, the EEG gamma band response and the gamma-theta coupling were also affected by this modulation of top-down control, whereas the late theta band response related to the congruency effect was not. These findings suggest that gamma band response is more than a marker of multisensory binding, being also sensitive to the correspondence between expected and actual multisensory stimulation. By contrast, theta band response was affected by congruency but appears to be largely immune to stimulation expectancy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Clinically, most patients with PLE exhibit a somatosensory aura that may include painful dysesthesias, though vertigo, aphasia, disturbances of one's body image also occur, when ictal propagation occurs from the parietal lobe to the supplementary motor area, hypermotor manifestations are noted. When temporolimbic propagation occurs, complex visual or auditory hallucinations and automatisms may appear. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is often nonlocalizing. Ictal EEG is rarely localizing in PLE, and invasive EEG is often required for definitive localization and functional mapping. Recent advances in clinical neurophysiology during the evaluation of patients with refractory partial epilepsy include Ictal magnetic source imaging (MSI). Combined EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) may be useful for patients with PLE to refine the localization in patients undergoing a presurgical evaluation. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are more concentrated inside the seizure onset zone (SOZ), indicating that they may be used as interictal scalp EEG biomarker for the SOZ. When medical therapy fails, resective epilepsy surgery can result in seizure freedom or significant reduction especially when a lesion is present.

AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS OF NORMAL AND ALCOHOLIC EEG SIGNALS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; alcohol; nonlinear analysis; automated diagnosis; lyapunov exponent; higher order spectra; support vector machine	NEURAL NETWORK METHODOLOGY; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; TIME-SERIES; IDENTIFICATION; EPILEPSY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; QUANTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; BIOFEEDBACK; SYSTEM	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which record the electrical activity in the brain, are useful for assessing the mental state of a person. Since these signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, it is very difficult to decipher the useful information from them using conventional statistical and frequency domain methods. Hence, the application of nonlinear time series analysis to EEG signals could be useful to study the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals. In this paper, we propose a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique for the automated identification of normal and alcoholic EEG signals using nonlinear features. We first extract nonlinear features such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and four other Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features, and then use them to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier of varying kernel functions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order polynomials and a Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Our results indicate that these nonlinear measures are good discriminators of normal and alcoholic EEG signals. The SVM classifier with a polynomial kernel of order 1 could distinguish the two classes with an accuracy of 91.7%, sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 93.3%. As a pre-analysis step, the EEG signals were tested for nonlinearity using surrogate data analysis and we found that there was a significant difference in the LLE measure of the actual data and the surrogate data.

Using a wavelet based algorithm, we recently showed that for the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, frequency flow on the scalp EEG builds up to 5-12 Hz range just prior to and during the initial stages of the seizure. Here we present frequency flow analysis on EEG of patients with extra-temporal partial epilepsy and patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) to investigate any characteristic frequency flow patterns in these patients. We found that frequency flow in these patients also stays sustained in the 5-12 Hz range for longer periods of time just prior to and during the initial stages of the seizure compared to their respective baseline interictal recordings. The 5-12 Hz frequency flow was seen uniformly in all the channels in patients with IGE although it was seen most prominently adjacent to the seizure focus and to a lesser extent in other channels in patients with partial epilepsy.

To classify these EEG patterns, we propose an algorithm that specifies the learning area for SOM based on sub-attribute information (SOMSA) related to the individual differences of EEG data. The individual differences are quantified by analysing human personality because we believe that an individual's personality is responsible for individual differences. In the preprocessing phase, we extract the EEG feature vectors by calculating the time average in each of three frequency bands: 0, alpha and beta. The personality is analysed through ego analysis based on psychological testing. The device for recording EEG is a band-type device with a small number of electrodes. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using real EEG data. Our experimental results show that the accuracy rate of the EEG pattern classification using SOMSA is significantly improved compared with that using standard SOM.

We calculated the parameters and estimated the sources of these phenomena. We measured 64-channel EEG simultaneously with surface EMG of the right first dorsal interosseus muscle in 11 healthy volunteers. In Task1, subjects kept a medium-strength contraction continuously; in Task2, superimposed on this movement, they performed repetitive self-paced short contractions. In Task3 short contractions were executed alone. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG and CMC was performed with respect to the offset of brisk movements and averaged in each subject. Sources of PMBS and CMC were also calculated. High beta power in Task1, PMBS in Task2-3, and CMC in Task1-2 could be observed in the same individual frequency bands. While beta synchronization in Task1 and PMBS in Task2-3 appeared bilateral with contralateral predominance, CMC in Task1-2 was strictly a unilateral phenomenon; their main sources did not differ contralateral to the movement in the primary sensorimotor cortex in 7 of 11 subjects in Task1, and in 6 of 9 subjects in Task2. In Task2, CMC and PMBS had the same latency but their amplitudes did not correlate with each other. In Task2, weaker PMBS source was found bilaterally within the secondary sensory cortex, while the second source of CMC was detected in the premotor cortex, contralateral to the movement. In Task3, weaker sources of PMBS could be estimated in bilateral supplementary motor cortex and in the thalamus. PMBS and CMC appear simultaneously at the end of a phasic movement possibly suggesting similar antikinetic effects, but they may be separate processes with different active functions. Whereas PMBS seems to reset the supraspinal sensorimotor network, cortico-muscular coherence may represent the recalibration of cortico-motoneuronal and spinal systems.

Infraslow activity amplitude increase is also associated with epilepsy, traumatic brain injuries, strokes, tumors, and migraines and has been studied since the early 90s at the Henry Ford Hospital MEG Laboratory. We have used a DC-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) system to validate and characterize the ISA from animal models of cortical spreading depression thought to be the underlying mechanism of migraine and other cortical spreading depression-like events seen during ischemia, anoxia, and epilepsy. Magnetoencephalography characterizes these slow shifts easier than electroencephalography because there is no attenuation of these signals by the skull. In the current study, we report on ISA MEG signals of 12 patients with epilepsy in the preictal and postictal states. In the minutes just before the onset of a seizure, large-amplitude ISA MEG waveforms were detected, signaling the onset of the seizure. It is suggested that MEG assessment of ISA, in addition to activity in the conventional frequency band, can at times be useful in the lateralization of epileptic seizures.

Along with individual motivational tendencies, the ability to restrain one's impulses might be a factor in aggressive behavior. Recently, a role for the inhibitory cortical beta rhythm was suggested. The present study investigated whether individual differences in resting state asymmetries in the beta frequency band were associated with trait aggression and behavioral inhibition. In addition, the selective contributions of the prefrontal and motor cortex areas to these associations were examined. Results showed that relative dominant right frontal beta frequency activity was associated with both heightened trait aggression, especially hostility, and reduced response inhibition. Moreover, asymmetries over the anterior electrode locations proved to be related most closely to trait aggression, while asymmetries over the central electrode locations were associated with response inhibition. Together these findings show that right-dominant frontal beta activity is positively associated with aggressive tendencies and reduced behavioral inhibition.	[Hofman, Dennis; Schutter, Dennis J. L.

They provide diagnostic challenges because they often lack lateralizing or localizing features on clinical semiology and interictal and ictal scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. A number of unique semiologic features have been described over the last decade in patients with mesial frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). There are few reports of applying advanced neurophysiologic techniques such as electrical source imaging, magnetoencephalography, EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging, or analysis of high-frequency oscillations in patients with mesial FLE. Despite these diagnostic challenges, it seems that patients with mesial FLE benefit from epilepsy surgery to the same extent or even better than patients with FLE do, as a whole.

The paper shows that self-paced BCI performance can be significantly improved by combining a range of simple techniques including (1) constant-Q filters with varying bandwidth size depending on the center frequency, instead of constant bandwidth filters for frequency decomposition of the EEG signal in the 6 to 36 Hz band; (2) subjectspecific postprocessing parameter optimization consisting of dwell time and threshold, and (3) debiasing before postprocessing by readjusting the classification output based on the current and previous brain states, to reduce the number of false detections. This debiasing block is shown to be optimal when activated only in special cases which are predetermined during the training phase. Analysis of the data recorded from seven subjects executing foot movement shows a statistically significant 10% (P < 0.05) average improvement in true positive rate (TPR) and a 1% reduction in false positive rate (FPR) detections compared with previous work on the same data.

J	Sih, GC; Tang, KK				Sih, G. C.; Tang, K. K.			Sustainable time and stability of hippocampal and cortical EEG theta waves	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS			English	Article						Cortical; Hippocampal; Theta; Brain wave; Neuron; EEG	OSCILLATIONS; RELIABILITY; RHYTHM	Sinusoidal wave function is used to quantify brain rhythms characterized by the interaction of frequency, amplitude, and phase angle (FAP). Their combinations have been differentiated in terms of gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves, in accordance with test data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) at different locations of the scalp, and hence neurons at the different locations of the brain. The standard wave-type classifications, however, refer to a wide range of situations that are changeable according to variations of the sensory stimuli such that one wave type may switch into another. Even for the same wave type, say theta, a perturbation of frequency and/or amplitude can alter the sustainable time of the wave. The Least Variance Principle (LVP) is applied to determine the stable and reliable state of the "hippocampal" and "cortical" EEG theta waves having the, respective, frequency ranges of 7-9 Hz and 4-7 Hz. The sustainable time of the hippocampal waves are longer and more stable while those of the cortical waves are shorter and less stable. These findings are in general agreement with the available experimental results obtained from small mammals and humans. Also keep in mind of the difference in the method of recording the EEG waves. Seven different cases are reported from the LVP model. They are characterized by a comparative scheme for testing the sensitivity of the frequency and phase angle changes. Using the average frequencies of 8.0 Hz for the hippocampal waves and a higher phase angle and 5.5 Hz for the cortical waves and a lower phase angle, the, respective, sustainable times are found to be 2.2 s and 0.5 s. The hippocampal waves were found to be more stable. These results correspond precisely to test measurements where perturbation of the frequencies and phase angles can correspond to large variations in the sustainable time of the hippocampal and cortical theta waves. In general, larger frequencies and phase angles favor longer sustainable and stable time. That is perturbation of the theta wave frequency and phase angle can result in appreciable change of the sustainable time of the theta wave. These features are exhibited consistently by the results for seven different FAPs. Other situations can be generated to propose additional theta wave oscillation experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

P300 occurs at a relatively well defined time in relation to a stimulus and it represents a signal with a specified band frequency. Method: The electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded with 4 wet electrodes by means of g.MOBIlab+ module, a g.tec acquisition system. The multiresolution wavelet transform was chosen to extract the P300 potential from the EEG signal because it provides information on both time and frequency domains. Results: The multiresolution wavelet transform decomposes the signal in sub-bands and it helps to highlight the P300 potential. The spectrum of the P300 potential is around 3Hz. For the multiresolution wavelet decomposition this corresponds to coefficients of approximation of order 4 according to 0 to 60 Hz band of the original EEG signal. The representation of these coefficients emphasizes a better detection of P300 potential then in the original signal. Conclusion: It is shown to be a more appropriate method than the direct analysis of the signal because it works with lower dimensional signals. This method of detection of the P300 potential can be used successfully in the implementation of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

In contrast to the conventional therapeutic approach that comprises intensive training and practicing, passive repetitive sensory stimulation (RSS) has recently gained increasing attention as an alternative to countervail the sensory decline by improving perceptual abilities without the need of active participation. A particularly effective type of high-frequency RSS, utilizing Hebbian learning principles, improves perceptual acuity as well as sensorimotor functions and has been successfully applied to treat chronic stroke patients and elderly subjects. High-frequency RSS has been shown to induce plastic changes of somatosensory cortex such as representational map reorganization, but its impact on the brain's ongoing network activity and resting-state functional connectivity has not been investigated so far. Here, we applied high-frequency RSS in healthy human subjects and analyzed resting state Electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity patterns before and after RSS by means of imaginary coherency (ImCoh), a frequency-specific connectivity measure which is known to reduce over-estimation biases due to volume conduction and common reference. Thirty minutes of passive high frequency RSS lead to significant ImCoh-changes of the resting state mu-rhythm in the individual upper alpha frequency band with in distributed sensory and motor cortical areas. These stimulation induced distributed functional connectivity changes likely underlie the previously observed improvement in sensorimotor integration.

J	Diederich, A; Schomburg, A; Colonius, H				Diederich, Adele; Schomburg, Annette; Colonius, Hans			Saccadic Reaction Times to Audiovisual Stimuli Show Effects of Oscillatory Phase Reset	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; SELECTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERIODICITY	Initiating an eye movement towards a suddenly appearing visual target is faster when an accessory auditory stimulus occurs in close spatiotemporal vicinity. Such facilitation of saccadic reaction time (SRT) is well-documented, but the exact neural mechanisms underlying the crossmodal effect remain to be elucidated. From EEG/MEG studies it has been hypothesized that coupled oscillatory activity in primary sensory cortices regulates multisensory processing. Specifically, it is assumed that the phase of an ongoing neural oscillation is shifted due to the occurrence of a sensory stimulus so that, across trials, phase values become highly consistent (phase reset). If one can identify the phase an oscillation is reset to, it is possible to predict when temporal windows of high and low excitability will occur. However, in behavioral experiments the pre-stimulus phase will be different on successive repetitions of the experimental trial, and average performance over many trials will show no signs of the modulation. Here we circumvent this problem by repeatedly presenting an auditory accessory stimulus followed by a visual target stimulus with a temporal delay varied in steps of 2 ms. Performing a discrete time series analysis on SRT as a function of the delay, we provide statistical evidence for the existence of distinct peak spectral components in the power spectrum. These frequencies, although varying across participants, fall within the beta and gamma range (20 to 40 Hz) of neural oscillatory activity observed in neurophysiological studies of multisensory integration. Some evidence for high-theta/alpha activity was found as well. Our results are consistent with the phase reset hypothesis and demonstrate that it is amenable to testing by purely psychophysical methods. Thus, any theory of multisensory processes that connects specific brain states with patterns of saccadic responses should be able to account for traces of oscillatory activity in observable behavior.

In this study, after sLORETA transformation of EEG data, we applied group spatial independent component analysis which is routinely used in fMRI research. In three large and diverse samples coming from two different cultures (Russian and Taiwanese), spontaneous EEG data and retrospective questionnaire measures of subject's state, thoughts, and feelings during the EEG registration were collected. Regression analyses showed that appearance of spontaneous self-referential thoughts was best predicted by enhanced alpha activity within the DMN. Diminished theta and delta activity in the superior frontal gyrus and enhanced beta activity in the postcentral gyrus added to the prediction. The enhanced alpha activity prevailed in the posterior DMN hub in Russian, but in the anterior DMN hub in Taiwanese participants. Possible cross-cultural differences in personality and attitudes underlying this difference are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually investigated by the group-level analysis, for which tensor factorization can be used. However, sizes of a tensor including time-frequency representation of ERPs of multiple channels of multiple participants can be immense. It is time-consuming to decompose such a tensor. The low-rank approximation based sequential nonnegative Tucker decomposition (LraSNTD) has been recently developed and shown to be computationally efficient with respect to some benchmark datasets. Here, LraSNTD is applied to decompose a fourth-order tensor representation of ERPs. We find that the decomposed results from LraSNTD and a benchmark nonnegative Tucker decomposition algorithm are very similar. So, LraSNTD is promising for ERP studies.

Methods: Penicillin G was administered intracortically into superficial layers of the left sensorimotor cortex and EDs were induced. Focal brain cooling was achieved using a cooling device attached to the cortical surface. The cortical surface was cooled to 25 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C, and EEG was continuously recorded just beneath the cooling device. EEG spectral powers were determined using fast Fourier transform before and during cooling. Results: Penicillin G induced EDs and increased the Alpha and Beta power spectra. Cooling suppressed EDs with an effect that depended on the brain temperature. Cooling to 25 degrees C attenuated Beta powers, cooling to 20 degrees C attenuated Alpha and Beta powers, and cooling to 15 degrees C suppressed spectral powers ranging from Delta to Beta bands. Conclusions: These results suggest that focal brain cooling can terminate EDs in the cortex and suppress spectral powers with a temperature-dependent effect. Significance: These findings may contribute to development of a new clinical treatment for patients with epilepsy. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Properties of functional brain networks correlate with frequency of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; functional connectivity; graph theory; cross-correlation analysis; clustering co-efficient; modularity; resilience	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; DIAGNOSIS; EPILEPSY; HEALTH	Abnormalities in the topology of brain networks may be an important feature and etiological factor for psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). To explore this possibility, we applied a graph theoretical approach to functional networks based on resting state EEGs from 13 PNES patients and 13 age- and gender-matched controls. The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time-series by a cross-correlation method. PNES patients showed close to normal local and global connectivity and small-world structure, estimated with clustering coefficient, modularity, global efficiency, and small-worldness (SW) metrics, respectively. Yet the number of PNES attacks per month correlated with a weakness of local connectedness and a skewed balance between local and global connectedness quantified with SW, all in EEG alpha band. In beta band, patients demonstrated above-normal resiliency, measured with assortativity coefficient, which also correlated with the frequency of PNES attacks. This interictal EEG phenotype may help improve differentiation between PNES and epilepsy. The results also suggest that local connectivity could be a target for therapeutic interventions in PNES. Selective modulation (strengthening) of local connectivity might improve the skewed balance between local and global connectivity and so prevent PNES events.

Specifically, we measured alpha power, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and event-related brain potentials during early training of the Space Fortress task, and correlated these measures with subsequent learning rate and performance in transfer tasks. Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50% of the learning rate variance and 10%-20% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures. Thus, control processes, as indexed by alpha and delta EEG oscillations, can predict learning and skill improvements. The results are of potential use to optimize training regimes.

Here we examined the dynamics of thalamocortical communication during long-term episodic memory retrieval in two experiments. In Experiment 1, intrathalamic and surface EEG was recorded in an epileptic patient implanted with depth electrodes for brain stimulation therapy. In a recognition memory test, early (300-500 ms) stimulus-linked oscillatory synchrony between mediodorsal thalamic and frontal surface electrodes at beta frequency (20 Hz) was enhanced for correctly remembered old compared to correctly rejected new items. Directionality measures (Granger causality) indicated that the thalamus was the sender, and the neocortex the receiver, of this beta signal, which also modulated the power of neocortical gamma (55-80 Hz) oscillations (cross-frequency coupling). Experiment 2 validated the cross-frequency coupling effects in a healthy participant sample. Confirming the findings from Experiment 1, significantly increased cross-frequency coupling was found over frontal scalp electrodes during successful recognition. Extending anatomical knowledge on thalamic connectivity with frontal neocortex, these results suggest that the thalamus sends an early memory signal to frontal regions, triggering further memory search processes.

In conscious rats an equivalent dose of ketamine induces key features of animal models of acute psychosis, including hyperlocomotor activity, deficits in prepulse inhibition and gating of auditory evoked potentials, and concomitantly increases the power of ongoing spontaneously occurring gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations in the neocortex. This study investigated whether NMDAR antagonist-induced aberrant gamma oscillations could be modulated by acute treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. Extradural electrodes were surgically implanted into the skull of adult male Wistar rats. After recovery, rats were subcutaneously administered either clozapine (1-5 mg/kg, n=7), haloperidol (0.05-0.25 mg/kg; n=8), LY379268 (a preclinical agonist at mGluR(2/3) receptors : 0.3-3 mg/kg; n=5) or the appropriate vehicles, and 30 min later received ketamine (5 mg/kg s.c.). Quantitative measures of EEG gamma power and locomotor activity were assessed throughout the experiment. All three drugs significantly reduced the power of baseline EEG gamma oscillations by 30-50%, an effect most prominent after LY379268, and all inhibited ketamine-induced hyperlocomotor activity. However, only pretreatment with LY379268 attenuated trough-to-peak ketamine-induced gamma hyperactivity. These results demonstrate that typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs acutely reduce cortical gamma oscillations, an effect that may be related to their clinical efficacy.

The study compared 2- to 5-Hz and 5.2- to 13-Hz bands of the ictal EEG signal between brief-and ultrabrief-pulse ECT. Methods: Twenty-five patients with major depression were randomized to brief- (1 millisecond [ms]) and ultrabrief-pulse (0.3 ms) right unilateral ECT. In sessions 2 to 8, when patients in either group received 6 times threshold ECT, right and left frontal ictal EEG between ultrabrief (n = 60) and brief pulse (n = 63) were compared. Electroencephalographic spectra from 2- to 5-Hz and 5.2- to 13-Hz bands in the mid and postictal phases were subjected to multitaper jackknife analysis of spectral power density (mu V-2/Hz) and its SD or "regularity'' (mu V-2/Hz), peak spectral frequency (Hz), and its standard deviation (SD) or regularity (Hz). Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare the outcomes. Results: In ultrabrief ECT, spectral power density and its SD were significantly smaller within the mid seizure of both bands, whereas peak frequency and its SD were similar. Postseizure suppression of spectral power density of both bands was similar in either treatments. Conclusion: Lower spectral power densities were noted with ultrabrief-pulse ECT vis-a-vis brief-pulse ECT. However, in ultrabrief pulse ECT, regularity measures and postseizure suppression were comparable to brief-pulse ECT.

BOSC: A better oscillation detection method, extracts both sustained and transient rhythms from rat hippocampal recordings	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						theta; slow oscillation; urethane anesthesia; brain state; spectral analysis	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SLOW OSCILLATION; EEG; STATE; NAVIGATION; SYNCHRONY; PATTERNS	Neuronal population oscillations at a variety of frequencies can be readily seen in electroencephalographic (EEG) as well as local field potential recordings in many different species. Although these brain rhythms have been studied for many years, the methods for identifying discrete oscillatory epochs are still widely variable across studies. The better oscillation detection (BOSC) method applies standardized criteria to detect runs of true oscillatory activity and rejects transient events that do not reflect actual rhythms. It does so by estimating the background spectrum of the actual signal to derive detection criteria that include both power and duration thresholds. This method has not yet been applied to nonhuman data. Here, we test the BOSC method on two important rat hippocampal oscillatory signals, the theta rhythm and slow oscillation (SO), two large amplitude and mutually exclusive states. The BOSC method detected both the relatively sustained theta rhythm and the relatively transient SO apparent under urethane anesthesia and was relatively resilient to spectral features that changed across states, complementing previous findings for human EEG. Detection of oscillatory activity using the BOSC method (but not more traditional Fourier transform-based power analysis) corresponded well with human expert ratings. Moreover, for near-continuous theta, BOSC proved useful for detecting discrete disruptions that were associated with sudden and large amplitude phase shifts of the ongoing rhythm. Thus, the BOSC method accurately extracts oscillatory and nonoscillatory episodes from field potential recordings and produces systematic, objective, and consistent resultsnot only across frequencies, brain regions, tasks, and waking states, as shown previously, but also across species and for both sustained and transient rhythms. Thus, the BOSC method will facilitate more direct comparisons of oscillatory brain activity across all types of experimental paradigms. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This is followed by considering subsets that contain 2, 3, 4 as well as all 5 EEG rhythms. Finally, a feature subset selection method based on differential evolution (DE) that has particularly been proposed to deal with multi-channel signals is used to search for the best subset of EEG rhythms for the various channels.

We hypothesized that task-related brain oscillations and corticocortical connections were affected by age-and disease-related changes, which could be reflected in the CMI analysis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were measured in 16 MCI patients, 15 healthy age-matched controls, and 16 healthy younger individuals. The frequencies and interhemispheric CMI data were estimated in all groups. The specific EEG rhythms measured were delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma) bands. Significant differences in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands were observed between the younger and elderly groups. However, only the theta band was significantly different between the elderly and MCI groups. Moreover, this study used EEG recordings to investigate age-and disease-related changes in the corticocortical connections of the brain. This study proves that the theta-band frequency of the connection between the parietal and occipital lobes for the age-and disease-related changes can be depicted using the CMI analysis.

Signal distortion from microelectrodes in clinical EEG acquisition systems	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; RECORDINGS; TISSUE; STIMULATION; IMPEDANCE; EPILEPSY; MODEL	Many centers are now using high-density microelectrodes during traditional intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) both for research and clinical purposes. These microelectrodes are FDA-approved and integrate into clinical EEG acquisition systems. However, the electrical characteristics of these electrodes are poorly described and clinical systems were not designed to use them; thus, it is possible that this shift into clinical practice could have unintended consequences. In this study, we characterized the impedance of over 100 commercial macro-and microelectrodes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine how electrode properties could affect signal acquisition and interpretation. The EIS data were combined with the published specifications of several commercial EEG systems to design digital filters that mimic the behavior of the electrodes and amplifiers. These filters were used to analyze simulated brain signals that contain a mixture of characteristic features commonly observed in iEEG. Each output was then processed with several common quantitative EEG measurements. Our results show that traditional macroelectrodes had low impedances and produced negligible distortion of the original signal. Brain tissue and electrical wiring also had negligible filtering effects. However, microelectrode impedances were much higher and more variable than the macroelectrodes. When connected to clinical amplifiers, higher impedance electrodes produced considerable distortion of the signal at low frequencies (<60 Hz), which caused significant changes in amplitude, phase, variance and spectral band power. In contrast, there were only minimal changes to the signal content for frequencies above 100 Hz. In order to minimize distortion with microelectrodes, we determined that an acquisition system should have an input impedance of at least 1 G Omega, which is much higher than most clinical systems. These results show that it is critical to account for variations in impedance when analyzing EEG from different-sized electrodes. Data from microelectrodes may yield misleading results unless recorded with high-impedance amplifiers.

Neural Synchrony during Response Production and Inhibition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; EEG; DYNAMICS; ERPS; ANTERIORIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; MEMORY	Inhibition of irrelevant information (conflict monitoring) and/or of prepotent actions is an essential component of adaptive self-organized behavior. Neural dynamics underlying these functions has been studied in humans using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited in Go/NoGo tasks that require a speeded motor response to the Go stimuli and withholding a prepotent response when a NoGo stimulus is presented. However, averaged ERP waveforms provide only limited information about the neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulus processing, motor preparation, and response production or inhibition. In this study, we examine the cortical representation of conflict monitoring and response inhibition using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during continuous performance Go/NoGo task in 50 young adult females. We hypothesized that response inhibition would be associated with a transient boost in both temporal and spatial synchronization of prefrontal cortical activity, consistent with the role of the anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices in cognitive control. Overall, phase synchronization across trials measured by Phase Locking Index and phase synchronization between electrode sites measured by Phase Coherence were the highest in the Go and NoGo conditions, intermediate in the Warning condition, and the lowest under Neutral condition. The NoGo condition was characterized by significantly higher fronto-central synchronization in the 300-600 ms window, whereas in the Go condition, delta-and theta-band synchronization was higher in centro-parietal regions in the first 300 ms after the stimulus onset. The present findings suggest that response production and inhibition is supported by dynamic functional networks characterized by distinct patterns of temporal and spatial synchronization of brain oscillations.

Theta modulation of inter-regional gamma synchronization during auditory attention control	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Theta; Gamma; Cross-frequency; EEG; Attention; Neural synchrony; Neural oscillation; Functional connectivity	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; INTEGRATION; MECHANISMS	Synchronization of gamma oscillations among brain regions is relevant for dynamically organizing communication among neurons to support cognitive and perceptual processing including attention orienting. Recent research has demonstrated that inter-regional synchronization in the gamma-band is modulated by theta rhythms during cortical processing. It has been proposed that such cross-frequency dynamics underlie the integration of local processes into large-scale functional networks. To investigate the potential role of theta-gamma mechanisms during auditory attention control, we localized activated regions using EEG beamformer analysis, and calculated inter-regional gamma-band synchronization between activated regions as well as modulation of inter-regional gamma-band synchronization by the phase of cortical theta rhythms. Abundant synchronization of gamma-band oscillations among regions comprising the auditory attention control network was observed. This interregional gamma synchronization was modulated by theta phase. These results provide further evidence implicating inter-regional gamma-band synchronization, and theta-gamma interactions, in task-dependent communication among cortical regions, and provide the first evidence that such mechanisms are relevant for auditory attention control.

We investigated this issue by recording the intracranial field potentials of the amygdala in participants undergoing preneurosurgical assessment (n = 6). Participants observed faces, mosaics, and houses in upright and inverted orientations using a dummy target detection task. Time-frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that the amygdala showed greater gamma-band activity in response to faces than to mosaics at 200-300 msec, with a peak at 255 msec. Gamma-band activation with a similar temporal profile was also found in response to faces versus houses. Activation patterns did not differ between upright and inverted presentations of stimuli. These results suggest that the human amygdala is involved in the early stages of face processing, including the modulation of subjective perception of faces.

There are many studies that have analyzed PNES in adults; currently, however, there is no systematic assessment of purely childhood PNES semiology. Our study based on a large pediatric video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (VEM) cohort, provides a detailed analysis of childhood PNES and assesses the usability of the current classification system described in adults. Methods: Medical and video-EEG records of 568 consecutive children (younger than 18 years) who underwent video-EEG monitoring (VEM) at our hospital were reviewed. Aura, type of movement, anatomic distribution, synchrony, symmetry, eye movement, responsiveness, vocalization, hyperventilation, vegetative and emotional signs, presence of eyewitness, and duration of the event were recorded among children with the diagnosis of PNES. We also compared our data with those of earlier adult studies. Key Findings: Seventy-five archived PNES of 27 children (21 girls; age 8-18 years) were reanalyzed. Nine children (33%) had the diagnosis of epilepsy currently or in the past. Mean age at the time of PNES onset was 11.6 (standard deviation 3.2) years. Mean duration of PNES was longer (269 s) compared to seizures of the epileptic group (83 s; p = 0.002). Eyewitnesses (mostly parents) were present in 89% of cases. Eighty percent of PNES had an abrupt start, with 68% also ending abruptly. In only 15% of events were the patients eyes closed at the beginning of the attack. Patients were unresponsive in 34%. The most frequent motor sign was tremor (25%) with the upper, rather than lower limbs more frequently involved. Pelvic thrusting was seen in only two attacks. Emotional-mostly negative-signs were observed during 32 PNES (43%). Based on Seneviratne et al.'s classification, 18 events (24%) were classified as rhythmic motor PNES, only half the frequency of that previously described in adults. No hypermotor PNES was found. The frequency of complex motor PNES (13%) and mixed PNES (4%) showed similar frequency in children as in adults. Dialeptic PNES was found more frequently among younger children. All PNES belonged to the same semiologic type in 23 patients (85%). Significance: Because homogeneity of PNES within a patient was high in the pediatric population, we found it useful to classify PNES into different semiologic categories. Dialeptic PNES seems to be more frequent among younger children. Tremor is the most frequent motor sign and usually accompanied by preserved responsiveness in childhood. Negative emotion is commonly seen in pediatric PNES, but pelvic thrusting is a rare phenomenon. We, therefore, suggest a modification of the present classification system in which PNES with motor activity is divided into minor and major motor PNES, and the latter group is subdivided into synchron rhythmic motor and asynchron motor PNES. We believe that our study, a detailed analysis on the semiology and classification of purely childhood PNES might assist the early and precise diagnosis of nonepileptic paroxysmal events.

The present report is a review of the significant role of alpha activity in memory and cognitive processes in healthy subjects, and in cognitive impairment. The role of neurotransmitters is also described, briefly, in this context. Towards an understanding of brain alpha: Despite numerous experimental studies, it is indicated that the presented results are only appropriate to establish an ensemble of reasonings and suggestions for analyzing "alphas" in the whole brain. In turn, in the near future, these reasonings and suggestions may serve (or are indispensable to serve) as fundaments of more general and tenable hypotheses on the genesis and function of "alphas".

Extending this view, phase synchronization of alpha oscillations across distant cortical regions could regulate integration of information. Here, we investigated whether such long-range cross-region coupling in the alpha band is intrinsically and selectively linked to activity in a distinct functionally specialized brain network. If so, this would provide new insight into the functional role of alpha band phase synchrony. We adapted the phase-locking value to assess fluctuations in synchrony that occur over time in ongoing activity. Concurrent EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were recorded during resting wakefulness in 26 human subjects. Fluctuations in global synchrony in the upper alpha band correlated positively with activity in several prefrontal and parietal regions (as measured by fMRI). fMRI intrinsic connectivity analysis confirmed that these regions correspond to the well known fronto-parietal (FP) network. Spectral correlations with this network's activity confirmed that no other frequency band showed equivalent results. This selective association supports an intrinsic relation between large-scale alpha phase synchrony and cognitive functions associated with the FP network. This network has been suggested to implement phasic aspects of top-down modulation such as initiation and change in moment-to-moment control. Mechanistically, long-range upper alpha band synchrony is well suited to support these functions. Complementing our previous findings that related alpha oscillation power to neural structures serving tonic control, the current findings link alpha phase synchrony to neural structures underpinning phasic control of alertness and task requirements.

Inferring task-related networks using independent component analysis in magnetoencephalography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Working memory; Independent component analysis; General linear model; Hippocampus; Neural oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; MEG; BRAIN; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; MODEL	A novel framework for analysing task-positive data in magnetoencephalography (MEG) is presented that can identify task-related networks. Techniques that combine beamforming, the Hilbert transform and temporal independent component analysis (ICA) have recently been applied to resting-state MEG data and have been shown to extract resting-state networks similar to those found in fMRI. Here we extend this approach in two ways. First, we systematically investigate optimisation of time-frequency windows for connectivity measurement. This is achieved by estimating the distribution of functional connectivity scores between nodes of known resting-state networks and contrasting it with a distribution of artefactual scores that are entirely due to spatial leakage caused by the inverse problem. We find that functional connectivity, both in the resting-state and during a cognitive task, is best estimated via correlations in the oscillatory envelope in the 8-20 Hz frequency range, temporally down-sampled with windows of 1-4 s. Second, we combine ICA with the general linear model (GLM) to incorporate knowledge of task structure into our connectivity analysis. The combination of ICA with the GLM helps overcome problems of these techniques when used independently: namely, the interpretation and separation of interesting independent components from those that represent noise in ICA and the correction for multiple comparisons when applying the GLM. We demonstrate the approach on a 2-back working memory task and show that this novel analysis framework is able to elucidate the functional networks involved in the task beyond that which is achieved using the GLM alone. We find evidence of localised task-related activity in the area of the hippocampus, which is difficult to detect reliably using standard methods. Task-positive ICA, coupled with the GLM, has the potential to be a powerful tool in the analysis of MEG data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Rectification of the EMG is an unnecessary and inappropriate step in the calculation of Corticomuscular coherence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Cortico-muscular coherence; Rectified EMG; Unrectified EMG; EMG rectification	SURFACE EMG; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ELECTROMYOGRAMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; TASK; PRECISION; INPUT; DRIVE	Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) estimation is a frequency domain method used to detect a linear coupling between rhythmic activity recorded from sensorimotor cortex (EEG or MEG) and the electromyogram (EMG) of active muscles. In motor neuroscience, rectification of the surface EMG is a common pre-processing step prior to calculating CMC, intended to maximize information about action potential timing, whilst suppressing information relating to motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape. Rectification is believed to produce a general shift in the EMG spectrum towards lower frequencies, including those around the mean motor unit discharge rate. However, there are no published data to support the claim that EMG rectification enhances the detection of CMC. Furthermore, performing coherence analysis after the non-linear procedure of rectification, which results in a significant distortion of the EMG spectrum, is considered fundamentally flawed in engineering and digital signal processing. We calculated CMC between sensorimotor cortex EEG and EMG of two hand muscles during a key grip task in 14 healthy subjects. CMC calculated using unrectified and rectified EMG was compared. The use of rectified EMG did not enhance the detection of CMC, nor was there any evidence that MUAP shape information had an adverse effect on the CMC estimation. EMG rectification had inconsistent effects on the power and coherence spectra and obscured the detection of CMC in some cases. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, which, along with our empirical data, demonstrates that rectification is neither necessary nor appropriate in the calculation of CMC.

Adaptive Method for EEG Spectrum Component Decomposition	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						EEG rhythms; EEG spectrum; correlation matrix; principal components analysis	ALPHA	A new computerized method for EEG rhythms extraction is proposed as a development of the idea of adjustable boundaries of frequency components that was put forward in previous investigations. Principle component analysis of the correlation matrix of EEG spectra with subsequent rotation of factor solutions was used for decomposition of a spectrum into physically meaningful spectral components. The method was tested on EEG of 14 healthy subjects recorded in 17 functional waking states. Fourteen independent spectral components in the spectral range from 0 to 100 Hz were extracted and their frequency boundaries were consistent with the current knowledge on frequency components of EEG oscillations. Main advantage of the described method is the adjustable estimation of EEG frequency oscillators taking into account characteristic properties of individual EEGs. Possible area of application might be the correct evaluation of spectral power of the EEG rhythms, EEG coherence and other spectral characteristics in clinical and experimental research, studies of the frequency characteristics of the EEG rhythms in different human functional states, changes in frequency characteristics of the EEG rhythms during maturation and in mental pathology.

Currently, studies of epileptic seizures often involve tedious and time-consuming visual inspection of multi-channel long EEG data by medical experts. To better monitor seizures and make medications more effective, we propose a recurrence time based approach to characterize brain electrical activity. Unlike many other nonlinear methods, the proposed approach does not require that the EEG data be chaotic and/or stationary. It only contains a few parameters that are largely signal-independent, and hence, is very easy to use. The method detects epileptic seizures with accuracy close to 100% (when subclinical seizures are not counted) and false alarm rate per hour close to 0. Most critically, the method is very fast: with an ordinary PC (CPU speed less than 2 GHz), computation of the recurrence time from one channel EEG data of duration one hour with sampling frequency of 200 Hz takes about 1 minute CPU time. Therefore, with an ordinary PC, the method is able to process all 28 channels of 1-hour EEG data in about half an hour, and thus faster than the data being continuously collected. The method can also effectively monitor propagation of seizures in the brain. Therefore, it has the potential to be an excellent candidate for real-time monitoring of epileptic seizures in a clinical setting.

How to recognize SSVEP with shorter time and lower error rate is one of the key points to develop a more efficient SSVEP-based BCI. To achieve this goal, we make use of the sparsity constraint of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for the extraction of more discriminative features of SSVEP, and then we propose a LASSO model using the linear regression between electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and the standard square-wave signals of different frequencies to recognize SSVEP without the training stage. In this study, we verified the proposed LASSO model offline with the EEG data of nine healthy subjects in contrast to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In the experiment, when a shorter time window was used, we found that the LASSO model yielded better performance in extracting robust and detectable features of SSVEP, and the information transfer rate obtained by the LASSO model was significantly higher than that of the CCA. Our proposed method can assist to reduce the recording time without sacrificing the classification accuracy and is promising for a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Switch-Related and General Preparation Processes in Task-Switching: Evidence from Multivariate Pattern Classification of EEG Data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECONFIGURATION; COMPONENTS	The cued-trials task-switching paradigm is used to investigate the processes involved in preparation to change task. Task switch trials typically show poorer performance than task repeat trials, suggesting that additional or more time-consuming preparation processes are required to switch tasks. However, behavioral and neuroimaging studies have so far been unable to decipher whether preparing for a switch in task involves distinct cognitive processes to those required more generally on both switch and repeat trials. The current study addresses this question using a novel multivariate pattern misclassification analysis of frequency band-specific local topographical patterns in human EEG activity that was elicited by cues varying in information value. Within the alpha frequency band, misclassification analysis produced evidence for an early switch-related preparation process over right frontal cortex, as well as a later task readiness preparation process over right parietal cortex. This represents compelling evidence for dissociable switch-related and task readiness preparation processes that show distinct time course and spatial activation patterns.

The majority of attentional research has focused on the effects of attention to a single modality, and little is known about the role of attention in multimodal sensory processing. Here we employ a novel experimental design to examine the electrophysiological basis of audio-visual attention shifting. We use electroencephalography (EEG) to study differences in brain dynamics between quickly shifting attention between modalities and focusing attention on a single modality for extended periods of time. We also address interactions between attentional effects generated by the attention-shifting cue and those generated by subsequent stimuli. The conclusions from these examinations address key issues in attentional research, including the supramodal theory of attention, or the role of attention in foveal vision. The experimental design and analysis methods used here may suggest new directions in the study of the physiological basis of attention.

The analysis of sleep in humans is usually made on periods (epochs) of 30-s length according to the original Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep scoring manual. In this paper, we propose a new phase space-based algorithm (mainly based on Poincare plot) for automatic classification of sleep-wake states in humans using EEG data gathered over relatively short-time periods. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments involving EEG data from seven healthy adult female subjects and was tested on epoch lengths ranging from 3-s to 30-s. The performance of our phase space approach was compared to a 2-dimensional state space approach using spectral power in two selected human-specific frequency bands. These powers were calculated by dividing integrated spectral amplitudes at selected human-specific frequency bands. The comparison demonstrated that the phase space approach gives better performance in the case of short as well as standard 30-s epoch lengths.

Neuropeptide-S Evoked Arousal with Electroencephalogram Slow-Wave Compensatory Drive in Rats	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Neuropeptide S; Sleep-wake architecture; Electroencephalogram oscillations; Homeostasis; Vigilance state transition	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; SYSTEM EXPRESSION; COCAINE-SEEKING; ACTIVATION; SLEEP; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ASSOCIATION; INVOLVEMENT; NUCLEUS; NEURONS	Objectives: Neuropeptide S (NPS) exerts a dual arousal and anxiolytic effect in rodents, which may indicate the potential of a novel class of therapeutic agents in psychiatry. The purpose of this study is to fully describe the nature of electroencephalogram (EEG)-defined waking that mediates these arousal effects. Methods: Effects of the intracerebroventricular infusion of NPS at 2 different doses were characterized over 20 h on sleep-wake architecture and EEG spectral components in rats that were chronically implanted with epidural electrodes for continuous measurement of sleep polygraphic and EEG variables. Results: NPS (1 and 10 nmol) increased active waking (+88 and +87%, respectively), decreased light slow-wave sleep (ISWS) (-84 and -68%, respectively), deep slow-wave sleep (dSWS) (-47 and -33%, respectively) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (-71 and -70%, respectively) during the first 2 h after infusion. The wake-promoting effect of NPS is consistent with a marked lengthening in latency to sleep onset, a decrease in the number of state transitions from wakefulness to ISWS, and a delayed ISWS compensatory response. Interestingly, NPS significantly enhanced waking EEG theta oscillations and slow wave activity during dSWS. Conclusion:The findings suggest that NPS enhanced a consolidated waking associated with a subsequent compensatory EEG slow-wave homeostatic drive rather than rebound sleep duration. The characteristics of NPS-induced waking coupled with enhanced EEG theta oscillations without rebound in sleep are desirable therapeutic features in wake-promoting agents. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

The importance of circuits is underscored by the finding that no single gene contributes strongly to the disease. Thus, some circuit abnormality to which many proteins can contribute is the likely cause. There are several major hypotheses regarding the circuitry involved: first, a change in the balance of excitation/inhibition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); second, abnormal EEG oscillations in the gamma range; third, an increase in theta/delta EEG power related to changes in the thalamus (particularly midline nuclei); fourth, hyperactivity in the hippocampus and consequent dopamine hyperfunction; and fifth, deficits in corollary discharge. Evidence for these hypotheses will be reviewed.

Studies in genetic rodent models suggest that SWDs originate from a restricted region in the somatosensory cortex. The properties of this initiation site remain unknown. Our goal was to characterize the interictal, preictal and ictal neuronal activity in the primary and secondary cortical regions (S1, S2) and in the adjacent insular cortex (IC) in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Methods: We performed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in combination with multisite local field potential (LFP) and single cell juxtacellular recordings, and cortical electrical stimulations, in freely moving rats and those under neurolept-anesthesia. Key Findings: The onset of the SWDs was preceded by 59 Hz field potential oscillations, which were detected earlier in S2 and IC than in S1. Sustained SWDs could be triggered by a 2-s train of 7-Hz electrical stimuli at a lower current intensity in S2 than in S1. In S2 and IC, subsets of neurons displayed rhythmic firing (59 Hz) in between seizures. S2 and IC layers V and VI neurons fired during the same time window, whereas in S1 layer VI, neurons fired before layer V neurons. Just before the spike component of each SW complex, short-lasting high-frequency oscillations consistently occurred in IC similar to 20 msec before S1. Significance: Our findings demonstrate that the S2/IC cortical areas are a critical component of the macro-network that is responsible for the generation of absence-related SWDs.

We compared two VR-systems: a highly immersive Single-Wall-VR-system (three-dimensional view, large screen) and a less immersive Desktop-VR-system (two-dimensional view, small screen). Twenty-nine participants performed a spatial navigation task in a virtual maze and had to state their sensation of "being there" on a 5-point rating scale. Task-related power decrease/increase (TRPD/TRPI) in the Alpha band (8-12 Hz) and coherence analyses in different frequency bands were used to analyze the EEG data. The Single-Wall-VR-system caused a more intense presence experience than the Desktop-VR-system. This increased feeling of presence in the Single-Wall-VR-condition was accompanied by an increased parietal TRPD in the Alpha band, which is associated with cortical activation. The lower presence experience in the Desktop-VR-group was accompanied by a stronger functional connectivity between frontal and parietal brain regions indicating that the communication between these two brain areas is crucial for the presence experience. Hence, we found a positive relationship between presence and parietal brain activation and a negative relationship between presence and frontal brain activation in an interactive VR-paradigm, supporting the results of passive non-interactive VR-studies.

The aim was to investigate the spatiotemporal stability of these oscillators and quantify the spatiotemporal process of engagement and disengagement of the neuronal oscillators in both multitrial and single-trial data. Methods: White light-emitting diode flicker stimulation was used at 15 frequencies, which were set relative to the individual a frequency of each of the 10 healthy participants. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) were recorded. Subsequently, spatiotemporal matching pursuit (MP) algorithms were used to analyze the EEG and MEG topographies. Results: Intraindividually similar topographies were found at stimulation frequencies close to (1) the individual a frequency and (2) half the individual a frequency in the multitrial and the single-trial cases. In both stimulation frequency ranges, the authors observed stable topographies 5 to 10 stimuli after the beginning of the stimulation and lasting three nonexisting periods after the end of the stimulation. This was interpreted as the engaging/disengaging effect of the observed oscillations, because especially the frequency parameter adopted before and after stable topographies were observed. Topographic entrainment was slightly more pronounced in MEG as compared with that in EEG. Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis of nonlinear information processing in human visual system, which can be described by nonlinear neural oscillators.

EEG signals contained not only noise artefacts, but also variations within and across sessions. To reduce this unnecessary information in EEG signal processing, we applied an extension version of common spatial pattern (CSP). The original CSP has been widely used to extract relevant spatial features from EEG signals. However, one of the CSP limitations is occurred when it concentrated on artifacts and variances sources, which exceeded the variance of endogenous component of the brain, instead of extracting the sources that provide subject's intention. Therefore, we proposed to add more parameter for separating invariance and variance in EEGs. To reduce the variant parts of signal in EEGs, we applied invariant common spatial pattern (iCSP) to maximize one class in the same time minimize other class and invariant sources. Based on neurophysiological knowledge, we made some strong weights to special electrodes related to our experimental paradigm. The raw EEG signals were recorded by auditory stimuli with 3 different frequencies cued for real hand movement and ignored noise. The right or left actual hand movements-based EEG signal states were classified by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The behavioral significance of coherent resting-state oscillations after stroke	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural networks; Stroke; Neurological deficits; Alpha oscillations; Functional connectivity	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG; PERFORMANCE; AREAS; NETWORKS; MEG	Stroke lesions induce not only loss of local neural function, but disruptions in spatially distributed areas. However, it is unknown whether they affect the synchrony of electrical oscillations in neural networks and if changes in network coherence are associated with neurological deficits. This study assessed these questions in a population of patients with subacute, unilateral, ischemic stroke. Spontaneous cortical oscillations were reconstructed from high-resolution electroencephalograms (EEG) with adaptive spatial filters. Maps of functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas were created and correlated with patient performance in motor and cognitive scores. In comparison to age matched healthy controls, stroke patients showed a selective disruption of FC in the alpha frequency range. The spatial distribution of alpha band FC reflected the pattern of motor and cognitive deficits of the individual patient: network nodes that participate normally in the affected functions showed local decreases in FC with the rest of the brain. Interregional FC in the alpha band, but not in delta, theta, or beta frequencies, was highly correlated with motor and cognitive performance. In contrast, FC between contralesional areas and the rest of the brain was negatively associated with patient performance. Alpha oscillation synchrony at rest is a unique and specific marker of network function and linearly associated with behavioral performance. Maps of alpha synchrony computed from a single resting-state EEG recording provide a robust and convenient window into the functionality and organization of cortical networks with numerous potential applications.

Brain's alpha activity is highly reduced in euthymic bipolar disorder patients	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						EEG alpha activity; Bipolar disorder; Visual evoked alpha oscillations; Euthymia; Schizophrenia	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RESTING EEG; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; GAMMA COHERENCE; P300 AMPLITUDE; FIRST-EPISODE; ABNORMALITIES	Brain's alpha activity and alpha responses belong to major electrical signals that are related to sensory/cognitive signal processing. The present study aims to analyze the spontaneous alpha activity and visual evoked alpha response in drug free euthymic bipolar patients. Eighteen DSM-IV euthymic bipolar patients (bipolar I n = 15, bipolar II n = 3) and 18 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Patients needed to be euthymic at least for 4 weeks and psychotrop free for at least 2 weeks. Spontaneous EEG (4 min eyes closed, 4 min eyes open) and evoked alpha response upon application of simple visual stimuli were analyzed. EEG was recorded at 30 positions. The digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis was performed for spontaneous eyes closed and eyes open conditions and the response power spectrum was also analyzed for simple visual stimuli. In the analysis of spontaneous EEG, the ANOVA on alpha responses revealed significant results for groups (F(1,34) = 8.703; P < 0.007). Post-hoc comparisons showed that spontaneous EEG alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than the spontaneous EEG alpha power of euthymic patients. Furthermore, visual evoked alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than visual evoked alpha power of euthymic patients (F(1,34) = 4.981; P < 0.04). Decreased alpha activity in spontaneous EEG is an important pathological EEG finding in euthymic bipolar patients. Together with an evident decrease in evoked alpha responses, the findings may lead to a new pathway in search of biological correlates of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder.

On-off intermittency of thalamo-cortical oscillations in the electroencephalogram of rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Temporal dynamics; Continuous wavelet analysis; Spike-wave discharge; Absence seizure; Sleep spindle; WAG/Rij rat	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; SLEEP SPINDLES; IN-VIVO; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISM; SEIZURES; NEURONS	Spike-wave discharges (SWD) are electroencephalographic hallmarks of absence epilepsy. SWD are known to originate from thalamo-cortical neuronal network that normally produces sleep spindle oscillations. Although sleep spindles and SWD are considered as thalamocortical oscillations, functional relationship between them is not obvious. The present study describes temporal dynamics of SWD and sleep spindles as determined in 24 h EEG recorded in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. SWD, sleep spindles (10-15 Hz) and 5-9 Hz oscillations were automatically detected in EEG using wavelet-based algorithm. It was found that non-linear dynamics of SWD fitted well to the law of 'on-off intermittency'. Sleep spindles also demonstrated 'on-off intermittency', in contrast to 5-9 Hz oscillations, whose dynamics could not be classified as having any known type of non-linear behavior. Intermittency in sleep spindles and SWD implies that (1) temporal dynamics of these oscillations are deterministic in nature, and (2) it might be controlled by a system-level mechanism responsible for circadian modulation of neuronal network activity.

Differential effects of NMDA antagonists on high frequency and gamma EEG oscillations in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Schizophrenia animal model; NMDA receptor antagonists; Gamma oscillations; High frequency oscillations	ASPARTATE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE; 2-AMINO-7-PHOSPHONOHEPTANOIC ACID; BIPHENYL-DERIVATIVES; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; WORKING-MEMORY; ANIMAL-MODEL; IN-VITRO; RAT	Neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural abnormalities following timed prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treatment in rats model changes observed in schizophrenia. In particular, MAM treatment on gestational day 17 (E17) preferentially disrupts limbic cortical circuits, and is a promising animal model of schizophrenia. The hypersensitivity of this model to the NMDA receptor antagonist-induced hyperactivity has been proposed to mimic the increase in sensitivity observed in schizophrenia patients following PCP and Ketamine administration. However, how this increase in sensitivity in both patients and animals translates to differences in EEG oscillatory activity is unknown. In this study we have shown that MAM-E17 treated animals have an increased response to the hyperlocomotor and wake promoting effects of Ketamine, PCP, and MK801 but not to the competitive antagonist SDZ 220,581. These behavioural changes were accompanied by altered EEG responses to the NMDAR antagonists, most evident in the gamma and high frequency (HFO) ranges: altered sensitivity of these neuronal network oscillations in MAM-exposed rats is regionally selective, and reflects altered interneuronal function in this neurodevelopmental model.

Family-based genome-wide association study of frontal theta oscillations identifies potassium channel gene KCNJ6	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alcoholism; EEG; GWAS; KCNJ6; oscillations	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; S-TRANSFORM; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; DELTA-OSCILLATION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; GIRK CHANNELS; NEURONS; MEMORY	Event-related oscillations (EROs) represent highly heritable neuroelectric correlates of cognitive processes that manifest deficits in alcoholics and in offspring at high risk to develop alcoholism. Theta ERO to targets in the visual oddball task has been shown to be an endophenotype for alcoholism. A family-based genome-wide association study was performed for the frontal theta ERO phenotype using 634 583 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 1560 family members from 117 families densely affected by alcohol use disorders, recruited in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism. Genome-wide significant association was found with several SNPs on chromosome 21 in KCNJ6 (a potassium inward rectifier channel; KIR3.2/GIRK2), with the most significant SNP at P = 4.7 x 10-10). The same SNPs were also associated with EROs from central and parietal electrodes, but with less significance, suggesting that the association is frontally focused. One imputed synonymous SNP in exon four, highly correlated with our top three SNPs, was significantly associated with the frontal theta ERO phenotype. These results suggest KCNJ6 or its product GIRK2 account for some of the variations in frontal theta band oscillations. GIRK2 receptor activation contributes to slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials that modulate neuronal excitability, and therefore influence neuronal networks.	[Kang, S.

Nonetheless, there is little doubt that alpha-band oscillations also play an active role in information processing. In this article, I suggest that alpha-band oscillations have two roles (inhibition and timing) that are closely linked to two fundamental functions of attention (suppression and selection), which enable controlled knowledge access and semantic orientation (the ability to be consciously oriented in time, space, and context). As such, alpha-band oscillations reflect one of the most basic cognitive processes and can also be shown to play a key role in the coalescence of brain activity in different frequencies.

Cortico-Muscular Coherence is an index of the coupling of EEG signal in the cortical area with sEMG activity in the frequency domain, and its contributions in the beta band (15-30 Hz) have been associated to the movement intent. Cortico-Muscular Coherence estimation is here achieved by considering a closed-loop representation of the signals under analysis obtained through Multivariate Auto Regressive modeling. Significance levels for Cortico-Muscular Coherence are assessed by means of a surrogate data analysis approach. The detection technique is able to reveal significant Cortico-Muscular Coherence changes in 79% of the experimental trials, with a mean anticipation of 1.35 s with respect to movement onset. Time-frequency estimation of Cortico-Muscular Coherence can provide an insight for the development of a multimodal BCI able to integrate information from the brain activity in the functioning of assistive devices.

J.; Ser, Wee; Huang, Guang-bin			Discrete Wavelet Transform Coefficients for Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE				In this paper, we propose to use DWT coefficients as features for emotion recognition from EEG signals. Previous feature extraction methods used power spectra density values dervied from Fourier Transform or sub-band energy and entropy derived from Wavelet Transform. These feature extracion methods eliminate temporal information which are essential for analyzing EEG signals. The DWT coefficients represent the degree of correlation between the analyzed signal and the wavelet function at different instances of time; therefore, DWT coefficients contain temporal information of the analyzed signal. The proposed feature extraction method fully utilizes the simultaneous time-frequency analysis of DWT by preserving the temporal information in the DWT coefficients. In this paper, we also study the effects of using different wavelet functions (Coiflets, Daubechies and Symlets) on the performance of the emotion recognition system. The input EEG signals were obtained from two electrodes according to 10-20 system: F-p1 and F-p2. Visual stimuli from International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were used to induce two emotions: happy and sad. Two classifiers were used: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results confirmed that the proposed DWT coefficients method showed improvement of performance compared to previous methods.	[Yohanes, Rendi E.

A preponderance of research suggests that oscillatory dynamics in the alpha band co-vary with performance on a number of visuo-spatial cognitive tasks. Here we discuss a growing body of research relating these measures to saccadic behavior, focusing also on how task related and spontaneous measures of alpha oscillations may serve as potential biomarkers for ocular motor dysfunction in clinical populations.

Improvements of Adaptive Filtering by Optimal Projection to filter different artifact types on long duration EEG recordings	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Automatic filtering; Muscle artifacts; Ocular artifacts; Electrode artifacts; Epilepsy; CSP	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REMOVAL; DECOMPOSITION	Adaptive Filtering by Optimal Projection (AFOP) is an automatic method for reducing ocular and muscular artifacts on electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings. This paper presents two additions to this method: an improvement of the stability of ocular artifact filtering and an adaptation of the method for filtering electrode artifacts. With these improvements, it is possible to reduce almost all the current types of artifacts, while preserving brain signals, particularly those characterising epilepsy. This generalised method consists of dividing the signal into several time-frequency windows, and in applying different spatial filters to each. Two steps are required to define one of these spatial filters: the first step consists of defining artifact spatial projection using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) method and the second consists of defining EEG spatial projection via regression. For this second step, a progressive orthogonalisation process is proposed to improve stability. This method has been tested on long-duration EEG recordings of epileptic patients. A neurologist quantified the ratio of removed artifacts and the ratio of preserved EEG. Among the 330 artifacted pages used for evaluation, readability was judged better for 78% of pages, equal for 20% of pages, and worse for 2%. Artifact amplitudes were reduced by 80% on average. At the same time, brain sources were preserved in amplitude from 70% to 95% depending on the type of waves (alpha, theta, delta, spikes, etc.). A blind comparison with manual Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was also realised. The results show that this method is competitive and useful for routine clinical practice.

Open label, randomized, crossover pilot trial of high-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring to relieve insomnia	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Biofeedback; EEG; HIRREM; insomnia; neural oscillations	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSOMNIA; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; EEG ACTIVITY; SLEEP; BIOFEEDBACK; PLACEBO; NEUROFEEDBACK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; HYPERAROUSAL; PREVALENCE	Effective noninvasive interventions for insomnia are needed. High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM (TM)) is a noninvasive, electroencephalography (EEG)-based method to facilitate greater client-unique, autocalibrated improvements of balance and harmony in cortical neural oscillations. This study explores using HIRREM for insomnia. Twenty subjects, with an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score of >= 15 (14 women, mean age 45.4, mean ISI 18.6), were enrolled in this randomized, unblinded, wait-list control, crossover, superiority study. Subjects were randomized to receive 8-12 HIRREM sessions over 3 weeks, plus usual care (HUC), or usual care alone (UC). Pre-and post-HIRREM data collection included ISI (primary outcome), and many secondary, exploratory measures (CES-D, SF-36, HR, BP, neurocognitive testing, and VAS scales). The UC group later crossed over to receive HIRREM. ISI was also repeated 4-6 weeks post-HIRREM. All subjects completed the primary intervention period. Analysis for differential change of ISI in the initial intervention period for HUC versus UC showed a drop of 10.3 points (95% CI: -13.7 to -6.9, P < 0.0001, standardized effect size of 2.68). Key secondary outcomes included statistically identical differential change for the crossed-over UC group, and persistence of the effect on the ISI up to > 4 weeks post-HIRREM. Differential change in the HUC group was also statistically significant for CES-D (-8.8, 95% CI: -17.5 to -0.1, P = 0.047), but other exploratory outcomes were not statistically significant. For all receiving HIRREM (n = 19), decreased high-frequency total power was seen in the bilateral temporal lobes. No adverse events were seen. This pilot clinical trial, the first using HIRREM as an intervention, suggests that HIRREM is feasible and effective for individuals having moderate-to-severe insomnia, with clinically relevant, statistically significant benefits based on differential change in the ISI. Effects persisted for 4 weeks after completion of HIRREM. Larger controlled clinical trials are warranted.

Spectral power changes were assessed separately for target and non-target stimuli in four different memory load conditions (0, 1, 2, and 3-back). The presentation of both target and non-target stimuli elicited long-lasting similar to 4-8 Hz power increases, which were more prominent at the beginning of stimulus onset during presentation of target stimuli, as compared to non-target stimuli, in the 0-back memory load condition. similar to 8-25 Hz power decreases appeared at stimulus onset. These power decreases were more prominent during the presentation of target stimuli, as compared to non-target stimuli, and their duration increased as a function of memory load between the 0-, 1-, and 2-back, but not the 3-back, memory load conditions. The current results provide further evidence in support of the notion of a complex interplay between both similar to 4-8 Hz power increases and similar to 8-25 Hz power decreases during cognitive memory task performance.

THE PROCESSING BIAS FOR THREATENING CUES REVEALED BY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL AND EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATION ANALYSES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						threatening picture; processing bias; event-related potential; event-related oscillation; emotion	ATTENTIONAL BIAS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; ANGRY FACES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; TRAIT ANXIETY; THETA BAND; BRAIN; EMOTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION	The processing bias of threat is crucial for survival. However, the neurophysiological underpinnings of this bias are not fully understood. To contribute to a better understanding of the processing bias for threat, both event-related potential (ERP) and event-related oscillation (ERO) analyses were applied to the electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from subjects while performing a go/no-go variant of the dot-probe task. In the task, subjects responded to the infrequent target stimuli and didn't respond to the standard stimuli. Both target and standard stimuli were preceded by a bilateral picture pair [one emotional (threatening or pleasant) and one neutral] as an emotional cue. The behavioral data and the P1 elicited by standard stimuli didn't show any significant main effect or interaction. The mean amplitude of N1 was greater negative for threatening cues than pleasant cues with the most significant effect in the fronto-central region, indicating a processing bias for threat related to early attention processing. In addition, the theta synchronization was stronger for threatening cues than pleasant cues with significant effect in posterior regions, suggesting that the posterior theta synchronization reflects the evaluation of emotional significance of stimuli. Taken together, the ERP and ERO analyses provide some independent insights into the processing bias for threatening cues and illustrate this bias more comprehensively. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Thus, the main goals of this review are to outline the relevance of the EEG with respect to sports, to give a concise overview of important findings, and to critically evaluate the impact of using this method in sports psychology. After a short introduction to EEG methods we will focus on applications in three areas: (a) basic aspects of movement and movement learning, (b) attention-related changes during activity, and (c) correlates of affective changes due to physical activity. Finally the relevance and importance of the EEG in sports psychology, as well as the limitations of its application, will be discussed.

Our previous work revealed behavioral inhibition modulation by anodal tDCS over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG); however, the electrophysiological correlates underlying this stimulation montage have yet to be established. The current work aimed to evaluate the distribution of neuronal oscillations changes following anodal tDCS over rIFG coupled with cathodal tDCS over left orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) using spectral power analysis. Methods: Healthy subjects underwent sham and real tDCS (15 min, 1.5 mA, anodal rIFG; cathodal lOFC) stimulation conditions in a single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Following tDCS session, resting EEG recordings were collected during 15 min. Results: Analysis showed a significant and selective diminution of the power of theta band. The theta diminution was observed in the rIFG area (represented the anode electrode), and was not found in the lOFC area (represented the cathode electrode). A significant effect was observed only in the theta but not in other bands. Conclusions: These results are the first demonstration of modulating oscillatory activity as measured by EEG with tDCS over rIFG in general, and documenting theta band reduction with this montage in particular. Significance: Our results may explain the improvement in behavioral inhibition reported in our previous work, and although this study was conducted with healthy subjects, the findings suggest that tDCS may also modulate electrophysiological changes among ADHD patients, where decreasing theta activity is the target of neuro-feedback methods aimed to improve cognitive control.

In order to address this question, EEG operational architectonics analysis (Fingelkurts and Fingelkurts 2001, 2008) was conducted in patients in minimally conscious (MCS) and vegetative states (VS) to study the dynamics of neuronal assemblies and operational synchrony among them as a function of consciousness expression. We found that in minimally conscious patients and especially in vegetative patients neuronal assemblies got smaller, their life span shortened and they became highly unstable. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the extent/volume and strength of operational synchrony among neuronal assemblies was smallest or even absent in VS patients, intermediate in MCS patients, and highest in healthy fully conscious subjects. All findings were similarly observed in EEG alpha as well as beta1 and beta2 frequency oscillations. The presented results support the basic tenets of operational architectonics theory of brain-mind functioning and suggest that EEG operational architectonics analysis may provide an objective and accurate means of assessing signs of (un)consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries. Therefore, this methodological approach may complement the existing "gold standard" of behavioral assessment of this population of challenging patients and inform the diagnostic and treatment decision-making processes.

The current study has two objectives, first, to conduct a multidimensional analysis of central and physical components of fatigue in drivers during simulated driving session and second, to find the rationality of each assessed parameter to be used for scoring system. Briefly, 12 skilled drivers were subjected to simulated driving session for 32-hours. An EEG and an ECG were obtained from each subject at 3-hours interval to assess central and peripheral components of driver's fatigue respectively. EEG data were analyzed to obtain the variation in relative energy of all frequency bands while ECG data were used to study heart rate variability(HRV) at progressive stages of fatigue. Concurrently, blood samples of each subject were analyzed for key blood biomarkers(random blood sugar, blood urea and creatinine) at 8-hours interval. The relative-energy of theta, alpha and beta-bands increased most significantly at Cz electrode while the variations across the stages was most significant in a derived band i.e. alpha+theta / delta 1-delta 2 followed by that of theta-band. The power distribution in high frequency components of ECG showed a distinct decreasing trend with advancing fatigue. All blood biomarkers increased with duration of driving task that was significant across the stages. Thus, an effective scoring of drivers' fatigue can be obtained by integrating EEG parameters with HRV and blood biomarkers that can validate fatigue detecting devices under development.

Multichannel recording of ongoing EEG was carried out in the resting state; leads were located according to the 10-20 system. Despite natural high interindividual variability, the subgroup of internals was, in general, characterized by higher spectral powers (SPs) of the delta, theta, alpha, and beta 1 rhythms and a lower SPs of beta 2 and gamma oscillations recorded in the resting state with the eyes closed. In internals, the modal frequencies of practically all EEG ranges were, on average, somewhat lower. In this subgroup, reaction of EEG activation related to opening of the eyes was stronger, while the interhemisphere asymmetry was weaker.

This method could be as an alternative instead of other clinical criteria such as pain reflex, auditory evoked potential, bispectral index scale (BIS) or amount of burst suppression. The proposed method is based on analysis of a single-channel EEG signal of patients during anesthesia, using wavelet transform. In order to use wavelet information, entropy is selected as the statistical tool. The obtained results suggest our method called Wavelet Coefficient Energy Entropy (WCEE) as a quantitative index for depth of anesthesia. To validate the introduced index. WCEE is applied to EEG signals of 22 people during the surgery and their determined indices are compared to BIS index, which is now a reference in anesthesia monitoring. The comparison results reveal a high correlation between WCEE index and BIS index during different anesthesia states. Moreover, WCEE values could precisely classify different anesthesia states with less computational burden than BIS index. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as the oscillatory dynamics of the EEG signal, specifically, frequency power changes expressed as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S), were analyzed. Replicating earlier results, we found an N400 on semantically incongruent words, as well as on low doze probability words. For the bilinguals investigated in the present study, N400 latency in the low doze probability condition was found to be modulated by L2 proficiency, indicating that L2 proficiency in our sample might have influenced the speed of semantic integration. Relative Theta power increased for all three word conditions, but no influence of proficiency was observed. Different from the ERP results, we found a stronger increase in theta power for low doze probability words than for incongruent and high doze probability words, especially over temporo-parietal brain areas. The spatial distribution of the theta ERD/S results also differed from the N400 topography. Whereas the N400 showed a typical topography with a maximum over temporo-posterior electrode positions, the theta ERD/S topography was maximal for high and low doze probability words over left central-posterior electrode positions. These findings show that the ERP and ERD/S results are sensitive to semantic processing. The different pattern of the ERD/S results compared to the ERP results, functionally and with regard to topography, suggests that the ERD/S reflects a different aspect or stage of semantic processing, possibly the successful conceptualization of a sentence.

Spontaneous brain oscillations are assumed to be the underlying mechanism of periodic perception. Depending on the phase angle of the oscillations, an identical stimulus results in different perceptual outcomes. Past results, however, can only account for a correlation of perception with the phase of the ongoing brain oscillations. Therefore, it is desirable to demonstrate a causal relation between phase and perception. One way to address this question is to entrain spontaneous brain oscillations by applying an external oscillation and then demonstrate behavioral consequences of this oscillation. We conducted an auditory detection experiment with humans, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) concurrently and simultaneously applied oscillating transcranial direct current stimulation at 10 Hz (alpha-tDCS). Our approach revealed that detection thresholds were dependent on the phase of the oscillation that was entrained by alpha-tDCS. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an electrophysiological effect: alpha-power was enhanced after alpha-tDCS as compared to a pre-stimulation period. By showing a causal relation between phase and perception, our results extend findings of previous studies that were only able to demonstrate a correlation. We found that manipulation of the phase resulted in different detection thresholds, which supports the notion that perception can be periodically modulated by oscillatory processes. This demonstrates that tDCS can serve as a tool in neuroscience to extend the knowledge of the functional significance of brain oscillations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) sensitivity differentiates EEG theta responses during goal conflict in a continuous monitoring task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Coherence; Theta; Goal conflict; Behavioural inhibition system (BIS)	VOLUME CONDUCTION; TRAIT ANXIETY; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE; PERSONALITY; ASYMMETRY	Previous research has revealed that EEG theta oscillations are affected during goal conflict processing. This is consistent with the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) theory of anxiety (Gray & McNaughton, 2000). However, studies have not attempted to relate these BIS-related theta effects to BIS personality measures. Confirmation of such an association would provide further support for BIS theory, especially as it relates to trait differences. EEG was measured (32 electrodes) from extreme groups (low/high trait BIS) engaged in a target detection task. Goal conflicts were introduced throughout the task. Results show that the two groups did not differ in behavioural performance. The major EEG result was that a stepwise discriminant analysis indicated discrimination by 6 variables derived from coherence and power, with 5 of the 6 in the theta range as predicted by BIS theory and one in the beta range. Also, across the whole sample, EEG theta coherence increased at a variety of regions during primary goal conflict and showed a general increase during response execution; EEG theta power, in contrast, was primarily reactive to response execution. This is the first study to reveal a three-way relationship between the induction of goal conflict, the induction of theta power and coherence, and differentiation by psychometrically-defined low/high BIS status.

Three visual stimuli, flickering at 13, 14, and 15 Hz, were displayed on a liquid crystal display monitor to induce user's SSVEPs. The induced SSVEPs were used to control three movement functions (forward, left, and right) of the small robot car. Users gazed at one chosen visual stimulus at one time, and the induced SSVEP was recognized to activate the desired movement function. In this paper, all subjects were requested to handle the small robot car to complete an S-shaped course four times. The proposed system utilized only one electroencephalography (EEG) channel placed at the Oz position. The acquired EEG signals were first segmented into 1-s epochs, and each epoch was then decomposed by EEMD into a series of oscillation components, denoted as intrinsic oscillatory functions (IOFs), representing multiscale features of the recorded signal. The SSVEP-related IOFs were then recognized using a matched filter detector (MFD), including a matched filter demodulator and an amplitude detector. The visual stimulus, which contributed maximum power to the MFD, was recognized as the gazed target. In this paper, all subjects could actuate the small robot car using the proposed EEMD-based brain computer interface system to complete an S-shaped course four times; the mean execution time, number of valid detections, and command transfer interval over the 11 subjects were 84.5 s, 51.13 commands, and 1.65 s/command, respectively.

There is increasing evidence that pathological oscillations may be specific to diseased networks in patients with epilepsy and that these oscillations may be a key biomarker for generating and indentifying epileptic networks. We present a semi-automated method that detects, maps, and mines pathological gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations (PGOs) in human epileptic brain to possibly localize epileptic networks. We apply the method to standard clinical iEEG (<100 Hz) with interictal PGOs and seizures from six patients with medically refractory epilepsy. We demonstrate that electrodes with consistent PGO discharges do not always coincide with clinically determined seizure onset zone (SOZ) electrodes but at times PGO-dense electrodes include secondary seizure-areas (SS) or even areas without seizures (NS). In 4/5 patients with epilepsy surgery, we observe poor (Engel Class 4) postsurgical outcomes and identify more PGO-activity in SS or NS than in SOZ. Additional studies are needed to further clarify the role of PGOs in epileptic brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characteristics of Evoked Potential Multiple EEG Recordings in Patients with Chronic Pain by Means of Parallel Factor Analysis	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							CO2-LASER STIMULATION	This paper presents an alternative method, called as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) with a continuous wavelet transform, to analyze of brain activity in patients with chronic pain in the time-frequency-channel domain and quantifies differences between chronic pain patients and controls in these domains. The event related multiple EEG recordings of the chronic pain patients and non-pain controls with somatosensory stimuli (pain, random pain, touch, random touch) are analyzed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is applied to describe the effects of aging on the frequency response differences between patients and controls. The results show that the somatosensory cortical responses occurred around 250 ms in both groups. In the frequency domain, the neural response frequency in the pain group (around 4 Hz) was less than that in the control group (around 5.5 Hz) under the somatosensory stimuli. In the channel domain, cortical activation was predominant in the frontal region for the chronic pain group and in the central region for controls. The indices of active ratios were statistical significant between the two groups in the frontal and central regions. These findings demonstrate that the PARAFAC is an interesting method to understanding the pathophysiological characteristics of chronic pain.

Available mass emergency depopulation procedures include whole-house gassing, partial-house gassing, containerized gassing, and water-based foam. To evaluate potential depopulation methods, it is often necessary to determine the time to the loss of consciousness (LOC) in poultry. Many current approaches to evaluating LOC are qualitative and require visual observation of the birds. This study outlines an electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency domain based approach for determining the point at which a bird loses consciousness. In this study, commercial broilers were used to develop the methodology, and the methodology was validated with layer hens. In total, 42 data sets from 13 broilers aged 5-10 wk and 12 data sets from four spent hens (age greater than 1 yr) were collected and analyzed. A wireless EEG transmitter was surgically implanted, and each bird was monitored during individual treatment with isoflurane anesthesia. EEG data were evaluated using a frequency-based approach. The alpha /delta (A/D, alpha: 8-12 Hz, delta: 0.5-4 Hz) ratio and loss of posture (LOP) were used to determine the point at which the birds became unconscious. Unconsciousness, regardless of the method of induction, causes suppression in alpha and a rise in the delta frequency component, and this change is used to determine unconsciousness. There was no statistically significant difference between time to unconsciousness as measured by A/D ratio or LOP, and the AID values were correlated at the times of unconsciousness. The correlation between LOP and AID ratio indicates that the methodology is appropriate for determining unconsciousness. The A/D ratio approach is suitable for monitoring during anesthesia, during depopulation, and in situations where birds cannot be readily viewed.	[Benson, E. R.; Alphin, R. L.; Rankin, M.

A cued Sternberg WM task and electro-encephalographic recordings (EEG) were used to investigate encoding and control operations in response to to-be-remembered (REM) and not-to-be-remembered (NREM) stimuli in younger and older adults. Younger and older adults selectively remembered REM items in a final recognition memory test. During early stages of stimulus processing, inter-trial phase stability was higher for REM than for NREM items in younger and older adults, presumably reflecting preferential encoding of REM items. At later stages, the oscillatory power of oscillations in the alpha/beta frequency range was higher for NREM than for REM, presumably reflecting the inhibitory top-down suppression of task-irrelevant information. Early phase stability was selectively related to working memory performance in younger adults and high-functioning older adults. The results of this study reveal the differential contributions of low-level feature binding and strategic control components to adult age differences in WM, and show that older adults with more youth-like processing dynamics tend to achieve higher levels of performance.

Subjective patterns range from simple phosphenes to complex patterns but are highly specific and reported reliably across studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using independent-component analysis (ICA) we report a reduction in amplitude variance consistent with subjective-pattern formation in ventral posterior areas of the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG exhibits significantly increased power at delta/theta and gamma-frequencies (point and circle patterns) or a series of high-frequency harmonics of a delta oscillation (spiral patterns). Conclusions/Significance: Subjective-pattern formation may be described in a way entirely consistent with identical pattern formation in fluids or granular flows. In this manner, we propose subjective-pattern structure to be represented within a spatio-temporal lattice of harmonic oscillations which bind topographically organized visual-neuronal assemblies by virtue of low frequency modulation.

Evaluation of EEG based determination of unconsciousness vs. loss of posture in broilers	RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Broiler; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Unconsciousness; Brain activity	POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEART-RATE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ANESTHESIA; CHICKENS; DEPTH	Evaluation of the loss of consciousness in poultry is an essential component in evaluating bird welfare under a variety of situations and applications. Many current approaches to evaluating loss of consciousness are qualitative and require observation of the bird. This study outlines a quantitative method for determining the point at which a bird loses consciousness. In this study, commercial broilers were individually anesthetized and the brain activity recorded as the bird became unconscious. A wireless EEG transmitter was surgically implanted and the bird anesthetized after a 24-48 h recovery. Each bird was monitored during treatment with isoflurane anesthesia and EEG data was evaluated using a frequency based approach. The alpha/delta (AID) ratio and loss of posture (LOP) were used to determine the point at which the birds went unconscious. There was no statistically significant difference between time to unconsciousness as measured by AID ratio or LOP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Benson, E. R.; Alphin, R.

Voltage loss at these tissues may deteriorate the measured signal. In this study, we explored a possibility that an electroencephalograph bearing enhanced input-impedance could detect more sensitively the short latency somatosensory-evoked potential (SEPs) and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in SEPs. We introduced a negative capacitance converter (NCC) into the electroencephalograph at front end. We expected the NCC to reduce floating capacitance in shielded wires between electrode and the electroencephalograph, and consequently to enhance the input-impedance of the device especially in higher frequency region. SEPs and HFOs were measured in eight subjects with the proposed device and compared with those measured with a commercial electroencephalograph. 7 of 8 showed larger amplitude of SEPs when EEG measured with the proposed device, but only 4 out of 7 showed larger amplitude of HFOs.

Electrocardiogram-Based Sleep Spectrogram Measures of Sleep Stability and Glucose Disposal in Sleep Disordered Breathing	SLEEP			English	Article						Disposition index; diabetes mellitus type 2; sleep spectrogram; sleep quality	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; PERIODIC LEG MOVEMENTS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; HEART HEALTH; RISK-FACTOR; APNEA; METABOLISM; MEN; SENSITIVITY	Study Objectives: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is independently associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Experimental sleep fragmentation has been shown to impair insulin sensitivity. Conventional electroencephalogram (EEG)-based sleep-quality measures have been inconsistently associated with indices of glucose metabolism. This analysis explored associations between glucose metabolism and an EEG-independent measure of sleep quality, the sleep spectrogram, which maps coupled oscillations of heart-rate variability and electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived respiration. The method allows improved characterization of the quality of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: N/A. Participants: Nondiabetic subjects with and without SDB (n = 118) underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) and a full-montage polysomnogram. The sleep spectrogram was generated from ECG collected during polysomnography. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Standard polysomnographic stages (stages 1, 2, 3+4, and rapid eye movement [ REM]) were not associated with the disposition index (D-I) derived from the FSIVGTT. In contrast, spectrographic high-frequency coupling (a marker of stable or "effective" sleep) duration was associated with increased, and very-low-frequency coupling (a marker of wake/REM/transitions) associated with reduced DI. This relationship was noted after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, slow wave sleep, total sleep time, stage 1, the arousal index, and the apnea-hypopnea index. Conclusions: ECG-derived sleep-spectrogram measures of sleep quality are associated with alterations in glucose-insulin homeostasis. This alternate mode of estimating sleep quality could improve our understanding of sleep and sleep-breathing effects on glucose metabolism.

In this article, we suggest that posterior alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) provide a mechanism for prioritizing and ordering unattended visual input according to 'relevance'. Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) that are phase-locked to the alpha oscillations keep competing unattended representations apart in time, thus creating a sequence of perceptual cycles. As inhibition gradually lowers within an alpha cycle, the ordered sequence of competing input is activated, producing a temporal phase code for saliency. The proposed mechanism is based on recent experiments indicating that the phase of alpha activity modulates perception and that alpha oscillations are produced by periodic pulses of inhibition.

It is a particularly crucial issue in pediatric anesthesia, in the context of the recent controversies about the potential neurological consequences of the main anesthetic drugs on the developing brain. The electroencephalogram signal reflects the electrical activity of the neurons in the cerebral cortex. It is thus the key to assessment of the level of hypnosis. Beyond visual analysis, several monitoring devices allow an automated treatment of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, combining time and frequency domain analysis. Each of these monitors focuses on a specific combination of characteristics of the signal and provides the clinician with useful information that remains, however, partial. For a comprehensive approach of the EEG-derived indices, the main features of the normal EEG, in adults and children, will be presented in the awake state and during sleep. Age-related modifications accompanying cerebral maturation during infancy and childhood will be detailed. Then, this review will provide an update on how anesthetic drugs, particularly hypnotics, influence the EEG signal, and how the main available monitors analyze these drug-induced modifications. The relationships between pain, memory, and the EEG will be discussed. Finally, this review will focus on some specific EEG features such as the electrical epileptoid activity observed under sevoflurane anesthesia. The EEG signal is the best window we have on cortical brain activity and provides a fair pharmacodynamic feedback of the effects of hypnotics. However, the cortex is only one of several targets of anesthesia. Hypnotics and opiates, have also subcortical primary targets, and the EEG performances in the evaluation or prediction of nociception are poor. Monitoring subcortical structures in combination with the EEG might in the future allow a better evaluation and a more precise adaptation of balanced anesthesia.

Task induced modulation of neural oscillations in electrophysiological brain networks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Functional connectivity; Neural oscillations; Working memory; Brain networks; ICA	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; MEMORY LOAD; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG DATA; MEG; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; BEAMFORMER; LOCALIZATION; SUPPRESSION	In recent years, one of the most important findings in systems neuroscience has been the identification of large scale distributed brain networks. These networks support healthy brain function and are perturbed in a number of neurological disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). Their study is therefore an important and evolving focus for neuroscience research. The majority of network studies are conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which relies on changes in blood oxygenation induced by neural activity. However recently, a small number of studies have begun to elucidate the electrical origin of fMRI networks by searching for correlations between neural oscillatory signals from spatially separate brain areas in magnetoencephalograPhy (MEG) data Here we advance this research area. We introduce two methodological extensions to previous independent component analysis (ICA) approaches to MEG network characterisation: 1) we show how to derive pan-spectral networks that combine independent components computed within individual frequency bands. 2) We show how to measure the temporal evolution of each network with millisecond temporal resolution. We apply our approach to similar to 10 h of MEG data recorded in 28 experimental sessions during 3 separate cognitive tasks showing that a number of networks could be identified and were robust across time, task, subject and recording session. Further, we show that neural oscillations in those networks are modulated by memory load, and task relevance. This study furthers recent findings on electrodynamic brain networks and paves the way for future clinical studies in patients in which abnormal connectivity is thought to underlie core symptoms.

Physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals have been less considered for emotion recognition in comparison to other modalities such as facial expression and speech, although they have a potential interest as alternative or supplementary channels. This article presents our work on: (1) constructing a dataset containing EEG and peripheral physiological signals acquired during presentation of music video clips, which is made publicly available, and (2) conducting binary classification of induced positive/negative valence, high/low arousal, and like/dislike by using the aforementioned signals. The procedure for the dataset acquisition, including stimuli selection, signal acquisition, self-assessment, and signal processing is described in detail. Especially, we propose a novel asymmetry index based on relative wavelet entropy for measuring the asymmetry in the energy distribution of EEG signals, which is used for EEG feature extraction. Then, the classification systems based on EEG and peripheral physiological signals are presented. Single-trial and single-run classification results indicate that, on average, the performance of the EEG-based classification outperforms that of the peripheral physiological signals. However, the peripheral physiological signals can be considered as a good alternative to EEG signals in the case of assessing a user's preference for a given music video clip (like/dislike) since they have a comparable performance to EEG signals while being more easily measured.

We propose a method to find the spatial amplitude patterns of a time-limited waveform across multiple EEG channels. It consists of a single iteration of multichannel matching pursuit where the base waveform is obtained via the Hilbert transform of a time-limited tone. The vector of extracted amplitudes across channels is used for classification, and we analyze the effect of deviation in temporal alignment of the waveform on classification performance. Results for a previously published dataset of 6 subjects show comparable results versus a more complicated criteria-based method.

The nonsynonymous c.22G > A polymorphism (rs73598374) of adenosine deaminase (ADA) reduces the conversion of adenosine to inosine and predicts baseline differences in sleep slow-wave oscillations. We hypothesized that this polymorphism affects cognitive functions, and investigated whether it modulates electroencephalogram (EEG), behavioral, subjective, and biochemical responses to sleep deprivation. Attention, learning, memory, and executive functioning were quantified in healthy adults. Right-handed carriers of the variant allele (G/A genotype, n = 29) performed worse on the d2 attention task than G/G homozygotes (n = 191). To test whether this difference reflects elevated homeostatic sleep pressure, sleep and sleep EEG before and after sleep deprivation were studied in 2 prospectively matched groups of G/A and G/G genotype subjects. Deep sleep and EEG 0.75- to 1.5-Hz oscillations in non-REM sleep were significantly higher in G/A than in G/G genotype. Moreover, attention and vigor were reduced, whereas waking EEG alpha activity (8.5-12 Hz), sleepiness, fatigue, and alpha-amylase in saliva were enhanced. These convergent data demonstrate that genetic reduction of ADA activity elevates sleep pressure and plays a key role in sleep and waking quality in humans.

Due to this complexity, there are still open issues and challenges regarding olfactory psychophysiology. One challenge concerns the investigation of the hedonic dimension of olfaction, and how it affects the power of the brain oscillations. Although there are some EEG studies exploring the changes in the power of the brain oscillations during olfactory perception, they use simple power spectral analysis techniques and vary much in terms of the reported findings. To reduce this variability, we propose the use of multivariate spectral analysis, to reveal only the frequency patterns of the EEG signals that contribute the most to olfactory perception. The goal is to investigate how these frequency patterns are affected by hedonically different odors throughout the cortex.

Cortical entrainment of human hypoglossal motor unit activities. J Neurophysiol 107: 493-499, 2012. First published November 2, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00769.2011.-Output from the primary motor cortex contains oscillations that can have frequency-specific effects on the firing of motoneurons (MNs). Whereas much is known about the effects of oscillatory cortical drive on the output of spinal MN pools, considerably less is known about the effects on cranial motor nuclei, which govern speech/oromotor control. Here, we investigated cortical input to one such motor pool, the hypoglossal motor nucleus (HMN), which controls muscles of the tongue. We recorded intramuscular genioglossus electromyogram (EMG) and scalp EEG from healthy adult subjects performing a tongue protrusion task. Cortical entrainment of HMN population activity was assessed by measuring coherence between EEG and multiunit EMG activity. In addition, cortical entrainment of individual MN firing activity was assessed by measuring phase locking between single motor unit (SMU) action potentials and EEG oscillations. We found that cortical entrainment of multiunit activity was detectable within the 15- to 40-Hz frequency range but was inconsistent across recordings. By comparison, cortical entrainment of SMU spike timing was reliable within the same frequency range. Furthermore, this effect was found to be intermittent over time. Our study represents an important step in understanding corticomuscular synchronization in the context of human oromotor control and is the first study to document SMU entrainment by cortical oscillations in vivo.

However, the regulation and action mechanism of acupuncture is still unclear. In the present study, synchronization levels of brain activities evoked by MA is investigated. We design an experiment that acupuncture at Zusanli with four different frequencies to obtain electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. Since neural system is a complex nonlinear dynamics system that possesses strong nonlinear characteristic, phase synchronization (PS) based on recurrence plot method is introduced to quantify the synchronization between EEG signals induced by MA. It is found that the synchronization between different brain regions during acupuncture is obviously lower than that before acupuncture, which can prove that MA has effect on the brain.

Based on the maps at peak times of Global Field Power, the sequences were parsed into segments of quasi-stable potential distribution, the 'microstates'. The microstates were clustered into four classes of map topographies (A-D). Analysis of the microstate parameters time coverage, occurrence frequency and duration as well as the temporal sequence (syntax) of the microstate classes revealed significant differences: Believers had a higher coverage and occurrence of class B, tended to decreased coverage and occurrence of class C, and showed a predominant sequence of microstate concatenations from A to C to B to A that was reversed in skeptics (A to B to C to A). Microstates of different topographies, putative "atoms of thought", are hypothesized to represent different types of information processing.The study demonstrates that personality differences can be detected in resting EEG microstate parameters and microstate syntax. Microstate analysis yielded no conclusive evidence for the hypothesized relation between paranormal belief and schizophrenia.

While synchrony has been a key element in visual assessment of neonatal EEG signals, there has been no unambiguous definitions for synchrony, and no objective measures available for neonatal signals. Estimation of phase locking value (PLV) has been an established paradigm in adults, but many unique characteristics of the neonatal EEG have precluded its applicability in them. In the present paper, we developed the existing PLV-based methods further to be applicable for neonatal signals at two different temporal scales, oscillations and events, where the latter refers technically to quantitating phase synchrony (PS) between band-specific amplitude envelopes (bafPS). In addition, we present a measure for quantitation based on assessing cumulative proportion of time with statistically significant synchrony between the given signal pair. The paper uses real EEG examples and the prior neurobiological knowledge in the process of defining optimal parameters in each step of the procedure. Finally, we apply the method to a set of dense array EEG recordings from very early preterm babies, recorded at conceptional age of less than 30 weeks. By comparing PS and bafPS from babies without and with major cerebrovascular lesion, we show that the effects of brain lesions may be selective both in space and in frequency. These findings do by nature escape visual detection in the conventional EEG reading, however they have intriguing correlates in the current concept of how somatosensory networks are thought to develop and/or become disorganized in the early preterm babies.

Although amphibians are thought to lack a neocortical homologue, changes in rest-activity states occur in these species. In the present study, EEG signals were recorded from the surface of the cerebral hemispheres and midbrain on both sides of the brain in an anuran species, Babina daunchina, using electrodes contacting the meninges in order to measure changes in mean EEG power across behavioral states. Functionally relevant frequency bands were identified using factor analysis. The results indicate that: (1) EEG power was concentrated in four frequency bands during the awake or active state and in three frequency bands during rest; (2) EEG bands in frogs differed substantially from humans, especially in the fast frequency band; (3) bursts similar to mammalian sleep spindles, which occur in non-rapid eye movement mammalian sleep, were observed when frogs were at rest suggesting sleep spindle-like EEG activity appeared prior to the evolution of mammals.

Eighteen subjects, including six patients with cerebral palsy (CP) and three patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), participated. The results showed (1) the existence of BCI performance difference caused by severe motor disability; (2) different coherence patterns between participants with and without severe motor disability during BCI operation and (3) effects of motor disability on cortical connections varying in the brain regions for the different frequency bands, indicating reduced cortical differentiation and specialisation. Participants with severe neuromuscular impairments, as compared with the able-bodied group, recruited more cortical regions to compensate for the difficulties caused by their motor disability, reflecting a less efficient operating strategy for the BCI task. This study demonstrated that coherence analysis can be applied to examine the ways cortical networks cooperate with each other during BCI tasks. Practitioner Summary: Few studies have investigated the electrophysiological underpinnings of differences in BCI performance. This study contributes by assessing neuronal synchrony among brain regions. Our findings revealed that severe motor disability causes more cortical areas to be recruited to perform the BCI task, indicating reduced cortical differentiation and specialisation.

Employing a recently introduced methodology that considers the time variations of phase coupling among signals from different channels, a sequence of functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) was constructed for different frequency bands and analyzed based on graph theoretic tools. In the first stage of analysis, hubs were detected in the FCGs based on local and global efficiency. The probability of each node to be identified as a hub was estimated. This defined a topographic function that showed widespread distribution with prominence over the frontal brain regions for both local and global efficiency. Hubs consistent across time were identified via a summarization technique and found to locate over forehead. In the second stage of analysis, the modular structure of each single FCG was delineated. The derived time-dependent signatures of functional structure were compared in a systematic way revealing fluctuations modulated by frequency. Interestingly, the evolution of functional connectivity can be described via abrupt transitions between states, best described as short-lasting bimodal functional segregations. Based on a distance function that compares clusterings, we discovered that these segregations are recurrent. Entropic measures further revealed that the apparent fluctuations are subject to intrinsic constraints and that order emerges from spatially extended interactions.

Recent studies have demonstrated that spontaneous brain oscillations and functional connectivity dissociate during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep; this leads to spontaneous cognitive processes, such as memory consolidation and emotional modulation. However, variations in network connectivity across the sleep stages or between sleep/wake transitions require further elucidation. We observed changes in the connectivity of the sensorimotor and default-mode networks (DMN) mediated by midnight sleep among 18 healthy participants. The results indicated that (1) functional connectivity in both networks showed increasing dissociation as NREM sleep deepened, whereas hyperconnectivity occurred during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; and (2) compared with connectivity before sleep, the DMN presented a comparable connectivity pattern immediately after awakening, whereas the connectivity of the sensorimotor network remained disrupted. These findings showed that connectivity patterns dissociate and reconnect coherently in both cortical networks during NREM and REM sleep, respectively. After the person awakened, the DMN connectivity was re-established before the sensorimotor reconnection. These dynamic sleep-related dissociations and reconnections between sleep/wake conditions might provide the key to understanding cognitive modulations in sleep. If so, connectivity changes might serve as an alternative indicator beyond the EEG signature to unveil the spontaneous processes that occur during sleep.

In addition to examining oscillations in pre-specified bands, interactions and relations between the different frequency bandwidths is another important aspect that needs to be considered in unraveling the workings of the human brain and its functions. In this review we provide evidence that studying interdependencies between brain oscillations may be a valuable approach to study the electrophysiological processes associated with motivation and emotional states. Studies will be presented showing that amplitude-amplitude coupling between delta-alpha and delta-beta oscillations varies as a function of state anxiety and approach-avoidance-related motivation, and that changes in the association between delta-beta oscillations can be observed following successful psychotherapy. Together these studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations may contribute to expanding our understanding of the neural processes underlying motivation and emotion.

While the recording of rapid discharges from intracranial electrodes has long been established, their observation from the scalp is challenging. The prevailing view is that rapid discharges cannot be seen clearly (or at all) in scalp EEG because they have low signal-to-noise ratio. To date, however, no studies have investigated the 'observability' of rapid discharges, i.e. under what conditions and to what extent they can be visible in recorded EEG signals. Here, we used a model-based approach to examine the impact of several factors (distance to sources, skull conductivity, source area, source synchrony, and background activity) on the observability of rapid discharges in simultaneously simulated depth EEG and scalp EEG signals. In our simulations, the rapid discharge was clearly present in depth EEG signals but mostly almost not visible in scalp EEG signals. We identified some of the factors that may limit the observability of the rapid discharge on the scalp. Notably, surrounding background activity was found to be the most critical factor. The findings are discussed in relation to the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: We applied a multiple band frequency analysis to video electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of the infant's scalp. We also performed computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) of the brain in order to ascertain the epileptic focus. Results: During the periodic spasms, we identified fast ictal activity with frequencies of 60-70 Hz in the right centroparietal region. This region was part of the area surrounding the largest cortical tuber that was identified on CT and MRI and was located in the right frontal lobe. An area of increased blood perfusion that was observed with SPECT and dipole sources that were determined with interictal MEG were also located in this area. In addition, ictal frequency oscillations (FOs) with high gamma activity were identified over the cortex surrounding the largest tuber. After a lesionectomy of this tuber, the periodic spasms disappeared, and no FOs were detected over this area. Conclusions: Scalp EEG, which identified the ictal onset zone by detecting fast activity that was suggestive of FOs, was useful for detecting the epileptogenic region in an infant with TS.

Recent findings from studies utilising electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have identified abnormal activation and irregular maintenance of gamma (>30 Hz) range oscillations when ASD individuals attempt basic visual and auditory tasks. Methodology/Principal Fndings: The pilot study reported here is the first study to use spatial filtering techniques in MEG to explore face processing in children with ASD. We set out to examine theoretical suggestions that gamma activation underlying face processing may be different in a group of children and young people with ASD (n = 13) compared to typically developing (TD) age, gender and IQ matched controls. Beamforming and virtual electrode techniques were used to assess spatially localised induced and evoked activity. While lower-band (3-30 Hz) responses to faces were similar between groups, the ASD gamma response in occipital areas was observed to be largely absent when viewing emotions on faces. Virtual electrode analysis indicated the presence of intact evoked responses but abnormal induced activity in ASD participants. Conclusions/Significance: These findings lend weight to previous suggestions that specific components of the early visual response to emotional faces is abnormal in ASD.

J	Jalili, M				Jalili, Mahdi			Collective behavior of interacting locally synchronized oscillations in neuronal networks	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Neuronal networks; Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model; Collective behavior; Spike synchronization	NEURAL SYNCHRONY; CORTEX; MODEL; ENHANCEMENT; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	Local circuits in the cortex and hippocampus are endowed with resonant, oscillatory firing properties which underlie oscillations in various frequency ranges (e.g. gamma range) frequently observed in the local field potentials, and in electroencephalography. Synchronized oscillations are thought to play important roles in information binding in the brain. This paper addresses the collective behavior of interacting locally synchronized oscillations in realistic neural networks. A network of five neurons is proposed in order to produce locally synchronized oscillations. The neuron models are Hindmarsh-Rose type with electrical and/or chemical couplings. We construct large-scale models using networks of such units which capture the essential features of the dynamics of cells and their connectivity patterns. The profile of the spike synchronization is then investigated considering different model parameters such as strength and ratio of excitatory/inhibitory connections. We also show that transmission time-delay might enhance the spike synchrony. The influence of spike-timing-dependence-plasticity is also studies on the spike synchronization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Frequency Coding in the Developing Somatosensory Cortex	UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI			Russian	Article						sensory cortex; development; electroencephalography; neonate; rat; somatosensory system; neuronal networks; oscillations		The development of the central nervous system is characterized by expression of the unique patterns of oscillatory electrical activity that are hypothesized to participate in the formation of specific synaptic connections between neurons during development. Two sensory-driven patterns have been studied in the somatosensory cortex of neonatal rats with characteristic oscillatory frequencies: early gamma oscillations (40-50 Hz) and alpha/beta, or spindle-burst, oscillations (7-30 Hz). Here, we address the question of how these two patterns are activated in relation to the stimulation of the topographic and non-topographic sensory inputs in the neonatal rat barrel cortex. We have found that the stimulation of the topographic sensory input by a deflection of the principal whisker specifically triggers early gamma oscillations in the corresponding cortical barrel in somatosensory cortex, whereas the stimulation of multiple adjacent whiskers (all but principle mode of stimulation) evokes alpha/beta oscillations. Since gamma and alpha/beta oscillations induce long-term potentiation and depression at thalamocortical synapses, respectively, we hypothesize that these two sensory-driven patterns are instrumental in the activity-dependent formation of the topographic maps in sensory cortex during the critical period of thalamocortical development.				mitrukhina@inmed.univ-mrs.fr; suchkov@inmed.univ-mrs.fr; guzel.sitdikova@ksu.ru; roustem.khazipov@inserm.fr; maratminlebaev@inserm.fr	Sitdikova, Guzel/N-7198-2013; MINLEBAEV, Marat/R-4794-2019; Khazipov, Roustem/M-1834-2016; MINLEBAEV, Marat/B-4927-2015	Sitdikova, Guzel/0000-0001-5412-2204; MINLEBAEV, Marat/0000-0002-0722-7027; Khazipov, Roustem/0000-0002-6763-2841; MINLEBAEV, Marat/0000-0002-0722-7027					12	0	0	0	0	KAZAN FEDERAL UNIV	KAZAN	UL KREMLYOVSKAYA, 18, KAZAN, 420008, RUSSIA	2542-064X	2500-218X		UCHENYE ZAP KAZAN UN	Uchenye Zap.

Traveling waves in the alpha and theta ranges are found to be common in both prestimulus and poststimulus EEG activity. The dynamical properties of these waves, including their speeds, directions, and durations, are systematically characterized for the first time, and the results show that there are significant changes of prestimulus spontaneous waves in the presence of an external stimulus. Furthermore, the functional relevance of these waves is examined by studying how they are correlated with reaction times on a single trial basis; prestimulus alpha waves traveling in the frontal-to-occipital direction are found to be most correlated to reaction speeds. These findings suggest that propagating waves of brain oscillations might be involved in mediating long-range interactions between widely distributed parts of human cortex.

The diverse semiologies may not produce lateralizing or localizing signs and can appear bizarre and suggest psychogenic events. Unfortunately, scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often unsatisfactory. It is not uncommon that these traditional diagnostic studies are either unhelpful or even misleading. In some cases, SPECT and positron emission tomography imaging can be an effective tool to identify the origin of seizures. However, these techniques and other emerging techniques all have limitations, and new approaches are needed to improve source localization.

The method used was video-EEG monitoring that was conducted for 24 h in children with seizure disorders. The results were as follows: There were fewer children with temporal EEG onset seizure (TOS) than with frontal EEG onset seizure (FOS) (p = 0.132). Within the TOS category, PTOS was most frequent, and ATOS was rare (p = 0.001). The mean duration of ATOS was longer than that of TOS and PTOS (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in seizure frequency and nocturnal attacks between children with TOS and children with FOS. Furthermore, we observed the interictal EEG from three aspects: the background, the location of discharges, and the time of discharges. The frequency of the multi-focal and bilateral discharges of FOS was higher than that of TOS (p < 0.01). The FOS discharged easily and quickly spread to the bilateral hemisphere and formed secondary bilateral synchrony. Focal discharges predominated in TOS, and rarely showed the paroxysm of bilateral synchronous rhythm. Bursts of fast rhythms predominated in the onset of TOS. In contrast, there were a variety of ictal EEG in FOS. Finally, it was concluded that in the group of children studied, the clinical and EEG characteristics of TOS were different from those of FOS.

Towards a Unified Understanding of Event-Related Changes in the EEG: The Firefly Model of Synchronization through Cross-Frequency Phase Modulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-RESPONSES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; WAVES; GAMMA; DECOMPOSITION; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISM	Although event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used to study sensory, perceptual and cognitive processes, it remains unknown whether they are phase-locked signals superimposed upon the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) or result from phase-alignment of the EEG. Previous attempts to discriminate between these hypotheses have been unsuccessful but here a new test is presented based on the prediction that ERPs generated by phase-alignment will be associated with event-related changes in frequency whereas evoked-ERPs will not. Using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which allows measurement of narrow-band changes in the EEG without predefining frequency bands, evidence was found for transient frequency slowing in recognition memory ERPs but not in simulated data derived from the evoked model. Furthermore, the timing of phase-alignment was frequency dependent with the earliest alignment occurring at high frequencies. Based on these findings, the Firefly model was developed, which proposes that both evoked and induced power changes derive from frequency-dependent phase-alignment of the ongoing EEG. Simulated data derived from the Firefly model provided a close match with empirical data and the model was able to account for i) the shape and timing of ERPs at different scalp sites, ii) the event-related desynchronization in alpha and synchronization in theta, and iii) changes in the power density spectrum from the pre-stimulus baseline to the post-stimulus period. The Firefly Model, therefore, provides not only a unifying account of event-related changes in the EEG but also a possible mechanism for cross-frequency information processing.

J	Lucchiari, C; Pravettoni, G				Lucchiari, Claudio; Pravettoni, Gabriella			The Effect of Brand on EEG Modulation A Study on Mineral Water	SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; spectral analysis; neuromarketing; cortical correlates of brand attachment	MARKETING ACTIONS; GAMMA; EXPECTATION; ACTIVATION; ALPHA; THETA; TASK	Consumers often develop close relationships with their preferred brands and goods. To achieve marketing goals, companies need to develop in customers a positive brand attachment. When they succeed, the brand is immediately recognized, it elicits specific responses, and it becomes more difficult to be replaced by competitors. Previous studies have suggested the existence of a relationship between brand evaluation and a reward-related functional circuit. The present study measured brain responses to different brands of mineral water. In particular, we were interested in analyzing the impact of brand attachment on brain modulation. We hypothesized that brand evaluation would be associated with reward processing, and that brain oscillatory activity would be modulated by different expectations based on previous experience. Time-frequency analyses of EEG oscillatory activity were performed on 26 healthy subjects (13 males and 13 females) during water intake of differently labeled glasses of mineral water. Our results confirmed that brand processing is related to activity of the frontocentral reward-related network. Beta activity seems to be modulated by the experience of pleasure associated with a favorite brand, while theta modulation seems to reflect the lack of this experience. In conclusion, our study showed how exposure to a brand can affect EEG modulation. Additionally, we confirmed a possible relationship between brand evaluation and reward processing.

Spatial attention boosts short-latency neural responses in human visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERPs; EEG synchrony; Spatial attention; Theta; Alpha	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG; DYNAMICS; INHIBITION	In a previous study of visual-spatial attention, Martinez et al. (2007) replicated the well-known finding that stimuli at attended locations elicit enlarged early components in the averaged event-related potential (ERP), which were localized to extrastriate visual cortex. The mechanisms that underlie these attention-related ERP modulations in the latency range of 80-200 ms, however, remain unclear. The main question is whether attention produces increased ERP amplitudes in time-domain averages by augmenting stimulus-triggered neural activity, or alternatively, by increasing the phase-locking of ongoing EEG oscillations to the attended stimuli. We compared these alternative mechanisms using Morlet wavelet decompositions of event-related EEG changes. By analyzing single-trial spectral amplitudes in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands, which were the dominant frequencies of the early ERP components, it was found that stimuli at attended locations elicited enhanced neural responses in the theta band in the P1 (88-120 ms) and N1 (148-184 ms) latency ranges that were additive with the ongoing EEG. In the alpha band there was evidence for both increased additive neural activity and increased phase-synchronization of the EEG following attended stimuli, but systematic correlations between pre- and post-stimulus alpha activity were more consistent with an additive mechanism. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date in humans that short-latency neural activity elicited by stimuli within the spotlight of spatial attention is boosted or amplified at early stages of processing in extrastriate visual cortex.

However, the blur caused by volume conduction makes it difficult to identify the exact origin of the EEG rhythm in the brain using only the human scalp EEG. In this study, simultaneous fMRI and EEG measurements were performed during a visually guided motor execution task in order to investigate whether the mu rhythm in the scalp EEG is an indication of the activity in the sensorimotor cortex. In addition, a new method was proposed for reconstruction of the cortical EEG activity through the fusion of fMRI and EEG data. A suppression of mu rhythm appeared around the lateral central electrode sites, just above the sensorimotor cortex, in association with the activity in that region. During a visually guided motor execution task, the alpha rhythms at the occipital electrode sites and the alpha rhythm at the central electrode sites also showed a correlation with the fMRI signal in the occipital and the supplementary motor cortices, respectively. This method allows the investigation of the scalp EEG origin with the spatial precision of fMRI, while retaining dynamic properties of the cortex with the temporal precision of EEG.

A shared low-frequency oscillatory rhythm abnormality in resting and sensory gating in schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Neural oscillation; Evoked potential; Theta; Gamma; Schizophrenia; Heritability	WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FIRST-EPISODE; SYNCHRONY; EEG; HERITABILITY; DYSFUNCTION	Objectives: We hypothesized that an oscillatory abnormality that is consistently observed across various testing paradigms may index an elementary neuronal abnormality marking schizophrenia risk. Methods: Compared neural oscillations in resting EEG and sensory gating conditions in schizophrenia patients (n = 128), their first-degree relatives (n = 80), and controls (n = 110) and calculated phenotypic and/or genetic correlation of the abnormal measure across these conditions. Results: Using a uniform, single trial analytical approach, we identified two prominent oscillatory characteristics in schizophrenia: (1) augmented neural oscillatory power was pervasive in medicated schizophrenia patients in most frequencies, most prominent in the theta-alpha range (4-11 Hz) across the two paradigms (all p < 0.007); and (2) their first-degree relatives shared significantly augmented oscillatory energy in theta-alpha frequency in resting (p = 0.002) and insufficient suppression of theta-alpha in sensory gating (p = 0.01) compared with normal controls. Heritability estimates for theta-alpha related measures for resting and gating conditions ranged from 0.44 to 0.49 (p < 0.03). The theta-alpha measures were correlated genetically with each other (RhoG = 0.82 +/- 0.43; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Augmented theta-alpha rhythm may be an elementary neurophysiological problem associated with genetic liability of schizophrenia. Significance: This finding helps to refine key electrophysiologic biomarkers for genetic and clinical studies of schizophrenia. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Recent studies suggest that GBA is associated with behavioral performance in memory tasks, but it is not clear whether gamma oscillations are related to individual differences in memory ability. To examine this issue, we recruited participants with low memory ability (mild cognitive impairment, or MCI; n=16) as well as age-, education-, and sex-matched controls (n=19) for a study involving a spatial delayed match to sample (DMTS) task. We recorded EEG during task performance and analyzed gamma oscillation changes during the memory maintenance phase of the task Gamma event-related desynchronization was stronger in the control group than in the MCI group in the mid-frontal area, and mean GBA in this area correlated with clinical memory measures as well as behavioral performance on the DMTS task. These findings suggest that gamma oscillations not only reflect brain activity related to memory processes, but also vary with the memory ability of individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Integrated central-autonomic multifractal complexity in the heart rate variability of healthy humans	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						multifractal HRV; central nervous system; autonomic nervous system; fractal correlation	RATE DYNAMICS; TERM; OSCILLATIONS; EXERCISE; SLEEP; RESPONSES; AROUSAL; ALPHA	Purpose of Study: The aim of this study was to characterize the central-autonomic interaction underlying the multifractality in heart rate variability (HRV) of healthy humans. Materials and Methods: Eleven young healthy subjects participated in two separate similar to 40 min experimental sessions, one in supine (SUP) and one in, head-up-tilt (HUT), upright (UPR) body positions. Surface scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were collected and fractal correlation of brain and heart rate data was analyzed based on the idea of relative multifractality. The fractal correlation was further examined with the EEG, HRV spectral measures using linear regression of two variables and principal component analysis (PCA) to find clues for the physiological processing underlying the central influence in fractal HRV. Results: We report evidence of a central-autonomic fractal correlation (CAFC) where the HRV multifractal complexity varies significantly with the fractal correlation between the heart rate and brain data (P = 0.003). The linear regression shows significant correlation between CAFC measure and EEG Beta band spectral component (P = 0.01 for SUP and P = 0.002 for UPR positions). There is significant correlation between CAFC measure and HRV LF component in the SUP position (P = 0.04), whereas the correlation with the HRV HF component approaches significance (P = 0.07). The correlation between CAFC measure and HRV spectral measures in the UPR position is weak. The PCA results confirm these findings and further imply multiple physiological processes underlying CAFC, highlighting the importance of the EEG Alpha, Beta band, and the HRV LF, HF spectral measures in the supine position. Discussion and Conclusion:The findings of this work can be summarized into three points: (i) Similar fractal characteristics exist in the brain and heart rate fluctuation and the change toward stronger fractal correlation implies the change toward more complex HRV multifractality. (ii) CAFC is likely contributed by multiple physiological mechanisms, with its central elements mainly derived from the EEG Alpha, Beta band dynamics. (iii) The CAFC in SUP and UPR positions is qualitatively different, with a more predominant central influence in the fractal HRV of the UPR position.	[Lin, D.

This calls for the utilization of complex-valued spectrum, instead of the commonly used power spectral density, in designing the brain computer interfaces. This paper studies the complex-valued spectrum of the EEG signal recorded during mental imagery tasks, and provides a statistical model for the EEG spectral components. Motivated by the results of a recent work by the authors, this paper proposes a time-varying noncircularly-symmetric Gaussian model for complex-valued EEG spectrum during a mental imagery trial. It will be shown that the mean of this Gaussian model is constant over time, whereas its variance and pseudo-variance follow an autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model. The validity of this model is then verified using statistical tests.

The information-rich techniques of electro-and magnetoencephalography, as well as structural and functional MRI, are increasingly being examined through the lenses of network theory and oscillations to capture complex brain dynamics. Although still in the early stages of clinical application, these "network" approaches have the potential to shed new light on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neurological diseases. We review the basic principles of network theory and oscillation dynamics, including the recently discovered "small-world network" concept, and provide and introduction to how these techniques are being applied to routinely available clinical data (such as MRI, EEG, and MEG). Specific clinical applications span normal brain functions (cognition and sleep) and disorders of the brain such as epilepsy, dementia, movement disorders, pain, autism, and schizophrenia. These interrelated approaches respect the fundamentals of anatomically-driven diagnosis while providing a theoretical and practical armamentarium to investigate aspects of neurological disease that may challenge the scope of traditional clinical tools.

This EEG power attenuation parallels reductions of structural and metabolic markers of neuronal maturation (i.e., gray matter loss and decrease of absolute cerebral glucose utilization). However, it is largely unknown what causes these electrophysiological changes, and how this functional reorganization relates to other functional measures such as the fMRI BOLD signal. In this study, we used simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI to localize hemodynamic correlates of fluctuating EEG oscillations and to study the development of this EEG-BOLD coupling. Furthermore, the maturational EEG power attenuation was directly compared to BOLD signal power maturation. Both analyses were novel in their developmental perspective and aimed at providing a functional lead to EEG maturation. Data from 19 children, 18 adolescents and 18 young adults were acquired in 10 min eyes-open/eyes-closed resting states. Our results revealed that both EEG and BOLD amplitudes strongly decrease between childhood and adulthood, but their functional coupling remains largely unchanged. The global reduction of absolute amplitude of spontaneous slow BOLD signal fluctuation is a novel marker for brain maturation, and parallels the globally decreasing trajectories of EEG amplitudes, gray matter and glucose metabolism during adolescence. Further, the absence of thalamocortical EEG-BOLD coupling in children together with age-related normalized thalamic BOLD power increase indicated maturational changes in brain state regulation.

Studies of polysomnographic and quantitative sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have provided contradictory results, with few consistent findings in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). For the most part, it appears that delta EEG activity may provide the best discrimination between patients and healthy controls. A closer examination of delta activity in the very slow end of the frequency band is still to be considered in assessing sleep in CFS. The present preliminary study compared absolute and relative spectral power in conventional EEG bands and ultra-slow delta (0.5-0.8 Hz) between 10 young female patients with the CFS and healthy controls without psychopathology. In absolute measures, the ultra-slow delta power was lower in CFS, about one-fifth that of the control group. Other frequency bands did not differ between groups. Relative ultra-slow delta power was lower in patients than in controls. CFS is associated with lower ultra-slow (0.5-0.8 Hz) delta power, underscoring the importance of looking beyond conventional EEG frequency bands. From a neurophysiological standpoint, lower ultra-slow wave power may indicate abnormalities in the oscillations in membrane potential or a failure in neural recruitment in those with CFS.

Experiments were divided in two groups: early (from the first to the third fourth experiments) and late (fifth tenth experiments). During the early experimental series, unilateral persistent EEG changes consisting in an increase in the delta- and beta-band power with a simultaneous depression of the gamma-band activity were observed in the ipsilateral to SD hemisphere. In addition, interhemispheric coherence between symmetrical cortical points decreased. During the late experimental series, a generalized bilateral increase in the power of the delta and beta activity was demonstrated with a rise in coherence in the beta band. This generalized activity occurred cyclically and was distinct during a long period of time (2-3 hours) after propagation of a single SD wave. Such kind of cyclical activity blocked the propagation of subsequent SD waves in the neocortex of a waking rabbit and decreased the probability of recurrent wave origin up to a complete cessation of wave generation. Thus, a cortical SD wave provoked the appearance of synchronized beta oscillations in the EEG, which in turn actively influenced the properties of recurrent waves.	[Roshchina, G. Ya.; Koroleva, V.

This major EEG pattern has been extensively studied, from physiological to anatomical levels, for more than half a century. Nevertheless the cellular and network mechanisms accountable for the theta generation are still not fully understood. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the circuitry involved in the generation of theta oscillations, from the hippocampus to extra hippocampal structures such as septal complex, entorhinal cortex and pedunculopontine tegmentum, a main trigger of theta state through direct and indirect projections to the septal complex. We conclude with a short overview of the perspectives offered by technical advances for deciphering more precisely the different neural components underlying the emergence of theta oscillations.

However its neurobiological bases have yet to be fully disclosed. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to fully monitor neuronal activation throughout EMDR sessions including the autobiographical script. Ten patients with major psychological trauma were investigated during their first EMDR session (T0) and during the last one performed after processing the index trauma (T1). Neuropsychological tests were administered at the same time. Comparisons were performed between EEGs of patients at T0 and T1 and between EEGs of patients and 10 controls who underwent the same EMDR procedure at T0. Connectivity analyses were carried out by lagged phase synchronization. Results: During bilateral ocular stimulation (BS) of EMDR sessions EEG showed a significantly higher activity on the orbitofrontal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in patients at T0 shifting towards left temporo-occipital regions at T1. A similar trend was found for autobiographical script with a higher firing in fronto-temporal limbic regions at T0 moving to right temporo-occipital cortex at T1. The comparisons between patients and controls confirmed the maximal activation in the limbic cortex of patients occurring before trauma processing. Connectivity analysis showed decreased pair-wise interactions between prefrontal and cingulate cortex during BS in patients as compared to controls and between fusiform gyrus and visual cortex during script listening in patients at T1 as compared to T0. These changes correlated significantly with those occurring in neuropsychological tests. Conclusions: The ground-breaking methodology enabled our study to image for the first time the specific activations associated with the therapeutic actions typical of EMDR protocol. The findings suggest that traumatic events are processed at cognitive level following successful EMDR therapy, thus supporting the evidence of distinct neurobiological patterns of brain activations during BS associated with a significant relief from negative emotional experiences.

Assessing the effects of caffeine and theanine on the maintenance of vigilance during a sustained attention task	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Vigilance; Alpha-band; Oscillations; EEG; Human; Tea; Theanine; Caffeine	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; EEG ACTIVITY; TEA; SUPPRESSION; INCREASES; POWER; COMBINATION; MECHANISMS; ALERTNESS	Caffeine and L-theanine, both naturally occurring in tea, affect the ability to make rapid phasic deployments of attention to locations in space as reflected in behavioural performance and alpha-band oscillatory brain activity (8-14 Hz). However, surprisingly little is known about how these compounds affect an aspect of attention that has been more popularly associated with tea, namely vigilant attention: the ability to maintain focus on monotonous tasks over protracted time-periods. Twenty-seven participants performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) over a two-hour session on each of four days, on which they were administered caffeine (50 mg), theanine (100 mg), the combination, or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion. Concurrently, we recorded oscillatory brain activity through high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We asked whether either compound alone, or both in combination, would affect performance of the task in terms of reduced error rates overtime, and whether changes in alpha-band activity would show a relationship to such changes in performance. When treated with placebo, participants showed a rise in error rates, a pattern that is commonly observed with increasing time-on-task, whereas after caffeine and theanine ingestion, error rates were significantly reduced. The combined treatment did not confer any additional benefits over either compound alone, suggesting that the individual compounds may confer maximal benefits at the dosages employed. Alpha-band oscillatory activity was significantly reduced on ingestion of caffeine, particularly in the first hour. This effect was not changed by addition of theanine in the combined treatment. Theanine alone did not affect alpha-band activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rhythmic bursting in the reticular thalamic nucleus (nRt), arising from interplay between Ca(v)3.3-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-dependent small-conductance-type 2 (SK2) K+ channels, underlies spindle generation. Correlative evidence indicates that spindles contribute to memory consolidation and protection against environmental noise in human NREMS. Here, we describe a molecular mechanism through which spindle power is selectively extended and we probed the actions of intensified spindling in the naturally sleeping mouse. Using electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices from SK2 channel-overexpressing (SK2-OE) mice, we found that nRt bursting was potentiated and thalamic circuit oscillations were prolonged. Moreover, nRt cells showed greater resilience to transit from burst to tonic discharge in response to gradual depolarization, mimicking transitions out of NREMS. Compared with wild-type littermates, chronic EEG recordings of SK2-OE mice contained less fragmented NREMS, while the NREMS EEG power spectrum was conserved. Furthermore, EEG spindle activity was prolonged at NREMS exit. Finally, when exposed to white noise, SK2-OE mice needed stronger stimuli to arouse. Increased nRt bursting thus strengthens spindles and improves sleep quality through mechanisms independent of EEG slow waves (<4 Hz), suggesting SK2 signaling as a new potential therapeutic target for sleep disorders and for neuropsychiatric diseases accompanied by weakened sleep spindles.

However, synchronization also plays a fundamental role in cognitive processing, and the level of theta and higher frequency band synchronization is modulated during WM. Yet, little is known about the link between BOLD, EEG power, and EEG synchronization during WM, and how these measures develop with human brain maturation or relate to behavioral changes. We examined EEG-BOLD signal correlations from 18 young adults and 15 school-aged children for age-dependent effects during a load-modulated Sternberg WM task. Frontal load (in-)dependent EEG theta power was significantly enhanced in children compared to adults, while adults showed stronger fMRI load effects. Children demonstrated a stronger negative correlation between global theta power and the BOLD signal in the default mode network relative to adults. Therefore, we conclude that theta power mediates the suppression of a task-irrelevant network. We further conclude that children suppress this network even more than adults, probably from an increased level of task-preparedness to compensate for not fully mature cognitive functions, reflected in lower response accuracy and increased reaction time. In contrast to power, correlations between instantaneous theta global field synchronization and the BOLD signal were exclusively positive in both age groups but only significant in adults in the frontal-parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. Furthermore, theta synchronization was weaker in children and was -in contrast to EEG power- positively correlated with response accuracy in both age groups. In summary we conclude that theta EEG-BOLD signal correlations differ between spectral power and synchronization and that these opposite correlations with different distributions undergo similar and significant neuronal developments with brain maturation.

J	Lega, BC; Jacobs, J; Kahana, M				Lega, Bradley C.; Jacobs, Joshua; Kahana, Michael			Human hippocampal theta oscillations and the formation of episodic memories	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						episodic memory; free recall; hippocampus; oscillation; subsequent memory effect; theta rhythm	HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL NAVIGATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX	The importance of the hippocampal theta oscillation (48 Hz) to memory formation has been well-established through studies in animals, prompting researchers to propose comprehensive theories of memory and learning that rely on theta oscillations for integrating information in the hippocampus and neocortex. Yet, empirical evidence for the importance of 48 Hz hippocampal theta oscillations to memory formation in humans is equivocal at best. To clarify this apparent interspecies discrepancy, we recorded intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from 237 hippocampal electrodes in 33 neurosurgical patients as they performed an episodic memory task. We identified two distinct patterns of hippocampal oscillations, at similar to 3 and similar to 8 Hz, which are at the edges of the traditional 48 Hz human theta band. The 3 Hz slow-theta oscillation exhibited higher power during successful memory encoding and was functionally linked to gamma oscillations, but similar patterns were not present for the 8 Hz fast-theta oscillation. For episodic memory, slow-theta oscillations in the human hippocampus appear to be analogous to the memory-related theta oscillations observed in animals. Both fast-theta and slow-theta oscillations exhibit evidence of phase synchrony with oscillations in the temporal cortex. We discuss our findings in the context of recent research on the electrophysiology of human memory and spatial navigation, and explore the implications of this result for theories of corticohippocampal communication.

Audio-visual facilitation of the mu rhythm	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mu rhythm; Mirror neuron system; Multimodal facilitation; Independent components analysis	GRASP REPRESENTATIONS; MOTOR FACILITATION; EEG; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; HUMANS; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; PREMOTOR	Previous studies demonstrate that perception of action presented audio-visually facilitates greater mirror neuron system (MNS) activity in humans (Kaplan and Iacoboni in Cogn Process 8(2):103-113, 2007) and non-human primates (Keysers et al. in Exp Brain Res 153(4):628-636, 2003) than perception of action presented unimodally. In the current study, we examined whether audio-visual facilitation of the MNS can be indexed using electroencephalography (EEG) measurement of the mu rhythm. The mu rhythm is an EEG oscillation with peaks at 10 and 20 Hz that is suppressed during the execution and perception of action and is speculated to reflect activity in the premotor and inferior parietal cortices as a result of MNS activation (Pineda in Behav Brain Funct 4(1):47, 2008). Participants observed experimental stimuli unimodally (visual-alone or audio-alone) or bimodally during randomized presentations of two hands ripping a sheet of paper, and a control video depicting a box moving up and down. Audio-visual perception of action stimuli led to greater event-related desynchrony (ERD) of the 8-13 Hz mu rhythm compared to unimodal perception of the same stimuli over the C3 electrode, as well as in a left central cluster when data were examined in source space. These results are consistent with Kaplan and Iacoboni's (in Cogn Process 8(2):103-113, 2007), findings that indicate audio-visual facilitation of the MNS; our left central cluster was localized approximately 13.89 mm away from the ventral premotor cluster identified in their fMRI study, suggesting that these clusters originate from similar sources. Consistency of results in electrode space and component space support the use of ICA as a valid source localization tool.

The primary focus of this study is to identify the correlation between fluctuating level of attention and its implications on the cardiac rhythm recorded in the ECG. Furthermore, Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are also analyzed and classified for use as a benchmark for comparison with ECG analysis. Several advanced signal processing techniques have been implemented and investigated to derive multiple clandestine and informative features from both these physiological signals. Decomposition and feature extraction are done using Stockwell-transform for the ECG signal, while Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for EEG. These features are then applied to various machine-learning algorithms to produce classification models that are capable of differentiating between the cases of a person being attentive and a person not being attentive. The presented results show that detection and classification of cognitive attention using ECG are fairly comparable to EEG.

We showed that this new approach of pharmaco-electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis can shed light on subtle changes, which cannot be foreseen from conventional analysis (amplitude/latency/topography). Methods: In this placebo-controlled crossover study, the effects of orally administered morphine (30 mg) on esophageal pain elicited by electrical stimulation were investigated in 9 healthy volunteers. Using new methods (decomposition of the EPs with MMP and clustering) in combination with inverse modeling, we investigated brain sources of the EPs and their time-frequency properties. Results: Morphine treatment resulted in a shift of the brain sources in the low-frequency range (2-4 Hz) toward the frontal cortex during the first 300 milliseconds after stimulus, whereas active brain sources after placebo treatment remained stable. Conclusions: Decomposing the EPs into the original brain generators showed that morphine mainly changes the low frequency electrical activity in the frontal brain area. This method can be used to increase the basic understanding of the opioid effect on the brain's processing of pain and eventually identify biomarkers of analgesia in experimental pain models.

Simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation and theta burst stimulation prolongs continuous theta burst stimulation-induced suppression of corticomotor excitability in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical oscillations; electroencephalography; motor plasticity; transcranial magnetic stimulation	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; WAVE ACTIVITY; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; CHRONIC STROKE; PLASTICITY	The objective of this study was to assess whether the simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the neuroplastic response to transcranial magnetic theta burst stimulation. Motor evoked potential amplitude was assessed at baseline and at regular intervals up to 60 min following continuous theta burst stimulation, slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation, and the simultaneous application of these paradigms. In addition, the electroencephalographic power spectra of slow and fast delta, and theta frequency bands recorded over the motor cortex were analyzed prior to and up to 5 min following each intervention. There was longer-lasting motor evoked potential suppression following the simultaneous application of continuous theta burst stimulation and slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation compared with when continuous theta burst stimulation was applied alone. Slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation applied alone did not modulate the motor evoked potential amplitude. No significant changes in spectral power were observed following slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation. Simultaneous application of continuous theta burst stimulation and slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation may provide an approach to prolong the induction of neuroplastic changes in motor cortical circuits by repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation.

In our study hippocampal network oscillations, population spikes, and long-term potentiation (LTP) were recorded in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) and presenilin1 (PS1) transgenic and wild type mice at 2, 4, and 8 months of age under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta oscillations elicited by brainstem stimulation were similar in wild type and PS1 mice at all age groups. In contrast, APP/PS1 mice showed an age-dependent decrease in hippocampal activity, characterized by a significant decline in elicited theta power and frequency at 4 and 8 months. Magnitudes of population spikes and long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus were similar across groups at both 4 and 8 months. In APP/PS1 mice, soluble and insoluble A beta, and hippocampal and cortical plaque load increased with age, and the disruption in hippocampal theta oscillation showed a significant correlation with plaque load. Our study shows that, using in vivo electrophysiological methods, early A beta-related functional deficits can be robustly detected in the brainstem-hippocampus multisynaptic network.

Noninvasive Epileptic Seizure Localization from Stochastic Behavior of Short Duration Interictal High Density Scalp EEG Data	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Epilepsy localization; Noninvasive epilepsy localization; High density scalp EEG; Seizure free-epilepsy localization; EEG phase synchronization	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; POWER; SYNCHRONIZATION	The stochastic behavior of the phase synchronization index (SI) in different EEG bands was examined for noninvasive localization of the epileptogenic areas from the short duration (30-60 s), seizure-free and spike-free high density (256 channel) scalp EEG data. We also examined the cross-frequency and cross-electrode coupling in different EEG bands. EEG data of four subjects was used. The seizure areas were localized with subdural recordings with an 8x8 grid electrode array. It was found that the stochastic behavior of the SI in low gamma band (30-50 Hz) was higher in epileptogenic areas. The beta (12-30 Hz) band also showed similar tendencies. The stochastic behavior in theta (3-7 Hz) band was depressed in the seizure area while it was widespread in large areas over the scalp in the alpha (7-12 Hz) band. The stochastic behavior of the cross-frequency and cross-electrode couplings in theta-gamma, alpha-gamma and beta-gamma bands were decreased in the seizure areas for all four subjects. These findings suggest that it is possible to localize the epileptogenic areas from the short duration seizure-free and spike-free high density scalp EEG data.

A separation of the overlapping patterns in the EEG signals is often performed first. These separated patterns are then analysed by some artificial intelligence methods in order to identify the activity. As pattern separation and activity identification are often linked, the two processes must be tuned to a specific problem, thus losing some generality of the procedure. The complexity of the patterns in EEG signals is often too great for completely automated pattern recognition. In this case, phase demodulation was introduced as a procedure for the extraction of the phase properties of the EEG signals. These phase shifts are known to correlate with the brain activity; therefore, phase-demodulated EEG signals were used to predict the motor activity. Three studies with off-line identification of the motor activities have been performed so far. In the first study, a continuous gripping force was predicted. In the second study, index-and middle-finger activation was predicted, and in the final study, wrist movements were analysed. The presented procedure can be used for designing a continuous brain-computer interface.

Brain State Evolution During Seizure and Under Anesthesia: A Network-Based Analysis of Stereotaxic EEG Activity in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy Patients	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS	Epilepsy is a neurological condition with a prevalence of 1%, and 14-34% have medically refractory epilepsy (MRE). Seizures in focal MRE are generated by a single epileptogenic zone (or focus), thus there is potentially a curative procedure - surgical resection. This procedure depends significantly on correct identification of the focus, which is often uncertain in clinical practice. In this study, we analyzed intracranial stereotaxic EEG (sEEG) data recorded in two human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery. We view the sEEG data as samples from the brain network and hypothesize that seizure foci can be identified based on their network connectivity during seizure. Specifically, we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from EEG recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient, connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in a given frequency band. Matrix structure was analyzed using singular value decomposition and the leading singular vector was used to estimate each electrode's time dependent centrality (importance to the network's connectivity). Our preliminary study suggests that seizure foci may be the most weakly connected regions in the brain during the beginning of a seizure and the most strongly connected regions towards the end of a seizure. Additionally, in one of the patients analyzed, the network connectivity under anesthesia highlights seizure foci. Ultimately, network centrality computed from sEEG activity may be used to develop an automated, reliable, and computationally efficient algorithm for identifying seizure foci.

We quantified the dynamic repertoire, duration and oscillatory type of EEG microstates in eyes-closed rest in relation to the degree of expression of clinical self-consciousness. For NCC a model was suggested that contrasted normal, severely disturbed state of consciousness and state without consciousness. Patients with disorders of consciousness were used. Results suggested that the repertoire, duration and oscillatory type of EEG microstates in resting condition quantitatively related to the level of consciousness expression in brain-damaged patients and healthy-conscious subjects. Specifically, results demonstrated that (a) decreased number of EEG microstate types was associated with altered states of consciousness, (b) unawareness was associated with the lack of diversity in EEG alpha-rhythmic microstates, and (c) the probability for the occurrence and duration of delta-, theta- and slow-alpha-rhythmic microstates were associated with unawareness, whereas the probability for the occurrence and duration of fast-alpha-rhythmic microstates were associated with consciousness. In conclusion, resting EEG has a potential value in revealing NCC. This work may have implications for clinical care and medical-legal decisions in patients with disorders of consciousness.

Due to the different nature of these modifications, their onsets show no synchrony and time dynamics is often strongly dissimilar. After acquiring data from a group of 16 subjects, we estimated temporal correlation between task and signals in order to assess possible influences induced by an attentive task on electroencephalographic (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin concentration signals. We also investigated correlations and time delays between couples of different biological signals. This allowed for the isolation of a subgroup of subjects showing similar tracks. Cardiac frequency and deoxy-haemoglobin signals displayed a strong positive correlation with the task design, while EEG alpha rhythm and oxygenation showed a negative correlation. Neural electrical response was nearly instantaneous with respect to the task progression, and autonomic response showed a mean delay of about 15 s and a slower hemodynamic response (mean delay above 20 s) was finally induced. Globally, the task elicited a cascade of responses, in which delays can be quantified.	[Bari, V.; Calcagnile, P.; Molteni, E.; Cerutti, S.; Bianchi, A.

The aim of our study was to use MEG to determine the effect of manual acupuncture on neuronal oscillatory dynamics. A major problem in MEG investigations of manual acupuncture is the absence of on set times for each needle manipulation. Given that beamforming (spatial filtering) analysis is not dependent upon stimulus-driven responses being phase-locked to stimulus onset, we postulated that beamforming could reveal source locations and induced changes in neuronal activity during manual acupuncture. In a beamformer analysis, a two-minute period of manual acupuncture needle manipulation delivered to the ipsilateral right LI-4 (Hegu) acupoint was contrasted with a two-minute baseline period. We considered oscillatory power changes in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (30-100Hz) frequency bands. We found significant decreases in betab and power in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, we found significant power decreases in beta and gamma frequency bands in only the SFG. No significant power modulations were found in theta and alpha bands. Our results indicate that beamforming is a useful analytical tool to reconstruct underlying neuronal activity associated with manual acupuncture. Our main finding was of beta power decreases in primary somatosensory cortex and SFG, which opens up a line of future investigation regarding whether this contributes toward an underlying mechanism of acupuncture.

Alterations in brain functional cortical connectivity in resting-state networks have been detected with functional imaging techniques, but neurophysiologic connectivity measures have not been systematically examined. We used weighted network analysis to examine resting state functional connectivity as measured by quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) coherence in 121 unmedicated subjects with MDD and 37 healthy controls. Subjects with MDD had significantly higher overall coherence as compared to controls in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-20 Hz) frequency bands. The frontopolar region contained the greatest number of "hub nodes" (surface recording locations) with high connectivity. MDD subjects expressed higher theta and alpha coherence primarily in longer distance connections between frontopolar and temporal or parietooccipital regions, and higher beta coherence primarily in connections within and between electrodes overlying the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) or temporal regions. Nearest centroid analysis indicated that MDD subjects were best characterized by six alpha band connections primarily involving the prefrontal region. The present findings indicate a loss of selectivity in resting functional connectivity in MDD. The overall greater coherence observed in depressed subjects establishes a new context for the interpretation of previous studies showing differences in frontal alpha power and synchrony between subjects with MDD and normal controls. These results can inform the development of qEEG state and trait biomarkers for MDD.

Pre-Cue Fronto-Occipital Alpha Phase and Distributed Cortical Oscillations Predict Failures of Cognitive Control	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; ANTISACCADE PERFORMANCE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EXPRESS SACCADES; NEURAL PROCESSES; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN; TASK; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Cognitive control is required for correct performance on antisaccade tasks, including the ability to inhibit an externally driven ocular motor response (a saccade to a peripheral stimulus) in favor of an internally driven ocular motor goal (a saccade directed away from a peripheral stimulus). Healthy humans occasionally produce errors during antisaccade tasks, but the mechanisms associated with such failures of cognitive control are uncertain. Most research on cognitive control failures focuses on poststimulus processing, although a growing body of literature highlights a role of intrinsic brain activity in perceptual and cognitive performance. The current investigation used dense array electroencephalography and distributed source analyses to examine brain oscillations across a wide frequency band-width in the period before antisaccade cue onset. Results highlight four important aspects of ongoing and preparatory brain activations that differentiate error from correct antisaccade trials: (1) ongoing oscillatory beta (20-30 Hz) power in anterior cingulate before trial initiation (lower for error trials); (2) instantaneous phase of ongoing alpha/theta (7 Hz) in frontal and occipital cortices immediately before trial initiation (opposite between trial types); (3) gamma power (35-60 Hz) in posterior parietal cortex 100 ms before cue onset (greater for error trials); and (4) phase locking of alpha (5-12 Hz) in parietal and occipital cortices immediately before cue onset (lower for error trials). These findings extend recently reported effects of pre-trial alpha phase on perception to cognitive control processes and help identify the cortical generators of such phase effects.

Literature provides a wide number of studies dealing either with the kinematics or the cerebral correlates of the impairment. Nevertheless, few studies exist merging both aspects together. The aim of this study is the integrated analyses of time and spatial parameters of both the affected and less-affected sides and of the EEG signal, recorded during the movement execution, for the quantitative description of the pointing gesture in children with CP. The participants (pathological and control subjects) were asked to execute a pointing task simultaneously with the recording by an optoelectronic system and an electroencephalographer. Kinematic data were processed for the extraction of several synthetic indexes, to be correlated with parameters derived from frequency analysis of the electroencephalographic signal. Kinematic results showed statistical differences (1) between the affected and the less-affected arms in patients and (2) between the less-affected arm in patients and the normal arm in controls. Further differences were found in kinematics with respect to bilateral or ipsilateral motor control, extracted from EEG. Given the different behavior evidenced by either ipsilateral or contralateral reorganization, and considering the role of feedback and feed-forward contributions to motor programming, some hypotheses emerged about the motor control during pointing task in CP.

Short latency activation of cortex during clinically effective subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						subthalamic nucleus; deep brain stimulation; event related potential; electroencephalography; Parkinson's disease	ACTION-POTENTIAL UPSTROKE; NUCLEUS STIMULATION; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; NETWORK MODULATION; STN-STIMULATION; MAXIMUM RATE; TIME-COURSE; NEURONS; IMPROVEMENT; CIRCUIT	Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is superior to medical therapy for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and additional evidence suggests that it improves refractory symptoms of essential tremor, primary generalized dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite this, its therapeutic mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that subthalamic stimulation activates the cerebral cortex at short latencies after stimulus onset during clinically effective stimulation for PD. In 5 subjects (six hemispheres), EEG measured the response of cortex to subthalamic stimulation across a range of stimulation voltages and frequencies. Novel analytical techniques reversed the anode and cathode electrode contacts and summed the resulting pair of event-related potentials to suppress the stimulation artifact. We found that subthalamic brain stimulation at 20 Hz activates the somatosensory cortex at discrete latencies (mean latencies: 1.0 +/- 0.4, 5.7 +/- 1.1, and 22.2 +/- 1.8 ms, denoted as R1, R2, and R3, respectively). The amplitude of the short latency peak (R1) during clinically effective high-frequency stimulation is nonlinearly dependent on stimulation voltage (P < 0.001; repeated-measures analysis of variance), and its latency is less variable than that of R3 (1.02 versus 19.46 ms; P < 0.001, Levene's test). We conclude that clinically effective subthalamic brain stimulation in humans with PD activates the cerebral cortex at 1 ms after stimulus onset, most likely by antidromic activation. These findings suggest that alteration of the precise timing of action potentials in cortical neurons with axonal projections to the subthalamic region may be an important component of the therapeutic mechanism of subthalamic brain stimulation.

Peculiarities of the Coherence of Resting-State EEG Activity in Subjects with Different Levels of Aggressiveness	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						coherence; EEG frequency components; aggressiveness; hostility; autoaggressiveness	BRAIN ACTIVITY	By analyzing the coherence of EEG activity, we examined the spatial organization of the latter in 60 adults of both sexes characterized by dissimilar levels of different aspects of aggressiveness and hostility (diagnosed using the Buss-Durkee and Il'yin questionnaires). Recording of EEG (21 leads positioned according to the 10-20 system) was carried out in the resting state. The greatest numbers of aggressiveness level-related differences in the coherence level (values of the coherence coefficient, K-coh) were found for oscillations of the beta and gamma ranges. Despite the high natural interindividual variability, the subgroup of persons with a high level of aggressiveness was characterized, in general, by somewhat smaller values of K-coh for the delta and theta ranges (in particular in the P4-O2 pair) and greater values of K-coh for the beta 1 and beta 2 rhythms (with an accent in the C3-P3 pair) and gamma range (maximum differences in T3-T5). The subgroup of persons with a high level of hostility was distinguished by smaller K-coh of delta, theta, and gamma oscillations and greater K-coh for the beta range in pairs F8-T4 and F7-T3. Aggressive persons demonstrated greater, in general, numbers of low-coherence relations, especially in the delta and theta spectrum segments. The subgroup with domination of autoaggressiveness was characterized by several significantly lower values of K-coh for the delta and theta ranges.

In this overview article, we summarize the process and products of the sixth meeting in this series, which focused on the identification of promising imaging paradigms, based on the measurement of cognitive evoked potentials (event-related potential) of cognition-related time-frequency analyses of the electroencephalography as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 23 well-specified paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that measure cognitive functions previously identified as targets for treatment development were identified at the meeting as being recommended for the further developmental work needed in order to validate and optimize them as biomarker measures. Individual paradigms are discussed in detail in 6 domain-based articles in this volume. Ongoing issues related to the development of these and other measures as valid, sensitive and reliable measurement, and assessment tools, as well as the steps necessary for the development of specific measures for use as biomarkers for treatment development and personalized medicine, are discussed.

Participants performed a semantic blocking task in which objects were named in semantically homogeneous blocks of trials consisting of members of a semantic category (e.g., all objects are tools) or in heterogeneous blocks, consisting of unrelated objects. The classic pattern of slower naming times in the homogeneous relative to heterogeneous blocks is assumed to reflect the duration of lexical selection. For the collected data in the homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions the imaginary part of coherency (ImC) was evaluated at different frequencies. The ImC is a measure for detecting the coupling of different brain sites acting on sensor level. Most importantly, the ImC is robust to the artifact of volume conduction. We analyzed the ImC at all pairs of 56 EEG channels across all frequencies. Contrasting the two experimental conditions we found pronounced differences in the theta band at 7 Hz and estimated the most dominant underlying brain sources via a minimum norm inverse solution based on the ImC. As a result of the source localization, we observed connectivity between occipito-temporal and frontal areas, which are well-known to play a major role in lexical-semantic language processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of investigating interactive brain activity during overt language production.

In recent decades, analysis of this activity has been not only the focus of interest for description of sensory-cognitive processes, but has also led to trials for establishing new hypotheses. The present review and the companion review aim to constitute an ensemble of "reasonings and suggestions" to understand alpha oscillations based on a wide range of accumulated findings rather than a trial to launch a new "alpha theory". Surveyed descriptions related to physiology and brain function: The review starts with descriptions of earlier extracellular recordings, field potentials and also considers earlier alpha hypotheses. Analytical descriptions of evoked and event-related responses, event-related desynchronization, the relationship between spontaneous activity and evoked potentials, aging brain, pathology and alpha response in cognitive impairment are in the content of this review. In essence, the gamut of the survey includes a multiplicity of evidence on functional correlates in sensory processing, cognition, memory and vegetative system, including the spinal cord and heart.

A systematic literature review was conducted to determine those electrical parameters that would deliver an effective stun so that birds would be rendered unconscious and insensible until death. Inspection data from slaughterhouse inspections conducted both in Member States in and non-Member States were included. Many of the published studies did not allow a comprehensive analysis due to different study designs and incomplete data. There are few observational studies in abattoirs to determine the numbers of birds that are effectively stunned, however, the inspection data from the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) did not identify major problems but, for practical reasons, they used non-EEG (electro-encephalogram) methods to ascertain the effectiveness of a stun. At the present time, an EEG is the most reliable indicator of unconsciousness and insensibility. Clinical somatosensory indicators are not as reliable. The aim of a stunning system is to achieve a 100% effective stun, and the most effective electrical parameters in use can achieve an effectiveness of up to 96% as measured using EEG ascertainment methods (100% were reported as unconscious using non-EEG methods). It is recommended that the Regulation should indicate minimum current for each bird, frequency and current type as well as the wave characteristics - duty cycle and waveform. There should be better surveillance and monitoring of the electrical parameters in use at abattoirs and, in addition, methods that allow the accurate measurement of actual electrical current flowing through each bird should be further developed. Research on effective stunning should be validated by the measurement of EEG activity and related to clinical measures that are easier to use in practice.

Formation of the visual set to facial emotion recognition was supplemented with two types of additional task: either visuospatial (to find a target stimulus among others) or verbal (to tell a word from a pseudoword). The results of the experiments were compared to those obtained in similar experiments without the memory load. Changes in the EEG beta rhythm during visual set forming and testing were studied. The EEG was analyzed by wavelet transformation. Changes in the mean level, maximum and latency of the maximum of wavelet coefficient were rated at different stages of the experiment. All these characteristics for the beta rhythm were higher in experiments with both types of additional memory load as compared to those without the memory load.	[Yakovenko, I. A.; Kozlov, M.

CNV and spectral power (4-100 Hz) were calculated from EEG activity in the preparatory interval in 16 healthy adult participants. As previously reported, CNV amplitudes were higher in Go compared to NoGo trials. In addition, event-related spectral power of the Go condition was reduced in the theta to low gamma range compared to the NoGo condition, confirming that preparing to respond is associated with modulation of event-related spectral activity as well as the CNV. Altogether, the impact of the experimental manipulation on both slow event-related potentials and oscillatory EEG activity may reflect coordinated dynamic changes in the excitability of distributed neural networks involved in preparation.

Time-dependent approach for single trial classification of covert visuospatial attention	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; ALPHA-BAND; HUMAN EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; ENHANCEMENT; MODULATIONS; SUPPRESSION	Recently, several studies have started to explore covert visuospatial attention as a control signal for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Covert visuospatial attention represents the ability to change the focus of attention from one point in the space without overt eye movements. Nevertheless, the full potential and possible applications of this paradigm remain relatively unexplored. Voluntary covert visuospatial attention might allow a more natural and intuitive interaction with real environments as neither stimulation nor gazing is required. In order to identify brain correlates of covert visuospatial attention, classical approaches usually rely on the whole alpha-band over long time intervals. In this work, we propose a more detailed analysis in the frequency and time domains to enhance classification performance. In particular, we investigate the contribution of alpha sub-bands and the role of time intervals in carrying information about visual attention. Previous neurophysiological studies have already highlighted the role of temporal dynamics in attention mechanisms. However, these important aspects are not yet exploited in BCI. In this work, we studied different methods that explicitly cope with the natural brain dynamics during visuospatial attention tasks in order to enhance BCI robustness and classification performances. Results with ten healthy subjects demonstrate that our approach identifies spectro-temporal patterns that outperform the state-of-the-art classification method. On average, our time-dependent classification reaches 0.74 +/- 0.03 of the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) value with an increase of 12.3% with respect to standard methods (0.65 +/- 0.4). In addition, the proposed approach allows faster classification (<1 instead of 3 s), without compromising performances. Finally, our analysis highlights the fact that discriminant patterns are not stable for the whole trial period but are changing over short time intervals. These results support the hypothesis that visual attention information is actually indexed by subject-specific alpha sub-bands and is time dependent.

Augmented gamma band auditory steady-state responses: Support for NMDA hypofunction in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory; Electroencephalography; Steady-state; Gamma; Beta; Theta; NMDA	GABA(B) RECEPTORS; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; AMPLITUDE; GLUTAMATE; STIMULUS	Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) have deviations in auditory perception perhaps attributable to altered neural oscillatory response properties in thalamo-cortical and/or local cortico-cortical circuits. Previous EEG studies of auditory steady-state responses (aSSRs; a measure of sustained neuronal entrainment to repetitive stimulation) in SZ have indicated attenuated gamma range (approximate to 40 Hz) neural entrainment. Stimuli in most such studies have been relatively brief (500-1000 ms) trains of 1 ms clicks or amplitude modulated pure tones (1000 Hz) with short, fixed interstimulus intervals (200-1000 ms). The current study used extended (1500 ms), more aurally dense broadband stimuli (500-4000 Hz noise; previously demonstrated to elicit larger aSSRs) with longer, variable interstimulus intervals (2700-3300 ms). Dense array EEG (256 sensor) was collected while 17 SZ and 16 healthy subjects passively listed to stimuli modulated at 15 different frequencies spanning beta and gamma ranges (16-44 Hz in 2 Hz steps). Results indicate that SZ have augmented aSSRs that were most extreme in the gamma range. Results also constructively replicate previous findings of attenuated low frequency auditory evoked responses (2-8 Hz) in SZ. These findings (i) highlight differential characteristics of low versus high frequency and induced versus entrained oscillatory auditory responses in both SZ and healthy stimulus processing, (ii) provide support for an NMDA-receptor hypofunction-based pharmacological model of SZ, and (iii) report a novel pattern of aSSR abnormalities suggesting that gamma band neural entrainment deviations among SZ may be more complex than previously supposed, including possibly being substantially influenced by physical stimulus properties.

College students (N = 37) were instructed to construct three solutions to the optical maze in a Web-based learning environment, which required some knowledge of physics. The subjects put forth their best effort to minimize the number of convexes and mirrors needed to guide the image of an object from the entrance to the exit of the maze. This study examines EEG changes in different frequency bands accompanying varying demands on the cognitive process of providing solutions. Results showed that the mean power of theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta 1 significantly increased as the number of convexes and mirrors used by the students decreased from solution 1 to 3. Moreover, the mean power of theta and alpha 1 significantly increased when the participants constructed their personal optimal solution (the least total number of mirrors and lens used by students) compared to their non-personal optimal solution. In conclusion, the spectral power of frontal, frontal midline and posterior theta, posterior alpha, and temporal beta increased predominantly as the task demands and task performance increased.

By the application of advanced signal processing tools, statistics and machine learning, this BCI system offers: 1) asynchronous mode of operation, 2) automatic selection of user-dependent parameters based on an initial calibration, 3) incremental update of the classifier parameters from feedback data. The signal classification uses spatially filtered signals and is based on spectral power estimation computed in individualized frequency bands, which are automatically identified by a specially tailored AR-based model. Relevant features are chosen by a criterion based on Mutual Information. Final recognition of motor imagery is effectuated by a multinomial logistic regression classifier. This BCI system was evaluated in two studies. In the first study, five participants trained the ability to imagine movements of the right hand, left hand and feet in response to visual cues. The accuracy of the classifier was evaluated across four training sessions with feedback. The second study assessed the information transfer rate (ITR) of the BCI in an asynchronous application. The subjects' task was to navigate a cursor along a computer rendered 2-D maze. A peak information transfer rate of 8.0 bit/min was achieved. Five subjects performed with a mean ITR of 4.5 bit/min and an accuracy of 74.84%. These results demonstrate that the use of automated interfaces to reduce complexity for the intended operator (outside the laboratory) is indeed possible.

High-frequency neuronal network modulations encoded in scalp EEG precede the onset of focal seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epileptic seizures; Scalp EEG; Preictal dynamics; Network interactions; High frequency oscillations; Information theory; Seizure prediction	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; RESTING BRAIN; FAST RIPPLES; OSCILLATIONS; CONNECTIVITY; ANTICIPATION; GENERATION; PREDICTION; ENTROPY; MARKER	Modulations of neuronal network interactions by seizure precursors are only partially understood and difficult to measure, in part due to inherent intra- and inter-patient seizure heterogeneities and EEG variability. This study investigated preictal neuromodulations associated with seizures originating in the temporal and/or frontal lobes, using information theoretic parameters estimated from awake scalp EEGs in two frequency ranges, <= 100 Hz and >100 Hz, respectively. Seizure-related activity at high frequencies has not been extensively estimated in awake scalp EEGs. Based on the statistical similarity of preictal and ictal information parameters, preictal network interactions appeared to be specifically modulated at frequencies >100 Hz, but not at lower frequencies. The dynamics of these parameters varied distinctly according to the origin of seizure onset (temporal versus frontal). Although preliminary, and based on a small patient sample for which the potential heterogeneity of multiple anticonvulsive medications was difficult to control, these results suggest that preictal modulations may be estimated from high-frequency scalp EEGs using directional information measures with high specificity to ictal events, and may thus be promising for improving seizure prediction.

A novel method for the determination of the EEG individual alpha frequency	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha reactivity; Inter-individual variability; Leads selection; Peak frequency; Transition frequency; Spectrum	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; TASK-DIFFICULTY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RHYTHMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; POWER	The individual alpha frequency (IAF) is one of the most common tools used to study the variability of EEG rhythms among subjects. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for IAF determination, including the popular peak frequency (PF) method, the extended band (EB) method, and the transition frequency (TF) method. However, literature techniques for IAF determination are over-reliant on the presence of peaks in the EEG spectrum and are based on qualitative criteria that require visual inspection of every individual EEG spectrum, a task that can be time consuming and difficult to reproduce. In this paper a novel channel reactivity based (CRB) method is proposed for IAF computation. The CRB method is based on quantitative indexes and criteria and relies on task-specific alpha reactivity patterns rather than on the presence of peaks in the EEG spectrum. Application of the technique to EEG signals recorded from 19 subjects during a cognitive task demonstrates the effectiveness of the CRB method and its capability to overcome the limits of PF, EB, and TF approaches.

While pre-stimulus activity in the parieto-occipital area has been exhaustively investigated with congruent results, less is known about the sensorimotor areas, for which studies reported inconsistent findings. In this work, the topic is addressed in a brain-computer interface (BCI) setting based on modulations of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). The goal is to assess whether and how pre-stimulus SMR activity influences the successive task execution quality and consequently the classification performance. Grand average data of 23 participants performing right and left hand motor imagery were analyzed. Trials were separated into two groups depending on the SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue, and classification by common spatial patterns (CSPs) preprocessing and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out in the post-stimulus time interval, i.e., during the task execution. The correlation between trial group and classification performance was assessed by an analysis of variance. As a result of this analysis, trials with higher SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue yielded significantly better classification performance than trials with lower amplitude. A further investigation of brain activity patterns revealed that this increase in accuracy is mainly due to the persistence of a higher SMR amplitude over the ipsilateral hemisphere. Our findings support the idea that exploiting information about the ongoing SMR might be the key to boosting performance in future SMR-BCI experiments and motor related tasks in general.

Information from pre- and peristimulus time intervals - in terms of event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) of the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signal - was directly incorporated in the relevant test statistics. For the individual steps of the analysis, we used particular estimations of the time-frequency distribution of the energy along with particular error control methods, that is, short-time Fourier transform and false-discovery rate at the sensor level and multitapers and familywise error rate at the source level. This procedure was applied to two types of group-level tests, a within-condition test and a between-conditions test. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed by (1) analyzing the event-related brain activity from two experimental conditions of an auditory MEG experiment passive listening to a sequence of frequency-modulated sweeps and their active categorization with respect to the direction of frequency modulation, and (2) comparing the findings with those obtained with a widely used cluster-based analysis.

Assessing the risk of subsequent tonic-clonic seizures in patients with a history of simple or complex partial seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY	Background Patients who present with only simple or complex partial seizures have a poorly documented prognosis. Treatment may be advocated to prevent future secondary generalised seizures, reduce the frequency of further simple or complex partial seizures or a combination of both. Methods A full statistical analysis on 1334 patients was carried out. The outcomes measured were post-randomisation times to first seizure of any type and first tonic-clonic seizure. Methodology was adopted that accounted for individuals' underlying pre-randomisation seizure counts and allowed for the possibility that there may be a proportion of the sample that will not experience post-randomisation seizure recurrence. Results 103 subjects randomised to the MESS (Multicentre Study of Early Epilepsy and Single Seizures) study had only partial seizures at randomisation. Only 17 of these had a tonic-clonic seizure during follow-up. The presence of an abnormal EEG at randomisation influenced this risk: an estimated 23% of those with EEG abnormality were at risk of tonic-clonic seizures during follow-up compared with 16% of those with a normal EEG. The group did, however, continue to have partial seizures during follow-up, and modelling showed that the impact of treatment on these seizures was significantly less than the effects of treatment on the frequency of tonic-clonic seizures in those patients with such pre-randomisation seizures. Conclusion Patients presenting with a history of only partial seizures are at low risk of subsequent tonic-clonic seizures in the period of time to which therapeutic decisions are relevant. The effects of the antiepileptic drugs used in the MESS study are greater for tonic-clonic seizures than they are for partial seizures.

Task-dependent changes in cortical excitability and effective connectivity: a combined TMS-EEG study. J Neurophysiol 107: 2383-2392, 2012. First published February 8, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00707.2011.-The brain's electrical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is known to be influenced by exogenous factors such as the frequency and intensity of stimulation and the orientation and positioning of the stimulating coil. Less understood, however, is the influence of endogenous neural factors, such as global brain state, on the TMS-evoked response (TMS-ER). In the present study, we explored how changes in behavioral state affect the TMS-ER by perturbing the superior parietal lobule (SPL) with single pulses of TMS and measuring consequent differences in the frequency, strength, and spatial spread of TMS-evoked currents during the delay period of a spatial short-term memory task and during a period of passive fixation. Results revealed that task performance increased the overall strength of electrical currents induced by TMS, increased the spatial spread of TMS-evoked activity to distal brain regions, and increased the ability of TMS to reset the phase of ongoing broadband cortical oscillations. By contrast, task performance had little effect on the dominant frequency of the TMS-ER, both locally and at distal brain areas. These findings contribute to a growing body of work using combined TMS and neuroimaging methods to explore task-dependent changes in the functional organization of cortical networks implicated in task performance.

The articulation conveys speech information that helps detect and disambiguate the auditory speech. As important characteristic of EEG, oscillations and its synchronization have been applied to cognition research more and more. This study analyzed the EEG data acquired by unimodal and bimodal stimuli using time frequency and phase synchrony approach, investigated the oscillatory activities and its synchrony modes behind evoked potential during auditory-visual integration, in order to reveal the inherent neural integration mechanism under these modes. It was found that beta activity and its synchronization differences had relationship with gesture N1-P2, which happened in the earlier stage of speech coding to pronouncing action. Alpha oscillation and its synchronization related with auditory N1-P2 might be mainly responsible for auditory speech process caused by anticipation from gesture to sound feature. The visual gesture changing enhanced the interaction of auditory brain regions. These results provided explanations to the power and connectivity change of event-evoked oscillatory activities which matched ERPs during auditory-visual speech integration.

Studies in the period of 2009-2011 are discussed, in which a new phenomenon in human EEG was found out, i.e., personal (individual) features of neocortical gamma activity in parameters such as amplitude, frequency and width of the gamma band. This phenomenon was revealed in induced responses to visual stimuli in people under conditions of repeated research (after different time intervals hours, weeks, months). The findings suggest the necessity of development of the metric system for assessment of this phenomenon and corresponding estimation of personal features of the gamma band and their stability (reliability), which would allow interindividual differences to be revealed.

J	Gilmore, CS; Fein, G				Gilmore, Casey S.; Fein, George			Theta event-related synchronization is a biomarker for a morbid effect of alcoholism on the brain that may partially resolve with extended abstinence	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Abstinent; alcoholism; biomarker; EEG; event-related synchronization; theta; time-frequency		Analyzing the induced (non-stimulus-phase-locked) EEG activity elicited by targets in a three-condition visual oddball task, Fein and colleagues have shown increased theta band event-related synchronization (ERS) in two different samples of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) compared with age-and gender-comparable controls. The theta ERS effect in alcoholics was also shown to be independent of, and opposite in direction to, the reduced amplitude evoked (stimulus-phase-locked) activity typically found in alcoholics and those at genetic risk of developing alcoholism. This study extends these findings by applying time-frequency analysis to target stimulus event-related EEG to compare evoked and induced theta activity in 43 LTAA and 72 nonalcoholic controls with a group of 31 alcoholics who just recently initiated abstinence from alcohol (between 6-and 15-week abstinent; referred to as short-term abstinent alcoholics, STAA). Results demonstrated that (1) evoked theta power was reduced to the same degree in STAA and LTAA compared with nonalcoholic control participants, while (2) induced theta activity, measured by theta ERS, was increased in both STAA and LTAA relative to controls, but was also increased in STAA relative to LTAA. The STAA and LTAA groups did not differ on measures of alcohol use severity or family history of alcohol problems. These results, coupled with previous findings that show a relationship between stronger theta ERS and increased memory load and attention allocation, suggest that increased theta ERS may be a biomarker for a detrimental effect of chronic alcohol abuse on the brain - a detriment that may recover, at least partially, with extended abstinence.

The Amplitude and Timing of the BOLD Signal Reflects the Relationship between Local Field Potential Power at Different Frequencies	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SOURCE-DENSITY ANALYSIS; SINGLE CORTICAL CELLS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EEG PHENOMENA; FMRI SIGNAL; INFORMATION MEASURES; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY	There is growing evidence that several components of the mass neural activity contributing to the local field potential (LFP) can be partly separated by decomposing the LFP into nonoverlapping frequency bands. Although the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been found to correlate preferentially with specific frequency bands of the LFP, it is still unclear whether the BOLD signal relates to the activity expressed by each LFP band independently of the others or if, instead, it also reflects specific relationships among different bands. We investigated these issues by recording, simultaneously and with high spatiotemporal resolution, BOLD signal and LFP during spontaneous activity in early visual cortices of anesthetized monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We used information theory to characterize the statistical dependency between BOLD and LFP. We found that the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (18-30 Hz), and gamma (40-100 Hz) LFP bands were informative about the BOLD signal. In agreement with previous studies, gamma was the most informative band. Both increases and decreases in BOLD signal reliably followed increases and decreases in gamma power. However, both alpha and beta power signals carried information about BOLD that was largely complementary to that carried by gamma power. In particular, the relationship between alpha and gamma power was reflected in the amplitude of the BOLD signal, while the relationship between beta and gamma bands was reflected in the latency of BOLD with respect to significant changes in gamma power. These results lay the basis for identifying contributions of different neural pathways to cortical processing using fMRI.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that impaired consciousness during NREM sleep is associated with an increased modularity of brain activity. Cerebral connectivity was quantified in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging times series acquired in 13 healthy volunteers during wakefulness and NREM sleep. The analysis revealed a modification of the hierarchical organization of large-scale networks into smaller independent modules during NREM sleep, independently from EEG markers of the slow oscillation. Such modifications in brain connectivity, possibly driven by sleep ultraslow oscillations, could hinder the brain's ability to integrate information and account for decreased consciousness during NREM sleep.

Oscillatory brain dynamics underlying alcohol's effects on language are poorly understood despite impairments on verbal tasks. To investigate how moderate alcohol intoxication modulates event-related theta activity during visual word processing, healthy social drinkers (N = 22, 11 females) participated in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. They performed a double-duty lexical decision task as they detected real words among non-words. An additional requirement to respond to all real words that also referred to animals induced response conflict. High density whole-head MEG signals and midline scalp EEG data were decomposed for each trial with Morlet wavelets. Each person's reconstructed cortical surface was used to constrain noise-normalized distributed minimum norm inverse solutions for theta frequencies. Alcohol intoxication increased reaction time and marginally affected accuracy. The overall spatio-temporal pattern is consistent with the left-lateralized fronto-temporal activation observed in language studies applying time-domain analysis. Event-related theta power was sensitive to the two functions manipulated by the task. First, theta estimated to the left-lateralized fronto-temporal areas reflected lexical-semantic retrieval, indicating that this measure is well suited for investigating the neural basis of language functions. While alcohol attenuated theta power overall, it was particularly deleterious to semantic retrieval since it reduced theta to real words but not pseudowords. Second, a highly overlapping prefrontal network comprising lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex was sensitive to decision conflict and was also affected by intoxication, in agreement with previous studies indicating that executive functions are especially vulnerable to alcohol intoxication.

The understanding of the characteristics of the period prior to the seizure onset is a decisive step towards the development of seizure prediction frameworks. Multiway models of EEG segments already demonstrated that hidden structures may be unveiled using tensor decomposition techniques. We propose a novel approach using a multiway model, Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), to identify spatial, temporal and spectral signatures of the preictal period. The results obtained, from a dataset of 4 patients, with a total of 30 seizures, suggest that a common structure may be involved in seizure generation. Furthermore, the spatial signature may be related to the ictal onset region and that determined frequency sub-bands may be more relevant in preictal stages.

NMDA antagonist MK801 recreates auditory electrophysiology disruption present in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism; Electrophysiology; Endophenotype; Animal models; NMDA receptor antagonist	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; MICE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MK-801; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS; LOCOMOTION; STEREOTYPY; BIOMARKER	Autism is a highly disabling neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, language impairment, and repetitive behaviors. There are few effective biological treatments for this disorder, partly due to the lack of translational biomarkers. However, recent data suggest that autism has reliable electrophysiological endophenotypes, along with evidence that some deficits may be caused by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Similarly, the NMDAR antagonist MK801 has been used in behavioral animal models of autism. Since MK801 has also been used as a model of schizophrenia, this paper examines the independent and overlapping ways in which MK801 recreates the electrophysiogical changes present in both diseases. Mouse EEG was recorded in response to auditory stimuli after either vehicle or MK801 and the dose-response relationship for each measure was determined. ERP component amplitude and latency analysis was performed along with time-frequency analysis of gamma frequency inter-trial coherence and evoked power. Evoked gamma power and ITC were decreased by MK801 at the highest dose. P1, Ni latency and gamma baseline power were increased in dose dependent fashion following MK801. There were no amplitude changes in P1 or NI. MK801 caused alterations in evoked gamma activity, gamma ITC, gamma baseline power, P1 and Ni latency similar to findings in autism. These data provide evidence indicating that NMDAR dysfunction may contribute to deficits specific to autism and some that overlap with other disorders such as schizophrenia. Such observations could be important for developing novel therapeutics, as electrophysiological endophenotypes associate with functional measures and may provide early biomarkers for efficacy in clinical trials.

Over the last 20 years, this hypothesis has received considerable support, in particular by in vitro studies of thalamic oscillations following pharmacological/genetic manipulations of GABAARs. However, from a critical appraisal of the evidence in absence epilepsy patients and well-established models of absence epilepsy it emerges that SWDs can occur as frequently during wakefulness as during sleep, with their preferential occurrence in either one of these behavioural states often being patient dependent. Moreover, whereas the EEG expression of both SWDs and sleep spindles requires the integrity of the entire cortico-thalamo-cortical network, SWDs initiates in cortex while sleep spindles in thalamus. Furthermore, the hypothesis of a reduction in GABAAR function across the entire cortico-thalamo-cortical network as the basis for the transformation of sleep spindles into SWDs is no longer tenable. In fact, while a decreased GABAAR function may be present in some cortical layers and in the reticular thalamic nucleus, both phasic and tonic GABAAR inhibitions of thalamo-cortical neurons are either unchanged or increased in this epileptic phenotype. In summary, these differences between SWDs and sleep spindles question the view that the EEG hallmark of absence seizures results from a transformation of this EEG oscillation of natural sleep.

This study further investigates ictal broadband EEG in the same cohort of patients by examining the infraslow activity, including ictal baseline ("direct current") shifts (IBS) and peri-ictal infraslow activity (0.02 to 0.2 Hz). The seizure onset zone had been defined and resected based on HFO+ by a prospectively defined protocol. We reviewed 11 representative seizures from 6 patients by visual and spectral analyses using appropriate filters and timescales. The HFO seizure onset, in the high gamma or ripple frequency, preceded or followed the IBS closely (< 300 ms). The IBS were negative or positive, similar to 1 mV in amplitude and 2 to 3 seconds long. Although the HFO+ were always ipsilateral to the surgical hemisphere, the IBS could be ipsilateral or contralateral. Compared with conventional frequency activity, the HFO+ and IBS were significantly smaller in spatial distribution and likely to be concordant. The peri-ictal infraslow activity consisted of distinct periodic or rhythmic (0.12 to 0.16 Hz) patterns, poorly concordant with IBS or HFO+. Although not statistically significant, better seizure outcome tended to correlate with smaller seizure onset zones and more complete resection of the HFO+ and IBS contacts. We conclude that IBS, like HFO+, define a smaller seizure onset zone and probably a more accurate epileptogenic zone in neocortical epilepsy.

EEG changes in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting	ZHURNAL NEVROLOGII I PSIKHIATRII IMENI S S KORSAKOVA			Russian	Article						EEG; theta-rhythm; brain ischemia; on-pump CABG	THETA; OSCILLATIONS	We studied the changes of electroencephalograms (EEG) related to on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 28 right-handed male patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), 10 from which had accompanying moderated (30-50%) carotid artery (CA) stenoses. All EEG studies were performed 3-5 days before and 7-11 days after CABG. EEG data of healthy age-matched males (n=14) were examined. Before surgery, the CHD patients differed from the control group by less expressed theta2 and beta1 rhythm power asymmetry. The differences demonstrated worse conditions for cognitive processes in CHD patients. After CABG, the higher power of teta1 and 2 rhythms, predominantly in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere which was mostly expressed in patients with CA stenosis, was observed in all CHD patients. This effect can be considered as the appearance of ischemic neuronal injury caused by on-pump CABG. The localization of changes in the frontal cortex of the left hemisphere can be related to a high vulnerability of these regions. The deficit of cerebral blood flow in these regions will define a clinical picture of cognitive decline after CABG.	[Tarasova, I.

Such mechanisms might be related to neuronal oscillations, which are known to be involved in gating of incoming information [3]. We here apply a working memory (WM) task to investigate how neuronal oscillations are involved in the suppression of distracting information that can be predicted in time. We used a modified Sternberg WM task in which distracters were presented in the retention interval, while we recorded the ongoing brain activity using magnetoencephalography. The data revealed a robust adjustment of the phase of alpha oscillations in anticipation of the distracter. In trials with strong phase adjustment, response times to the memory probe were reduced. Further, the power of alpha oscillations increased prior to the distracter and predicted performance. Our findings demonstrate that the doors of perception close when a distracter is expected. The phase adjustment of the alpha rhythm adds to the computational versatility of brain oscillations, because such a mechanism allows for modulating neuronal processing on a fine temporal scale.

Accordingly, brain functional connectivity is not static in time, but fluctuates dynamically following the synchronization and desynchronization of neural populations. This dynamic functional connectivity has recently been demonstrated in spontaneous fluctuations of the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal, measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We analyzed temporal fluctuations in BOLD connectivity and their electrophysiological correlates, by means of long (approximate to 50 min) joint electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI recordings obtained from two populations: 15 awake subjects and 13 subjects undergoing vigilance transitions. We identified positive and negative correlations between EEG spectral power (extracted from electrodes covering different scalp regions) and fMRI BOLD connectivity in a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions (with millimeter spatial resolution). In particular, increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) power were related to decreased functional connectivity, whereas gamma (30-60 Hz) power correlated positively with BOLD connectivity between specific brain regions. These patterns were altered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with slower oscillations being correlated with functional connectivity increases. Dynamic BOLD functional connectivity was reflected in the fluctuations of graph theoretical indices of network structure, with changes in frontal and central alpha power correlating with average path length. Our results strongly suggest that fluctuations of BOLD functional connectivity have a neurophysiological origin. Positive correlations with gamma can be interpreted as facilitating increased BOLD connectivity needed to integrate brain regions for cognitive performance. Negative correlations with alpha suggest a temporary functional weakening of local and long-range connectivity, associated with an idling state.

Maturation of EEG oscillations in children with sodium channel mutations	BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Dravet syndrome; Scnla mutation; Age-dependent alteration; Brain oscillation; Spectral analysis; Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy	SEVERE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; DRAVET SYNDROME; MOUSE MODEL; HIPPOCAMPUS; THETA; SCN1A; INFANCY; INTERNEURONS; SEIZURES; REGION	Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy beginning in infancy in which children have difficult to control seizures and cognitive impairment. The majority of children with DS carry mutations of the gene Scnla, which codes for the alpha subunit of the type I voltage-gated sodium channel and is important for the function of interneurons. Interneurons have a critical role in the generation of brain rhythms involved in cognitive processing. We hypothesized that children with DS with Scnla mutations would have abnormal oscillatory activity. To address this hypothesis, we used EEG power spectral analysis during the wakening to determine if frequency and power are altered in 23 EEGs from 12 children with DS compared to 18 age-matched controls. While there were few differences between the EEG power spectra in DS and controls in children under 2 years, in older children group differences were apparent. In DS children between 3 and 5 years there were significant decreases in percentage of alpha power compared to controls and in DS children over age 6 years there was a marked increase of theta and decrease of alpha compared to controls. Developmental status paralleled the power spectral analysis with an increasing likelihood of having severe cognitive problems with increasing age. These results demonstrate that Scnla mutations result in an age-dependent alteration in oscillatory process. Such abnormalities in developmental progression of oscillations may play an important role in poor cognitive development in children with DS. (c) 2011 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

This study tested the hypothesis that patients with depression show less and later declines into lower EEG vigilance stages (different global functional brain states) under resting conditions than healthy controls, as proposed by the vigilance theory of affective disorders. Methods. Thirty patients with Major Depressive Disorder (19 female; mean age: 37.2 years, SD: 12.6) without psychotropic medication and 30 carefully age-and sex-matched controls (19 female; mean age: 37.3 years, SD: 12.8) without past or present mental disorders underwent a 15-min resting EEG. EEG-vigilance regulation was determined with a computer-based vigilance classification algorithm (VIGALL, Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig), allowing a classification of vigilance stages A (with substages A1, A2 and A3), B (with substages B1 and B2/3) and C. Results. Depressive patients spent significantly more time in the highest EEG vigilance substage A1, and less time in substages A2, A3 and B2/3 than controls. In depressive patients, a significantly longer latency until the occurrence of substages A2, A3 and B2/3 was observed. No significant group differences in the percentage of B1 segments or the latency until occurrence of B1 were found. Conclusions. The results confirm the hypothesis that patients with depression show less (and later) declines into lower EEG vigilance stages under resting conditions than healthy controls, and support the vigilance theory of affective disorders linking a hyperstable vigilance regulation to depression.

CHANGES IN HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM AND THEIR CORRELATIONS WITH SPEED DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF VOLUNTARY WHEEL RUNNING IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						wheel running; hippocampal theta rhythm; speed	SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; TREADMILL EXERCISE; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; HEART-RATE; EEG; BEHAVIOR; FREQUENCY; POWER	Hippocampal theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) can be observed during locomotor behavior, but findings on the relationship between locomotion speed and theta frequency are inconsistent if not contradictory. The inconsistency may be because of the difficulties that previous analyses and protocols have had excluding the effects of behavior training. We recorded the first or second voluntary wheel running each day, and assumed that theta frequency and activity are correlated with speed in different running phases. By simultaneously recording electroencephalography, physical activity, and wheel running speed, this experiment explored the theta oscillations during spontaneous running of the 12-h dark period. The recording was completely wireless and allowed the animal to run freely while being recorded in the wheel. Theta frequency and theta power of middle frequency were elevated before running and theta frequency, theta power of middle frequency, physical activity, and running speed maintained persistently high levels during running. The slopes of the theta frequency and theta activity (4-9.5 Hz) during the initial running were different compared to the same values during subsequent running. During the initial running, the running speed was positively correlated with theta frequency and with theta power of middle frequency. Over the 12-h dark period, the running speed did not positively correlate with theta frequency but was significantly correlated with theta power of middle frequency. Thus, theta frequency was associated with running speed only at the initiation of running. Furthermore, theta power of middle frequency was associated with speed and with physical activity during running when chronological order was not taken into consideration. (C) 2012 IBRO.

Methods: Linear spectral coherence, mean phase coherence (MPC) z-score and Pearson's correlation coefficient of analytic amplitudes were evaluated for different spectral bands of whole-night EEG recordings from 25 healthy subjects. Results: Coherence and MPC z-score demonstrated practically the same statistical differences between vigilance stages, confirming the findings of previous coherence-based studies. MPC z-score and amplitude correlations were most correlated (>0.5) between homologous interhemispheric positions and least correlated between nonhomologous interhemispheric positions and between fronto-occipital positions. Conclusions: Coherence and phase synchronization provided essentially the same information. Complete synchronization was manifested by highly coherent phases and correlated amplitudes, as well as by correlated changes of phase synchronization, coherence and amplitude correlations between vigilance states. In cases of weaker coupling, phase synchronization and coherence change in agreement, while behaviour of amplitude correlations differs. Significance: Phase synchronization analysis is not superior to coherence analysis, although the coupling between EEG signals is dominated by phase synchronization which turns into complete synchronization in the most strongly coupled EEG signals.

Within-subject joint independent component analysis of simultaneous fMRI/ERP in an auditory oddball paradigm	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; ICA; Multimodal neuroimaging; Auditory oddball paradigm; P300	TARGET DETECTION; P300; EEG; POTENTIALS; BRAIN; FUSION; DISCRIMINATION; GENERATORS; RESPONSES; CORTEX	The integration of event-related potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can contribute to characterizing neural networks with high temporal and spatial resolution. This research aimed to determine the sensitivity and limitations of applying joint independent component analysis (jICA) within-subjects, for ERP and fMRI data collected simultaneously in a parametric auditory frequency oddball paradigm. In a group of 20 subjects, an increase in ERP peak amplitude ranging 1-8 mu V in the time window of the P300 (350-700 ms), and a correlated increase in fMRI signal in a network of regions including the right superior temporal and supramarginal gyri, was observed with the increase in deviant frequency difference. JICA of the same ERP and fMRI group data revealed activity in a similar network, albeit with stronger amplitude and larger extent. In addition, activity in the left pre- and post-central gyri, likely associated with right hand somato-motor response, was observed only with the jICA approach. Within-subject, the jICA approach revealed significantly stronger and more extensive activity in the brain regions associated with the auditory P300 than the P300 linear regression analysis. The results suggest that with the incorporation of spatial and temporal information from both imaging modalities, jICA may be a more sensitive method for extracting common sources of activity between ERP and fMRI.

Here, however, we suggest that the most basic mechanism of empathy-the intuitive sharing of other's emotional and motivational states-is limited to those we like. Measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha oscillations as people observed ingroup vs outgroup members, we found that participants showed similar activation patterns when feeling sad as when they observed ingroup members feeling sad. In contrast, participants did not show these same activation patterns when observing outgroup members and even less so the more they were prejudiced. These findings provide evidence from brain activity for an ingroup bias in empathy: empathy may be restricted to close others and, without active effort, may not extend to outgroups, potentially making them likely targets for prejudice and discrimination.

Even less is known as to what extent electrical fields generated by the partially synchronous collective activity of neural populations influence the dynamics of the individual neurons and the network activities they participate in. Here, we discuss some recent results related to multiscale brain dynamics that emphasize the relative weakness of current neuroscientific understanding of how complex feedback interactions across different spatial scales of brain activity, from the level of individual neurons to spatiotemporally coordinated EEG source activity networks that include separated cortical areas, support coordinated brain/behavioral function.

Intriguingly, the amplitude of ongoing oscillations, such as measured in EEG recordings, fluctuates irregularly, with episodes of high amplitude alternating with episodes of low amplitude. Despite the widespread occurrence of amplitude fluctuations in many frequency bands and brain regions, the mechanisms by which they are generated are poorly understood. Here, we show that irregular transitions between sub-second episodes of high-and low-amplitude oscillations in the alpha/beta frequency band occur in a generic neuronal network model consisting of interconnected inhibitory and excitatory cells that are externally driven by sustained cholinergic input and trains of action potentials that activate excitatory synapses. In the model, we identify the action potential drive onto inhibitory cells, which represents input from other brain areas and is shown to desynchronize network activity, to be crucial for the emergence of amplitude fluctuations. We show that the duration distributions of high-amplitude episodes in the model match those observed in rat prefrontal cortex for oscillations induced by the cholinergic agonist carbachol. Furthermore, the mean duration of high-amplitude episodes varies in a bell-shaped manner with carbachol concentration, just as in mouse hippocampus. Our results suggest that amplitude fluctuations are a general property of oscillatory neuronal networks that can arise through background input from areas external to the network.	[Gonzalez, Oscar J.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether the event-related dynamics of EEG differ between genders during the performance of Navon letter identification tasks (NLITs). To this end, the EEG patterns of 40 subjects were recorded during the NLIT performance. We compared behavioral outcomes, event-related temporo-spectral dynamics, and source distribution of neural oscillations within cortical regions of male and female subjects. We found that male subjects exhibited greater induced neural activities than female subjects in right temporo-parietal areas at theta and alpha frequency bands. Source imaging for the time ranges at which maximal gender differences were observed revealed gender-dependent estimated current densities in the right posterior temporal regions. These gender differences can be explained by the existence of distinct, gender-specific hemispheric specialization. Thus, gender differences should be considered during behavioral tasks and electrophysiological measurements.

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources - including Na+ and Ca2+ spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations - can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.

Neural correlates of being imitated: An EEG study in preverbal infants	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Mu rhythm; Imitation; Perception-action; Infant	MU-RHYTHM; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; ACTION-PERCEPTION; MOTOR ACTIVATION; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTION; ATTENTION; SYSTEM; DESYNCHRONIZATION	A foundational aspect of early social-emotional development is the ability to detect and respond to the actions of others who are coordinating their behavior with that of the self. Behavioral work in this area has found that infants show particular preferences for adults who are imitating them rather than adults who are carrying out noncontingent or mismatching actions. Here, we explore the neural processes related to this tendency of infants to prefer others who act like the self. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded from 14-month-old infants while they were observing actions that either matched or mismatched the action the infant had just executed. Desynchronization of the EEG mu rhythm was greater when infants observed an action that matched their own most recently executed action. This effect was strongest immediately prior to the culmination of the goal of the observed action, which is consistent with recent ideas about the predictive nature of brain responses during action observation.

A correlation analysis was made between WAIS-III scores and the Z-transformed absolute power (AP) and relative power (RP) values of delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Lower values of delta and theta and higher values of alpha AP and RP were significantly related to better scores in the WAIS-III subtest scores. There were few significant relationships between WAIS-III scores and beta activity. These results suggest that the WAIS-III could be used as a brain function indicator in this age group, paying special attention to the subtests that correlated most significantly with EEG values.

To identify sleep-associated neurophysiological indicators of this restructuring of knowledge representations, we measured frequency-specific power of EEG while participants slept during the night between two sessions of the NRT. Alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG power during slow wave sleep (SWS) emerged as a specific marker of the transformation of presleep implicit knowledge to postsleep explicit knowledge (ExK). Beta power during SWS was increased whenever ExK was attained after sleep, irrespective of presleep knowledge. No such EEG predictors of insight were found during Sleep Stage 2 and rapid eye movement sleep. These results support the view that it is neuronal memory reprocessing during sleep, in particular during SWS, that lays the foundations for restructuring those task-related representations in the brain that are necessary for promoting the gain of ExK.

Here we investigated whether there is a temporal relation between sleep spindles and MEG oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency band (>30 Hz) which is considered to reflect local cortical processing of memory representations. MEG and simultaneous EEG (at Cz) were obtained in subjects during sleep together with standard poly-somnography. As expected EEG spindles were correlated with power increases in MEG spindle (12.5-15.5 Hz) power mainly over prefrontal and occipital cortical areas. During EEG spindles we revealed both transient significant increases and decreases in MEG power, with decreases occurring significantly more often than increases. The modulations in gamma power occurred mainly at sites of increased MEG spindle power, and more often during peaks than troughs within the EEC spindle cycle. Cross-frequency coherence analyses confirmed a strong phase-coupling of gamma band activity with the spindle rhythm. The findings are consistent with the idea that spindles provide a fine-tuned temporal frame for integrated cortical memory processing during sleep. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Connectivity Analysis as a Novel Approach to Motor Decoding for Prosthesis Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; connectivity analysis; motor control; time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DYNAMIC BAYESIAN NETWORK; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; INFORMATION-FLOW; FINGER MOVEMENT; CORTICAL AREAS; EEG ACTIVITY; GAMMA-BAND	The use of neural signals for prosthesis control is an emerging frontier of research to restore lost function to amputees and the paralyzed. Electrocorticography (ECoG) brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are an alternative to EEG and neural spiking and local field potential BMI approaches. Conventional ECoG BMIs rely on spectral analysis at specific electrode sites to extract signals for controlling prostheses. We compare traditional features with information about the connectivity of an ECoG electrode network. We use time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) to determine connectivity between ECoG channels in humans during a motor task. We show that, on average, TV-DBN connectivity decreases from baseline preceding movement and then becomes negative, indicating an alteration in the phase relationship between electrode pairs. In some subjects, this change occurs preceding and during movement, before changes in low or high frequency power. We tested TV-DBN output in a hand kinematic decoder and obtained an average correlation coefficient (r(2)) between actual and predicted joint angle of 0.40, and as high as 0.66 in one subject. This result compares favorably with spectral feature decoders, for which the average correlation coefficient was 0.13. This work introduces a new feature set based on connectivity and demonstrates its potential to improve ECoG BMI accuracy.

Gamma-Band Oscillations in the Primary Somatosensory Cortex-A Direct and Obligatory Correlate of Subjective Pain Intensity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LASER EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG RESPONSES; HUMANS; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; PERCEPTION; CAUSALITY	Electroencephalographic gamma band oscillations (GBOs) induced over the human primary somatosensory cortex (SI) by nociceptive stimuli have been hypothesized to reflect cortical processing involved directly in pain perception, because their magnitude correlates with pain intensity. However, as stimuli perceived as more painful are also more salient, an alternative interpretation of this correlation is that GBOs reflect unspecific stimulus-triggered attentional processing. Infact, this is suggested by recent observations that other features of the electroencephalographic (EEG) response correlate with pain perception when stimuli are presented in isolation, but not when their saliency is reduced by repetition. Here, by delivering trains of three nociceptive stimuli at a constant 1 s interval, and using different energies to elicit graded pain intensities, we demonstrate that GBOs recorded over SI always predict the subjective pain intensity, even when saliency is reduced by repetition. These results provide evidence for a close relationship between GBOs and the cortical activity subserving pain perception.	[Zhang, Z. G.; Iannetti, G.

In this study, the effect of subject's state on cortical oscillatory responses to emotional facial expressions was investigated in a sample of 40 subjects aged 17-32 years. The strength of oscillatory responses in all frequency bands was lower in subjects who felt tenseness, experienced negative emotions, and did not like the experimental procedure. Moreover, in these subjects, personality-related differences in cortical oscillatory responses were not found, though they were found in subjects who reported being relaxed and liked the procedure. The observed individual differences in subject's state partly depended on personality and partly on other factors that preexisted before the experiment. These data show that subject's state is an important contributor to observed oscillatory dynamics and should be taken into account.

A comparison between detectors of high frequency oscillations	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High frequency oscillations; HFO; Automatic detector; Intracerebral EEG	TEMPORAL-LOBE; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPAL; MACROELECTRODES; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; EEG	Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a biomarker of epileptogenicity. Visual marking of HFOs is highly time-consuming and inevitably subjective, making automatic detection necessary. We compare four existing detectors on the same dataset. Methods: HFOs and baselines were identified by experienced reviewers in intracerebral EEGs from 20 patients. A new feature of our detector to deal with channels where baseline cannot be found is presented. The original and an optimal configuration are implemented. Receiver operator curves, false discovery rate, and channel ranking are used to evaluate performance. Results: All detectors improve performance with the optimal configuration. Our detector had higher sensitivity, lower false positives than the others, and similar false detections. The main difference in performance was in very active channels. Conclusions: Each detector was developed for different recordings and with different aims. Our detector performed better in this dataset, but was developed on data similar to the test data. Moreover, optimizing on a particular data type improves performance in any detector. Significance: Automatic HFO detection is crucial to propel their clinical use as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. Comparing detectors on a single dataset is important to analyze their performance and to emphasize the issues involved in validation. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Sequencing the cortical processing of pitch-evoking stimuli using EEG analysis and source estimation	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						pitch; EEG; mismatch negativity; iterated rippled noise	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPLEX TONES; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION; FREQUENCY; LOCALIZATION; PERCEPTION	Cues to pitch include spectral cues that arise from tonotopic organization and temporal cues that arise from firing patterns of auditory neurons. fMRI studies suggest a common pitch center is located just beyond primary auditory cortex along the lateral aspect of Heschl's gyrus, but little work has examined the stages of processing for the integration of pitch cues. Using electroencephalography, we recorded cortical responses to high-pass filtered iterated rippled noise (IRN) and high-pass filtered complex harmonic stimuli, which differ in temporal and spectral content. The two stimulus types were matched for pitch saliency, and a mismatch negativity (MMN) response was elicited by infrequent pitch changes. The P1 and N1 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) are thought to arise from primary and secondary auditory areas, respectively, and to result from simple feature extraction. MMN is generated in secondary auditory cortex and is thought to act on feature-integrated auditory objects. We found that peak latencies of both P1 and N1 occur later in response to IRN stimuli than to complex harmonic stimuli, but found no latency differences between stimulus types for MMN. The location of each ERP component was estimated based on iterative fitting of regional sources in the auditory cortices. The sources of both the P1 and N1 components elicited by IRN stimuli were located dorsal to those elicited by complex harmonic stimuli, whereas no differences were observed for MMN sources across stimuli. Furthermore, the MMN component was located between the P1 and N1 components, consistent with fMRI studies indicating a common pitch region in lateral Heschl's gyrus. These results suggest that while the spectral and temporal processing of different pitch-evoking stimuli involves different cortical areas during early processing, by the time the object-related MMN response is formed, these cues have been integrated into a common representation of pitch.

In this study, we investigated EEG patterns that were induced by seven different mental tasks (i.e. mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, imagery of familiar faces and motor imagery) and evaluated the binary classification performance. The aim was to provide a broad range of reliable and user-appropriate tasks to make individual optimization of BCI control strategies possible. Nine users participated in four sessions of multi-channel EEG recordings. Mental tasks resulting most frequently in good binary classification performance include mental subtraction, word association, motor imagery and mental rotation. Our results indicate that a combination of 'brain-teasers' - tasks that require problem specific mental work (e.g. mental subtraction, word association) - and dynamic imagery tasks (e.g. motor imagery) result in highly distinguishable brain patterns that lead to an increased performance.

Adenosine is strongly implicated in sleep homeostasis, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the adenosine deaminase gene (ADA G22A) has been associated with deeper and more efficient sleep. The present study verified the association between the ADA G22A polymorphism and changes in sleep EEG spectral power (from C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2, and O2-A1 derivations) in the Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO) sample from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eight-hundred individuals were subjected to full-night polysomnography and ADA G22A genotyping. Spectral analysis of the EEG was carried out in all individuals using fast Fourier transformation of the signals from each EEG electrode. The genotype groups were compared in the whole sample and in a subsample of 120 individuals matched according to ADA genotype for age, gender, body mass index, caffeine intake status, presence of sleep disturbance, and sleep-disturbing medication. When compared with homozygous GG genotype carriers, A allele carriers showed higher delta spectral power in Stage 1 and Stages 3+4 of sleep, and increased theta spectral power in Stages 1, 2 and REM sleep. These changes were seen both in the whole sample and in the matched subset. The higher EEG spectral power indicates that the sleep of individuals carrying the A allele may be more intense. Therefore, this polymorphism may be an important source of variation in sleep homeostasis in humans, through modulation of specific components of the sleep EEG.

Nevertheless, recent independent findings confirm the hypothesis that the neurophysiological mechanisms of encoding and recall of episodic memories are largely comparable across wakefulness and sleep. Brain lesion and neuroimaging studies converge in indicating that temporo-parieto-occipital junction and ventromesial prefrontal cortex play a crucial role in dream recall. Morphoanatomical measurements disclose some direct relations between volumetric and ultrastructural measures of the hippocampus-amygdala on the one hand, and some specific qualitative features of dreaming on the other. Intracranial recordings of epileptic patients also provide support for the notion that hippocampal nuclei mediate memory formation during sleep as well as in wakefulness. Finally, surface EEG studies showed that sleep cortical oscillations associated to a successful dream recall are the same involved in encoding and recall of episodic memories during wakefulness. Although preliminary, these converging pieces of evidence strengthen the general view that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying episodic/declarative memory formation may be the same across different states of consciousness.

J	Ng, BSW; Schroeder, T; Kayser, C				Ng, Benedict Shien Wei; Schroeder, Tim; Kayser, Christoph			A Precluding But Not Ensuring Role of Entrained Low-Frequency Oscillations for Auditory Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE PATTERNS; SPEECH; CORTEX; DISCRIMINATION; EXCITATION; MECHANISM; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; STIMULI	Oscillatory activity in sensory cortices reflects changes in local excitation-inhibition balance, and recent work suggests that phase signatures of ongoing oscillations predict the perceptual detection of subsequent stimuli. Low-frequency oscillations are also entrained by dynamic natural scenes, suggesting that the chance of detecting a brief target depends on the relative timing of this to the entrained rhythm. We tested this hypothesis in humans by implementing a cocktail-party-like scenario requiring subjects to detect a target embedded in a cacophony of background sounds. Using EEG to measure auditory cortical oscillations, we find that the chance of target detection systematically depends on both power and phase of theta-band (2-6 Hz) but not alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations before target. Detection rates were higher and responses faster when oscillatory power was low and both detection rate and response speed were modulated by phase. Intriguingly, the phase dependency was stronger for miss than for hit trials, suggesting that phase has a inhibiting but not ensuring role for detection. Entrainment of theta range oscillations prominently occurs during the processing of attended complex stimuli, such as vocalizations and speech. Our results demonstrate that this entrainment to attended sensory environments may have negative effects on the detection of individual tokens within the environment, and they support the notion that specific phase ranges of cortical oscillations act as gatekeepers for perception.

We presented isolated words to listeners, and observed, using generalized additive modeling, oscillations in the upper part of the delta range, the theta range (Bastiaansen & Hagoort, 2003), and the lower part of the alpha range related to degree of (rated) danger and usefulness (Wurm, 2007) starting around 150 ms and continuing to 350 ms post stimulus onset. A negative deflection in the oscillations tied to danger around 250-300 ms fits well with a similar negativity observed in the same time interval for visual emotion processing. Frequency and competitor effects emerged or reached maximal amplitude later, around or following the uniqueness point. The early effect of danger, long before the words' uniqueness points, is interpreted as evidence for the dual pathway theory of LeDoux (1996). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The memory function of the hippocampus depends on two major patterns of oscillations in the theta and gamma ranges, both requiring the intact functioning of the network of fast-firing interneurons expressing parvalbumin. We examined the ability of acute and chronic administration of NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists to recapitulate the oscillatory dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia. In freely moving rats, acute injection of MK801 or ketamine increased gamma power in both CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Theta peak shifted to higher frequencies whereas the average 5-10 Hz theta power decreased by 24% in CA1 and remained high in the dentate gyrus. Strong increase in CA1 gamma and decrease in theta power triggered by brainstem stimulation were found under urethane anesthesia. In contrast to acute experiments, chronic administration of ketamine caused a steady decline in both gamma and theta oscillations, 2-4 weeks after treatment. A further important difference between the two models was that the effects of acute injection were more robust than the changes after chronic treatment. Chronic administration of ketamine also leads to decrease in the number of detectable parvalbumin interneurons. Histological examination of interindividual differences indicated, however, that within the ketamine treated group a further decrease in parvalbumin neurons correlated with strengthening of oscillations. The findings are consistent with abnormalities of oscillations in human schizophrenia and further validate the NMDA-R hypofunction hypothesis.

In the present work, we propose a graph-based methodology to investigate the connectivity redundancy in brain networks. By taking into account all the possible paths between pairs of nodes, we considered three complementary indexes, characterizing the network redundancy (i) at the global level, i.e. the scalar redundancy (ii) across different path lengths, i.e. the vectorial redundancy (iii) between node pairs, i.e. the matricial redundancy. We used this procedure to investigate the functional connectivity estimated from a dataset of high-density EEG signals in a group of healthy subjects during a no-task resting state. The statistical comparison with a benchmark dataset of random networks, having the same number of nodes and links of the EEG nets, revealed a significant (p < 0.05) difference for all the three indexes. In particular, the redundancy in the EEG networks, for each frequency band, appears radically higher than random graphs, thus revealing a natural tendency of the brain to present multiple parallel interactions between different specialized areas. Notably, the matricial redundancy showed a high (p < 0.05) redundancy between the scalp sensors over the parieto-occipital areas in the Alpha range of EEG oscillations (7.5 12.5 Hz), which is known to be the most responsive channel during resting state conditions.

The chapter is restricted to their use in biomedicine and particularly in electroencephalogram signal processing to find specific components of such multi-channel signals. Methods presented include signal de-noising, evaluation of their fundamental components and segmentation based upon feature detection in time-frequency and time-scale domains using both the discrete Fourier transform and the discrete wavelet transform. Resulting pattern vectors are then classified by self-organizing neural networks using a specific statistical criterion proposed to evaluate distances of individual feature vector values from corresponding cluster centers. Results achieved are compared for different data sets and selected mathematical methods to detect segments features. Proposed methods verified in the MATLAB environment using distributed data processing are accompanied by the appropriate graphical user interface that enables convenient and user friendly time-series processing.

Action-related semantic content and negation polarity modulate motor areas during sentence reading: An event-related desynchronization study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event related desynchronization; Language; Embodied simulation; Action representation; Sentential negation	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FINGER MOVEMENTS; ERD/ERS PATTERNS; TEXT INFORMATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; EEG; ACTIVATION; REPRESENTATION	Our study evaluated motor cortex involvement during silent reading of sentences referring to hand actions. We aimed at defining whether sentential polarity (affirmative vs. negative) would modulate motor cortex activation using the event-related desynchronization (ERD) analysis of the mu rhythm. Eleven healthy volunteers performed a reading task involving 160 sentences (80 affirmative: 40 hand-related, 40 abstract; 80 negative: 40 hand-related, 40 abstract). After reading each sentence, subjects had to decide whether the verb was high or low frequency in Italian. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded with 32 surface electrodes and mu ERD analyses were performed for each subject. Hand-action related sentences induced a greater mu ERD over the left premotor and motor hand areas compared to abstract sentences. Mu ERD was greater and temporally delayed when the hand-related verbs were presented in the negative versus affirmative form. As predicted by the "embodied semantic" theory of language understanding, motor areas were activated during sentences referring to hand actions. In addition, motor cortex activation was larger for negative than affirmative motor sentences, a finding compatible with the hypothesis that comprehension is more demanding in the specific case of motor content negation.

Alpha- and Beta-Oscillations of Dynamics of the Area and Weight of Receptive Fields of Cat Striate Neurons under Conditions of Classical and Combined Mapping	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						cat; striate cortex; neurons; receptive field area and weight; dynamics; rhythms	CORTEX; INHIBITION	In 22 acute experiments in anesthetized and immobilized adult cats the dynamics of 83 receptive fields (RF) of 47 striate neurons was studied by temporal slices method. Classical mapping revealed wave-like changes in the area and weight of neuronal RFs. Special mathematical analysis showed that such changes represented a sum of a slow non-oscillatory and comparatively fast components. The slow component was a biphasic up and down RF dynamics. In most cases, the oscillation frequencies were within the alpha- and beta- EEG frequency ranges. When the RF center was activated additionally during combined mapping, the oscillations frequencies remained unchanged, but the duration and amplitude of non-oscillatory component substantially decreased. Mechanisms underlying the RF dynamics and its functional significance are discussed.	[Lasareva, N. A.; Kozhukhov, S. A.; Novikova, R. V.; Tikhomirov, A. S.; Tsutskiridze, D. Yu; Sharaev, G.

Estimation of heart rate signals for mental stress assessment using neuro fuzzy technique	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Non-linear system; Heart-rate variability (HRV); Electrocardiogram (ECG); Autonomic nervous system (ANS)	NETWORKS; EEG	This paper presents the evaluation of mental stress assesment using heart-rate variability (HRV). The activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is studied by means of time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the heart-rate variability signal. Spectral decomposition of the heart-rate variability before smoking and after smoking was obtained. Mental stress is accompanied by dynamic changes in ANS activity. HRV analysis is a popular tool for assessing the activities of autonomic nervous system. The approach consists of (1) monitoring of heart rate signals, (2) signal processing using wavelet transform (WT) (different wavelets), (3) neuro fuzzy evaluation techniques to provide robustness in HRV analysis, (4) monitoring the function of ANS under different stress conditions. Our experiment involves 20 physically fit persons under different times (before smoking and after smoking). Nero fuzzy technique have been used to model the experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study addresses a possible relationship between MEG power changes and the N400m component of the event-related field. Whole-head MEG was recorded while subjects listened to spoken sentences with incongruent (IC) or congruent (C) sentence endings. A clear N400m was observed over the left hemisphere, and was larger for the IC sentences than for the C sentences. A timefrequency analysis of power revealed a decrease in alpha and beta power over the left hemisphere in roughly the same time range as the N400m for the IC relative to the C condition. A linear regression analysis revealed a positive linear relationship between N400m and beta power for the IC condition, not for the C condition. No such linear relation was found between N400m and alpha power for either condition. The sources of the beta decrease were estimated in the LIFG, a region known to be involved in semantic unification operations. One source of the N400m was estimated in the left superior temporal region, which has been related to lexical retrieval. We interpret our data within a framework in which beta oscillations are inversely related to the engagement of task-relevant brain networks. The source reconstructions of the beta power suppression and the N400m effect support the notion of a dynamic communication between the LIFG and the left superior temporal region during language comprehension.

In general we may consider that the term HFO encompasses activities from 30 to 600 Hz. The best practice is to indicate always explicitly the frequency range of the HFOs in any specific study. There are numerous types of HFOs: those in normal brain appear to facilitate synchronization and information transfer necessary for cognitive processes and memory, while a particular class of HFOs in the brain of animals and people with epilepsy appears to reflect fundamental mechanisms of epileptic phenomena and could serve as biomarkers of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity in abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. A better understanding of the significance of HFOs depends on a deeper analysis of the mechanisms of generation of different kinds of HFOs, that typically are at the crossroads between intrinsic membrane properties and neuronal interactions, both chemical and electrical. There is still a lack of understanding of how specific information is carried by HFOs and can be operational in normal cognitive processes such as in working and long-term memory and abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. The complexity of these processes makes the development of relevant computational models of dynamical neuronal networks most compelling. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We analyzed time domain (N-N interval, pNN50) and frequency domain (High Frequency (HF), Low Frequency (LF) and LF/HF ratio) indices from ten-minute resting EKG activity. Patients with RE showed significantly higher HF and lower LF power and lower LF/HF ratio than controls, independent of the epilepsy group, and did not show significant differences in any other autonomic index with respect to the two control groups. In RE, we found a negative relationship between both seizure load and frequency of sleep interictal EEG abnormalities with parasympathetic drive levels. These changes might be the expression of adaptive mechanisms to prevent the excessive sympathetic drive seen in patients with refractory epilepsies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Glutathione Precursor N-Acetyl-Cysteine Modulates EEG Synchronization in Schizophrenia Patients: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS	Glutathione (GSH) dysregulation at the gene, protein, and functional levels has been observed in schizophrenia patients. Together with disease-like anomalies in GSH deficit experimental models, it suggests that such redox dysregulation can play a critical role in altering neural connectivity and synchronization, and thus possibly causing schizophrenia symptoms. To determine whether increased GSH levels would modulate EEG synchronization, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, was administered to patients in a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol for 60 days, followed by placebo for another 60 days (or vice versa). We analyzed whole-head topography of the multivariate phase synchronization (MPS) for 128-channel resting-state EEGs that were recorded at the onset, at the point of crossover, and at the end of the protocol. In this proof of concept study, the treatment with NAC significantly increased MPS compared to placebo over the left parieto-temporal, the right temporal, and the bilateral prefrontal regions. These changes were robust both at the group and at the individual level. Although MPS increase was observed in the absence of clinical improvement at a group level, it correlated with individual change estimated by Liddle's disorganization scale. Therefore, significant changes in EEG synchronization induced by NAC administration may precede clinically detectable improvement, highlighting its possible utility as a biomarker of treatment efficacy.

CX717 is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor that has shown efficacy in rodent and primate cognition models. CX717 (100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg) and placebo were studied in 16 healthy male volunteers (18-45 years) in a randomized, crossover study. Cognitive function, arousal and recovery sleep (by polysomnography) were assessed during the extended wakefulness protocol. Placebo condition was associated with significant decrements in cognition, particularly at the circadian nadir (between 03:00 and 05:00). Pre-specified primary and secondary analyses (general linear mixed modelling, GLMM) at each separate time point did not reveal consistent improvements in performance or objective alertness with any dose of CX717. Exploratory repeated measures analysis, a method used to take into account the influence of individual differences, demonstrated an improvement in attention-based task performance following the 1000 mg dose. Analysis of the recovery sleep showed that CX717 1000 mg significantly reduced stage 4 and slow-wave sleep (p <= 0.05) with evidence of reduced electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave and spindle activity. The study suggests that CX717 only at the 1000 mg dose may counteract effects of sleep deprivation on attention-based tasks and that it may interfere with subsequent recovery sleep.

Neural aftereffects of errors in a stop-signal task	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Response inhibition; Post-error slowing; Event-related potentials; Time-frequency analysis	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HUMAN EEG; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS	In order to maintain goal-directed behavior in a changing and distractive environment, one needs to continuously monitor one's own performance and adjust it in case of unfavorable outcomes. One aspect of behavioral adjustment commonly observed in reaction time tasks is an increase in response time in trials following an error, referred to as post-error slowing (PES). Using a stop-signal task with a four-on-two stimulus-response mapping, we here investigated the neural aftereffects of stop-errors. We examined oscillatory activity in the inter-trial interval as well as event-related potentials (ERP) in the next trial. Behavioral results speak against general adjustments after stop-errors as post-error behavioral changes could be attributed to stimulus or response repetitions. This corresponded with ERP effects in the next trial with only the visual N1 showing an effect of previous trial type and both N2 and P3 showing an effect of stimulus repetition. During the inter-trial interval, we observed stronger and later occipital alpha power increase after stop-errors compared to go- or inhibited trials. Errors also elicited enhanced frontal beta power relative to stop-trials and by trend to correct go-trials, which largely returned to baseline before the onset of the next trial. These transient changes in the neural aftereffects of stop-errors might be related to previous behavioral observations of PES after short, but not long response-stimulus intervals.

Orbitofrontal and Insular Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Orbitofrontal; Insula; Seizures; Epilepsy; Intracranial EEG; Neocortical	SURGICAL-TREATMENT; LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; ORIGIN; CORTEX	Purpose: Orbitofrontal and insular epilepsy are difficult to recognize because clinical presentations are variable and surgical approaches remain difficult. Methods: Literature review and review of our own case series including selected cases regarding the clinical manifestation and diagnostic utility of diagnostic tests in orbitofrontal and insular epilepsy. Results: Orbitofrontal epilepsy presents with either frontal lobe type seizures with hypermotor automatism or temporal lobe type seizures with oroalimentary and manual automatisms depending on the spread pattern. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and other functional imaging can be helpful, but intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) are still required to identify orbitofrontal seizure onset. Insular epilepsy presents with throat constriction and unilateral paresthesias. Preoperative functional imaging methods can be helpful, but exploration of the insula is required to identify unequivocal insular onset. Intracranial EEG in the insula can be performed safely and should be considered in atypical temporal lobe cases. Conclusions: Intracranial EEG remains the main diagnostic modality to identify orbitofrontal and insular epilepsy. Newer diagnostic modalities such as high-frequency oscillations, EEG, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnet resonance spectroscopy, and magnet source imaging need to be examined further to establish their diagnostic utility.

Methods: Scalp EEG data were recorded from 26 healthy subjects under tonic cold pain (CP) and no-pain control (NP) conditions. EEG power spectra and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) localized EEG cortical sources were compared between the two conditions in five frequency bands: 1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz, 12-18 Hz and 18-30 Hz. Results: In line with the EEG power spectral results, the source power significantly differed between the CP and NP conditions in 8-12 Hz (CP < NP) and 18-30 Hz (CP > NP) in extensive brain regions. Besides, there were also significantly different 4-8 Hz and 12-18 Hz source activities between the two conditions. Among the significant source activities, the left medial frontal and left superior frontal 4-8 Hz activities, the anterior cingulate 8-12 Hz activity and the posterior cingulate 12-18 Hz activity showed significant negative correlations with subjective pain ratings. Conclusions: The brain's perception of tonic cold pain was characterized by cortical source power changes across different frequency bands in multiple brain regions. Oscillatory activities that significantly correlated with subjective pain ratings were found in the prefrontal and cingulate regions. Significance: These findings may offer useful measures for objective pain assessment and provide a basis for pain treatment by modulation of neural oscillations at specific frequencies in specific brain regions.

Several studies indicated that orexins play a crucial role in the sleep-wake regulation and in the pathomechanism of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. As no data are available related to the EEG effects of orexin A in healthy, freely moving rats, the aim of the present experiments was to analyze EEG power changes in the generally used frequency bands after intracerebroventricular orexin A administration. Orexin A administration (0.84 and 2.8 nM/rat) differently affected fronto-occipital EEG waves in the different frequency bands recorded for 24 hours. Delta (1-4 Hz) and alpha (10-16 Hz) power decreased, while theta (4-10 Hz) and beta (16-48 Hz) power increased. Decrease of the delta power was followed by a rebound in case of the higher orexin A dose. This complex picture might be explained by the activation of several systems by the orexin A administration. Among these systems, cortical and thalamic circuits as well as the role of the neurons containing corticotrophin-releasing factor might be of significant importance.

These comprise increased delta and theta power and the emergence of alpha oscillations over frontal regions. In this study we use a meanfield model of the thalamo-cortical system to reproduce these changes and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the EEG and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. Specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands. The model suggests that the.;e changes are brought about through increased inhibition within local cortical interneuron circuits. These results are encouraging and motivate more extensive use of neural meanfield models in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological agents on macroscopic brain dynamics.

Interictal high frequency oscillations in an animal model of infantile spasms	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Infantile spasms; TTX; High frequency oscillations; EEG	HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; EEG FAST ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; CORTEX; HZ; RECORDINGS; SEIZURES; NETWORK; SPIKES; ONSET	While infantile spasms is the most common catastrophic epilepsy of infancy and early-childhood, very little is known about the basic mechanisms responsible for this devastating disorder. In experiments reported here, spasms were induced in rats by the chronic infusion of TTX into the neocortex beginning on postnatal days 10-12. Studies of focal epilepsy suggest that high frequency EEG oscillations (HFOs) occur interictally at sites that are most likely responsible for seizure generation. Thus, our goal was to determine if HFOs occurred and where they occurred in cortex in the TTX model. We also undertook multiunit recordings to begin to analyze the basic mechanisms responsible for HFOs. Our results show that HFOs occur most frequently during hypsarrhythmia and NREM sleep and are most prominent contralateral to the TTX infusion site in the homotopic cortex and anterior to this region in frontal cortex. While HFOs were largest and most frequent in these contralateral regions, they were also commonly recorded synchronously across multiple and widely-spaced recordings sites. The amplitude and spatial distribution of interictal HFOs were found to be very similar to the high frequency bursts seen at seizure onset. However, the latter differed from the interictal events in that the high frequency activity was more intense at seizure onset. Microwire recordings showed that neuronal unit firing increased abruptly with the generation of HFOs. A similar increase in neuronal firing occurred at the onset of the ictal events. Taken together, results suggest that neocortical networks are abnormally excitable, particularly contralateral to TFX infusion, and that these abnormalities are not restricted to small areas of cortex. Multiunit firing coincident with HFOs is fully consistent with a neocortical hyperexcitability hypothesis particularly since they both occur at seizure onset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Neural synchronization between different brain regions is thought to be implicated in long-term memory consolidation by facilitating neural communication and by promoting neural plasticity. However, the majority of studies have focused their interest on intra-hippocampal, rhinal-hippocampal or cortico-hippocampal synchronization, while inter-hemispheric synchronization has been so far neglected. To clarify the features of spontaneous human hippocampal activity and to investigate inter-hemispheric hippocampal synchronization across vigilance states, pre-sleep wakefulness and nighttime sleep were recorded from right and left homologous hippocampal loci using stereo-EEG techniques. Hence, quantitative and interhemispheric coherence analyses of hippocampal activity across sleep and waking states were carried out. The results showed the presence of delta activity in human hippocampal spontaneous EEG also during wakefulness. The activity in the delta range exhibited a peculiar bimodal distribution, namely a low frequency non-oscillatory activity (up to 2 Hz) synchronized between hemispheres mainly during wake and REM sleep, and a faster oscillatory rhythm (2-4 Hz). The latter was less synchronized between the hippocampi and seemed reminiscent of animal RSA (rhythmic slow activity). Notably, the low-delta activity showed high inter-hemispheric hippocampal coherence during REM sleep and, to a lesser extent, during wakefulness, paralleled by a (unexpected) decrease of coherence during NREM sleep. Therefore, low-delta hippocampal state-dependent synchronization starkly contrasts with neocortical behavior in the same frequency range.

The Brain Matures with Stronger Functional Connectivity and Decreased Randomness of Its Network	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; WHITE-MATTER; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; EEG COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTEX; VOLUME	We investigated the development of the brain's functional connectivity throughout the life span (ages 5 through 71 years) by measuring EEG activity in a large population-based sample. Connectivity was established with Synchronization Likelihood. Relative randomness of the connectivity patterns was established with Watts and Strogatz' (1998) graph parameters C (local clustering) and L (global path length) for alpha (similar to 10 Hz), beta (similar to 20 Hz), and theta (similar to 4 Hz) oscillation networks. From childhood to adolescence large increases in connectivity in alpha, theta and beta frequency bands were found that continued at a slower pace into adulthood (peaking at similar to 50 yrs). Connectivity changes were accompanied by increases in L and C reflecting decreases in network randomness or increased order (peak levels reached at similar to 18 yrs). Older age (55+) was associated with weakened connectivity. Semi-automatically segmented T1 weighted MRI images of 104 young adults revealed that connectivity was significantly correlated to cerebral white matter volume (alpha oscillations: r = 33, p<01; theta: r = 22, p<05), while path length was related to both white matter (alpha: max. r = 38, p<001) and gray matter (alpha: max. r = 36, p<001; theta: max. r = 36, p<001) volumes. In conclusion, EEG connectivity and graph theoretical network analysis may be used to trace structural and functional development of the brain.	[Smit, Dirk J.

These brain states are the result of balanced coordination between integrating and segregating activities of different lobes through rhythmic oscillations. Such coordination has been studied in recent times through synchronization of EEG signals generated from different lobes. In this paper, the authors have considered Synchronization Likelihood (SL) to measure the synchronization or integration between the lobes. The synchronization information is stored in SL matrix and the principal components of an SL matrix have been used to represent the state of brain at any instant. Finally, the time series of weight vectors corresponding to the principal components of SL matrices at each time point has been used to classify different states of brain at different stages of a sleep deprived experiment.

While initiation of the active cortical states during sleep slow oscillation has been intensively studied, the biological mechanisms which drive the network transition from an active state to silence remain poorly understood. In the current study, using a combination of in vivo electrophysiology and thalamocortical network simulation, we explored the impact of intrinsic and synaptic inhibition on state transition during sleep slow oscillation. We found that in normal physiological conditions, synaptic inhibition controls the duration and the synchrony of active state termination. The decline of interneuron-mediated inhibition led to asynchronous downward transition across the cortical network and broke the regular slow oscillation pattern. Furthermore, in both in vivo experiment and computational modelling, we revealed that when the level of synaptic inhibition was reduced significantly, it led to a recovery of synchronized oscillations in the form of seizure-like bursting activity. In this condition, the fast active state termination was mediated by intrinsic hyperpolarizing conductances. Our study highlights the significance of both intrinsic and synaptic inhibition in manipulating sleep slow rhythms.

As beta-band EEG activity has been previously postulated to indicate attentional modulation in the visual system, we searched for possible deficits in beta power in elderly subjects performing an attentional task with spatial differentiation between visual stimuli. We found that in older adults a lower level of beta activity correlated with decreased behavioral performance. As compared to young subjects, older adults expressed decreased activation in beta band during an attentional task, which displayed two different dynamics during the anticipatory period. Those dynamics were accompanied by one of two different behavioral pattern deficits. We hypothesize that one group of elderly participants suffered from difficulty in the activation of attentional processes (alertness deficits), while the other from difficulty in sustaining those processes (vigilance deficits).

Self-Correlations of Electroencephalograms	COMPLEX SYSTEMS			English	Article								A susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) cellular automaton model for collective neural interactions proposed recently is revisited. In this model, neurons are simple network nodes with different states: active or firing, and quiescent. The main thesis of this approach is that the electroencephalogram (EEG) could emerge as the fluctuations in the number of firing neurons. In this framework, EEG is understood as a statistical epiphenomenon. In this paper, the mean number of active sites and the self-correlation function both in the SIS stochastic model and in elementary cellular automata (ECAs) are considered. Damped oscillatory relaxation to the stationary state is found both in the SIS model and in ECA rule 30; periodic oscillations are found for other class 3 and class 4 cellular automata. A statistical analysis of the self-correlations in real EEG shows that the damped oscillatory relaxations are found both in delta and alpha waves. The normalized amplitude of these correlations is predicted by cellular automata models. This reinforces the view of the brain as a highly complex cellular automata system.

Older people exhibit less slow-wave and spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, together with attenuated levels of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as compared to young individuals. However, the extent to which these age-related changes in sleep impact on dream processing remains largely unknown. Here we investigated NREM and REM sleep EEG activity prior to dream recall and no recall in 17 young (2031 years) and 15 older volunteers (5774 years) during a 40 h multiple nap protocol. Dream recall was assessed immediately after each nap. During NREM sleep prior to dream recall, older participants displayed higher frontal EEG delta activity (13 Hz) and higher centro-parietal sigma activity (1215 Hz) than the young volunteers. Conversely, before no recall, older participants had less frontal-central delta activity and less sigma activity in frontal, central and parietal derivations than the young participants. REM sleep was associated to age-related changes, such that older participants had less frontal-central alpha (1012 Hz) and beta (1619 Hz) activity, irrespective of dream recall and no recall. Our data indicate that age-related differences in dream recall seem to be directly coupled to specific frequency and topography EEG patterns, particularly during NREM sleep. Thus, the spectral correlates of dreaming can help to understand the cortical pathways of dreaming.

To elucidate sleep functions related to motor memory consolidation, sleep EEG spectral analysis was performed for each recorded sleep stage. Sixteen female college students practiced juggling in the morning, and were tested immediately afterward. Eight of the subjects took a 2-hour nap after practice juggling (nap group), while another 8 stayed awake (control group). Juggling performance was then re-tested in the evening. Juggling performance improved after the 2-hour nap, while subjects in the control group did not show improvement. Slow oscillation, delta wave, and sigma wave EEG spectral power all increased significantly during non-REM sleep, especially during slow-wave sleep, after the post-motor learning nap (mNap) compared to an earlier baseline nap that preceded learning the task. Such EEG alterations have been suggested to relate to explicit declarative (hippocampus-dependent) memory consolidation; however, motor learning is considered to rely upon implicit procedural memory. We found that while sleep facilitated the consolidation of motor memory similar to that following real sport activities, the alterations in sleep EEG suggest that the initial motor learning of complex, highly coordinated 3-ball cascade juggling may involve substantial use of explicit memory.

Therefore, most prior studies focused on the role of synchronization for episodic memory, as reflected in theta (similar to 5Hz) and gamma (>40 Hz) power increases. These studies, however, neglect the role that is played by neural desynchronization, which is usually reflected in power decreases in the alpha and beta frequency band (8-30 Hz). In this paper we present a first idea, derived from information theory that gives a mechanistic explanation of how neural desynchronization aids human memory encoding and retrieval. Thereby we will review current studies investigating the role of alpha and beta power decreases during long-term memory tasks and show that alpha and beta power decreases play an important and active role for human memory. Applying mathematical models of information theory, we demonstrate that neural desynchronization is positively related to the richness of information represented in the brain, thereby enabling encoding and retrieval of long-term memories. This information via desynchronization hypothesis makes several predictions, which can be tested in future experiments.

Development of hypersynchrony in the cortical network during chemoconvulsant-induced epileptic seizures in vivo. J Neurophysiol 107: 1718-1730, 2012. First published December 21, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00327.2011.-The prevailing view of epileptic seizures is that they are caused by increased hypersynchronous activity in the cortical network. However, this view is based mostly on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings that do not directly monitor neuronal synchronization of action potential firing. In this study, we used multielectrode single-unit recordings from the hippocampus to investigate firing of individual CA1 neurons and directly monitor synchronization of action potential firing between neurons during the different ictal phases of chemoconvulsant-induced epileptic seizures in vivo. During the early phase of seizures manifesting as low-amplitude rhythmic beta-electrocorticography (ECoG) activity, the firing frequency of most neurons markedly increased. To our surprise, the average overall neuronal synchronization as measured by the cross-correlation function was reduced compared with control conditions with similar to 60% of neuronal pairs showing no significant correlated firing. However, correlated firing was not uniform and a minority of neuronal pairs showed a high degree of correlated firing. Moreover, during the early phase of seizures, correlated firing between 9.8 +/- 5.1% of all stably recorded pairs increased compared with control conditions. As seizures progressed and high-frequency ECoG polyspikes developed, the firing frequency of neurons further increased and enhanced correlated firing was observed between virtually all neuronal pairs. These findings indicated that epileptic seizures represented a hyperactive state with widespread increase in action potential firing. Hypersynchrony also characterized seizures. However, it initially developed in a small subset of neurons and gradually spread to involve the entire cortical network only in the later more intense ictal phases.

Tackling creativity at its roots: Evidence for different patterns of EEG alpha activity related to convergent and divergent modes of task processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Creativity; Alpha synchronization; Divergent thinking; Convergent thinking	SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; BAND; NEUROSCIENCE; ACTIVATION; ERS	The distinction between convergent and divergent cognitive processes given by Guilford (1956) had a strong influence on the empirical research on creative thinking. Neuroscientific studies typically find higher event-related synchronization in the EEG alpha rhythm for individuals engaged in creative ideation tasks compared to intelligence-related tasks. This study examined, whether these neurophysiological effects can also be found when both cognitive processing modes (convergent vs. divergent) are assessed by means of the same task employing a simple variation of instruction. A sample of 55 participants performed the alternate uses task as well as a more basic word association task while EEG was recorded. On a trial-by-trial basis, participants were either instructed to find a most common solution (convergent condition) or a most uncommon solution (divergent condition). The answers given in the divergent condition were in both tasks significantly more original than those in the convergent condition. Moreover, divergent processing was found to involve higher task-related EEG alpha power than convergent processing in both the alternate uses task and the word association task. EEG alpha synchronization can hence explicitly be associated with divergent cognitive processing rather than with general task characteristics of creative ideation tasks. Further results point to a differential involvement of frontal and parietal cortical areas by individuals of lower versus higher trait creativity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Towards non-invasive multi-unit spike recordings: Mapping 1 kHz EEG signals over human somatosensory cortex	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High-frequency EEG; Low-noise EEG acquisition system; Somatosensory cortex; Non-invasive electrophysiology	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; 600 HZ; EVOKED POTENTIALS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; SCALP RESPONSES; SEP COMPONENTS; GENERATORS; BURSTS; LOCALIZATION; STIMULATION	Objective: Scalp-derived human somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) contain high-frequency oscillations (600 Hz; 'sigma-burst') reflecting concomitant bursts of spike responses in primary somatosensory cortex that repeat regularly at 600 Hz. Notably, recent human intracranial SEP have revealed also 1 kHz responses ('kappa-burst'), possibly reflecting non-rhythmic spiking summed over multiple cells (MUA: multi-unit activity). However, the non-invasive detection of EEG signals at 1 kHz typical for spikes has always been limited by noise contributions from both, amplifier and body/electrode interface. Accordingly, we developed a low-noise recording set-up optimised to map non-invasively 1 kHz SEP components. Methods: SEP were recorded upon 4 Hz left median nerve stimulation in 6 healthy human subjects. Scalp potentials were acquired inside an electrically and magnetically shielded room using low-noise custommade amplifiers. Furthermore, in order to reduce thermal Johnson noise contributions from the sensor/skin interface, electrode impedances were adjusted to <= 1 k Omega. Responses averaged after repeated presentation of the stimulus (n = 4000 trials) were evaluated by spatio-temporal pattern analyses in complementary spectral bands. Results: Three distinct spectral components were identified: N20 (<100 Hz), sigma-burst (450-750 Hz), and kappa-burst (850-1200 Hz). The two high-frequency bursts (sigma, kappa) exhibited distinct and partially independent spatiotemporal evolutions, indicating subcortical as well as several cortical generators. Conclusions: Using a dedicated low-noise set-up, human SEP 'kappa-bursts' at 1 kHz can be non-invasively detected and their scalp distribution be mapped. Their topographies indicate a set of subcortical/cortical generators, at least partially distinct from the topography of the 600 Hz sigma-bursts described previously. Significance: The non-invasive detection and surface mapping of 1 kHz EEG signals presented here provides an essential step towards non-invasive monitoring of multi-unit spike activity.

There are at least 3-4 phase/time-locked gamma responses within the 28-45-Hz frequency window. Late responses starting around 300 ms are probably responses that are conveyed over reticular formation, hippocampus, etc., whereas the early response in the primary occipital cortex O1 starting at 100 ms is most probably the direct response over the short pathway over lateral geniculate nucleus. Eigenvalues or nodes: It is remarkable that nodes or Eigenvalues are observed, despite the complexity of the pathways and the superposition of several oscillations. It appears that the event-related oscillations in the gamma band undergo an increasing frequency modulation. The time course in the first 200 ms has lower frequencies of approximately 28-30 Hz. With increasing time, the frequencies of these oscillations reach values of up to 46 Hz. The brain reacts within three-to-four frequency bands, depending on the modality of stimulation. In the context of quantum dynamics, the results are tentatively explained via the concept of eigenvalues.

In a previous study from our laboratory, the GABAergic drugs bicuculline (BIC) and muscimol (MUS) were microinjected into the deep layers of either the anterior SC (aSC) or the posterior SC (pSC) in animals of the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR) strain submitted to acoustic stimulation, in which simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of the aSC, pSC, SNPr and striatum was performed. Only MUS microinjected into the pSC blocked audiogenic seizures. In the present study, we expanded upon these previous results using the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) microinjected into the aSC and pSC in conjunction with quantitative EEG analysis (wavelet transform), in the search for mechanisms associated with the susceptibility of this inbred strain to acoustic stimulation. Our hypothesis was that the WAR strain would have different connectivity between specific subareas of the superior colliculus and the SNPr when compared with resistant Wistar animals and that these connections would lead to altered behavior of this network during audiogenic seizures. Wavelet analysis showed that the only treatment with an anticonvulsant effect was MUS microinjected into the pSC region, and this treatment induced a sustained oscillation in the theta band only in the SNPr and in the pSC. These data suggest that in WAR animals, there are at least two subcortical loops and that the one involved in audiogenic seizure susceptibility appears to be the pSC-SNPr circuit. We also found that WARs presented an increase in the number of FG + projections from the posterior SNPr to both the aSC and pSC (primarily to the pSC), with both acting as proconvulsant nuclei when compared with Wistar rats. We concluded that these two different subcortical loops within the basal ganglia are probably a consequence of the WAR genetic background. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the anticipation phase, differential activity was most prominent over midline electrodes and parieto-occipital sensors. Differences between non-reward- and reward-predicting cues were localized in the cuneus and later in the dorsal PCC, suggesting a modulation by potential reward information during early visual processing, followed by a coarse emotional evaluation of the cues. Oscillatory analysis revealed increased theta power after non-reward cues over fronto-central sites. In the beta range, power decreased with the magnitude of the potential reward and increased with reaction time, probably reflecting the influence of the striatal response to potential reward on the sensorimotor cortex. At reward delivery, negative prediction errors led to a larger mediofrontal negativity. The spatiotemporal evolution of reward processing was modulated by prediction error: whereas differences were located in PCC and putamen in the prediction error comparison, in the case of expected outcomes they were located in PCC, ACC and parahippocampal gyrus. In the oscillatory realm, theta power was largest following rewards and, in the case of non-rewards, was largest when these were unexpected. Higher beta activity following rewards was also observed in both modalities, but MEG additionally showed a significant power decrease for this condition over parieto-occipital sensors. Our results show how visual, limbic and striatal structures are involved in the different stages of reward anticipation and delivery, and how theta and beta oscillations have a prominent role in the processing of these stimuli.

Moreover, the increase of two EEG markers, alpha3/alpha2 and theta/gamma ratio, have been associated with, respectively, AD converter and non-AD converter subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objective: To study the association of prognostic EEG markers with specific GM changes of thalamus and basal ganglia in subjects with MCI to identify different MCI populations. Methods: 74 adult subjects with mild cognitive impairment underwent EEG recording and high resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The theta/gamma and alpha3/alpha2 ratio was computed for each subject. Three groups were obtained according to increasing tertile values of both alpha3/alpha2 and theta/gamma ratio. Gray matter density differences between groups were investigated using a voxel-based morphometry technique. Results: Subjects with higher a3/a2 ratios when compared to subjects with lower and middle a3/a2 ratios showed minor atrophy in the ventral stream of basal ganglia (head of caudate nuclei and accumbens nuclei bilaterally) and of the pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus; subjects with higher t/g ratio showed minor atrophy in putamina nuclei bilaterally than subjects with middle ratio.

The Impact of a Regular Blood Donation on the Hematology and EEG of Healthy Young Male Blood Donors	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG-DMN; Blood donation; Hb concentration; Regional spectral EEG field power	SEVERE ISOVOLEMIC ANEMIA; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; HUMAN BRAIN; HEMORRHAGE; MEMORY; OXYGEN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; HUMANS	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 400 ml whole blood donation on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) and hematology, not earlier reported in the literature. EEG activity was recorded from ten male blood donors (experiment group) before, during and after blood donation (i.e., 400 ml whole blood withdrawal). EEG topography and regional spectral field powers analyses were carried out via fast Fourier transformation. The venous hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was measured with a hematology analyzer. In the control investigation, 12 male age-matched volunteers (control group) were kept in semi-sitting position for the duration of a blood donation without actually vena puncture. The volunteers had no prior experiences of blood donation. Within the experiment group, post-donation Hb concentration decreased by 3.7% compared with the pre-donation Hb values (P < 0.01). Before blood donation, Hb concentration in control group was significantly higher compared to the experiment group (P < 0.05). For the experiment group, the field power of alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz) EEG during blood withdrawal was significantly lower compared to that after blood withdrawal (P < 0.05). In contrast for the control group, all seven bands of regional spectral field powers showed no significantly discrepancies in the three periods. Blood donation attenuates the alpha-1 at the parietal-frontal area on human EEG-DMN transiently with no lasting effect at post-donation period. The blood donation-related effects on brain function may be of little consequence due to slight hemodynamic change and the results may facilitate the opinion that blood donation is a safe process and that should not discourage volunteers.

Cross-conditional entropy and coherence analysis of pharmaco-EEG changes induced by alprazolam	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Pharmaco-EEG; Benzodiazepine; Alprazolam; Conditional entropy	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MUTUAL INFORMATION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPLEXITY; SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA; REGULARITY; BROMAZEPAM	Rationale Quantitative analysis of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) and their interpretation constitute a helpful tool in the assessment of the bioavailability of psychoactive drugs in the brain. Furthermore, psychotropic drug groups have typical signatures which relate biochemical mechanisms with specific EEG changes. Objectives To analyze the pharmacological effect of a dose of alprazolam on the connectivity of the brain during wakefulness by means of linear and nonlinear approaches. Methods EEG signals were recorded after alprazolam administration in a placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial. Nonlinear couplings assessed by means of corrected cross-conditional entropy were compared to linear couplings measured with the classical magnitude squared coherence. Results Linear variables evidenced a statistically significant drug-induced decrease, whereas nonlinear variables showed significant increases. All changes were highly correlated to drug plasma concentrations. The spatial distribution of the observed connectivity changes clearly differed from a previous study: changes before and after the maximum drug effect were mainly observed over the anterior half of the scalp. Additionally, a new variable with very low computational cost was defined to evaluate nonlinear coupling. This is particularly interesting when all pairs of EEG channels are assessed as in this study. Conclusions Results showed that alprazolam induced changes in terms of uncoupling between regions of the scalp, with opposite trends depending on the variables: decrease in linear ones and increase in nonlinear features. Maps provided consistent information about the way brain changed in terms of connectivity being definitely necessary to evaluate separately linear and nonlinear interactions.	[Alonso, J.

Also, both alcohol ingestion and hormonal variations during menstruation have been associated with characteristic changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether EEG activity during the performance of the Tower of London (TOL) task is affected by previous ingestion of alcohol and whether these EEG patterns vary in relation to different phases of the menstrual cycle. For this purpose, female participants consumed a moderate dose of alcohol or placebo during the follicular and early luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and then, 35 min after liquid ingestion, EEG activity was recorded during the performance of TOL. A deleterious effect of alcohol on TOL performance was potentiated in the follicular phase, related to a higher alpha 1 relative power, probably as a result of the low progesterone levels characteristic of this menstrual phase. These data show the feasibility of examining the interaction of alcohol and menstrual cycle phases on cognitive performance by means of EEG recording, and contribute toward a better understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie the cognitive changes that occur during the menstrual cycle under the effects of alcohol.

Moreover, the increase of a specific EEG (electroencephalogram) marker, alpha 3/alpha 2, have been associated with AD-converters subjects with MCI (mild cognitive impairment). To study the association of prognostic EEG markers with specific GM changes of thalamus and basal ganglia in subjects with MCI to detect biomarkers (morpho-physiological) early predictive of AD and non-AD dementia. Seventy-four adult subjects with MCI underwent EEG recording and high-resolution 3D MRI (three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging). The alpha 3/alpha 2 ratio was computed for each subject. Three groups were obtained according to increasing tertile values of alpha 3/alpha 2 ratio. GM density differences between groups were investigated using a VBM (voxel-based morphometry) technique. Subjects with higher alpha 3/alpha 2 ratios when compared with subjects with lower and middle alpha 3/alpha 2 ratios showed minor atrophy in the ventral stream of basal ganglia (head of caudate nuclei and accumbens nuclei bilaterally) and of the pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus; The integrated analysis of EEG and morpho-structural markers could be useful in the comprehension of anatomo-physiological underpinning of the MCI entity.

In this paper, a method composed of the mutual information method and Lempel-Ziv complexity method (MILZC) is proposed to investigate the effects of acupuncture on the complexity of information exchanges between different brain regions based on EEGs. In the experiments, eight subjects are manually acupunctured at 'Zusanli' acupuncture point (ST-36) with different frequencies (i.e., 50, 100, 150, and 200 times/min) and the EEGs are recorded simultaneously. First, MILZC values are compared in general. Then average brain connections are used to quantify the effectiveness of acupuncture under the above four frequencies. Finally, significance index P values are used to study the spatiality of the acupuncture effect on the brain. Three main findings are obtained: (i) MILZC values increase during the acupuncture; (ii) manual acupunctures (MAs) with 100 times/min and 150 times/min are more effective than with 50 times/min and 200 times/min; (iii) contralateral hemisphere activation is more prominent than ipsilateral hemisphere's. All these findings suggest that acupuncture contributes to the increase of brain information exchange complexity and the MILZC method can successfully describe these changes.

Since recently there were different types of developments in computer-aided EMG equipment, different methodologies in the time domain and frequency domain has been followed for quantitative analysis of EMG signals. In this study, the usefulness of the different feature extraction methods for describing MUP morphology is investigated. Besides, soft computing techniques were presented for the classification of intramuscular EMG signals. The proposed method automatically classifies the EMG signals into normal, neurogenic or myopathic. Also, multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN), dynamic fuzzy neural network (DFNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based classifiers were compared in relation to their accuracy in the classification of EMG signals. Concerning the impacts of features on the EMG signal classification, different results were obtained through analysis of the soft computing techniques. The comparative analysis suggests that the ANFIS modelling is superior to the DFNN and MLPNN in at least three points: slightly higher recognition rate; insensitivity to overtraining; and consistent outputs demonstrating higher reliability.

Nevertheless relatively little is known about how females process information acquired from males during mate selection. In the Emei music frog, Babina daunchina, males normally call from hidden burrows and females in the reproductive stage prefer male calls produced from inside burrows compared with ones from outside burrows. The present study evaluated changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) power output in four frequency bands induced by male courtship vocalizations on both sides of the telencephalon and mesencephalon in females. The results show that (1) both the values of left hemispheric theta relative power and global lateralization in the theta band are modulated by the sexual attractiveness of the acoustic stimulus in the reproductive stage, suggesting the theta oscillation is closely correlated with processing information associated with mate choice; (2) mean relative power in the beta band is significantly greater in the mesencephalon than the left telencephalon, regardless of reproductive status or the biological significance of signals, indicating it is associated with processing acoustic features and (3) relative power in the delta and alpha bands are not affected by reproductive status or acoustic stimuli. The results imply that EEG power in the theta and beta bands reflect different information processing mechanisms related to vocal recognition and auditory perception in anurans.

We propose a novel methodology to identify the different states of the epileptic brain, based on the topographic mapping of the time varying relative power of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency sub-bands, estimated from EEG. Using normalized-cuts segmentation algorithm, points of interest are identified in the topographic mappings and their trajectories over time are used for finding out relations with epileptogenic propagations in the brain. These trajectories are used to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which models the different epileptic brain states and the transition among them. Applied to 10 patients suffering from focal seizures, with a total of 30 seizures over 497.3 h of data, the methodology shows good results (an average point-by-point accuracy of 89.31%) for the identification of the four brain states - interictal, preictal, ictal and postictal. The results suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics captured by the proposed methodology are related to the epileptic brain states and transitions involved in focal seizures. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

The verification of these claims has mostly been experimental in nature, since a formal mathematical analysis is often intractable because of the sheer magnitude of the number (billions) of neurons in the brain. Consequently, a formal analysis of such models has only been achieved for 'small-scale systems' of neural networks (NNs). As opposed to this, the aim of this paper is to understand how we can model the brain as a so-called 'large-scale system' for analyzing various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, etc. In particular, we explore a large-scale NN model suitable for the piriform cortex which is acclaimed for its chaotic behavior from clinical experiments. In addition, the piriform cortex is easy to model because it appears to be 'almost independent' of other portions of the brain. To achieve this, we describe its behavior by moving the analysis from the time space into the phase space of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Although the model of the piriform cortex contains hundreds of variables, we utilize the concept that useful information can be extracted from a single EEG signal which, in turn, can be perceived as a time series computed from the artificial electrodes. Indeed, this transformation, i.e. from the time space of a time series to its corresponding phase space, is considered mandatory to extract the nonlinear characteristics related with chaos. By studying the piriform cortex model in this manner, we demonstrate that we can generate certain desirable phenomena by modifying some of the underlying control parameters. More specifically, we investigate the problem of density and strength, the problem of connectivity and the problem of stimulus frequency, and show their relevance to neurological conditions such as epilepsy and schizophrenia.

Temporal regularities could be used to predict the timing of upcoming events, thus facilitating their processing. Indeed, cognitive theories have long posited the existence of internal oscillators whose timing can be entrained to ongoing periodic stimuli in the environment as a mechanism of temporal attention. Recently, recordings from primate brains have shown electrophysiological evidence for these hypothesized internal oscillations. We hypothesized that rhythmic visual stimuli can entrain ongoing neural oscillations in humans, locking the timing of the excitability cycles they represent and thus enhancing processing of subsequently predictable stimuli. Here we report evidence for entrainment of neural oscillations by predictable periodic stimuli in the alpha frequency band and show for the first time that the phase of existing brain oscillations cannot only be modified in response to rhythmic visual stimulation but that the resulting phase-locked fluctuations in excitability lead to concomitant fluctuations in visual awareness in humans. This entrainment effect was dependent on both the amount of spontaneous alpha power before the experiment and the level of 12-Hz oscillation before each trial and could not be explained by evoked activity. Rhythmic fluctuations in awareness elicited by entrainment of ongoing neural excitability cycles support a proposed role for alpha oscillations as a pulsed inhibition of cortical activity. Furthermore, these data provide evidence for the quantized nature of our conscious experience and reveal a powerful mechanism by which temporal attention as well as perceptual snapshots can be manipulated and controlled.

Previous N200 speller was implemented at the scalp EEG level. Compared to scalp EEG, electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a broader frequency band that could be utilized in BCI. In this study, we investigated whether the high gamma brain activities recorded from human intracranial electrodes can enhance the performance of the subdural speller. The ERP and high gamma responses of one most task-related subdural electrode were used together for BCI classification and showed that high gamma responses did enhance the performance for the subdural visual motion speller resulted in an average increase of over 8% (p<0.05, paired t-test).

In health, variable effects of pain on attention have been observed, indicating alerting as well as distracting effects of pain. In the human brain, these effects are closely related to modulations of neuronal gamma oscillations. As hypervigilance as an abnormal increase of attention to external stimuli has been implicated in chronic pain states, we assumed both attentional performance and pain-induced gamma oscillations to be altered in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). We recorded electroencephalography from healthy subjects (n = 22) and patients with FMS (n = 19) during an attention demanding visual reaction time task. In 50% of the trials we applied painful laser stimuli. The results of self-assessment questionnaires confirm that patients with FMS consider themselves hypervigilant towards pain as compared to healthy controls. However, the experimental findings indicate that the effects of painful stimuli on attentional performance and neuronal gamma oscillations do not differ between patients and healthy subjects. We further found a significant correlation between the pain-induced modulation of visual gamma oscillations and the pain-induced modulation of reaction times. This relationship did not differ between groups either. These findings confirm a close relationship between gamma oscillations and the variable attentional effects of pain, which appear to be comparable in health and disease. Thus, our results do not provide evidence for a behavioral or neuronal manifestation of hypervigilance in patients with FMS.

Methods: Intracerebral EEGs were recorded in 17 patients with intractable focal seizures and normal MRIs. The rates of interictal HFOs and spikes inside and outside the SOZ were analyzed as well as the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of HFOs and spikes to determine the SOZ. Results: The mean rate of spikes, ripples and fast ripples (FR) was higher in the SOZ than in the non-SOZ channels. In regard to the identification of the SOZ the sensitivity was 91% for spikes, 91% for ripples and 66% for FR, the specificity was 30% for spikes, 42% for ripples and 80% for FR, and the accuracy was 44% for spikes, 54% for ripples and 76% for FR. Conclusions: The rates of spikes and HFOs were higher inside than outside the SOZ. However, HFOs are also more specific and accurate than spikes to delineate the SOZ. Significance: Analysis of interictal HFOs during 5-10 min of sleep recording is a good tool to localize the SOZ in patients with epilepsy and normal MRI, and could potentially reduce the duration of chronic intracerebral EEG recordings.

Here, we investigate, from a dynamic network perspective, how the cortical and cardiovascular systems behave during anesthesia by applying nonparametric spectral techniques to cortical electroencephalography, electrocardiogram and respiratory signals recorded from anesthetized rats under two drugs, ketamine-xylazine (KX) and pentobarbital (PB). We find that the patterns of low-frequency cortico-cardio-respiratory network interactions may undergo significant changes in network activity strengths and in number of network links at different depths of anesthesia dependent upon anesthetics used.

The EEG mu rhythm is a sensorimotor oscillation hypothesized to index simulation of some actions during perceptual processing of these actions. The purpose of this research was to extend the study of mu rhythm simulation responses during perceptual tasks to the domain of emotional face perception. Subjects viewed happy and disgusted face photos with empathy and non-empathy task instructions while EEG responses were measured. EEG components were isolated and analyzed using a blind source separation (BSS) method. Mu components were found to respond to the perception of happy and disgusted faces during both empathy and non-empathy tasks with an event-related desynchronization (ERD), activation that is consistent with face simulation. Significant differences were found between responses to happy and to disgusted faces across the right hemisphere mu components beginning about 500 ms after stimulus presentation. These findings support a simulation account of perceptual face processing based on a sensorimotor mirroring mechanism, and are the first report of distinct EEG mu responses to observation of positively and negatively valenced emotional faces.

We tested brain responsiveness to auditory stimulation in healthy controls (n=26), and in schizophrenia patients that frequently (n=18) or never (n=11) experienced AVH. Responsiveness was assessed by driving the EEG with click-tones at 20, 30 and 40 Hz. We compared stimulus induced EEG changes between groups using spectral amplitude maps and a global measure of phase-locking (GFS). As expected, the 40 Hz stimulation elicited the strongest changes. However, while controls and non-hallucinators increased 40 Hz EEG activity during stimulation, a left-lateralized decrease was observed in the hallucinators. These differences were significant (p=.02). As expected, GFS increased during stimulation in controls (p=.08) and non-hallucinating patients (p=.06), which was significant when combining the two groups (p=.01). In contrast, GFS decreased with stimulation in hallucinating patients (p=0.13), resulting in a significantly different GFS response when comparing subjects with and without AVH (p<.01). Our data suggests that normally, 40 Hz stimulation leads to the activation of a synchronized network representing the sensory input, but in hallucinating patients, the same stimulation partly disrupts on-going activity in this network.

Because of this unique strength relative to noninvasive hemodynamic-based measures (fMRI, PET), the complementary nature of hemodynamic and electrophysiological techniques is becoming more widely recognized (e.g., Human Connectome Project). However, the available analysis methods for solving the inverse problem for MEG and EEG have not been compared and standardized to the extent that they have for fMRI/PET. A number of factors, including the non-uniqueness of the solution to the inverse problem for MEG/EEG, have led to multiple analysis techniques which have not been tested on consistent datasets, making direct comparisons of techniques challenging (or impossible). Since each of the methods is known to have their own set of strengths and weaknesses, it would be beneficial to quantify them. Toward this end, we are announcing the establishment of a website containing an extensive series of realistic simulated data for testing purposes (http://cobre.mrn.org/megsim/). Here, we present: 1) a brief overview of the basic types of inverse procedures; 2) the rationale and description of the testbed created; and 3) cases emphasizing functional connectivity (e.g., oscillatory activity) suitable for a wide assortment of analyses including independent component analysis (ICA), Granger Causality/Directed transfer function, and single-trial analysis.

To elucidate the mechanisms of the cognitive system underlying face recognition, we investigated cerebral oscillations related to encoding in 'person identity nodes'. Methods: EEG was measured in nine healthy adults during perception of their own face, familiar face and unfamiliar face images. Results: Event-related synchronization (ERS) in theta, alpha and beta bands was initially induced in occipito-temporal areas within 0-200 ms of the presentation of facial stimuli. In addition, delta ERS over parietal and left temporal areas was greater in response to familiar faces around 0-800 ms compared with unfamiliar faces. Beta ERS over the right prefrontal area was significantly greater in response to a participant's own face compared with a familiar face at 400-800 ms post-stimulus. Conclusions: ERS within 0-200 ms reflects structural encoding of faces (i.e., N170 of the event related potential). Delta ERS within 0-800 ms suggests an association with memory retrieval. Beta ERS within 400-800 ms is consistent with the cortical areas reported to be strongly related to self-face perception in previous fMRI studies. Significance: The delta and beta bands ERS might provide an index of familiarity and self-recognition, respectively. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Altered and asymmetric default mode network activity in a "hypnotic virtuoso": An fMRI and EEG study	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Hypnosis; EEG; fMRI; Resting state; Default mode network	STATE FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HEART-RATE; HYPNOSIS; CONFLICT; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SUGGESTION	Very highly hypnotizable subjects are rare, easily induced, and able to manifest the whole spectrum of hypnotic phenomena, including post-hypnotic amnesia. The aim of this study was to detect and localize by means of quantitative functional MRI and EEG changes in cortical activity during hypnosis induction and deep "pure hypnosis" in a hypnotic "virtuoso" subject. We focused on areas forming the default mode network (DMN), since previous studies found that very highly suggestible subjects in hypnosis showed decreased activity in anterior DMN. During undisturbed hypnosis, our "virtuoso" subject showed not only detectable changes in DMN, but also peculiar activations of non-DMN areas and hemispheric asymmetries of frontal lobe connectivity. Our findings confirm that hypnosis is associated with significant modulation of connectivity and activity which involve the DMN but are not limited to it, depending on the depth of the hypnotic state, the type of mental content and emotional involvement.

Assessment of chemosensory function using electroencephalographic techniques	RHINOLOGY			English	Review						chemosensory event-related potentials; electroencephalogram; olfaction; trigeminal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODOR DISCRIMINATION; ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY; PREPYRIFORM CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG-RESPONSES; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; IDENTIFICATION	Electroencephalographic techniques are widely used to provide an objective evaluation of the chemosensory function and to explore neural mechanisms related to the processing of chemosensory events. The most popular technique to evaluate brain responses to chemosensory stimuli is across trial time-domain averaging to reveal chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERP) embedded within the ongoing EEG. Nevertheless, this technique has a poor signal-to-noise ratio and cancels out stimulus-induced changes in the EEG signal that are not strictly phased-locked to stimulus onset. The fact that consistent CSERP are not systematically identifiable in healthy subjects currently constitutes a major limitation to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of chemosensory dysfunction. In this review, we will review the different techniques related to the recording and identification of CSERP, discuss some of their limitations, and propose some novel signal processing methods which could be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of chemosensory event-related brain responses.

These findings have highlighted the potential for the development of simple brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as a diagnosis in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Objectives: This study here reviews current EEG-based BCIs that hold potential for assessing and eventually assisting patients with DoC. It highlights key areas for further development that might eventually make their application feasible in this challenging patient group. Methods: The major types of BCIs proposed in the literature are considered, namely those based on the P3 potential, sensorimotor rhythms, steady state oscillations and slow cortical potentials. In each case, a brief overview of the relevant literature is provided and then their relative merits for BCI applications in DoC are considered. Results: A range of BCI designs have been proposed and tested for enabling communication in fully conscious, paralysed patients. Although many of these have potential applicability for patients with DoC, they share some key challenges that need to be overcome, including limitations of stimulation modality, feedback, user training and consistency. Conclusion: Future work will need to address the technical and practical challenges facing reliable implementation at the patient's bedside.

Spindles are highly synchronous across the scalp in the electroencephalogram (EEG) but have low spatial coherence and exhibit low correlation with the EEG when simultaneously measured in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). We developed a computational model to explore the hypothesis that the spatial coherence spindles in the EEG is a consequence of diffuse matrix projections of the thalamus to layer 1 compared with the focal projections of the core pathway to layer 4 recorded in the MEG. Increasing the fanout of thalamocortical connectivity in the matrix pathway while keeping the core pathway fixed led to increased synchrony of the spindle activity in the superficial cortical layers in the model. In agreement with cortical recordings, the latency for spindles to spread from the core to the matrix was independent of the thalamocortical fanout but highly dependent on the probability of connections between cortical areas.

We assessed whether multiple variables related to self-regulation (perceived mental effort) emotional states (e.g., anxiety, stress, etc.) and motivational states (e.g., boredom, engagement, etc.) may co-occur or interact with frontal attentional processing probed in two matched-samples of fourteen lower-SES and higher-SES adolescents. ERP and EEG activation were measured during a task probing selective attention to sequences of tones. Pre- and post-task salivary cortisol and self-reported emotional states were also measured. At similar behavioural performance level, the higher-SES group showed a greater ERR differentiation between attended (relevant) and unattended (irrelevant) tones than the lower-SES group. EEG power analysis revealed a cross-over interaction, specifically, lower-SES adolescents showed significantly higher theta power when ignoring rather than attending to tones, whereas, higher-SES adolescents showed the opposite pattern. Significant theta asymmetry differences were also found at midfrontal electrodes indicating left hypo-activity in lower-SES adolescents. The attended vs. unattended difference in right midfrontal theta increased with individual SES rank, and (independently from SES) with lower cortisol task reactivity and higher boredom. Results suggest lower-SES children used additional compensatory resources to monitor/control response inhibition to distracters, perceiving also more mental effort, as compared to higher-SES counterparts. Nevertheless, stress, boredom and other task-related perceived states were unrelated to SES. Ruling out presumed confounds, this study confirms the midfrontal mechanisms responsible for the SES effects on selective attention reported previously and here reflect genuine cognitive differences.

We describe a sequence of fixation-event related potentials (fERPs) that unfolds during similar to 400 ms following each fixation. This sequence highly resembles the event-related responses in a replay experiment, in which subjects kept fixation while a sequence of images occurred around the fovea simulating the spatial and temporal patterns during the free viewing experiment. Similar responses were also observed in a second control experiment where the appearance of stimuli was controlled by the experimenters and presented at the center of the screen. We also observed a relatively early component (similar to 150 ms) that distinguished between targets and distractors only in the freeviewing condition. We present a novel approach to match the critical properties of two conditions (targets/distractors), which can be readily adapted to other paradigms to investigate EEG components during free eye-movements.

Less research has been conducted investigating how scientific concepts are learned and further processed in working memory. To bridge this gap, the present study investigated human brain dynamics associated with encoding of physics concepts, taking both presentation modality and concreteness into account. Results of this study revealed greater theta and low-beta synchronization in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during encoding of concrete pictures as compared to the encoding of both high and low imageable words. In visual brain areas, greater theta activity accompanying stimulus onsets was observed for words as compared to pictures while stronger alpha suppression was observed in responses to pictures as compared to words. In general, the EEG oscillation patterns for encoding words of different levels of abstractness were comparable but differed significantly from encoding of pictures. These results provide insights into the effects of modality of presentation on human encoding of scientific concepts and thus might help in developing new ways to better teach scientific concepts in class.

An ensemble system for automatic sleep stage classification using single channel EEG signal	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Recursive feature elimination; Sleep staging; Support vector machine	POSITIVE LYAPUNOV EXPONENT; CORRELATION DIMENSION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; QUANTIFICATION; ENTROPY; APNEA; DISCRIMINATION; SELECTION; HEALTH	The present work aims at automatic identification of various sleep stages like, sleep stages 1, 2, slow wave sleep (sleep stages 3 and 4), REM sleep and wakefulness from single channel EEG signal. Automatic scoring of sleep stages was performed with the help of pattern recognition technique which involves feature extraction, selection and finally classification. Total 39 numbers of features from time domain, frequency domain and from non-linear analysis were extracted. After extraction of features, SVM based recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique was used to find the optimum number of feature subset which can provide significant classification performance with reduced number of features for the five different sleep stages. Finally for classification, binary SVMs were combined with one-against-all (OAA) strategy. Careful extraction and selection of optimum feature subset helped to reduce the classification error to 8.9% for training dataset, validated by k-fold cross-validation (CV) technique and 10.61% in the case of independent testing dataset. Agreement of the estimated sleep stages with those obtained by expert scoring for all sleep stages of training dataset was 0.877 and for independent testing dataset it was 0.8572. The proposed ensemble SVM-based method could be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for sleep staging with the advantage of reducing stress and burden imposed on subjects.

Based on laboratory (Study 1) and home sleep records (Study II) here we report WS-related features of the patterns of antero-posterior 8-16 Hz non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep EEG power distributions. Participants in Study I were 9 WS and 9 typically developing (TD) controls matched for age (14-29 years) and sex, and sleeping for two consecutive nights in the laboratory. WS participants were characterized by region-independent decreases in 10.50-12.50 Hz and central increases in 14.75-15.75 Hz EEG power. Region-independent decreases and increases in z-scores of the spectra were observed in the 10.25-12.25 Hz and 14-16 Hz ranges, respectively. Moreover, in the EEG spectra of participants with WS a lower probability for the emergence of a frontally dominant peak was observed. Parietal fast sigma peaks and the antero-posterior shifts in power distributions were of higher frequencies in WS (similar to 1 Hz difference). A 1 year follow-up of 9 WS and 3 TD participants, as well as their inclusion into larger samples (20 WS and 20 TD, age: 6-29 years) of a two-night ambulatory home polysomnography study confirmed the WS-specific decrease in alpha/low sigma power (8-11.75 Hz) and the pattern of z-score differences (decreases: 8.50-11.25 Hz; increases: 13.5-14 Hz), including the antero-posterior shifts in power distribution (0.5 Hz) and some features of the spectral peaks. Altogether these data suggest a decrease in alpha/low sigma power, as well as a redistribution of NREM sleep 8-16 Hz EEG power toward the higher frequencies and/or a higher frequency of NREM sleep thalamocortical oscillations in WS.

MeCP2+/- mouse model of RTT reproduces auditory phenotypes associated with Rett syndrome and replicate select EEG endophenotypes of autism spectrum disorder	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Sensory evoked potential; SEP; Auditory evoked potential; AEP; ERP; MeCP2; Preclinical model; Mouse; Gamma oscillation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STEM RESPONSE FINDINGS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN-STEM; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; MUTANT MICE; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION	Impairments in cortical sensory processing have been demonstrated in Rett syndrome (RTT) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and are thought to contribute to high-order phenotypic deficits. However, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for these abnormalities are unknown. This study investigated auditory sensory processing in a mouse model of RTT with a heterozygous loss of MeCP2 function. Cortical abnormalities in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD are reflected in auditory evoked potentials and fields measured by EEG and MEG. One of these abnormalities, increased latency of cortically sourced components, is associated with language and developmental delay in autism. Additionally, gamma-band abnormalities have recently been identified as an endophenotype of idiopathic autism. Both of these cortical abnormalities are potential clinical endpoints for assessing treatment. While ascribing similar mechanisms of idiopathic ASD to Rett syndrome (RTT) has been controversial, we sought to determine if mouse models of RTT replicate these intermediate phenotypes. Mice heterozygous for the null mutations of the gene MeCP2, were implanted for EEG. In response to auditory stimulation, these mice recapitulated specific latency differences as well as select gamma and beta band abnormalities associated with ASD. MeCP2 disruption is the predominant cause of RTT, and reductions in MeCP2 expression predominate in ASD. This work further suggests a common cortical pathophysiology for RTT and ASD, and indicates that the MeCP2+/- model may be useful for preclinical development targeting specific cortical processing abnormalities in RTT with potential relevance to ASD.

Investigating the Neural Correlates of Pathological Cortical Networks in Alzheimer's Disease Using Heterogeneous Neuronal Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease (AD); computational models; EEG; functional deficits; structural impairment	DECREASED EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; AMYLOID PEPTIDE; DYNAMICS; DEATH	This paper describes an investigation into the pathophysiological causes of abnormal cortical oscillations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using two heterogeneous neuronal network models. The effect of excitatory circuit disruption on the beta band power (13-30 Hz) using a conductance-based network model of 200 neurons is assessed. Then, the neural correlates of abnormal cortical oscillations in different frequency bands based on a larger network model of 1000 neurons consisting of different types of cortical neurons are also analyzed. EEG studies in AD patients have shown that beta band power (13-30 Hz) decreased in the early stages of the disease with a parallel increase in theta band power (4-7 Hz). This abnormal change progresses with the later stages of the disease but with decreased power spectra in other fast frequency bands plus an increase in delta band power (1-3 Hz). Our results show that, despite the heterogeneity of the network models, the beta band power is significantly affected by excitatory neural and synaptic loss. Second, the results of modeling a functional impairment in the excitatory circuit shows that beta band power exhibits the most decrease compared with other bands. Previous biological experiments on different types of cultural excitatory neurons show that cortical neuronal death is mediated by dysfunctional ionic behavior that might specifically contribute to the pathogenesis of beta-amyloid-peptide-induced neuronal death in AD. Our study also shows that beta band power was the first affected component when the modeled excitatory circuit begins to lose neurons and synapses.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in clinical epilepsy	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Epilepsy; Ripple; Fast ripple; EEG; Seizure; Infantile spasms	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURE ONSET ZONE; INTERICTAL SPIKES; 80-500 HZ; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FOCAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INVASIVE RECORDINGS	Epilepsy is one of the most frequent neurological diseases. In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500 Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability.

J	Rawle, CJ; Miall, RC; Praamstra, P				Rawle, Christian J.; Miall, R. Chris; Praamstra, Peter			Frontoparietal theta activity supports behavioral decisions in movement-target selection	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						movement preparation; reaching; motor cortex; parietal cortex; theta oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; CORTICAL MECHANISMS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EEG; PARIETAL; MOTOR; PREMOTOR; CORTEX; ALPHA	There is recent EEG evidence describing task-related changes of theta power in spatial attention and reaching/pointing tasks. Here, we aim to better characterize this theta activity and determine whether it is associated with visuospatial memory or with visuospatial selection functions of the frontoparietal cortex. We recorded EEG from 20 participants during a movement precuing task with center-out joystick movements. Precues displayed 1, 2, or 4 potential targets and were followed (stimulus onset asynchrony 1.2 s) by a central response cue indicating the movement-target. Remembering the precued target location(s) was mandatory in one and optional in a second version of the task. Analyses evaluated two slow brain potentials (CNV, contingent negative variation and CDA, contralateral delay activity) and task-related power changes. Results showed a differential modulation of frontal CNV and parietal CDA, consistent with earlier described set-size effects on motor preparation and visual short-term memory. Short-lived phases of theta event-related synchronization (ERS) were found 150500 ms after precue and response cue presentation, exhibiting parietal and frontal maxima. The increase of frontoparietal theta power following response cue presentation was strongly modulated by target load, i.e., absent for 1-target (when the movement-target could be selected in advance), contrasting with a robust 2050% ERS response in 2- and 4-target conditions. The scalp distribution, the timing, and the modulation by set-size suggest a role of theta activity in movement-target selection. The results support a recently proposed view of theta as emerging around behavioral decision points, linked to the evaluation of choice-relevant information.

Time-frequency analysis, based on Morlet wavelet transform together with 2D spectral power topography were applied to demonstrate different brain dynamics in subjects being acupunctured as compared to controls. A significant decrease of delta activity in right hemisphere together with an increase of alpha activity in central areas was observed in subjects who underwent acupuncture which may indicate the modulatory effects of electro-acupuncture as a treatment to improve the conditions of opioid dependency.

Pitfalls in the dipolar model for the neocortical EEG sources. J Neurophysiol 108: 956-975, 2012. First published April 25, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00098.2011.-For about six decades, primary current sources of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been assumed dipolar in nature. In this study, we used electro-physiological recordings from anesthetized Wistar rats undergoing repeated whisker deflections to revise the biophysical foundations of the EEG dipolar model. In a first experiment, we performed three-dimensional recordings of extracellular potentials from a large portion of the barrel field to estimate intracortical multipolar moments generated either by single spiking neurons (i.e., pyramidal cells, PC; spiny stellate cells, SS) or by populations of them while experiencing synchronized postsynaptic potentials. As expected, backpropagating spikes along PC dendrites caused dipolar field components larger in the direction perpendicular to the cortical surface (49.7 +/- 22.0 nA.mm). In agreement with the fact that SS cells have "close-field" configurations, their dipolar moment at any direction was negligible. Surprisingly, monopolar field components were detectable both at the level of single units (i.e., -11.7 +/- 3.4 nA for PC) and at the mesoscopic level of mixed neuronal populations receiving extended synaptic inputs within either a cortical column (-0.44 +/- 0.20 mu A) or a 2.5-m(3)-voxel volume (-3.32 +/- 1.20 mu A). To evaluate the relationship between the macroscopically defined EEG equivalent dipole and the mesoscopic intracortical multipolar moments, we performed concurrent recordings of high-resolution skull EEG and laminar local field potentials. From this second experiment, we estimated the time-varying EEG equivalent dipole for the entire barrel field using either a multiple dipole fitting or a distributed type of EEG inverse solution. We demonstrated that mesoscopic multipolar components are altogether absorbed by any equivalent dipole in both types of inverse solutions. We conclude that the primary current sources of the EEG in the neocortex of rodents are not precisely represented by a single equivalent dipole and that the existence of monopolar components must be also considered at the mesoscopic level.

Rapid fragmentation of neuronal networks at the onset of propofol-induced unconsciousness	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						electrophysiology; single units; GABA; cortical networks	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SLEEP; CONSCIOUSNESS; MECHANISMS; STATES; EEG; HUMANS; MODEL	The neurophysiological mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs cause loss of consciousness are poorly understood. Anesthetic actions at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels have been studied in detail at steady states of deep general anesthesia. However, little is known about how anesthetics alter neural activity during the transition into unconsciousness. We recorded simultaneous multiscale neural activity from human cortex, including ensembles of single neurons, local field potentials, and intracranial electrocorticograms, during induction of general anesthesia. We analyzed local and global neuronal network changes that occurred simultaneously with loss of consciousness. We show that propofol-induced unconsciousness occurs within seconds of the abrupt onset of a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation in the local field potential. This oscillation marks a state in which cortical neurons maintain local patterns of network activity, but this activity is fragmented across both time and space. Local (<4 mm) neuronal populations maintain the millisecond-scale connectivity patterns observed in the awake state, and spike rates fluctuate and can reach baseline levels. However, neuronal spiking occurs only within a limited slow oscillation-phase window and is silent otherwise, fragmenting the time course of neural activity. Unexpectedly, we found that these slow oscillations occur asynchronously across cortex, disrupting functional connectivity between cortical areas. We conclude that the onset of slow oscillations is a neural correlate of propofol-induced loss of consciousness, marking a shift to cortical dynamics in which local neuronal networks remain intact but become functionally isolated in time and space.

Human brain cortical correlates of short-latency afferent inhibition: a combined EEG-TMS study. J Neurophysiol 108: 314-323, 2012. First published March 28, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00796.2011.-When linking in time electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the excitability of the motor cortex can be modulated to evoke clear inhibition, as reflected by the amplitude decrement in the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). This specific property, designated short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), occurs when the nerve-TMS interstimulus interval (ISI) is approximately 25 ms and is considered to be a corticothalamic phenomenon. The aim of the present study was to use the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to navigated-TMS coregistration to better characterize the neuronal circuits underlying SAI. The present experimental set included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-navigated TMS and 60-channel TMS-compatible EEG devices. TMS-evoked EEG responses and MEPs were analyzed in eight healthy volunteers; ISIs between median nerve and cortical stimulation were determined relative to the latency of the individual N20 component of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) obtained after stimulation of the median nerve. ISIs from the latency of the N20 plus 3 ms and N20 plus 10 ms were investigated. In all experimental conditions, TMS-evoked EEG responses were characterized by a sequence of negative deflections peaking at approximately 7, 44, and 100 ms alternating with positive peaks at approximately 30, 60, and 180 ms post-TMS. Moreover, ISI N20 + 3 ms modulated both EEG-evoked activity and MEPs. In particular, it inhibited MEP amplitudes, attenuated cortical P60 and N100 responses, and induced motor cortex beta rhythm selective decrement of phase locking. The findings of the present experiment suggest the cortical origin of SAI that could result from the cortico-cortical activation of GABAergic-mediated inhibition onto the corticospinal neurons modulated by cholinergic activation able to reducing intralaminar inhibition and promoting intracolumnar inhibition.

One way of examining this issue is with the use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure changes in mu activation during the observation of yawns. Mu oscillations are seen in the alpha bandwidth of the EEG (8-12 Hz) over sensorimotor areas. Previous work has shown that mu suppression is a useful index of hMNS activation and is sensitive to individual differences in empathy. In two experiments, we presented participants with videos of either people yawning or control stimuli. We found greater mu suppression for yawns than for controls over right motor and premotor areas, particularly for those scoring higher on traits of empathy. In a third experiment, auditory recordings of yawns were compared against electronically scrambled versions of the same yawns. We observed greater mu suppression for yawns than for the controls over right lateral premotor areas. Again, these findings were driven by those scoring highly on empathy. The results from these experiments support the notion that the hMNS is involved in contagious yawning, emphasise the link between contagious yawning and empathy, and stress the importance of good control stimuli.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that ceftriaxone (CEF) robustly increases GLT-1 expression. In addition, physiological studies have shown that GLT-1 up-regulation strongly affects synaptic plasticity, and leads to an impairment of the prepulse inhibition, a simple form of information processing, thus suggesting that GLT-1 over-expression may lead to dysfunctions of large populations of neurons. To test this possibility, we assessed whether CEF affects cortical electrical activity by using chronic electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in male WKY rats. Spectral analysis showed that 8 days of CEF treatment resulted in a delayed reduction in EEG theta power (7-9 Hz) in both frontal and parietal derivations. This decrease peaked at day 10, i.e., 2 days after the end of treatment, and disappeared by day 16. In addition, we found that the same CEF treatment increased motor activity, especially when EEG changes are more prominent. Taken together, these data indicate that GLT-1 up-regulation, by modulating glutamatergic transmission, impairs the activity of widespread neural circuits. In addition, the increased motor activity and prepulse inhibition alterations previously described suggest that neural circuits involved in sensorimotor control are particularly sensitive to GLT-1 up-regulation.

OSCILLATORY POWER AND SYNCHRONY IN THE RAT FOREBRAIN ARE ALTERED BY A SENSITIZING REGIME OF D-AMPHETAMINE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						addiction; sensitization; prefrontal cortex; D-amphetamine; rat; local field potential	HIPPOCAMPAL TYPE-2 THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; PREPULSE INHIBITION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LATENT INHIBITION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; WORKING-MEMORY; INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION; DOPAMINE MODULATION	Repeated injections of psychostimulants, such as o-amphetamine (D-AMPH), provide a well-validated model of progressive cellular and systems-level alterations in brain function and behavior associated with addiction. The present study employed quantitative measures of both power spectral density and synchrony from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded simultaneously from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex (PAR), and hippocampus (HPC) in awake, behaving rats to assess changes in oscillations during different stages of D-AMPH-induced sensitization. The induction and development of sensitization altered the power of multiple frequency bands in a brain region-specific manner, whereas no changes were observed in animals treated with chronic saline. Specifically, the induction of sensitization to D-AMPH was accompanied by alterations in delta (2-5 Hz) and theta (5-11 Hz) oscillations similar to those observed in EEG recordings from addicted individuals describing craving and hedonic experience of the drug. Sensitization was also related to increased theta coherence between the PFC and HPC, along with suppression of cross-frequency correlations between theta and fast-gamma (65-100 Hz) in both the HPC and the PFC. Collectively, the present findings indicated the induction of a state in which the timing and synchronizing effects of oscillations are altered by sensitization to D-AMPH and are especially pronounced in the PFC. Furthermore, numerous LFP-derived measures were characterized that may serve as objective physiological correlates of pathological states observed in addiction. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Acoustically presented words were degraded in acoustic envelope and spectrum in an orthogonal design, and electroencephalogram responses in the frequency domain were analyzed in 24 participants, who rated word comprehensibility after each trial. First, the alpha power suppression during and after a degraded word depended monotonically on spectral and, to a lesser extent, envelope detail. The magnitude of this alpha suppression exhibited an additional and independent influence on later comprehension ratings. Second, source localization of alpha suppression yielded superior parietal, prefrontal, as well as anterior temporal brain areas. Third, multivariate classification of the time-frequency pattern across participants showed that patterns of late posterior alpha power allowed best for above-chance classification of word intelligibility. Results suggest that both magnitude and topography of late alpha suppression in response to single words can indicate a listener's sensitivity to acoustic features and the ability to comprehend speech under adverse listening conditions.

It is a fundamental mechanism of non-verbal communication, and it is essential for dynamic, online, interindividual synchronization during interactions. Here we aimed at investigating the oscillatory brain correlates of joint attention in a face-to-face paradigm where dyads of participants dynamically oriented their attention toward the same or different objects during joint and no-joint attention periods respectively. We also manipulated task instruction: in socially driven instructions, the participants had to follow explicitly their partner's gaze, while in color-driven instructions, the objects to be looked at were designated at by their color so that no explicit gaze following was required. We focused on oscillatory activities in the 10 Hz frequency range, where parieto-occipital alpha and the centro-parietal mu rhythms have been described, as these rhythms have been associated with attention and social coordination processes respectively. We tested the hypothesis of a modulation of these oscillatory activities by joint attention. We used dual-EEG to record simultaneously the brain activities of the participant dyads during our live, face-to-face joint attention paradigm. We showed that joint attention periods as compared to the no-joint attention periods-were associated with a decrease of signal power between 11 and 13 Hz over a large set of left centro-parieto-occipital electrodes, encompassing the scalp regions where alpha and mu rhythms have been described. This 11-13 Hz signal power decrease was observed independently of the task instruction: it was similar when joint versus no-joint attention situations were socially driven and when they were color-driven. These results are interpreted in terms of the processes of attention mirroring, social coordination, and mutual attentiveness associated with joint attention state.

J	Hartmann, T; Schlee, W; Weisz, N				Hartmann, Thomas; Schlee, Winfried; Weisz, Nathan			It's only in your head: Expectancy of aversive auditory stimulation modulates stimulus-induced auditory cortical alpha desynchronization	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory alpha; Tau rhythm; Auditory cortex; Expectancy; EEG	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; ATTENTION; FLUCTUATIONS; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; INCREASES	Increasing evidence underlines the functional importance of non-phase-locked cortical oscillatory rhythms. Among the different oscillations, alpha (8-12 Hz) has been shown to be modulated by anticipation or attention, suggesting a top-down influence. However, most studies to date have been conducted in the visual modality and the extent to which this notion also applies to the auditory cortex is unclear. It is furthermore often difficult to dissociate bottom-up from top-down contributions in cases of different stimuli (e.g., standards vs. deviants) or stimuli that are preceded by different cues. This study addresses these issues by investigating neuronal responses associated with intrinsically fluctuating perceptions of an invariant sound. Sixteen participants performed a pseudo-frequency-discrimination task in which a "high-pitch" tone was followed by an aversive noise, while the "low-pitch" tone was followed by silence. The participants had to decide which tone was presented even though the stimulus was actually kept constant while pseudo-randomized feedback was given. EEG data show that auditory cortical alpha power decreased by 20% in "high-pitch" trials relative to trials in which a "low pitch" was perceived. This study shows that expectancy of aversive feedback modulates perception of sounds and these fluctuating perceptions become manifest in modulations of sound-related alpha desynchronizations. Our findings extend recent evidence in the visual and somatosensory domain that alpha oscillations represent the excitatory/inhibitory balance of sensory cortical cell assemblies, which can be tuned in a top-down manner.

Methods: We characterize SSOs in a 51-year-old male with FFI carrying the D178N mutation and the methionine/methionine homozygosity at the polymorphic 129, codon of the PRNP gene and in eight gender and age-matched healthy controls. Polysomnographic (21 EEG electrodes, two consecutive nights) and volumetric- (Diffusion tensor imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging DTI MRI) evaluations were carried out for the patient in the middle course of the disease (five months after the onset of insomnia: disease duration: 10 months). We measured a set of features describing each SSO event: the wave shape, the event-origin location, the number and the location of all waves belonging to the event, and the grouping of spindle activity as a function of the SSO phase. Results: We found that the FFI individual showed a marked reduction of SSO event rate and wave morphological alterations as well as a significant reduction in grouping spindle activity, especially in frontal areas. These alterations paralleled DTI changes in the thalamus and the cingulate cortex. Conclusions: This work gives a quantitative picture of spontaneous SSO activity during the NREM sleep of a FFI individual. The results suggest that a thalamic neurodegeneration specifically alters the cortical expression of the SSO. This characterization also provides indications about cortico-thalamic interplays in SSO activity in humans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High-frequency oscillatory response to illusory contour in typically developing boys and boys with autism spectrum disorders	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; Kanizsa square; Autism spectrum disorder; Preschool children; Gamma oscillations	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; SUBJECTIVE CONTOURS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; WHITE-MATTER; PERCEPTION; SPECIFICITY; COHERENCE; CHILDREN	Illusory contour (IC) perception, a fruitful model for studying the automatic contextual integration of local image features, can be used to investigate the putative impairment of such integration in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We used the illusory Kanizsa square to test how the phase-locked (PL) gamma and beta electroencephalogram (EEG) responses of typically developing (TD) children aged 3-7 years and those with ASD were modulated by the presence of IC in the image. The PL beta and gamma activity strongly differentiated between IC and control figures in both groups of children (IC effect). However, the timing, topography, and direction of the IC effect differed in TD and ASD children. Between 40 msec and 120 msec after stimulus onset, both groups demonstrated lower power of gamma oscillations at occipital areas in response to IC than in response to the control figure. In TD children, this relative gamma suppression was followed by relatively higher parieto-occipital gamma and beta responses to IC within 120-270 msec after stimulus onset. This second stage of IC processing was absent in children with ASD. Instead, their response to IC was characterized by protracted (40-270 msec) relative reduction of gamma and beta oscillations at occipital areas. We hypothesize that children with ASD rely more heavily on lower-order processing in the primary visual areas and have atypical later stage related to higher-order processes of contour integration.

The choice of the estimation method is vital while extracting accurate PAC parameters from data. Two desired properties of PAC estimators are reliability and computational efficiency. This study offers a methodology called normalized direct PAC (ndPAC) for the rapid and statistically reliable estimation of PAC strength. A plain confidence limit formula, depending solely on data length and confidence level, is derived. Confidence level derivation is validated numerically. It is shown through simulations that ndPAC exhibits high specificity and sensitivity performances. The suggested methodology is also demonstrated on monkey electrocorticogram recorded during a visual task.

This study aimed to improve short term memory performance by individual alpha neurofeedback training (NFT). With appropriate protocol designed for NET, the experimental results showed that the participants were able to learn to increase the relative amplitude in individual alpha band during NFT and short term memory performance was significantly enhanced by 20 sessions of NFT. More importantly, further analysis revealed that the improvement of short term memory was positively correlated with the increase of the relative amplitude in the individual upper alpha band during training. In addition, effective strategies for individual alpha training varied among individuals and the most successful mental strategies were related to positive thinking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A neurophysiological-metabolic model for burst suppression	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; MITOCHONDRIAL OSCILLATIONS; HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK; OHTAHARA-SYNDROME; BRAIN PROTECTION; ALTERED STATES; EEG; HYPOTHERMIA; PHYSIOLOGY	Burst suppression is an electroencepholagram (EEG) pattern in which high-voltage activity alternates with isoelectric quiescence. It is characteristic of an inactivated brain and is commonly observed at deep levels of general anesthesia, hypothermia, and in pathological conditions such as coma and early infantile encephalopathy. We propose a unifying mechanism for burst suppression that accounts for all of these conditions. By constructing a biophysical computational model, we show how the prevailing features of burst suppression may arise through the interaction between neuronal dynamics and brain metabolism. In each condition, the model suggests that a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate, coupled with the stabilizing properties of ATP-gated potassium channels, leads to the characteristic epochs of suppression. Consequently, the model makes a number of specific predictions of experimental and clinical relevance.

Suppression of thalamocortical oscillations following traumatic brain injury in rats Laboratory investigation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; coma; thalamocortical slice; slow cortical oscillation; recovery; rat	IN-VITRO; NEURONS; SLICES; RESPONSES; ISCHEMIA; RECOVERY; STROKE; MICE; EEG	Object. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often causes an encephalopathic state, corresponding amplitude suppression, and disorganization of electroencephalographic activity. Clinical recovery in patients who have suffered TBI varies, and identification of patients with a poor likelihood of functional recovery is not always straightforward. The authors sought to investigate temporal patterns of electrophysiological recovery of neuronal networks in an animal model of TBI. Because thalamocortical circuit function is a critical determinant of arousal state, as well as electroencephalography organization, these studies were performed using a thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Methods. Adult rats received a moderate parietal fluid-percussion injury and were allowed to survive for 1 hour, 2 days, 7 days, or 15 days prior to in vitro electrophysiological recording. Thalamocortical brain slices, 450-mu m thick, were prepared using a cutting angle that preserved reciprocal connections between the somatosensory cortex and the ventrobasal thalamic complex. Results. Extracellular recordings in the cortex of uninjured control brain slices revealed spontaneous slow cortical oscillations (SCOs) that are blocked by (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 mu M) and augmented in low [Mg2+]o. These oscillations have been shown to involve simultaneous bursts of activity in both the cortex and thalamus and are used here as a metric of thalamocortical circuit integrity. They were absent in 84% of slices recorded at 1 hour postinjury, and activity slowly recovered to approximate control levels by Day 15. The authors next used electrically evoked SCO-like potentials to determine neuronal excitability and found that the maximum depression occurred slightly later, on Day 2 following TBI, with only 28% of slices showing evoked activity. In addition, stimulus intensities needed to create evoked SCO activity were elevated at 1 hour, 2 days, and 7 days following TBI, and eventually returned to control levels by Day 15. The SCO frequency remained low throughout the 15 days following TBI (40% of control by Day 15). Conclusions. The suppression of cortical oscillatory activity following TBI observed in the rat model suggests an injury-induced functional disruption of thalamocortical networks that gradually recovers to baseline at approximately 15 days postinjury. The authors speculate that understanding the processes underlying disrupted thalamocortical circuit function may provide important insights into the biological basis of altered consciousness following severe head injury. Moreover, understanding the physiological basis for this process may allow us to develop new therapies to enhance the rate and extent of neurological recovery following TBI.

In the present study the anxiolytic profile of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists LY-354740 and LY-404039 and the mGlu2 receptor PAM 1-methyl-2-((cis-3-methyl-4-(4-trifluoromethyl-2-methoxy)-phenyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (MTFIP) were evaluated using neurophysiology-based assays. Activation of mGlu2/3 receptors by these compounds, as well as the positive control diazepam, significantly decreased the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillation elicited by stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis (nPO), a characteristic action of anxiolytic compounds. Since the nPO is a critical region involved in regulation of rapid eye movement sleep, mGlu2/3 receptor activators were also tested on sleep parameters, as well as on cortical and hippocampal encephalography (EEG) activity. Both mGlu2/3 agonists and the mGlu2 PAM significantly prolonged REM sleep latency and reduced total REM sleep duration while during the active awake state all compounds lowered hippocampal peak theta frequency. However, diazepam and mGlu2/3 agonists/PAM elicited opposite changes in cortical EEG delta and beta bands. Delta power significantly increased after any of the mGlu2/3 compounds but decreased after diazepam. In the beta band, mGlu2/3 receptor agonists dose-dependently decreased beta power in contrast to the well-known beta activation by diazepam. These effects lasted 3-4 h and could not be explained by modest, transient changes (<1 h) in waking and slow wave sleep. The current observations support the role of mGlu2/3 receptor activators as potential anxiolytic compounds, but indicate a distinct action on cortical EEG activity which is different from the effects of GABAA PAMs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.

Here, we used EEG frequency-tagging to track cortical activities elicited by auditory and visual inputs separately, in the form of steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs). We tested whether SS-EPs could reveal a dynamic coupling of cortical activities related to the binding of auditory and visual inputs conveying synchronous vs. non-synchronous temporal periodicities, or beats. The temporally congruent audiovisual condition elicited markedly enhanced auditory and visual SS-EPs, as compared to the incongruent condition. Furthermore, an increased inter-trial phase coherence of both SS-EPs was observed in that condition. Taken together, these observations indicate that temporal congruency enhances the processing of multisensory inputs at sensory-specific stages of cortical processing, possibly through a dynamic binding by synchrony of the elicited activities and/or improved dynamic attending. Moreover, we show that EEG frequency-tagging with SS-EPs constitutes an effective tool to explore the neural dynamics of multisensory integration in the human brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate if sleep structure is influenced by GH substitutive therapy by analyzing the classical sleep architecture parameters and sleep microstructure by means of CAP. Subjects and methods: Laboratory polysomnographic sleep recordings were obtained from five children affected by GHD (two girls and three boys; mean age: 4.6 +/- 3.1 years), at baseline and after GH therapy, and from 10 normal healthy children (four girls and six boys, mean age: 5.6 +/- 2.2 years). Results: Compared to controls, GHD subjects showed a reduced total sleep time with increased wakefulness and a consequent decrease in sleep efficiency; GH therapy was associated with an increase of the awakenings/hour and a large effect size was evident for sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and stage N3, which were decreased, and for stage W, which was increased. CAP appeared to be globally reduced and all phase A subtypes and CAP cycle showed a longer duration in GHD children vs. controls. GH substitutive treatment was followed by an increase in CAP rate (total, in N2, and in N3); additionally, A1 index was also significantly increased, especially during stage N3, with a very large effect size. On the other hand, A2 and A3 index and CAP cycle mean duration were reduced. Conclusion: Sleep stage architecture seems to be influenced by the GH status, but the analysis of sleep microstructure by means of CAP reveals an enhancement of EEG slow oscillations in GHD patients (demonstrated by an increase in CAP rate and A1 index during N3) after the start of GH replacement therapy. These findings deserve to be verified in a larger trial. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

It is assumed to reflect an active inhibition process. Our aim was to investigate the differences in the beta rebound between movement termination and withholding of movement, and the withholding of overt and covert movement. Methods: Twenty healthy persons completed Go/NoGo experiments with real and imaginary foot movements (dorsiflexion of both feet). Only participants that presented a beta rebound were considered. Event-related (de) synchronization provided the time course of the beta rebound from a participant specific frequency band. Statistical analyses revealed the significant differences between pairs of conditions: motor execution Go vs. motor execution NoGo, and motor execution NoGo vs. motor imagery NoGo. Results: The beta rebound is stronger and lasts longer after termination of movement than during withholding of a motor response (9 participants). Withholding of overt movement generates a stronger, longer, and more widespread beta rebound than the withholding of imaginary movement (7 participants). The beta rebound is more common after termination (16/16) and withholding of real movement (12/16) than during withholding of imaginary movements (7/16). Conclusions: These phenomena share a common origin and a common frequency band. Their functional meaning is assumed to be the same, although there are differences in time span and intensity of the beta ERS. Significance: First direct comparison of the beta rebound between motor execution and motor withholding, as well as withholding of overt and covert foot movement. A beta rebound also occurs during withholding of a motor task, and it is more common and strong for overt movement than for covert movement.

The motor cortex drives the muscles during walking in human subjects	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; GAIT; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MOTONEURONS; CONTRACTION; MODULATION; REDUCTION	Indirect evidence that the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract contribute to the control of walking in human subjects has been provided in previous studies. In the present study we used coherence analysis of the coupling between EEG and EMG from active legmuscles during human walking to address if activity arising in the motor cortex contributes to the muscle activity during gait. Nine healthy human subjects walked on a treadmill at a speed of 3.5-4 km h(-1). Seven of the subjects in addition walked at a speed of 1 km h(-1). Significant coupling between EEG recordings over the leg motor area and EMG from the anterior tibial muscle was found in the frequency band 24-40 Hz prior to heel strike during the swing phase of walking. This signifies that rhythmic cortical activity in the 24-40 Hz frequency band is transmitted via the corticospinal tract to the active muscles during walking. These findings demonstrate that the motor cortex and corticospinal tract contribute directly to the muscle activity observed in steady-state treadmill walking.	[Petersen, T.

J	Proverbio, AM				Proverbio, Alice Mado			Tool perception suppresses 10-12 Hz mu rhythm of EEG over the somatosensory area	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; EEG; Object affordance; Mirror neurons; mu rhythm; Mu power	MOTOR IMAGERY; CORTEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; GENERATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; OBJECTS	The perception of tools vs. other objects has been shown to activate the premotor (BA6) and somatosensory cortex (BA3), which neurally represent object affordance related to tool manipulability (Proverbio et al., 2011). The earliest tool/non-tool discrimination is represented by increased anterior negativity (210-270 ms) in response to tools. In this study, we analyzed mu desynchronization with wavelet analysis based on EEG recordings in response to 300 familiar objects vs. tools in 11 participants. The results showed an early 140-175 ms mu desynchronization over centro-parietal sites at approximately 10-12 Hz during tool perception. The surface scalp distribution of mu power is compatible with neural generators located in the somatosensory cortex, but no source analysis was performed. These results support the hypothesis that there is a temporal and functional relationship between the rapid and transient p. suppression over the centro/parietal area and the successive increase in time-locked post-synaptic potentials (ERPs) in regions processing tool motor affordance.

J	Baker, FC; Turlington, SR; Colrain, I				Baker, Fiona C.; Turlington, Sharon R.; Colrain, Ian			Developmental changes in the sleep electroencephalogram of adolescent boys and girls	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						delta power; rapid eye movement sleep; sex differences; topographic	SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; EVOKED K-COMPLEX; BRAIN MATURATION; SLOW-WAVE; EEG; DELTA; TOPOGRAPHY; SEX; TRAJECTORIES; OSCILLATION	The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) changes across adolescence; however, there are conflicting data as to whether EEG changes are regionally specific, are evident in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and whether there are sex differences. The present study seeks to resolve some of these issues in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of sleep EEG in adolescents. Thirty-three healthy adolescents (18 boys, 15 girls; 1114 years) were studied on two occasions 68 months apart. Cross-sectional analysis of data from the initial visit revealed significantly less slow-wave sleep, delta (0.3 to <4 Hz) and theta (4 to <8 Hz) power in both NREM and REM sleep with advancing age. The agedelta power relationship was significant at the occipital site, with age accounting for 26% of the variance. Longitudinal analysis revealed that NREM delta power declined significantly from the initial to follow-up visit, in association with declining delta amplitude and incidence (P < 0.01), with the effect being greatest at the occipital site. REM delta power also declined over time in association with reduced amplitude (P < 0.01). There were longitudinal reductions in theta, alpha and sigma power in NREM and REM sleep evident at the occipital site at follow-up (P < 0.01). No sex differences were apparent in the pattern of change with age for NREM or REM sleep. Declines in sleep EEG spectral power occur across adolescence in both boys and girls, particularly in the occipital derivation, and are not state-specific, occurring in both NREM and REM sleep.

First published July 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00452.2012.-Population signals from neuronal ensembles in cortex during behavior are commonly measured with EEG, local field potential (LFP), and voltagesensitive dyes. A genetically encoded voltage indicator would be useful for detection of such signals in specific cell types. Here we describe how this goal can be achieved with Butterfly, a voltagesensitive fluorescent protein (VSFP) with a subthreshold detection range and enhancements designed for voltage imaging from single neurons to brain in vivo. VSFP-Butterfly showed reliable membrane targeting, maximum response gain around standard neuronal resting membrane potential, fast kinetics for single-cell synaptic responses, and a high signal-to-noise ratio. Butterfly reports excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in cortical neurons, whisker-evoked responses in barrel cortex, 25-Hz gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices, and 2- to 12-Hz slow waves during brain state modulation in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that cell class-specific voltage imaging is practical with VSFP-Butterfly, and expand the genetic toolbox for the detection of neuronal population dynamics.

Noise power (scalp-recorded electroencephalographic activity unlocked to stimuli) may offer a non-invasive window to assess this possibility. Methods: 29 minimally-treated patients with schizophrenia (of which 17 were first episodes) and 27 healthy controls underwent clinical and cognitive assessments and an electroencephalographic recording during a P300 paradigm to calculate signal-to-noise ratio and noise power magnitudes in the theta and gamma bands. Results: In comparison to controls, a significantly higher gamma noise power was common to minimally-treated and first episode patients over P3, P4, T5 and Fz electrode sites. Those high values were directly correlated to negative symptom severity and inversely correlated to verbal memory scores in the patients. There were no differences in signal-to-noise ratio magnitudes among the groups. Gamma noise power at Fz discriminated significantly between patients and controls. No significant differences were found in theta noise power or in gamma noise power over the other electrode sites between the groups of patients and controls. Limitations: We have not assessed phase-locked and non-phase locked power changes, a complementary approach that may yield useful information. Conclusions: Gamma noise power may represent a useful and non-invasive tool for studying brain dysfunction in psychotic illness. These results suggest an inefficient activation pattern in schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study examined the effect of acute nicotine gum administration (6 mg) on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (alpha(1), alpha(2) and theta bands) and performance on the parametrically manipulated N-back task of WM in 20 non-smoking adults. EEG activity varied with WM load (e.g. alpha(1) decreasing and theta increasing). Performance on the N-back was also load-sensitive, with slower reaction times and decreased accuracy associated with increasing memory load. Neither response speed nor accuracy measures were affected by nicotine but EEG was, with the effects varying by load and brain region. Nicotine-induced increases in alpha2 and theta were observed under lower (0-, 1-back) memory load conditions Additionally, nicotine significantly reduced signal detection sensitivity values and altered response bias toward being more conservative at all levels of the N-back. Taken together, these findings suggest that while nicotine may boost WM neural processes at lower levels of WM load in non-smokers, it also may activate concurrent behavioral inhibition networks that negate any effects on behavioral performance. Additionally, nicotine appears to have no impact, or perhaps a negative impact, on these processes under more demanding (2-back, 3-back) conditions in non-smokers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence suggests that increased sleep slow waves after sleep deprivation reflect plastic synaptic processes, and that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is causally involved in their homeostatic regulation. The functional Val66Met polymorphism of the gene encoding pro-BDNF causes impaired activity-dependent secretion of mature BDNF protein. We investigated whether this polymorphism contributes to the pronounced inter-individual variation in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) in humans. Setting: Sleep laboratory in temporal isolation unit. Participants: Eleven heterozygous Met allele carriers and 11 individually sex-and age-matched Val/Val homozygotes. Interventions: Forty hours prolonged wakefulness. Measurements and Results: Cognitive performance, subjective state, and waking and sleep EEG in baseline and after sleep deprivation were studied. Val/Val homozygotes showed better response accuracy than Met allele carriers on a verbal 2-back working memory task. This difference did not reflect genotype-dependent differences in sleepiness, well-being, or sustained attention. In baseline and recovery nights, deep stage 4 sleep and NREM sleep intensity as quantified by EEG SWA (0.75-4.5 Hz) were higher in Val/Val compared to Val/Met genotype. Similar to sleep deprivation, the difference was most pronounced in the first NREM sleep episode. By contrast, increased activity in higher EEG frequencies (> 6 Hz) in wakefulness and REM sleep was distinct from the effects of prolonged wakefulness. Conclusion: BDNF contributes to the regulation of sleep slow wave oscillations, suggesting that genetically determined variation in neuronal plasticity modulates NREM sleep intensity in humans.

Design: Polysomnographic assessment and standardized neurocognitive testing in healthy children. Settings: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Forty-two children aged 7.6 +/- 2.7 years, with an even distribution of body mass percentile (58.5 +/- 25.5) and SES reflective of national norms. Measurements: Analysis of sleep macrostructure following the R&K criteria and of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). The neurocognitive tests were the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale (5th edition) and a Neuropsychological Developmental Assessment (NEPSY) Results: Fluid reasoning ability was positively associated with CAP rate, particularly during SWS and with A1 total index and A1 index in SWS. Regression analysis, controlling for age and SES, showed that CAP rate in SWS and A1 index in SWS were significant predictors of nonverbal fluid reasoning, explaining 24% and 22% of the variance in test scores, respectively. Conclusion: This study shows that CAP analysis provides important insights on the role of EEG slow oscillations (CAP A1) in cognitive performance.

The algorithm is the computational engine for analyzing the time-varying coordination between signals, which is called correlation map analysis (CMA). Correlation is computed around any pair of points in the two input signals. Thus, coordination can be assessed across a continuous range of temporal offsets and be detected even when changing over time due to temporal fluctuations. The correlation algorithm has two major features: (i) it is structurally similar to a tunable filter, requiring only one parameter to set its cutoff frequency (and sensitivity), (ii) it can be applied either uni-directionally (computing correlation based only on previous samples) or bi-directionally (computing correlation based on both previous and future samples). Computing instantaneous correlation for a range of time offsets between two signals produces a 2D correlation map, in which correlation is characterized as a function of time and temporal offset. Graphic visualization of the correlation map provides rapid assessment of how correspondence patterns progress through time. The utility of the algorithm and of CMA are exemplified using the spatial and temporal coordination of various audible and visible components associated with linguistic performance.

Theta oscillations reflect a putative neural mechanism for human sensorimotor integration. J Neurophysiol 107: 65-77, 2012. First published October 5, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00893.2010.-Hippocampal theta oscillations (3-12 Hz) may reflect a mechanism for sensorimotor integration in rats (Bland BH. Prog Neurobiol 26: 1-54, 1986); however, it is unknown whether cortical theta activity underlies sensorimotor integration in humans. Rather, the mu rhythm (8-12 Hz) is typically found to desynchronize during movement. We measured oscillatory EEG activity for two conditions of an instructed delayed reaching paradigm. Conditions 1 and 2 were designed to differentially manipulate the contribution of the ventral visuomotor stream during the response initiation phase. We tested the hypothesis that theta activity would reflect changes in the relevant sensorimotor network: condition 2 engaged ventral stream mechanisms to a greater extent than condition 1. Theta oscillations were more prevalent during movement initiation and execution than during periods of stillness, consistent with a sensorimotor relevance for theta activity. Furthermore, theta activity was more prevalent at temporal sites in condition 2 than condition 1 during response initiation, suggesting that theta activity is present within the necessary sensorimotor network. Mu activity desynchronized more during condition 2 than condition 1, suggesting mu desynchronization is also specific to the sensorimotor network. In summary, cortical theta synchronization and mu desynchronization may represent broadly applicable rhythmic mechanisms for sensorimotor integration in the human brain.

Temporal integration depends on increased prestimulus beta band power	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal integration; EEG; Beta frequency band; Prestimulus activity	VISUAL-ATTENTION; EVENT; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; VARIABILITY; MODULATION	Temporal integration was examined using a missing element task, in which task performance depends on the ability to integrate brief successive stimulus displays. Previous studies have suggested that temporal integration is under endogenous control and that integration is more likely when stimuli match the observer's temporal expectancies. Beta oscillations have previously been related to such cognitive (and attentional) control, as well as to audiovisual integration. We thus hypothesized that prestimulus power in the beta frequency band might reflect integration readiness and distinguish trials in which stimuli were successfully integrated from unsuccessful ones. The results showed increased upper beta power (2130?Hz) prior to successful integration over central and parietal electrodes. This finding supported the idea that increased prestimulus beta power might reflect general control processes that can facilitate integration.

The identification of candidate intermediate phenotypes that are both heritable and genetically linked to ADHD may facilitate the detection of susceptibility genes and elucidate aetiological pathways. Very low-frequency (VLF; <0.5 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity represents a promising indicator of risk for ADHD, but it currently remains unclear as to whether it is heritable or genetically linked to the disorder. Methods: Direct-current (DC)-EEG was recorded during a cognitive activation condition in 30 monozygotic and dizygotic adolescent twin pairs concordant or discordant for high ADHD symptom scores, and 37 monozygotic and dizygotic matched-control twin pairs with low ADHD symptom scores. Structural equation modelling was used to quantify the genetic and environmental contributions to the phenotypic covariance between ADHD and VLF activity. Results: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was significantly associated with reduced VLF power during cognitive activation, which suggests reduced synchronization of widespread neuronal activity. Very low-frequency power demonstrated modest heritability (0.31), and the genetic correlation (-0.80) indicated a substantial degree of overlap in genetic influences on ADHD and VLF activity. Conclusions: Altered VLF activity is a potential candidate intermediate phenotype of ADHD, which warrants further investigation of underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms.

Spectral decomposition of P50 suppression in schizophrenia during concurrent visual processing	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; EEG; P50; Spectral analysis	HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; EVOKED-RESPONSE; RECENT-ONSET; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; ABNORMALITIES; INFORMATION; DYSFUNCTION; BRAIN; MODEL	Reduced suppression of the auditory P50 event-related potential has long been associated with schizophrenia, but the mechanisms associated with the generation and suppression of the P50 are not well understood. Recent investigations have used spectral decomposition of the electroencephalograph (EEG) signal to gain additional insight into the ongoing electrophysiological activity that may be reflected by the P50 suppression deficit. The present investigation extended this line of study by examining how both a traditional measure of sensory gating and the ongoing EEG from which it is extracted might be modified by the presence of concurrent visual stimulation - perhaps better characterizing gating deficits as they occur in a real-world, complex sensory environment. The EEG was obtained from 18 patients with schizophrenia and 17 healthy control subjects during the P50 suppression paradigm and while identical auditory paired-stimuli were presented concurrently with affectively neutral pictures. Consistent with prior research, schizophrenia patients differed from healthy subjects in gating of power in the theta range; theta activity also was modulated by visual stimulation. In addition, schizophrenia patients showed intact gating but overall increased power in the gamma range, consistent with a model of NMDA receptor dysfunction in the disorder. These results are in line with a model of schizophrenia in which impairments in neural synchrony are related to sensory demands and the processing of multimodal information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Slobounov, S; Sebastianelli, W; Hallett, M				Slobounov, Semyon; Sebastianelli, Wayne; Hallett, Mark			Residual brain dysfunction observed one year post-mild traumatic brain injury: Combined EEG and balance study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Mild traumatic brain injury; Balance; Center of pressure (COP) area	SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; HEAD-INJURIES; HIGH-SCHOOL; RECOVERY; STABILITY; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Objectives: There is still considerable debate and controversy about whether EEG can be used as a robust clinical tool for assessment of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Nonhomogeneous subject populations, inaccurate assessment of severity of brain injury, time since injury when EEG testing was performed, the lack of EEG research conducted serially and in conjunction with other behavioral measures as injury evolves over time may contribute to the existing controversies. In this study, we implemented a concussion assessment protocol combining a series of EEG and balance measures throughout one year post-injury to document the efficacy of EEG and balance measures as relate to differential recovery of patients suffering from MTBI. Methods: Three hundred and eighty subjects at risk for MTBI were initially recruited for baseline testing. Forty nine from this initial subjects pool subsequently suffered a single episode of concussive blow and were tested on day 7, 15, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post-injury. EEGs were recorded while sitting, standing on the force plate and then on a foam base of support with eyes open/closed conditions. EEG alpha power (8-12 Hz) and its percent suppression from sitting to standing postures were computed. The center of pressure (COP) measures were obtained from the force platform and analyzed for eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Results: Percent alpha power suppression from sitting to standing postural conditions significantly increased in MTBI subjects shortly after the injury (p < 0.01). Percent alpha power suppression significantly correlated with increased area of COP during standing posture with eye closed (r(2) = 0.53, p < 0.01). The magnitude of alpha power suppression predicted the rate of recovery of this measure in sub-acute and chronic phases of injury (r(2) = 0.609, p < 0.01). Finally, 85% of MTBI subjects who showed more than 20% of alpha power suppression in the acute phase of injury did not return to pre-injury status up to 12 months post-injury. Conclusions: The efficacy of serially implemented EEG measures in conjunction with balance assessment over the course of MTBI evolution to document residual cerebral dysfunction was demonstrated. Specifically, alteration of EEG alpha power dynamics in conjunction with balance data in the acute phase of injury with respect to baseline measures may predict the rate of recovery from a single concussive blow. Significance: Neurophysiological measures are excellent tools to assess the status and prognosis of patients with MTBI. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Sabate, M; Llanos, C; Enriquez, E; Rodriguez, M				Sabate, Magdalena; Llanos, Catalina; Enriquez, Enrique; Rodriguez, Manuel			Mu rhythm, visual processing and motor control	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mu activity; Sensorimotor cortex; Idling hypothesis	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY TASK; MOVEMENT; CORTEX; POTENTIALS	Objective: The Mu-rhythm has been proposed as both an inhibitor ("idling hypothesis") and as a promoter ("processing hypothesis") of information processing in the primary sensory-motor cortex (SM-C). We tested these possibilities by analyzing the phase-locked and non-phase-locked Mu response during the execution of a visual-motor task. Methods: EEG was recorded in 13 subjects during the visual presentation of an arrow which indicated the direction of the finger motion to be executed after the presentation of a second stimulus. The EEG activity in the alpha-range (Mu-alpha) and beta-range was evaluated by a method which segregated the phase-locked and the non-phase-locked response. The event-related Mu-response observed during this task was compared with that computed when the subjects saw the same arrow-stimuli but did not perform any task (passive test). Results: Visual stimuli induced a phase-locked alpha-oscillation which began approximate to 50 ms after the stimulus onset and persisted for about 150-200 ms. This response was much higher when stimuli were used for motion planning than when they were passively observed, and was more marked in the alpha-range than in the beta-range. The phase-locked response was followed by a persistent decrease of the non-phase-locked Mu-activity similar to that previously reported with the event-related desynchronization/synchronization method. Conclusions: The Mu-wave is not a single phenomenon. It was segregated here into two components, one with an early and short-lasting phase locked-response to visual stimuli, which increased during the task execution, and the other without phase-locked responses which persistently decreased during the task execution. Significance: Present data suggest that Mu-activity performs a double action, increasing the information processing of one task (according to the "processing hypothesis") and decreasing the computation of other potentially interfering tasks (according to the "idling hypothesis"), with task selection being achieved by choosing their phase-association to the Mu-wave.

This is an important challenge for basic and translational neuroscience since frequency-specific rhythms are hypothesized to code for sensorimotor and cognitive processes and aberrations in these rhythms develop as early markers of pathology in disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Methods to reconstruct the subcortical white matter networks related to different frequency bands have been limited by the dual challenges of recording electrical activity directly from human cortex with high spatial resolution and the inability, until a decade ago, to map white matter connectivity in vivo. In the present study, a multi-modal fusion of electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography data collected from 9 neurosurgical patients performing a working memory task known to elicit robust distributed cortical gamma and theta oscillations is presented. A similarity analysis of connectivity underlying 629 intracranial electrodes revealed distinct patterns of white matter terminating near cortex that exhibited gamma, theta, and conjoint gamma and theta oscillatory power. Future applications of this method for parcellating neural circuitry in normal and pathological states are discussed.

Beta oscillations (12-40 Hz) occur in motor cortical LFPs, but their functional relevance remains controversial. Power modulation studies have related beta oscillations to a "resting" motor cortex, postural maintenance, attention, sensorimotor binding and planning. Frequency modulations were largely overlooked. We here describe context-related beta frequency modulations in motor cortical LFPs. Two monkeys performed a reaching task with 2 delays. The first delay demanded attention in time in expectation of the visual spatial cue, whereas the second delay involved visuomotor integration and movement preparation. The frequency in 2 beta bands (around 20 and 30 Hz) was systematically 2-5 Hz lower during cue expectancy than during visuomotor integration and preparation. Furthermore, the frequency was directionally selective during preparation, with about 3 Hz difference between preferred and nonpreferred directions. Direction decoding with frequency gave similar accuracy as with beta power, and decoding accuracy improved significantly when combining power and frequency, suggesting that frequency might provide an additional signal for brain-machine interfaces. In conclusion, multiple beta bands coexist in motor cortex, and frequency modulations within each band are as behaviorally meaningful as power modulations, reflecting the changing behavioral context and the movement direction during preparation.

The frequency and timing of epileptiform activity on continuous electroencephalogram in comatose post-cardiac arrest syndrome patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; Erapeutic hypothermia; Coma; EEG; Seizure; Status epilepticus; Outcomes	CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; EEG	Aim: The incidence and timing of electrographic seizures and epileptiform activity in comatose, adult, post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) have not been extensively investigated. We hypothesized that onset most frequently occurs within the first 24 h post-arrest and is associated with poor neurologic outcome. Methods: Single-center, retrospective analysis of a cohort of 38 comatose PCAS patients treated with TH and continuous-EEG-monitoring (cEEG), initiated as soon as possible after ICU admission. All raw cEEG waveform records were cleared of annotations and clinical information and classified by two fellowship-trained electroencephalographers. Results: Twenty-three percent (9/38) of patients had electrographic seizures (median onset 19 h post-arrest); 5/9 (56%) had seizure-onset prior to rewarming; 7/9 (78%) had status epilepticus. Forty-five percent (17/38) had evidence of epileptiform activity (electrographic seizures or interictal epileptiform discharges), typically occurring during first 24 h post-arrest. Interictal epileptiform activity was highly associated with later detection of electrographic seizures (6/14, 43%, p = 0.001). Ninety-four percent (16/17) of patients with epileptiform activity had poor neurologic outcome or death at discharge (Cerebral Performance Category scale 3-5; p = 0.002) as did all (9/9) patients with electrographic seizures (p = 0.034). Conclusions: Electrographic seizures and epileptiform activity are common cEEG findings in comatose, PCAS patients treated with TH. In this preliminary study, most seizures were status epilepticus, had onset prior to rewarming, evolved from prior interictal epileptiform activity, and were associated with short-term mortality and poor neurologic outcome. Larger, prospective studies are needed to further characterize seizure activity in comatose post-arrest patients. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, Alzheimer Disease-associated cognitive decline has been related to amyloid beta-induced disturbances in several of these oscillatory patterns. We have previously shown that acute application of amyloid beta inhibits the generation of slow-frequency oscillations (7-20 Hz). In contrast, alterations in faster oscillations recorded in Alzheimer Disease-transgenic mice that over-express amyloid beta have been controversial. Since transgenic mice may produce complex responses due to compensatory mechanisms, we tested the effect of acute application of amyloid beta on fast oscillations (beta-gamma bursts) generated by entorhinal cortex slices in vitro in a Mg2+-free solution. We also explored the participation of the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in this effect. Our results show that bath application of a clinically relevant concentration of amyloid beta (10 nM) activates GSK-3 and reduces the power of beta-gamma bursts in the entorhinal cortex. The reduction of beta-gamma bursts by amyloid beta is blocked by inhibiting GSK-3 either with lithium or with SB 216763. Our results suggest that amyloid beta-induced inhibition of entorhinal cortex beta-gamma activity involves GSK-3 activation, which may provide a molecular mechanism for amyloid beta-induced neural network disruption and support the use of GSK-3 inhibitors to treat Alzheimer Disease.

In a simulated driving task with two different secondary tasks (i.e. visuomotor, auditory), N=28 participants had to perform full stop brakes reacting to appearing stop signs and red traffic lights. Alpha spindle rate was significantly higher during an auditory secondary task and significantly lower during a visuomotor secondary task as compared to driving only. Alpha spindle duration was significantly shortened during a visuomotor secondary task. The results are consistent with the assumption that alpha spindles indicate active inhibition of visual information processing. Effects on the alpha spindles while performing secondary tasks on top of the driving task indicate attentional shift according to the task modality. As compared to alpha band power, both the measures of alpha spindle rate and alpha spindle duration were less vulnerable to artifacts and the effect sizes were larger, allowing for a more accurate description of the current driver state.

However, the cognitive processes engaged during meditation that support trait changes in cognition are not well characterized. We conducted a longitudinal wait-list controlled study of intensive meditation training. Retreat participants practiced focused attention (FA) meditation techniques for three months during an initial retreat. Wait-list participants later undertook formally identical training during a second retreat. Dense-array scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected during 6 min of mindfulness of breathing meditation at three assessment points during each retreat. Second-order blind source separation, along with a novel semi-automatic artifact removal tool (SMART), was used for data preprocessing. We observed replicable reductions in meditative state-related beta-band power bilaterally over anteriocentral and posterior scalp regions. In addition, individual alpha frequency (IAF) decreased across both retreats and in direct relation to the amount of meditative practice. These findings provide evidence for replicable longitudinal changes in brain oscillatory activity during meditation and increase our understanding of the cortical processes engaged during meditation that may support long-term improvements in cognition.

Methods: The HHT-CPC sleep spectrogram technique was applied to a total of 69 single-lead ECG signals downloaded from the Physionet Sleep Apnea Database. Sleep spectrograms generated by both the original and the improved CPC method were compared on the structure distribution and time-frequency resolution. The performance of respiratory events detection by using the power of low frequency coupling (pLFC) in the new method was estimated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Furthermore, correlation between HHT-CPC index (temporal Variability of Dominant Frequency, TVDF) and conventional OSAHS scoring was computed. Results: The HHT-CPC spectrum provides much finer temporal resolution and frequency resolution (8 s and 0.001 Hz) compared with the original CPC (8.5 min and 0.004 Hz). The area under the ROC curve of pLFC was 0.79 in distinguishing respiratory events from normal breathing. Significant differences were found in TVDF among groups with different severities of OSAHS (normal, mild, moderate, and severe, p < 0.001). TVDF has a strong negative correlation with the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI, correlation coefficient -0.71). Conclusions: The HHT-CPC spectrum could exhibit more detailed temporal-frequency information about cardiopulmonary coupling during sleep. As two spectrographic markers, pLFC and TVDF can be used to identify respiratory events and represent the disruption extent of sleep architecture in patients with sleep apnea/hypopnea, respectively. The proposed technique might serve as a complementary approach to enhance diagnostic efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

A certain dynamics in the spatial synchronization in the alpha-band was revealed, which might reflect modulation of selective attention in time periods of the cognitive process providing its plasticity and set shift in response to a change in the situation. It is suggested that the source of attention modulation is the inner representation of the intervals between significant stimuli formed in the prefrontal cortex as a result of learning.

Clusters of axial and limb tonic contractions with head nodding began at 2 years of age. They occurred only during sleep, lasting 15 to 20 minutes and were pharmacoresistant. The child suffered slight mental delay. Interictal EEG showed left frontal spikes in slow sleep. Ictal video-EEG showed patterns of asymmetric spasms. MRI revealed a distinct white matter abnormality in the left frontal superior gyrus, corresponding clearly to localised cortical hypometabolism on FDG-PET and PET-MRI co-recording. SEEG investigation showed that the first spasm of the clusters corresponded to a localised discharge of rapid rhythms from the electrodes placed within the area identified as a lesion by MRI. Discharges then became more diffuse across the left frontal and temporal electrodes throughout the duration of the cluster. A tailored focal frontal resection was performed at 16 years of age. Spasms were very rare during the following three years (Engel class II). This observation illustrates the fact that isolated epileptic spasms can be cured by focal cortical resection despite a lack of clearly localised EEG surface anomalies.

We recorded the EEG signals evoked by repeated presentation of 12 American English phonemes. A support vector machine model correctly recognized a high percentage of the EEG brain wave recordings represented by their phases, which were expressed in discrete Fourier transform coefficients. We show that phases of the oscillations restricted to the frequency range of 2-9 Hz can be used to successfully recognize brain processing of these phonemes. The recognition rates can be further improved using the scalp tangential electric field and the surface Laplacian around the auditory cortical area, which were derived from the original potential signal. The best rate for the eight initial consonants was 66.7%. Moreover, we found a distinctive phase pattern in the brain for each of these consonants. We then used these phase patterns to recognize the consonants, with a correct rate of 48.7%. In addition, in the analysis of the confusion matrices, we found significant similarity-differences were invariant between brain and perceptual representations of phonemes. These latter results supported the importance of phonological distinctive features in the neural representation of phonemes.

Not All Errors Are Alike: Theta and Alpha EEG Dynamics Relate to Differences in Error-Processing Dynamics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VOLUME CONDUCTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SPATIAL STIMULUS; PHASE SYNCHRONY	Performance errors in conflict tasks often result from inappropriate action impulses, and are thought to signal the need for increased control over the motor system. However, errors may also result from lapses in sustained attention, which may require different monitoring and adaptation mechanisms. Distinguishing between the mechanisms of adaptation is important as both error types may occur intermixed. To this end, we measured EEG of healthy human subjects while they performed three variants of the Simon task in which errors were more likely to occur due to attentional lapses, failures of motor control, or both. Behavioral results showed that subjects exhibited less conflict effects and less impulsive errors in sustained attention compared with the other Simon conditions. Time-frequency analyses of EEG data showed that the sustained attention Simon condition, compared with the motor control Simon condition, was characterized by: (1) less error-related MFC theta (4-8 Hz) power and an absence of error-related MFC-DLPFC theta phase synchronization; (2) stronger error-related suppression of parieto-occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) power and stronger parieto-occipital-frontal alpha synchronization. A control experiment, using SART (the Sustained Attention to Response Test), confirmed that adaptation after attentional lapses involved posterior alpha power suppression, in addition to inter-regional frontal theta activity. Together, these results suggest that at least two cortical mechanisms exist for performance monitoring, and that different tasks and task-settings can recruit these mechanisms in a different way. Post-error brain dynamics thus consist of heterogeneous activity from multiple neurocognitive processes.	[van Driel, Joram; Ridderinkhof, K.

Automated determination of wakefulness and sleep in rats based on non-invasively acquired measures of movement and respiratory activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Automated sleep scoring; Non-invasive; Movement and respiratory activity; Doppler radar; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DOPPLER-SHIFT RADAR; HOME CAGE ACTIVITY; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; PRACTICE PARAMETERS; STRAIN DIFFERENCES; MICE; WAKE; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	The current standard for monitoring sleep in rats requires labor intensive surgical procedures and the implantation of chronic electrodes which have the potential to impact behavior and sleep. With the goal of developing a non-invasive method to determine sleep and wakefulness, we constructed a non-contact monitoring system to measure movement and respiratory activity using signals acquired with pulse Doppler radar and from digitized video analysis. A set of 23 frequency and time-domain features were derived from these signals and were calculated in 10 s epochs. Based on these features, a classification method for automated scoring of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and REM in rats was developed using a support vector machine (SVM). We then assessed the utility of the automated scoring system in discriminating wakefulness and sleep by comparing the results to standard scoring of wakefulness and sleep based on concurrently recorded EEG and EMG. Agreement between SVM automated scoring based on selected features and visual scores based on EEG and EMG were approximately 91% for wakefulness, 84% for NREM and 70% for REM. The results indicate that automated scoring based on non-invasively acquired movement and respiratory activity will be useful for studies requiring discrimination of wakefulness and sleep. However, additional information or signals will be needed to improve discrimination of NREM and REM episodes within sleep. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Word class and context affect alpha-band oscillatory dynamics in an older population	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						lexical-semantic; reading; EEG; oscillatory dynamics; alpha; theta		Differences in the oscillatory EEG dynamics of reading open class (OC) and closed class (CC) words have previously been found (Bastiaansen et al., 2005) and are thought to reflect differences in lexical-semantic content between these word classes. In particular, the theta-band (4-7 Hz) seems to play a prominent role in lexical-semantic retrieval. We tested whether this theta effect is robust in an older population of subjects. Additionally, we examined how the context of a word can modulate the oscillatory dynamics underlying retrieval for the two different classes of words. Older participants (mean age 55) read words presented in either syntactically correct sentences or in a scrambled order ("scrambled sentence") while their EEG was recorded. We performed time frequency analysis to examine how power varied based on the context or class of the word. We observed larger power decreases in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band between 200-700 ms for the OC compared to CC words, but this was true only for the scrambled sentence context. We did not observe differences in theta power between these conditions. Context exerted an effect on the alpha and low beta (13-18 Hz) bands between 0 and 700 ms. These results suggest that the previously observed word class effects on theta power changes in a younger participant sample do not seem to be a robust effect in this older population. Though this is an indirect comparison between studies, it may suggest the existence of aging effects on word retrieval dynamics for different populations. Additionally, the interaction between word class and context suggests that word retrieval mechanisms interact with sentence-level comprehension mechanisms in the alpha-band.

The aim of this study was to provide a complete description of the cortical dynamics induced by unpleasant and neutral pictures viewing, from the ERP averages to gamma rhythm modulation, and its phase synchronization. Gamma rhythm modulation was estimated by the event-related synchronization (ERS) approach, and phase synchrony between trials and between cortical regions was studied by extending the phase-locking statistics (PLS) approach. Consistent with previous literature, an increase in P300 and late positive potential and an increase in gamma activity during viewing of unpleasant pictures as compared to neutral ones were found. No inter-trial synchronization was evoked by the stimuli, whereas widespread phase locking between sites was identified. In particular, differences in gamma synchronization between unpleasant and neutral stimuli were found. Specifically, at early (0-250 ms) lags from stimulus onset, in the 38-45 Hz gamma interval, stronger intersite synchronizations for the unpleasant stimuli, even though quite widespread across the scalp, mainly involved the interhemispheric synchronization between temporal and frontal regions. In contrast, in the 30-37 Hz gamma interval, stronger synchronizations for the responses to neutral trials were found in the 500-750 time interval, mainly involving the temporo-parietal regions. These findings suggest that the full elaboration of unpleasant stimuli requires a tight interhemispheric communication between temporal and frontal regions that is realized by means of phase synchronization at about 40 Hz. In addition, in contrast with the idea of a broadband modulation of high-frequency activity by cognitive/emotional stimuli, the present findings i.e. stronger BRS responses to either emotional or neutral trials at specific frequency and time range, indicate that specific intervals of gamma activity could be each primarily involved in a specific aspect of stimulus processing.

In this work, we demonstrate a portable and continuous BCG monitor that is wearable at the ear. The device has the form factor of a hearing aid and is wirelessly connected to a PC for data recording and analysis. With the ear as an anchoring point, the device uses a MEMS tri-axial accelerometer to measure BCG at the head. Morphological differences exist between head BCG and traditional BCG, but the principal peaks (J waves) and their vectors are preserved. The frequency of J waves corresponds to heart rate, and when used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram's (ECG) R wave, the timing of J waves yields the RJ interval. Results from our clinical study show linear correlation between the RJ interval and the heart's pre-ejection period during hemodynamic maneuvers, thus revealing important information about cardiac contractility and its regulation.

For this purpose, short time memory task which includes memory load varieties is implemented to the subjects. To calculate mutual information, time and frequency information is both taken into consideration due to Cohen class time-frequency distribution (TFD) formulation. Cohen class based mutual information helps us to integrate adjacency matrices based on the similarity information of individual electrode pairs. In addition, essential frequency bins are selected from the TFD with respect to the default alpha frequency (8 - 12Hz) intervals. Moreover, graph based spectral clustering algorithm is used to parcellate memory related circuits on the brain. From the calculated adjacency matrices, the N-cut algorithm is used for node wise clustering between nodes. After node wise clustering information, subject wise clustering is applied with respect to the similarities of node information over all subjects.

In this research, the micro-electroencephalographic (EEG) technique was applied. Experiments were performed on 72 HPC formation slices obtained from 12 male Wistar rats. Two series of experiments were conducted: the control experiment, in which ACSF was used as an incubation medium, and the research one, in which ACSF was supplemented with 200 mu M AA. The experimental model of carbachol-induced EEG theta rhythm was applied. The following parameters of theta rhythm after 15, 30 and 45 min of recording were analysed: frequency, power, time duration of theta epochs and time duration of intervals between theta epochs. The results show that AA causes a statistically significant decrease in the power of theta rhythm after 15, 30 and 45 min of recording. The time duration of intervals between theta epochs was almost twice as long in slices incubated in ACSF + AA than in ACSF after 45 min of recording. The data obtained indicate that AA does not improve the condition of HPC slices. On the contrary, it worsens the ability of slice preparations to generate theta oscillations. We hypothesize that our data may result from the Fenton reaction or changes in the conformation of connexins.

Unravelling its neuro-biological basis is paramount to grasp the essence of our thoughts. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the visualisation of "what?" (e.g. faces or objects) and "where?" (e.g. spatial layout) content of mental images. However, the functional role of a common set of involved regions - the frontal regions - and their interplay with the "what" and "where" regions, has remained largely unspecified. This study combines functional MRI and electroencephalography to examine the full-brain network that underlies the visual imagery of complex scenes and to investigate the spectro-temporal properties of its nodes, especially of the frontal cortex. Our results indicate that frontal regions integrate the "what" and "where" content of our thoughts into one visually imagined scene. We link early synchronisation of anterior theta and beta oscillations to regional activation of right and central frontal cortices, reflecting retrieval and integration of information. These frontal regions orchestrate remote occipital-temporal regions (including calcarine sulcus and parahippocampal gyrus) that encode the detailed representations of the objects, and parietal "where" regions that encode the spatial layout into forming one coherent mental picture. Specifically the mesial superior frontal gyrus appears to have a principal integrative role, as its activity during the visualisation of the scene predicts subsequent performance on the imagery task.

However, it is unclear whether APOE-4 is linked to a specific pattern of intrinsic functional disintegration of the brain after the development of the disease or during its different stages. This study aimed at identifying spatial patterns and effects of APOE genotype on resting-state oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with AD, using a physiological connectivity index called "lagged phase synchronization''. Methodology/Principal Findings: Resting EEG was recorded during awake, eyes-closed state in 125 patients with AD and 60 elderly controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA. Patients with AD exhibited reduced parieto-occipital alpha oscillations compared with controls, and those carrying the APOE-4 allele had reduced alpha activity in the left inferior parietal and temporo-occipital cortex relative to noncarriers. There was a decreased alpha2 connectivity pattern in AD, involving the left temporal and bilateral parietal cortex. Several brain regions exhibited increased lagged phase synchronization in low frequencies, specifically in the theta band, across and within hemispheres, where temporal lobe connections were particularly compromised. Areas with abnormal theta connectivity correlated with cognitive scores. In patients with early AD, we found an APOE-4-related decrease in interhemispheric alpha connectivity in frontal and parieto-temporal regions. Conclusions/Significance: In addition to regional cortical dysfunction, as indicated by abnormal alpha oscillations, there are patterns of functional network disruption affecting theta and alpha bands in AD that associate with the level of cognitive disturbance or with the APOE genotype. These functional patterns of nonlinear connectivity may potentially represent neurophysiological or phenotypic markers of AD, and aid in early detection of the disorder.

We evaluated the clinical utility of interictal HFO events, especially their occurrence rates, by comparing the spatial distribution with a clinically determined epileptogenic zone by using subdural macroelectrodes. Methods We obtained intracranial electroencephalogram data with a high temporal resolution (2000 Hz sampling rate, 0.05-500 Hz band-pass filter) from seven patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Three epochs of 5-minute, artifact-free data were selected randomly from the interictal period. HFO candidates were first detected by an automated algorithm and subsequently screened to discard false detections. Validated events were further categorized as fast ripple (FR) and ripple (R) according to their spectral profiles. The occurrence rate of HFOs was calculated for each electrode contact. An HFO events distribution map (EDM) was constructed for each patient to allow visualization of the spatial distribution of their HFO events. Results The subdural macroelectrodes were capable of detecting both R and FR events from the epileptic neocortex. The occurrence rate of HFO events, both FR and R, was significantly higher in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than in other brain regions. Patient-specific HFO EDMs can facilitate the identification of the location of HFO-generating tissue, and comparison with findings from ictal recordings can provide additional useful information regarding the epileptogenic zone. Conclusions The distribution of interictal HFOs was reasonably consistent with the SOZ. The detection of HFO events and construction of spatial distribution maps appears to be useful for the presurgical mapping of the epileptogenic zone.

Differential synchronization in default and task-networks of the human brain	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						default network; task-specific network; neural synchronization; oscillatory power; theta band; alpha-band; gamma-band; mind wandering	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; RESTING BRAIN; MODE; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS; STREAMS	On a regional scale the brain is organized into dynamic functional networks. The activity within one of these, the default network, can be dissociated from that in other task-specific networks. All brain networks are connected structurally but evidently are only transiently connected functionally. One hypothesis as to how such transient functional coupling occurs is that network formation and dissolution is mediated by increases and decreases in oscillatory synchronization between constituent brain regions. If so, then we should be able to find transient differences in intra-network synchronization between the default network and a task-specific network. In order to investigate this hypothesis we conducted two experiments in which subjects engaged in a Sustained Attention to Response Task while having brain activity recorded via high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We found that during periods when attention was focused internally (mind wandering) there was significantly more neural phase synchronization between brain regions associated with the default network, whereas during periods when subjects were focused on performing the visual task there was significantly more neural phase synchrony within a task-specific brain network that shared some of the same brain regions. These differences in network synchrony occurred in each of theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands. A similar pattern of differential oscillatory power changes, indicating modulation of local synchronization by attention state, was also found. These results provide further evidence that the human brain is intrinsically organized into default and task-specific brain networks, and confirm that oscillatory synchronization is a potential mechanism for functional coupling within these networks.

The analgesic effect of pregabalin in patients with chronic pain is reflected by changes in pharmaco-EEG spectral indices	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						analgesic; electroencephalographic; pain; pattern recognition; pregabalin	COMPUTER-SUPPORTED EVALUATION; STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONIC-PANCREATITIS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; GABAPENTIN; REGISTRATION; FREQUENCY	AIM To identify electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers for the analgesic effect of pregabalin in patients with chronic visceral pain. METHODS This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 31 patients suffering from visceral pain due to chronic pancreatitis. Patients received increasing doses of pregabalin (75 mg-300 mg twice a day) or matching placebo during 3 weeks of treatment. Pain scores were documented in a diary based on a visual analogue scale. In addition, brief pain inventory-short form (BPI) and quality of life questionnaires were collected prior to and after the study period. Multi-channel resting EEG was recorded before treatment onset and at the end of the study. Changes in EEG spectral indices were extracted, and individual changes were classified by a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate the pregabalin and placebo responses. Changes in individual spectral indices and pain scores were correlated. RESULTS Pregabalin increased normalized intensity in low spectral indices, most prominent in the theta band (3.5-7.5 Hz), difference of-3.18, 95% CI-3.57,-2.80; P = 0.03. No changes in spectral indices were seen for placebo. The maximum difference between pregabalin and placebo treated patients was seen in the parietal region, with a classification accuracy of 85.7% (P = 0.009). Individual changes in EEG indices were correlated with changes in pain diary (P = 0.04) and BPI pain composite scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Changes in spectral indices caused by slowing of brain oscillations were identified as a biomarker for the central analgesic effect of pregabalin. The developed methodology may provide perspectives to assess individual responses to treatment in personalized medicine.

Methods: We studied 19 photosensitive patients with IGE (16 women) showing a photoparoxysmal electroencephalographic (EEG) response (PPR). Twenty-two normal subjects of similar age and sex acted as controls (17 women). We recorded F-VEPs from occipital and central electrodes. Stimuli were single flashes, intermingled to flash pairs at the interstimulus interval (ISI) of 333, 125, 62.5, 50, 33, and 16.5 msec (i.e., at the internal frequency of 3, 8, 16, 20, 30, and 60 Hz). Recordings were done both with closed and open eyes. The single F-VEP was split into a "main complex" and a "late response," which were measured separately. As to paired stimuli, the "test" F-VEP emerged from electronic subtraction of the single F-VEP to the paired F-VEP. Grouped data were analyzed by means of nonparametric analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Key Findings: In patients, the single F-VEP showed some enhanced components in its early "main complex.'' Then, the "test" F-VEP behaved differently than controls, particularly if recorded with closed eyes, when the normal inhibition was abolished at given ISIs, corresponding to an internal frequency of 16-30 Hz. In patients with a posterior PPR, impaired inhibition was evident over the occipital region only, but in those with a widespread PPR, it also involved the central areas. Significance: The paired F-VEP technique documents a defective inhibition in the visual system of photosensitive patients with IGE, whose features and timing likely underlie the PPR origin.

Although several electrophysiological studies have explored reward processing in healthy individuals, such studies in alcohol-dependent individuals are quite rare. The present study examines theta oscillations during reward processing in abstinent alcoholics. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 38 abstinent alcoholics and 38 healthy controls as they performed a single outcome gambling task, which involved outcomes of either loss or gain of an amount (10 or 50e) that was bet. Event-related theta band (3.07.0 Hz) power following each outcome stimulus was computed using the S-transform method. Theta power at the time window of the outcome-related negativity (ORN) and positivity (ORP) (200500 ms) was compared across groups and outcome conditions. Additionally, behavioral data of impulsivity and task performance were analyzed. The alcoholic group showed significantly decreased theta power during reward processing compared to controls. Current source density (CSD) maps of alcoholics revealed weaker and diffuse source activity for all conditions and weaker bilateral prefrontal sources during the Loss 50 condition when compared with controls who manifested stronger and focused midline sources. Furthermore, alcoholics exhibited increased impulsivity and risk-taking on the behavioral measures. A strong association between reduced anterior theta power and impulsive task-performance was observed. It is suggested that decreased power and weaker and diffuse CSD in alcoholics may be due to dysfunctional neural reward circuitry. The relationship among alcoholism, theta oscillations, reward processing, and impulsivity could offer clues to understand brain circuitries that mediate reward processing and inhibitory control Hum Brain Mapp, 2011.

To examine changes in event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced brain oscillations of object repetition priming with aging, we recorded EEGs of healthy groups of young (n = 14; mean age = 29.93 years) and older adults (n = 15; mean age = 66.4). Both groups exhibited similar behavioral haptic priming across repetitions, although young adults responded faster than the older group. Young and older adults showed ERP repetition enhancement at the 500-900 ms time window. In contrast, only the young participants showed ERP repetition suppression at the 1200-1500 ms segment. The results from the induced oscillations showed more positive amplitudes in young than in older adults at theta, alpha and beta frequencies (4-30 Hz). In addition, we found amplitude modulation related to stimulus repetition in the upper alpha and low beta sub-bands only in young adults (1250-1750 ms).The results suggest that although behavioral priming is spared with age, normal aging affects ERPs and oscillatory responses when performing an incidental priming symmetry detection task with haptically explored objects.

Numerous EEG (magnetoencephalography) and local field potential (LFP) measurements have related cognitive functions to different types of brain oscillations, but the functional significance of these rhythms remains poorly understood. Despite its proven value, LFP activity has not been extensively tested in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP), which has been implicated in a wide variety of cognitive control processes. We recorded action potentials and LFPs in area LIP during delayed eye movement tasks and during a passive fixation task, in which the time schedule was fixed so that temporal expectations about task-relevant cues could be formed. LFP responses in the gamma band discriminated reliably between saccade targets and distractors inside the receptive field (RF). Alpha and beta responses were much less strongly affected by the presence of a saccade target, however, but rose sharply in the waiting period before the go signal. Surprisingly, conditions without visual stimulation of the LIP-RF-evoked robust LFP responses in every frequency band-most prominently in those below 50 Hz-precisely time-locked to the expected time of stimulus onset in the RF. These results indicate that in area LIP, oscillations in the LFP, which reflect synaptic input and local network activity, are tightly coupled to the temporal expectation of task-relevant cues.

J	Chakravarthi, R; VanRullen, R				Chakravarthi, Ramakrishna; VanRullen, Rufin			Conscious updating is a rhythmic process	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							WAGON-WHEEL ILLUSION; FLASH-LAG; ATTENTION; MOTION; EXTRAPOLATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; OBJECT; EXCITABILITY; EXPLANATION	As the visual world changes, its representation in our consciousness must be constantly updated. Given that the external changes are continuous, it appears plausible that conscious updating is continuous as well. Alternatively, this updating could be periodic, if, for example, its implementation at the neural level relies on oscillatory activity. The flash-lag illusion, where a briefly presented flash in the vicinity of a moving object is misperceived to lag behind the moving object, is a useful tool for studying the dynamics of conscious updating. Here, we show that the trial-by-trial variability in updating, measured by the flash-lag effect (FLE), is highly correlated with the phase of spontaneous EEG oscillations in occipital (5-10 Hz) and frontocentral (12-20 Hz) cortices just around the reference event (flash onset). Further, the periodicity in each region independently influences the updating process, suggesting a two-stage periodic mechanism. We conclude that conscious updating is not continuous; rather, it follows a rhythmic pattern.

Specifically, mid-frontal ERP components in the N2 time range and error-related negativity time range are parsimoniously characterized as reflections of theta band activities. Forty participants completed three different tasks with varying stimulusresponse demands. Permutation tests were used to identify the dominant timefrequency responses of stimulus- and response-locked conditions as well as the enhanced responses to novelty, conflict, punishment, and error. A dominant theta band feature was found in all conditions, and both ERP component amplitudes and theta power measures were similarly modulated by novelty, conflict, punishment, and error. The findings support the hypothesis that generic and reactive medial prefrontal cortex processes are parsimoniously reflected by theta band activities.

While recent studies in humans emphasized rhythmic modulations of neuronal oscillations ("second-order" rhythms), their potential involvement in information coding remains an open question. Here, we show that a rhythmic (similar to 0.7 Hz) modulation of hippocampal theta power, unraveled by second-order spectral analysis, supports encoding of spatial and behavioral information. The phase preference of neuronal discharge within this slow rhythm significantly increases the amount of information carried by action potentials in various motor/cognitive behaviors by (1) distinguishing between the spikes fired within versus outside the place field of hippocampal place cells, (2) disambiguating place firing of neurons having multiple place fields, and (3) predicting between alternative future spatial trajectories. This finding demonstrates the relevance of second-order spectral components of brain rhythms for decoding neuronal information.

J	Soleymani, M; Pantic, M; Pun, T				Soleymani, Mohammad; Pantic, Maja; Pun, Thierry			Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Response to Videos	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Emotion recognition; EEG; pupillary reflex; pattern classification; affective computing	PUPIL LIGHT REFLEX; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEMS	This paper presents a user-independent emotion recognition method with the goal of recovering affective tags for videos using electroencephalogram (EEG), pupillary response and gaze distance. We first selected 20 video clips with extrinsic emotional content from movies and online resources. Then, EEG responses and eye gaze data were recorded from 24 participants while watching emotional video clips. Ground truth was defined based on the median arousal and valence scores given to clips in a preliminary study using an online questionnaire. Based on the participants' responses, three classes for each dimension were defined. The arousal classes were calm, medium aroused, and activated and the valence classes were unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant. One of the three affective labels of either valence or arousal was determined by classification of bodily responses. A one-participant-out cross validation was employed to investigate the classification performance in a user-independent approach. The best classification accuracies of 68.5 percent for three labels of valence and 76.4 percent for three labels of arousal were obtained using a modality fusion strategy and a support vector machine. The results over a population of 24 participants demonstrate that user-independent emotion recognition can outperform individual self-reports for arousal assessments and do not underperform for valence assessments.

Moderating effects of music on resting state networks	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; Default mode network; Functional connectivity; Independent component analysis	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ROSTRAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN BRAIN; LOW-FREQUENCY; FMRI DATA; EEG; REGISTRATION	Resting state networks (RSNs) are spontaneous, synchronous, low-frequency oscillations observed in the brains of subjects who are awake but at rest. A particular RSN called the default mode network (DMN) has been shown to exhibit changes associated with neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have also found that differing experimental conditions such as eyes-open versus eyes-closed can produce measurable changes in the DMN. These condition-associated changes have the potential of confounding the measurements of changes in RSNs related to or caused by disease state(s). In this study, we use fMRI measurements of resting-state connectivity paired with EEG measurements of alpha rhythm and employ independent component analysis, undirected graphs of partial spectral coherence, and spatiotemporal regression to investigate the effect of music-listening on RSNs and the DMN in particular. We observed similar patterns of DMN connectivity in subjects who were listening to music compared with those who were not, with a trend toward a more introspective pattern of resting-state connectivity during music-listening. We conclude that music-listening is a valid condition under which the DMN can be studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed method is based on the fact that the frequency responses of WLD conform to the frequency properties of the studied signal. Thus, a suitable wavelet for the decomposition and the appropriate levels for the reconstruction required to extract the desired signal can be selected. The reverse biorthogonal wavelet of the order of 6.8 is suitable for decomposing conventionally averaged EEG recordings of the MMN activity of children elicited by an uninterrupted sound under the oddball paradigm. With seven-level decomposition, the coefficients of the fifth and sixth levels are appropriate for extracting the MMN from the averaged trace. Results show that WLD can be used to extract MMN with much better properties than those of that extracted by the difference wave or an optimal band-pass digital filter. The improved properties mean that the deviant stimuli with larger magnitude deviance in contrast to the standard stimuli can elicit the MN1N with a larger peak amplitude and a shorter latency. The proposed method can be used as a preprocessing step for multichannel data processing and for the study of other event-related potentials.

Resting EEG in alpha and beta bands predicts individual differences in attentional blink magnitude	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Attentional blink; Attention; Alpha; Beta; Individual differences; Resting EEG	SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION; TEMPORAL ATTENTION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; DEFAULT NETWORK; ABSOLUTE POWER; OSCILLATIONS; TASK; RHYTHM; FMRI; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Accuracy for a second target (T2) is reduced when it is presented within 500 ms of a first target (T1) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) - an attentional blink (AB). There are reliable individual differences in the magnitude of the AB. Recent evidence has shown that the attentional approach that an individual typically adopts during a task or in anticipation of a task, as indicated by various measures, predicts individual differences in the AB deficit. It has yet to be observed whether indices of attentional approach when not engaged in a goal-directed task are also relevant to individual differences in the AB. The current studies investigated individual differences in the AB by examining their relationship with attention at rest using quantitative measures of EEG. Greater levels of alpha at rest were associated with larger AB magnitudes, where greater levels of beta at rest were associated with smaller AB magnitudes. Furthermore, individuals with more beta than alpha demonstrated a smaller AB effect than individuals with more alpha than beta. Our results suggest that greater attentional engagement at rest, when not engaged in a goal-directed task, is associated with smaller AB magnitudes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Emotive interference during cognitive processing in major depression: An investigation of lower alpha 1 activity	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						EEG; Major depression; Lower alpha 1; Working memory; Emotional-cognitive interaction; Information processing bias	HAPPY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-ALPHA; EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; STIMULI; IMAGES	Background: Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) tend to be more susceptible to distraction by negative emotional material than their non-depressed counterparts. This extends to an enhanced vulnerability to interference from mood-congruent stimuli during cognitive processing. The current study investigated the electrophysiological correlates of competing cognitive and emotional processing demands in MDD. Methods: Event-related alpha activity within the lower alpha 1 band was examined during the online information retention phase of a non-emotive WM task with extraneous emotional stimuli (positive, negative and neutral) presented as background images. EEG activity over posterior parietal cortex was compared between 15 acutely depressed and 16 never depressed right-handed women. Results: A valence specific dissociation in lower alpha 1 activity was observed between the two groups, consistent with greater attentional resource allocation to positive distracters in control participants and to negative distracters in MDD participants. No group differences were seen when neutral distracters were displayed. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that activity within the lower alpha 1 band is sensitive to competing emotional and cognitive processing demands and highlight the importance of posterior parietal regions in depression-related susceptibility to affective distractibility during cognitive processing.

Performance Evaluation of Classifiers for Detection of Alcoholics Using Electroencephalograms (EEG)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Gamma Band; Spectral Entropy; Autoregressive (AR) Model; Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC); Eigenvector; Back Propagation Neural Network; Probabilistic Neural Network; Support Vector Machines	OSCILLATIONS; ENTROPY; RISK	This paper suggests an automated detection of alcoholics and controls using Electroencephalograms (EEG). EEG signals are recorded from healthy and alcoholic subjects during visual object recognition task. Threshold of 100 mu V is used to remove the eye blink artifact and the gamma sub band (30-50 Hz) is extracted using elliptic band pass filter of 6th order. Different classical (spectral entropy), model based (power spectral density (PSD) estimation by Burg autoregressive (AR) model and eigenvector PSD estimation methods (MUSIC) in frequency domain are used as feature selection parameters. Three classification models such as feed forward Back propagation neural network (BPNN), Probabilistic neural network (PNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) networks are used to classify alcoholics and control subjects. The performances of BPNN and PNN classifiers are evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and holdout cross validation is performed to evaluate SVM classifier. Results show that model based and eigenvector based feature extraction methods are more accurate and sensitive than the conventional method such as spectral entropy estimation method to discriminate alcoholics from healthy controls. The SVM and PNN classifiers perform better than the BPNN classifier in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity. However to achieve high classification accuracy, SVM does not require either the preprocessing of the input signal as in BPNN classifier or the tuning of the spread factor as in PNN classifier. Hence among the three classifiers used in this work, SVM seems to be an optimal classifier for classifying alcoholics and healthy subjects.	[Shri, T. K.

Little is known about ictal autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity changes in epilepsy and PNES. This study compares ictal heart rate variability (HRV) parameters as a reflection of ANS tone in epileptic seizures and PNES, and explores differences between interictal and ictal ANS tone in both patient groups. Methods: Ictal HRV parameters were extracted from single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) data collected during video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 26 patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and 24 age-and sex-matched patients with PNES. One seizure per patient in a resting, wake, supine state was analyzed. Interictal ECG data were available for comparison from 14 patients in both groups. HRV parameters in time and frequency domains were analyzed (low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], standard deviation of all consecutive normal R wave intervals [SDNN], square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R wave intervals [RMSSD]). CVI (cardiovagal index), CSI (cardiosympathetic index), and ApEn (approximate entropy) were calculated from Lorenz plots. Key Findings: There were significant differences between ictal HRV measures during epileptic and nonepileptic seizures in the time and frequency domains. CSI (p < 0.001) was higher in epileptic seizures. Time interval between two consecutive R waves in the ECG (RR interval) (p = 0.002), LF (p = 0.02), HF (p = 0.003), and RMSSD (p = 0.003) were significantly lower during epileptic seizures. Binary logistic regression yielded a significant model based on the differences in CSI classifying 88% of patients with epilepsy and 73% of patients with PNES correctly. The comparison between resting and ictal states in both seizure disorders revealed significant differences in RR interval (epilepsy p < 0.001, PNES p = 0.01), CSI (epilepsy p < 0.001, PNES p = 0.02), HF (epilepsy p = 0.002, PNES p = 0.03), and RMSSD (epilepsy p = 0.004, PNES p = 0.04). In patients with epilepsy there were also significant differences in ictal versus interictal mean values of ApEn (p = 0.03) and LF (p = 0.04). Although CSI was significantly higher, the other parameters were lower during the seizures. Stepwise binary regression in the 14 patients with epilepsy produced a significant model differentiating resting state from seizures in 100% of cases. The same statistical approach did not yield a significant model in the PNES group. Significance: Our results show greater ANS activation in epileptic seizures than in PNES. The biggest ictal HRV changes associated with epileptic seizures (CSI, HF, and RMSSD) reflect high sympathetic system activation and reduced vagal tone. The reduced ApEn also reflects a high sympathetic tone. The observed ictal alterations of HRV patterns may be a more specific marker of epileptic seizures than heart rate changes alone. These altered HRV patterns could be used to detect seizures and also to differentiate epileptic seizures from PNES. Larger studies are justified with intergroup and intragroup comparisons between ictal and resting states.

Synchronous Oscillatory Neural Ensembles for Rules in the Prefrontal Cortex	NEURON			English	Article							HUMAN CORTICOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TOP-DOWN; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FRONTAL LOBES	Intelligent behavior requires acquiring and following rules. Rules define how our behavior should fit different situations. To understand its neural mechanisms, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) while monkeys switched between two rules (respond to color versus orientation). We found evidence that oscillatory synchronization of local field potentials (LFPs) formed neural ensembles representing the rules: there were rule-specific increases in synchrony at "beta" (19-40 Hz) frequencies between electrodes. In addition, individual PFC neurons synchronized to the LFP ensemble corresponding to the current rule (color versus orientation). Furthermore, the ensemble encoding the behaviorally dominant orientation rule showed increased "alpha" (6-16 Hz) synchrony when preparing to apply the alternative (weaker) color rule. This suggests that beta-frequency synchrony selects the relevant rule ensemble, while alpha-frequency synchrony deselects a stronger, but currently irrelevant, ensemble. Synchrony may act to dynamically shape task-relevant neural ensembles out of larger, overlapping circuits.

Double-Blind Single-Session Neurofeedback Training in Upper-Alpha for Cognitive Enhancement of Healthy Subjects	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			NORMATIVE DATA; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE	This paper reports on a single-session neurofeedback (NF) training procedure on the user-specific upper alpha band for cognitive enhancement in healthy users. A double-blind study was designed using a NF group and an active control group. Control group performed as the NF group but received sham feedback, minimizing the non-specific factors of training. This design aimed to (i) investigate upper alpha as a NF parameter, (i i) evaluate the NF effects on upper alpha during the execution of a cognitive task, and (i i i) evaluate the effects on cognitive performance by means of a cognitive task and a battery of psychological tests. Results of EEG analysis show the key role of the feedback: only the NF group enhanced upper alpha during the training, and it led to a desynchronization increase during the execution of the cognitive task. Regarding the behavioral results, a strong learning effect was observed, with the NF group performing better in almost all measurements but many of them without statistical significance.

Eleven healthy volunteers (M age = 23.8 yr., SD = 3.1) participated in this study which was conducted over two consecutive nights: an adaptation night and the experimental night. They underwent a visual discrimination task before and after the experimental night. A positive correlation was observed between overnight performance improvement on the visual discrimination task and EEG alpha band power during REM sleep, while no significant correlation was observed between the performance and either the amount of Stage REM sleep, REM activity or other sleep variables. The findings corroborate other studies and suggest that cortical activity during REM sleep contributed to procedural memory consolidation and highlights the importance of measuring quantitative REM sleep components to elucidate the role of physiological sleep on memory consolidation in humans.

Besides, duration, depth and continuity, sleep restorative properties depend on the capacity of the brain to create periods of sustained stable sleep. This issue is not confined only to the EEG activities but reverberates upon the ongoing autonomic activity and behavioral functions, which are mutually entrained in a synchronized oscillation. CAP can be identified both in adult and children sleep and therefore represents a sensitive tool for the investigation of sleep disorders across the lifespan. The present review illustrates the story of CAP in the last 25 years, the standardized scoring criteria, the basic physiological properties and how the dimension of sleep instability has provided new insight into pathophysiolology and management of sleep disorders.

Subchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in EEG, cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in mice	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						NMDA; GFAP; Schizophrenia; EAAT; Glt-1; Auditory evoked potential; Drug abuse; Glutamate	RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION MODEL; D-ASPARTATE-RECEPTOR; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; EPISODIC MEMORY; COCAINE; RAT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HIPPOCAMPUS; RETRIEVAL; EXPOSURE	Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic, dissociative, amnestic and euphoric effects. When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6 month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.

Noninvasively Decoding the Contents of Visual Working Memory in the Human Prefrontal Cortex within High-gamma Oscillatory Patterns	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; PHASE; HIPPOCAMPUS	The temporal maintenance and subsequent retrieval of information that no longer exists in the environment is called working memory. It is believed that this type of memory is controlled by the persistent activity of neuronal populations, including the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. For a long time, it has been controversially discussed whether, in working memory, the PFC stores past sensory events or, instead, its activation is an extramnemonic source of top-down control over posterior regions. Recent animal studies suggest that specific information about the contents of working memory can be decoded from population activity in prefrontal areas. However, it has not been shown whether the contents of working memory during the delay periods can be decoded from EEG recordings in the human brain. We show that by analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of EEG oscillatory patterns it is possible to noninvasively decode with high accuracy, during encoding and maintenance periods, the contents of visual working memory information within high-gamma oscillations in the human PFC. These results are thus in favor of an active storage function of the human PFC in working memory; this, without ruling out the role of PFC in top-down processes. The ability to noninvasively decode the contents of workingmemory is promising in applications such as brain computer interfaces, together with computation of value function during planning and decision making processes.

J	Kocsis, B				Kocsis, Bernat			State-Dependent Increase of Cortical Gamma Activity during REM Sleep after Selective Blockade of NR2B Subunit Containing NMDA Receptors	SLEEP			English	Article						Gamma oscillation; paradoxical sleep; MK-801; ketamine	IN-VITRO; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; MESSENGER-RNA; HIPPOCAMPAL; MK-801; RAT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; KETAMINE; NUCLEUS	Study Objectives: Sub-anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonists suppress sleep and elicit continuous high-power gamma oscillations lasting for hours. This effect is subunit-specific, as it was also seen after preferential blockade of the NR2A but not of the NR2B subunit-containing receptors. The objective of this study was to test whether NR2B receptor antagonists that do not induce lasting aberrant gamma elevation affect gamma activity during specific behaviors and states, including REM sleep, when gamma normally occurs. Design: Gamma oscillations in cortical EEG were assessed in different vigilance states in rats and were compared before and after injection of nonselective (ketamine, 10 mg/kg, and MK801, 0.2 mg/kg), as well as NR2A-preferring (NVP-AAM077, 20 mg/kg), and NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonists (Ro25-6985, 10 mg), and vehicle. Measurements and Results: In contrast to nonselective and NR2A-preferring antagonists, Ro25-6985 did not disrupt sleep and had no effect on gamma activity during waking and slow wave sleep. It significantly increased, however, gamma power in the frontal (but not in occipital) cortex during REM sleep (by 37% +/- 10%, average in the first 4 h). The effect had a short onset; enhanced gamma activity appeared as early as in the first REM sleep episode post-injection and lasted over 8 hours. Increased gamma power induced by MK-801 (46% +/- 5%) and NVP-AAM077 (100% +/- 8%) during REM sleep could also be detected several hours after injection when periodic alternation of sleep-wake states returned. Conclusions: By acting on gamma oscillations in a state-dependent manner, NMDA receptors might have subunit-specific role in REM sleep-associated cognitive processes.

The Importance of Single Trials: Temporal and Spatial Resolution in Event-Related Potential Research	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; EEG; MECHANISMS; PERSONALITY; APPEARANCE	In event-related potential (ERP) research, the average potential over many trials is a useful measure, but it obscures temporal variability across trials that may be functionally significant. Familiar ERP components have been shown to reflect the phase shifting of oscillatory activity that is present in varying degrees before the event. Even with single trials, understanding the underlying neural activity may require methods of dealing with the spatial superposition of neural signals at the head surface electrodes. We conclude with an illustration in which the modulation of averaged ERPs by trait anxiety may be related to underlying sources of theta oscillations.

It refers to that branch of Science aimed at exploring the Neurosciences through an ongoing process continuously renewed at each successive step of its advancement towards understanding the brain in its entirety. This chapter presents a neuroheuristic approach to the decision making process, firstly in an animal experiment, in an attempt to investigate the basic processes away from an anthropological perspective, and secondly in a classical neuroeconomic paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG). Multiple electrodes for multiple neuronal recordings were chronically implanted in cerebral cortical areas of freely-moving rats trained in a response choice task. Invariant preferred firing sequences appeared in association with the response predicted by the subject or in association with specific errors of decision. We recorded EEG and analyzed event-related potentials of subjects in a two conditions variant of UG where human players acted either as proposers with computer-controlled virtual partners or as responders to offers made by a virtual proposer. A proposer, in contrast to a responder, has to store the future proposed value in short-term memory and engage retrieval processes after getting the responder's reaction. Our EEG results support the hypothesis that while playing the role of proposers human subjects engage in a specific retrieval process while performing UG.	[Villa, Alessandro E.

Alpha phase locking seems to reflect the timing in the cortical process. In a previous study, lower alpha ERD was related to working memory in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients than in controls during the retention and retrival phases, but not in the encoding phase. However, memory deficits in OCD patients are known to be related to executive failure during the encoding phase. Thus, focusing on the encoding phase, we tested the level of alpha amplitude and phase locking in OCD patients according to memory load. The EEGs of fifteen OCD patients and fifteen controls were recorded during a Sternberg working memory task. The behavioral performance of the OCD patients was normal. However, the OCD group yielded significantly lower ERD and stronger phase locking. As memory load rose, ERD and phase locking significantly increased in both groups. A difference in event-related alpha oscillation was observed in the encoding phase. Lower alpha modulation in the OCD patient simplied abnormality of the excitatory/inhibitory process in the brain, and increased phase locking might reflect excessive attentional excitability.

J	Crespo-Garcia, M; Cantero, JL; Atienza, M				Crespo-Garcia, Maite; Cantero, Jose L.; Atienza, Mercedes			Effects of semantic relatedness on age-related associative memory deficits: The role of theta oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Aging; Associative memory; Theta oscillations; Neural inefficiency; Neural compensation	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; OLDER-ADULTS; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PARIETAL CORTEX	Growing evidence suggests that age-related deficits in associative memory are alleviated when the to-be-associated items are semantically related. Here we investigate whether this beneficial effect of semantic relatedness is paralleled by spatio-temporal changes in cortical EEG dynamics during incidental encoding. Young and older adults were presented with faces at a particular spatial location preceded by a biographical cue that was either semantically related or unrelated. As expected, automatic encoding of face-location associations benefited from semantic relatedness in the two groups of age. This effect correlated with increased power of theta oscillations over medial and anterior lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lateral regions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in both groups. But better-performing elders also showed increased brain-behavior correlation in the theta band over the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as compared to young adults. Semantic relatedness was, however, insufficient to fully eliminate age-related differences in associative memory. In line with this finding, poorer-performing elders relative to young adults showed significant reductions of theta power in the left IFG that were further predictive of behavioral impairment in the recognition task. All together, these results suggest that older adults benefit less than young adults from executive processes during encoding mainly due to neural inefficiency over regions of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). But this associative deficit may be partially compensated for by engaging preexistent semantic knowledge, which likely leads to an efficient recruitment of attentional and integration processes supported by the left PPC and left anterior PFC respectively, together with neural compensatory mechanisms governed by the right VLPFC.

Control of Sleep and Wakefulness. Physiol Rev 92: 1087-1187, 2012; doi:10.1152/physrev.00032.2011.-This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.

Their activation protects the articulations and facilitates movement accuracy, but despite these fundamental roles, little is known about the brain mechanisms underlying their control. In view of previous studies that showed lesser antagonist muscles activation in participants engaged in regular strength training (ST) than in participants actively engaged in endurance disciplines (ED), we used this between-group comparison to investigate the possible role of motor cortex activity on the control of antagonist muscles. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity as well as the net joint torque were recorded, while ten ST and eleven ED participants performed isometric knee muscles exertions at different force levels. EEG data showed a linear increase in the suppression of cortical oscillations in the 21-31 Hz frequency band with increasing force level in ST but not in ED participants. This effect was associated with lesser EMG activation of the antagonist muscles in ST than in ED participants, the difference between groups also increasing with the force level. Both effects were found specifically during flexion exertions, indicating that ST participants developed sharp central adaptations to control the antagonist muscles involved as prime movers in their usual training task. This result suggests that the cortical adaptations induced by regular strength training could exert a specific encoding of the antagonist muscles, leading to the minimization of their activation and improved energetic efficiency of the muscle contraction.

Animal studies have revealed new insights into the mechanisms by which mutations in this gene, encoding the type I voltage-gated sodium channel (Na(v)1.1), may lead to seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we further consider the function of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons, one cell type particularly affected by these mutations, in the context of the temporal coordination of neural activity subserving cognitive functions. We hypothesize that disruptions in GABAergic firing may directly contribute to the poor cognitive outcomes in children with DS, and discuss the therapeutic implications of this possibility.

Decoupling of Sleep-Dependent Cortical and Hippocampal Interactions in a Neurodevelopmental Model of Schizophrenia	NEURON			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; ADULT RATS; OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLES; DISRUPTION; DEFICITS; RIPPLES	Rhythmic neural network activity patterns are defining features of sleep, but interdependencies between limbic and cortical oscillations at different frequencies and their functional roles have not been fully resolved. This is particularly important given evidence linking abnormal sleep architecture and memory consolidation in psychiatric diseases. Using EEG, local field potential (LFP), and unit recordings in rats, we show that anteroposterior propagation of neocortical slow-waves coordinates timing of hippocampal ripples and prefrontal cortical spindles during NREM sleep. This coordination is selectively disrupted in a rat neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: fragmented NREM sleep and impaired slow-wave propagation in the model culminate in deficient ripple-spindle coordination and disrupted spike timing, potentially as a consequence of interneuronal abnormalities reflected by reduced parvalbumin expression. These data further define the interrelationships among slow-wave, spindle, and ripple events, indicating that sleep disturbances may be associated with state-dependent decoupling of hippocampal and cortical circuits in psychiatric diseases.

High-frequency neural activity and human cognition: Past, present and possible future of intracranial EEG research	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Electrocorticography; ECoG; High gamma; Functional mapping; Oscillations; Gamma	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC GAMMA ACTIVITY; DEPTH-RECORDED POTENTIALS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED CAUSALITY; OSCILLATIONS 100-500 HZ; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY	Human intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are primarily performed in epileptic patients for presurgical mapping. When patients perform cognitive tasks, iEEG signals reveal high-frequency neural activities (HFAs, between around 40 Hz and 150 Hz) with exquisite anatomical, functional and temporal specificity. Such HFAs were originally interpreted in the context of perceptual or motor binding, in line with animal studies on gamma-band ('40 Hz') neural synchronization. Today, our understanding of HFA has evolved into a more general index of cortical processing: task-induced HFA reveals, with excellent spatial and time resolution, the participation of local neural ensembles in the task-at-hand, and perhaps the neural communication mechanisms allowing them to do so. This review promotes the claim that studying HFA with iEEG provides insights into the neural bases of cognition that cannot be derived as easily from other approaches, such as fMRI. We provide a series of examples supporting that claim, drawn from studies on memory, language and default-mode networks, and successful attempts of real-time functional mapping. These examples are followed by several guidelines for HFA research, intended for new groups interested by this approach. Overall, iEEG research on HFA should play an increasing role in cognitive neuroscience in humans, because it can be explicitly linked to basic research in animals. We conclude by discussing the future evolution of this field, which might expand that role even further, for instance through the use of multi-scale electrodes and the fusion of iEEG with MEG and fMRI.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) from sensorimotor cortex and electromyogram (EMG) from two intrinsic hand muscles were recorded during a key grip motor task, and the modulation of CMC caused by afferent electrical and mechanical stimulation was measured. The particular stimuli used were graded single-pulse electrical stimuli, above threshold for perception and activating cutaneous afferents, applied to the dominant or non-dominant index finger, and a pulsed mechanical displacement of the gripped object causing the subject to feel as if the object may be dropped. Following electrical stimulation of the dominant index finger, the level of beta-range (14-36 Hz) CMC was reduced in a stimulus intensity-dependent fashion for up to 400 ms post-stimulus, then returned with greater magnitude before falling to baseline levels over 2.5 s, outlasting the reflex and evoked changes in EMG and EEG. Subjects showing no baseline beta-range CMC nevertheless showed post-stimulus increases in beta-range CMC with the same time course as those with baseline beta-range CMC. The mechanical stimuli produced similar modulation of beta-range CMC. Electrical stimuli to the non-dominant index finger produced no significant increase in beta-range CMC. The results suggest that both cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents have access to circuits generating CMC, but that only a functionally relevant stimulus produces significant modulation of the background beta-range CMC, providing further evidence that beta-range CMC has an important role in sensorimotor integration.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Evoked potentials; High-frequency oscillations; Single-trial analysis; Phase-reset; Added-activity; Detectability analysis	SEP COMPONENTS; EEG; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCALIZATION; GENERATION; MYOCLONUS; RESPONSES; WAVELETS; NOISE	Objective: Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) contain a brief oscillatory wavelet burst at about 600 Hz (r-burst) superimposed on the initial cortical component (N20). While invasive single-cell recordings suggested that this burst is generated by increased neuronal spiking activity in area 3b, recent non-invasive scalp recordings could not reveal concomitant single-trial added-activity, suggesting that the SEP burst might instead be generated by phase-reset of ongoing high-frequency EEG. Here, a statistical model and exemplary data are presented reconciling these seemingly contradictory results. Methods: A statistical model defined the conditions required to detect added-activity in a set of single-trial SEP. Its predictions were tested by analyzing human single-trial scalp SEP recorded with custom-made low-noise amplifiers. Results: The noise level in previous studies did not allow to detect single-trial added-activity in the period concomitant with the trial-averaged r-burst. In contrast, optimized low-noise recordings do reveal added-activity in a set of single-trials. Conclusions: The experimental noise level is the decisive factor determining the detectability of added-activity in single-trials. A low-noise experiment provided direct evidence that the SEP r-burst is at least partly generated by added-activity matching earlier invasive single-cell recordings. Significance: Quantitative criteria are provided for the feasibility of single-trial detectability of band-limited added-activity. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: We studied 13 epileptic patients who underwent language mapping using event-related gamma-oscillations on ECoG and stimulation via subdural electrodes. Sites showing significant gamma-augmentation during an auditory-naming task were defined as language-related ECoG sites. Sites at which stimulation resulted in auditory perceptual changes, failure to verbalize a correct answer, or sensorimotor symptoms involving the mouth were defined as language-related stimulation sites. We determined how frequently these methods revealed language-related sites in the superior-temporal, inferior-frontal, dorsolateral-premotor, and inferior-Rolandic regions. Results: Language-related sites in the superior-temporal and inferior-frontal gyri were detected by ECoG more frequently than stimulation (p < 0.05), while those in the dorsolateral-premotor and inferior-Rolandic regions were detected by both methods equally. Stimulation of language-related ECoG sites, compared to the others, more frequently elicited language symptoms (p < 0.00001). One patient developed dysphasia requiring in-patient speech therapy following resection of the dorsolateral-premotor and inferior-Rolandic regions containing language-related ECoG sites not otherwise detected by stimulation. Conclusions: Language-related gamma-oscillations may serve as an alternative biomarker of underlying language function in patients with left-hemispheric language-dominance. Significance: Measurement of language-related gamma-oscillations is warranted in presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The function of non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), the largest portion of sleep by time, is uncertain. However, one salient feature of NREMS is a significant reduction in the rate of cerebral glucose utilization relative to wakefulness(2-4). This and other findings have led to the widely held belief that sleep serves a function related to cerebral metabolism. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism during NREMS remain to be elucidated. One phenomenon associated with NREMS that might impact cerebral metabolic rate is the occurrence of slow waves, oscillations at frequencies less than 4 Hz, in the electroencephalogram(5,6). These slow waves detected at the level of the skull or cerebral cortical surface reflect the oscillations of underlying neurons between a depolarized/up state and a hyperpolarized/down state(7). During the down state, cells do not undergo action potentials for intervals of up to several hundred milliseconds. Restoration of ionic concentration gradients subsequent to action potentials represents a significant metabolic load on the cell(8); absence of action potentials during down states associated with NREMS may contribute to reduced metabolism relative to wake. Two technical challenges had to be addressed in order for this hypothetical relationship to be tested. First, it was necessary to measure cerebral glycolytic metabolism with a temporal resolution reflective of the dynamics of the cerebral EEG (that is, over seconds rather than minutes). To do so, we measured the concentration of lactate, the product of aerobic glycolysis, and therefore a readout of the rate of glucose metabolism in the brains of mice. Lactate was measured using a lactate oxidase based real time sensor embedded in the frontal cortex. The sensing mechanism consists of a platinum-iridium electrode surrounded by a layer of lactate oxidase molecules. Metabolism of lactate by lactate oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide, which produces a current in the platinum-iridium electrode. So a ramping up of cerebral glycolysis provides an increase in the concentration of substrate for lactate oxidase, which then is reflected in increased current at the sensing electrode. It was additionally necessary to measure these variables while manipulating the excitability of the cerebral cortex, in order to isolate this variable from other facets of NREMS. We devised an experimental system for simultaneous measurement of neuronal activity via the elecetroencephalogram, measurement of glycolytic flux via a lactate biosensor, and manipulation of cerebral cortical neuronal activity via optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons. We have utilized this system to document the relationship between sleep-related electroencephalographic waveforms and the moment-to-moment dynamics of lactate concentration in the cerebral cortex. The protocol may be useful for any individual interested in studying, in freely behaving rodents, the relationship between neuronal activity measured at the electroencephalographic level and cellular energetics within the brain.

Few studies have probed the neurocortical correlates of dysfunctional anger or assessed if cognitive processes, such as attention, are altered in dysfunctional anger. Though dysfunctional and high trait anger appears to be associated with biased processing of anger-eliciting information, few studies have examined if dysfunctional anger modulates attention more generally. This is a notable gap as volitional attention control is associated with effective emotive regulation, which is impaired in dysfunctional anger and in associated acts of aggression. In this pilot study, we examined performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) profiles during a 12-min continuous performance task (CPT) of sustained attention in 15 adults with dysfunctional anger (Anger group) and 14 controls (control group). The Anger group had fewer hits at the end of the CPT, which correlated with decreased frontocortical activation, suggesting decreased engagement of frontal circuits when attention is taxed. The Anger group had more false alarms overall indicating impaired response inhibition. Increased right cortical activation during the initial portion of CPT existed in the Anger group, perhaps reflecting greater engagement of frontal circuits (i.e. effort) during initial stages of the task compared to controls. Finally, increased overall beta1 power, suggesting increased cortical activation, was noted in the Anger group. These EEG patterns suggest a hypervigilant state in dysfunctional anger, which may interfere with effective attention control and decrease inhibition. Such impairments likely extend beyond the laboratory setting, and may associate with aggressive acts in real life. Aggr. Behav. 38:469-480, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The myth of the 'unaffected' side after unilateral stroke: Is reorganisation of the non-infarcted corticospinal system to re-establish balance the price for recovery?	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Motor; Stroke; Corticospinal; Homeostatic plasticity; Recovery; EEG; EMC; Corticomuscular coherence; Symmetry; Reorganisation	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; HEMISPHERIC STROKE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PLASTICITY; COHERENCE; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Bilateral changes in the hemispheric reorganisation have been observed chronically after unilateral stroke. Our hypotheses were that activity dependent competition between the lesioned and non-lesioned corticospinal systems would result in persisting asymmetry and be associated with poor recovery. Methods: Eleven subjects (medium 6.5 years after stroke) were compared to 9 age-matched controls. The power spectral density (PSD) of the sensorimotor electroencephalogram (SM1-EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and corticomuscular coherence (CMC) were studied during rest and isometric contraction of right or left opponens pollicis (OP). Global recovery was assessed using NIH score. Findings: There was bilateral loss of beta frequency activity in the SM1-EEGs and OP-EMGs in strokes compared to controls. There was no difference between strokes and controls in symmetry indices estimated between the two corticospinal systems for SM1-EEG, OP-EMG and CMC. Performance correlated with preservation of beta frequency power in OP-EMG in both hands. Symmetry indices for the SM1-EEG. OP-EMG and CMC correlated with recovery. Interpretation: Significant changes occurred at both cortical and spinomuscular levels after stroke but to the same degree and in the same direction in both the lesioned and non-lesioned corticospinal systems. Global recovery correlated with the degree of symmetry between corticospinal systems at all three levels - cortical and spinomuscular levels and their connectivity (CMC), but not with the absolute degree of abnormality. Reestablishing balance between the corticospinal systems may be important for overall motor function, even if it is achieved at the expense of the non-lesioned system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Focal administration of neuropeptide Y into the S2 somatosensory cortex maximally suppresses absence seizures in a genetic rat model	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Generalized epilepsy; Genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg; Somatosensory cortex; Thalamocortical circuit	WAVE DISCHARGES; Y-2 RECEPTORS; EPILEPSY; THALAMUS; NEURONS; ETHOSUXIMIDE; TRANSMISSION; OSCILLATIONS; EXPRESSION; INITIATE	Purpose: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses focal and generalized seizures in animal models. In this study, we investigated the sites within the thalamocortical circuit that NPY acts to suppress seizures in genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Methods: In conscious freely moving GAERS, NPY was administered via intracerebral microcannulae implanted bilaterally into one of the following regions: primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), the primary motor cortex (M1), caudal nucleus reticular thalamus (nRT), or ventrobasal thalamus (VB). Animals received vehicle and up to three doses of NPY, in a randomized order. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were carried out for 30 min prior to injection and 90 min after the injection of NPY or vehicle. Key Findings: Focal microinjections of NPY into the S2 cortex suppressed seizures in a dose-dependent manner, with the response being significantly different at the highest dose (1.5 mM) compared to vehicle for total time in seizures postinjection (7.2 +/- 3.0% of saline, p < 0.01) and average number of seizures (9.4 +/- 4.9% of saline, p < 0.05). In contrast NPY microinjections into the VB resulted in an aggravation of seizures. Significance: NPY produces contrasting effects on absence-like seizures in GAERS depending on the site of injection within the thalamocortical circuit. The S2 is the site at which NPY most potently acts to suppress absence-like seizures in GAERS, whereas seizure-aggravating effects are seen in the VB. These results provide further evidence to support the proposition that these electroclinically "generalized'' seizures are being driven by a topographically restricted region within the somatosensory cortex.

Methods Five patients with cervical dystonia who underwent bilateral GPi deep brain stimulation (DBS) were studied. Local field potentials from the GPi DBS electrodes and EEG were recorded while the patients performed externally triggered and self-initiated right wrist movements. Results Movement related potentials were recorded at the GPi bilaterally before the onset of self-initiated but not externally triggered movements. In all movements studied, frequency analysis revealed a similar to 10-24 Hz beta event related desynchronisation at bilateral GPi and with EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz) and the bilateral sensorimotor cortical regions (C3/C4-Cz). A similar to 64-68 Hz, gamma event related synchronisation was found with EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz), the sensorimotor cortices (C3-Cz) and the GPi contralateral to movements. Both beta event related desynchronisation and gamma event related synchronisation occurred before the onset of self-initiated movements and at the onset of externally triggered movements. There was a resting similar to 5-18 Hz coherence between the bilateral GPi, which attenuated for similar to 1 s during movements. Gamma coherences were observed between EEG recorded over the mid-frontal (Cz-Fz), contralateral sensorimotor cortices (C3-Cz) and the GPi from 0 to 0.5 s after movement onset for externally triggered movements and from 0.5 s before to 0.5 s after movement onset for self-initiated movements. Conclusions The beta and gamma frequency bands in the GPi are modulated by the preparation of self-initiated movements and the execution of self-initiated and externally triggered movements. The 5-18 Hz coherence at the bilateral GPi may be related to dystonia and its attenuation may facilitate voluntary movements.

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, including the pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA), has been implicated in the internally generated aspects of action planning, such as choice and intention. Yet, the mechanism by which this area interacts with other cognitive brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a central node in decision-making, is still unclear. To shed light on this mechanism, brain activity was measured via fMRI and intracranial EEG in two studies during the performance of visually cued repeated finger tapping in which the choice of finger was guided by either a presented number (external) or self-choice (internal). A functional-MRI (fMRI) study in 15 healthy participants demonstrated that the pre-SMA, compared to the SMA proper, was more active and also more functionally correlated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during internally compared to externally guided action planning (p < 0.05, random effect). In a similar manner, an intracranial-EEG study in five epilepsy patients showed greater inter-regional gamma-related connectivity between electrodes situated in medial and lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex for internally compared to externally guided actions. Although this finding was observed for groups of electrodes situated both in the pre-SMA and SMA-proper, increased intra-cluster gamma-related connectivity was only observed for the pre-SMA (sign-test, p < 0.0001). Overall our findings provide multi-scale indications for the involvement of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and especially the pre-SMA, in generating internally guided motor planning. Our intracranial-EEG results further point to enhanced functional connectivity between decision-making- and motor planning aspects of the PFC, as a possible neural mechanism for internally generated action planning.

Here, we examined whether the observation of different types of hand movements (target directed, non-target directed, cyclic and non-cyclic) elicits different EEG cortical temporal patterns. Methodology: Video-clips of four types of hand movements were shown to right-handed healthy participants. Two were target directed (grasping and pointing) motor acts; two were non-target directed (supinating and clenching) movements. Grasping and supinating were performed once, while pointing and clenching twice (cyclic movements). High-density EEG was recorded and analyzed by means of wavelet transform, subdividing the time course in time bins of 200 ms. The observation of all presented movements produced a desynchronization of alpha and beta rhythms in central and parietal regions. The rhythms desynchronized as soon as the hand movement started, the nadir being reached around 700 ms after movement onset. At the end of the movement, a large power rebound occurred for all bands. Target and non-target directed movements produced an alpha band desynchronization in the central electrodes at the same time, but with a stronger desynchronization and a prolonged rebound for target directed motor acts. Most interestingly, there was a clear correlation between the velocity profile of the observed movements and beta band modulation. Significance: Our data show that the observation of motor acts determines a modulation of cortical rhythm analogous to that occurring during motor act execution. In particular, the cortical motor system closely follows the velocity of the observed movements. This finding provides strong evidence for the presence in humans of a mechanism (mirror mechanism) mapping action observation on action execution motor programs.

However, it is not yet clear to what extent this presumed gating function of alpha activity also applies to the processing of pain. In the current study, a spatial attention paradigm was employed requiring subjects to attend to painful laser stimuli on one hand while ignoring stimuli on the other hand. Simultaneously, brain activity was recorded with MEG. In order to disentangle pre- and post-stimulus effects of attention, alpha activity was analyzed during time windows in anticipation of and in response to painful laser stimulation. Painful laser stimuli led to a suppression of alpha activity over both ipsi- and contralateral primary somatosensory areas irrespective if they were attended or ignored. Spatial attention was associated with a lateralization of anticipatory pre-stimulus alpha activity. Alpha activity was lower over primary somatosensory areas when the contralateral hand was attended compared to when the ipsilateral hand was attended, in line with the notion that oscillatory alpha activity regulates the flow of incoming information by engaging and/or disengaging early sensory areas. On the contrary, post-stimulus alpha activity, for stimuli on either hand, was consistently decreased with attention over contralateral areas. Most likely, this finding reflects an increased cortical activation and enhanced alerting if a painful stimulus is attended. The present results show that spatial attention results in a modulation of both pre- and post-stimulus alpha activity associated with pain. This flexible regulation of alpha activity matches findings from other modalities. We conclude that the assumed functional role of alpha activity as a top-down controlled gating mechanism includes pain processing and most likely represents a unified mechanism used throughout the brain.

Developmental and aging theories suggest that deficient inhibitory control processes in children and older adults may underlie the lower performance relative to younger adults. Recently, oscillatory alpha power (7-13 Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been suggested as a neural marker of inhibition processes contributing to WM performance (Sauseng et al., 2009). We examined 20 children (10-13 years), 12 younger adults (20-26 years), and 20 older adults (70-76 years) in a cued change-detection paradigm. Behaviorally, we observed the expected lifespan peak in younger adults. EEG alpha power was generally reduced in older adults compared to children and younger adults. In line with previous research, hemispheric differences in alpha power related to attention and WM processes during the retention interval increased with load in younger adults. In children and older adults, lateralized alpha power increased from low to medium load conditions, but decreased for high load conditions. Furthermore, older adults showed higher inter-trial phase stability shortly after stimulus onset compared to children and younger adults. Our results show that inhibitory control processes as indexed by local alpha power modulations can be observed in children and older adults but seem to break down when WM load is high. In addition, older adults are more entrained by external stimulation what may increase a need for inhibitory control during later processing. We conclude that differences in inhibitory control processes and information uptake as reflected in amplitude modulations and inter-trial phase stability of alpha rhythms interactively determine WM constraints across the lifespan.

For instance, differences in delta-beta coupling have been observed between people in a psychological stress condition and controls. We previously reported relationships between attentional threat processing and delta-beta coupling and individual differences in attentional control. The present study extended and replicated these findings in a large mixed gender sample (N = 80). Results demonstrated that emotional Stroop task interference for threatening words was related to self-reported attentional inhibition capacity and frontal delta-beta coupling. There was no clear gender difference for delta-beta coupling (only a non-significant trend) and the relationship between delta-beta coupling and attentional threat-processing was not affected by gender. These results replicate and extend an earlier finding concerning delta-beta coupling and cognitive affect regulation and further clarify relationships between delta-beta coupling, attentional control, and threat-processing.

They reflect alternating periods of neuronal hyperpolarization and depolarization in cortical networks. While recent findings have demonstrated their functional role in shaping and strengthening neuronal networks, a large-scale characterization of these two processes remains elusive in the human brain. In this study, by using simultaneous scalp EEG and intracranial recordings in 10 epileptic subjects, we examined the dynamics of hyperpolarization and depolarization waves over a large extent of the human cortex. We report that both hyperpolarization and depolarization processes can occur with two different characteristic time durations which are consistent across all subjects. For both hyperpolarization and depolarization waves, their average speed over the cortex was estimated to be approximately 1 m/s. Finally, we characterized their propagation pathways by studying the preferential trajectories between most involved intracranial contacts. For both waves, although single events could begin in almost all investigated sites across the entire cortex, we found that the majority of the preferential starting locations were located in frontal regions of the brain while they had a tendency to end in posterior and temporal regions.

Several studies have shown that a reduced number of channels can achieve the optimal classification accuracy in the offline analysis of motor imagery paradigm, which does not have real-time feedback as in the online control. However, for the cursor movement control paradigm, it remains unclear as to how many channels should be selected in order to achieve the optimal classification. In the present study, we gradually increased the number of channels, and adopted the time-frequency-spatial synthesized method for left and right motor imagery classification. We compared the effect of increasing channel number in two datasets, an imagery-based cursor movement control dataset and a motor imagery tasks dataset. Our results indicated that for the former dataset, the more channels we used, the higher the accuracy rate was achieved, which is in contrast to the finding in the latter dataset that optimal performance was obtained at a subset number of channels. When gradually increasing the number of channels from 2 to all in the analysis of cursor movement control dataset, the average training and testing accuracies from three subjects improved from 68.7% to 90.4% and 63.7% to 87.7%, respectively.

Whether this characteristic is specifically related to agentic extraversion and theta band of frequencies or is associated with a broader set of personality traits and frequency bands is a matter of debate, as well as the specific cortical regions contributing to this effect. To clarify these questions, we used group independent component analysis (ICA) and source localization techniques. Agentic extraversion was associated with higher theta activity in the default mode network's (DMN) posterior hub and lower theta activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Regression analyses showed that theta activity predicted agentic extraversion better than other frequency bands and agentic extraversion predicted posterior versus frontal activity better than other personality dimensions. These results are taken to indicate higher tonic activity in OFC and lower activity in DMN in extraverts as compared to introverts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study we aimed to reveal whether similar echoes also exist in the auditory modality. A dynamically changing auditory stimulus equivalent to the visual stimulus was designed and employed in two separate series of experiments, and the presence of reverberations was analyzed based on reverse correlations between stimulus sequences and EEG epochs. The first experiment directly compared visual and auditory stimuli: while previous findings of similar to 10 Hz visual echoes were verified, no similar echo was found in the auditory modality regardless of frequency. In the second experiment, we tested if auditory sequences would influence the visual echoes when they were congruent or incongruent with the visual sequences. However, the results in that case similarly did not reveal any auditory echoes, nor any change in the characteristics of visual echoes as a function of audio-visual congruence. The negative findings from these experiments suggest that brain oscillations do not equivalently affect early sensory processes in the visual and auditory modalities, and that alpha (8-13 Hz) oscillations play a special role in vision.

Methods: We analyzed 29 pediatric epilepsy patients who underwent intracranial EEG before focal resective surgery. We localized the brain regions with high kurtosis, the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and the regions with high-rate, high-amplitude and long-duration interictal paroxysms >= 20 Hz. We tested correlations between the surgical resection of those regions and post-surgical seizure outcome, and correlations between kurtosis and the rate/amplitude/duration of interictal paroxysms. Results: The resection of the regions with high kurtosis correlated with 1-year post-surgical seizure outcome (p = 0.028) but not with 2-year outcome. Kurtosis showed more significant correlation with 1-year seizure outcome than the SOZ and the rate/amplitude/duration of interictal paroxysms. Kurtosis showed positive, independent correlations with the amplitude and duration of interictal paroxysms (p < 0.0001) but not with the rate (p = 0.4). Conclusions: The regions with high kurtosis provide more reliable information to predict seizure outcome than the SOZ and the regions with high-rate/amplitude and long-duration interictal paroxysms. Kurtosis reflects combined effects of the amplitude and duration of the interictal paroxysms. Significance: High kurtosis suggests the regions with acquired ictogenicity within the irritative zone.

EEG-power and -coherence changes in a unimodal and a crossmodal working memory task with visual and kinesthetic stimuli	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Visual representations; Kinesthetic representations; Synchronization; Crossmodal matching; Haptics	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY; INTEGRATION; GAMMA; MOVEMENTS; ELECTRODE; INSIGHTS; BEHAVIOR	We investigated EEG-power and EEG-coherence changes in a unimodal and a crossmodal matching-to-sample working memory task with either visual or kinesthetic stimuli. Angle-shaped trajectories were used as stimuli presented either as a moving dot on a screen or as a passive movement of a haptic device. Effects were evaluated during the different phases of encoding, maintenance, and recognition. Alpha power was modulated during encoding by the stimulus modality, and in crossmodal conditions during encoding and maintenance by the expected modality of the upcoming test stimulus. These power modulations were observed over modality-specific cortex regions. Systematic changes of coherence for crossmodal compared to unimodal tasks were not observed during encoding and maintenance but only during recognition. There, coherence in the theta-band increased between electrode sites over left central and occipital cortex areas in the crossmodal compared to the unimodal conditions. The results underline the importance of modality-specific representations and processes in unimodal and crossmodal working memory tasks. Crossmodal recognition of visually and kinesthetically presented object features seems to be related to a direct interaction of somatosensory/motor and visual cortex regions by means of long-range synchronization in the theta-band and such interactions seem to take place at the beginning of the recognition phase, i.e. when crossmodal transfer is actually necessary.

While abnormal low-frequency activity can be found around tumor borders, disrupted structural connectivity may also impinge on neural activity in distant brain regions and other frequency bands. We investigated how glioma in patients with normal motor functioning affects activity in primary motor areas (M1). Methods: Using magnetoencephalography in 12 patients with unilateral glioma located around the central sulcus, we studied activity in bilateral M1s in resting state and during movement with focus on motor-related mu (8-12 Hz) and beta rhythms (15-30 Hz). Principal component analysis served to test for differences in spectral content. Results: A shift was found towards lower frequencies for M1 in the tumor hemisphere compared to M1 in the healthy hemisphere, caused by an increase in mu and decrease in beta power. This pattern was observed both in resting state and during movement. Conclusions: This 'slowing' of brain oscillations in M1 resembles findings in patients with monohemispheric stroke and Parkinson's disease. A loss of intra-cortical connectivity may account for these findings, possibly supplemented by tumor-induced changes in neurotransmitter systems. Significance: Motor functioning may be unaffected by a spectral shift of mu and beta oscillations. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

NFT of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is demonstrated a great benefit in neurological or psychological disorders in the clinic. However, effect of SMR NFT is controversial and mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, the mu group showed significant enhancement of semantic and working memories after NFT, and enhancement of semantic memory was significantly related to increase duration and power of mu rhythm. SMR group showed enhancement of semantic memory with no correlation to SMR parameters. Our results suggest that mu rhythm may become a better way to facilitate memory processing in a NFT.

The following areas of application are considered: (1) the microscopic dynamics of single cells and intracellular processes, (2) sensory data processing, (3) the group dynamics of neuronal ensembles, and (4) the macrodynamics of rhythmical brain activity (using multichannel EEG recordings). The detection and classification of various oscillatory patterns of brain electrical activity and the development of continuous wavelet-based brain activity monitoring systems are also discussed as possibilities.

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), by contrast, most studies use spatial ICA: each time point constitutes a row of the data matrix, and independence of the spatial patterns is maximized. Here, we show the utility of spatial ICA in characterizing oscillatory neuromagnetic signals. We project the sensor data into cortical space using a standard minimum-norm estimate and apply a sparsifying transform to focus on oscillatory signals. The resulting method, spatial Fourier-ICA, provides a concise summary of the spatiotemporal and spectral content of spontaneous neuromagnetic oscillations in cortical source space over time scales of minutes. Spatial Fourier-ICA applied to resting-state and naturalistic stimulation MEG data from nine healthy subjects revealed consistent components covering the early visual, somatosensory and motor cortices with spectral peaks at similar to 10 and similar to 20 Hz. The proposed method seems valuable for inferring functional connectivity, stimulus-related modulation of rhythmic activity, and their commonalities across subjects from nonaveraged MEG data.

Using wireless polysomnographic recordings, this study aimed to investigate the long-term effects on sleep patterns and autonomic function in free moving rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The sleep pattern and heart rate variability (HRV) of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were analyzed. After 7-10 days, the rats were divided into two groups: an MCAO group (n = 8) and a sham surgery group (n = 8). Compared with shams, MCAO rats showed decreased accumulated quiet sleep (QS) time over 24 h during the 3rd week. The time percentage, duration and delta power of QS were also significantly decreased in the MCAO group during the dark period. Compared with baseline, there were significant increases in the parasympathetic-associated HRV measures in the sham group, including the total power (TP), high frequency power (HF) and lower frequency power (LF), throughout the post-operative weeks (primarily the 2nd and 3rd weeks), reflecting a developmental increase of parasympathetic modulation; the normalized LF and the LF-HF ratio were unaffected. In great contrast, however, most of the HRV measures in the MCAO group were not significantly changed. Therefore, this study showed that the long-term effects of ischemic stroke injury involve retardation of the establishment of parasympathetic enhancement and disturbance of the normal sleep-wake cycle.

The generation of both sleep spindles and slow-wave activity relies on synchronized oscillations in a thalamo-cortical network that might be implicated in synaptic strengthening (spindles) and downscaling (slow-wave activity) during sleep. This study further examined the association between electroencephalographic power during non-rapid eye movement sleep in the spindle (sigma, 1216 Hz) and slow-wave frequency range (0.13.5 Hz) and overnight memory consolidation in 20 healthy subjects (10 men, 27.1 +/- 4.6 years). We found that both electroencephalographic sigma power and slow-wave activity were positively correlated with the prepost-sleep consolidation of declarative (word list) and procedural (mirror-tracing) memories. These results, although only correlative in nature, are consistent with the view that processes of synaptic strengthening (sleep spindles) and synaptic downscaling (slow-wave activity) might act in concert to promote synaptic plasticity and the consolidation of both declarative and procedural memories during sleep.

We propose a shift in network synchrony due to changes in cellular response. Here we use phase-response curves (PRC) from Morris-Lecar (M-L) model neurons with synaptic depression and gradually decrease input current to cells within a network simulation. This method effectively decreases firing rates resulting in a shift to greater network synchrony illustrating a possible mechanism of the transition phenomenon. PRCs are measured from the M-L conductance based model cell with a range of input currents within the limit cycle. A large network of 3000 excitatory neurons is simulated with a network topology generated from second-order statistics which allows a range of population synchrony. The population synchrony of the oscillating cells is measured with the Kuramoto order parameter, which reveals a transition from tonic to clonic phase exhibited by our model network. The cellular response shift mechanism for the tonic-clonic seizure transition reproduces the population behavior closely when compared to EEG data.

Stunning effectiveness of broiler chickens using a two-phase stunner: pulsed direct current followed by sine wave alternating current	ARCHIV FUR GEFLUGELKUNDE			English	Article						Broiler; electroencephalogram; Simmons two-phase stunner; high frequency DC; sine wave AC	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PHYSICAL REFLEXES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; WATERBATH; FREQUENCY; SLAUGHTER; POULTRY	Stunning efficiency of male and female broiler chickens was analysed in response to the two-phase Simmons step-up stunner. In Phase I, a pulsed DC of 550 Hz is applied in a shallow waterbath. This is immediately followed by Phase II, consisting of a metal plate with sine wave AC of 50 Hz. 120 male and female broiler chickens were randomly allocated to six stunning groups with 10 males and 10 females per group. In Phase I a voltage of 12 or 15 V was applied followed by 40, 50 or 60 V in Phase II. Stunning time was 10 and 5 s in Phase I and II respectively. The rms current per bird was recorded. To assess stunning efficiency the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for 120 s post-stun. Simultaneously the occurrence of spontaneous eye lid blinking, breathing and wing flapping was assessed. The corneal reflex was tested every 20 s. The reduction of brain power in two frequency bands (2-30 Hz and 13-30 Hz) to less than 10% of the pre-stun level was analysed as indicator for adequate stunning. Female broilers showed a significantly lower rms stunning current as a result of higher electrical resistance. Phase II showed the biggest impact on stunning efficiency. Increasing voltage improved the stunning effect, but none of the analysed treatments induced unconsciousness in at least 90% of the animals. Voltage settings of more than 60 V AC in Phase II must therefore be applied. The majority of animals recovered from stunning in all groups. The occurrence of physical reflexes was suppressed in animals that were considered sensitive in the EEG analysis. Assessment of these reflexes for the evaluation of stunning efficiency can therefore not be recommended for this stunning method. No animal showed tonic-clonic convulsions following stunning and the level of severe wing flapping was very low in all groups. Meat quality advantages of this stunning method can therefore be expected, but this must be assessed in a separate study. It must be investigated if this effect can be maintained with higher voltage settings to ensure adequate stunning efficiency.

However, patients who suffered a stroke in the motor cortex have lost brain activity in the injured area, and consequently, mobility in contralateral limbs. Such a loss eliminates the possibility of extracting motor information from brain activity while the patient is undergoing therapy for the affected limb. This work proposes to decode motor information from EEG activity of the contralesional hemisphere in patients who suffered a hemiparetic stroke. Four stroke patients participated in this study and the results proved the feasibility of decoding motor information while patients attempted to move the affected limb.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						agency; hyperscanning; EEG; imitation; social interaction	SOCIAL-INTERACTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG EVIDENCE; RUBBER HAND; MU-RHYTHMS; SELF; SYNCHRONIZATION; AGENCY; MODULATION; EXPERIENCE	Brain correlates of the sense of agency have recently received increased attention. However, the explorations remain largely restricted to the study of brains in isolation. The prototypical paradigm used so far consists of manipulating visual perception of own action while asking the subject to draw a distinction between self- versus externally caused action. However, the recent definition of agency as a multifactorial phenomenon combining bottom-up and top-down processes suggests the exploration of more complex situations. Notably there is a need of accounting for the dynamics of agency in a two-body context where we often experience the double faceted question of who is at the origin of what in an ongoing interaction. In a dyadic context of role switching indeed, each partner can feel body ownership, share a sense of agency and altogether alternate an ascription of the primacy of action to self and to other. To explore the brain correlates of these different aspects of agency, we recorded with dual EEG and video set-ups 22 subjects interacting via spontaneous versus induced imitation (II) of hand movements. The differences between the two conditions lie in the fact that the roles are either externally attributed (induced condition) or result from a negotiation between subjects (spontaneous condition). Results demonstrate dissociations between self- and other-ascription of action primacy in delta, alpha and beta frequency bands during the condition of II. By contrast a similar increase in the low gamma frequency band (38-47Hz) was observed over the centro-parietal regions for the two roles in spontaneous imitation (SI). Taken together, the results highlight the different brain correlates of agency at play during live interactions.

These responses play a potentially important role in localising tissue involved in the generation of seizure activity, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. However, in vitro evidence suggests that self-terminating oscillations in nervous tissue are underpinned by non-trivial spatio-temporal dynamics in an excitable medium. In this study, we investigate this hypothesis in spatial extensions to a neural mass model for epileptiform dynamics. We demonstrate that spatial extensions to this model in one and two dimensions display propagating travelling waves but also more complex transient dynamics in response to local perturbations. The neural mass formulation with local excitatory and inhibitory circuits, allows the direct incorporation of spatially distributed, functional heterogeneities into the model. We show that such heterogeneities can lead to prolonged reverberating responses to a single pulse perturbation, depending upon the location at which the stimulus is delivered. This leads to the hypothesis that prolonged rhythmic responses to local stimulation in epileptogenic tissue result from repeated self-excitation of regions of tissue with diminished inhibitory capabilities. Combined with previous models of the dynamics of focal seizures this macroscopic framework is a first step towards an explicit spatial formulation of the concept of the epileptogenic zone. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the epileptogenic zone will help to improve diagnostic and therapeutic measures for treating epilepsy.

Subjects of the first group had to react only to facial stimuli (n = 29), whereas the second group solved an additional task loading the working memory (they had to find a target stimulus in a matrix of letters, n = 35). We estimated wavelet spectra in the occipital, temporal, central and frontal areas of both hemispheres. In both groups of subjects with the plastic form of set, the power level in the gamma2 band (41-60 Hz) was significantly higher than in subject with the rigid form. In group A at the set-testing stage, the largest increase in the gamma2 band was related to the central areas of the left hemisphere. In more complex situation (group 6), the increase in power in the gamma2 and gamma1 (21-40 Hz) bands was observed in the occipital and temporal areas of both hemispheres. At the same time, the EEG power of the central areas in these gamma bands was significantly lower. In the frontal areas there were no significant differences in the dynamics of power between the subjects of both groups.	[Dumenko, V. N.; Kozlov, M.

Studies have shown that physical responses are affected by unconscious preferences before conscious decision making. Accordingly, attention-related neural activities could be influenced by unconscious preferences. However, few neurological data exist on the relationship between visual attention and subjective preference. To address this issue, we focused on lateralization during visual attention and investigated the effects of subjective color preferences on visual attention-related brain activities. We recorded electroencephalograph (EEG) data during a preference judgment task that required 19 participants to choose their preferred color from 2 colors simultaneously presented to the right and left hemifields. In addition, to identify oscillatory activity during visual attention, we conducted a control experiment in which the participants focused on either the right or the left color without stating their preference. The EEG results showed enhanced theta (4-6 Hz) and decreased alpha (10-12 Hz) activities in the right and left occipital electrodes when the participants focused on the color in the opposite hemifield. Occipital theta synchronizations also increased contralaterally to the hemifield to which the preferred color was presented, whereas the alpha desynchronizations showed no lateralization. The contralateral occipital theta activity lasted longer than the ipsilateral occipital theta activity. Interestingly, theta lateralization was observed even when the preferred color was presented to the unattended side in the control experiment, revealing the strength of the preference-related theta-modulation effect irrespective of visual attention. These results indicate that subjective preferences modulate visual attention-related brain activities. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to additionally load the working memory, we lengthened the time gap between target (faces) and trigger stimuli. Such a lengthening from 1 to 8 s resulted in an increase of set plasticity (fewer mistakes in facial expression recognition). It also led to a reduction of the reaction time and less number of contrast illusions in recognition. We analyzed theta- and alpha-band EEG changes during individual segments of the time gap and suggested that repeated trials with a certain fixed interval between stimuli formed an inner representation of the interval duration. This inner representation up-regulates the visual attention in case of anticipation of a relevant event (stimulus) and down-regulates the attention when the stimulus is not expected. In case of the plastic set, the induced EEG synchronization in the alpha band is stronger in the trials with correct recognition in the middle of the inter-stimulus time gap. We think this synchronization reflects the action of the top-down cognitive control that suppresses the influence of irrelevant information on the brain activity Theta-band dynamics in the inter-stimulus time gap can be associated with the emotional strain caused by the fact that a person had to retain in memory (for several seconds) the result of facial expression recognition.

J	Salari, N; Buchel, C; Rose, M				Salari, Neda; Buechel, Christian; Rose, Michael			Functional Dissociation of Ongoing Oscillatory Brain States	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; PRESTIMULUS; CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS; NEUROFEEDBACK	The state of a neural assembly preceding an incoming stimulus is assumed to modulate the processing of subsequently presented stimuli. The nature of this state can differ with respect to the frequency of ongoing oscillatory activity. Oscillatory brain activity of specific frequency range such as alpha (8-12 Hz) and gamma (above 30 Hz) band oscillations are hypothesized to play a functional role in cognitive processing. Therefore, a selective modulation of this prestimulus activity could clarify the functional role of these prestimulus fluctuations. For this purpose, we adopted a novel non-invasive brain-computer-interface (BCI) strategy to selectively increase alpha or gamma band activity in the occipital cortex combined with an adaptive presentation of visual stimuli within specific brain states. During training, oscillatory brain activity was estimated online and fed back to the participants to enable a deliberate modulation of alpha or gamma band oscillations. Results revealed that volunteers selectively increased alpha and gamma frequency oscillations with a high level of specificity regarding frequency range and localization. At testing, alpha or gamma band activity was classified online and at defined levels of activity, visual objects embedded in noise were presented instantly and had to be detected by the volunteer. In experiment I, the effect of two levels of prestimulus gamma band activity on visual processing was examined. During phases of increased gamma band activity significantly more visual objects were detected. In experiment II, the effect was compared against increased levels of alpha band activity. An improvement of visual processing was only observed for enhanced gamma band activity. Both experiments demonstrate the specific functional role of prestimulus gamma band oscillations for perceptual processing.

Brain Oscillatory Activity during Spatial Navigation: Theta and Gamma Activity Link Medial Temporal and Parietal Regions	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; APPROXIMATE JOINT DIAGONALIZATION; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; MEMORY FORMATION; EEG DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; BLIND; REAL; INTEGRATION	Brain oscillatory correlates of spatial navigation were investigated using blind source separation (BSS) and standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analyses of 62-channel EEG recordings. Twenty-five participants were instructed to navigate to distinct landmark buildings in a previously learned virtual reality town environment. Data from periods of navigation between landmarks were subject to BSS analyses to obtain source components. Two of these cortical sources were found to exhibit significant spectral power differences during navigation with respect to a resting eyes open condition and were subject to source localization using sLORETA. These two sources were localized as a right parietal component with gamma activation and a right medial-temporal-parietal component with activation in theta and gamma bandwidths. The parietal gamma activity was thought to reflect visuospatial processing associated with the task. The medial-temporal-parietal activity was thought to be more specific to the navigational processing, representing the integration of ego- and allo-centric representations of space required for successful navigation, suggesting theta and gamma oscillations may have a role in integrating information from parietal and medial-temporal regions. Theta activity on this medial-temporal-parietal source was positively correlated with more efficient navigation performance. Results are discussed in light of the depth and proposed closed field structure of the hippocampus and potential implications for scalp EEG data. The findings of the present study suggest that appropriate BSS methods are ideally suited to minimizing the effects of volume conduction in noninvasive recordings, allowing more accurate exploration of deep brain processes.

Frequency-dependent functional connectivity within resting-state networks: An atlas-based MEG beamformer solution	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Beamforming; Magnetoencephalography; Source modelling; Functional connectivity; Graph analysis; Networks; Phase lag index; Resting-state	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; VOLUME-CONDUCTION	The brain consists of functional units with more-or-less specific information processing capabilities, yet cognitive functions require the co-ordinated activity of these spatially separated units. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has the temporal resolution to capture these frequency-dependent interactions, although, due to volume conduction and field spread, spurious estimates may be obtained when functional connectivity is estimated on the basis of the extra-cranial recordings directly. Connectivity estimates on the basis of reconstructed sources may similarly be affected by biases introduced by the source reconstruction approach. Here we propose an analysis framework to reliably determine functional connectivity that is based around two main ideas: (i) functional connectivity is computed for a set of atlas-based ROIs in anatomical space that covers almost the entire brain, aiding the interpretation of MEG functional connectivity/network studies, as well as the comparison with other modalities; (ii) volume conduction and similar bias effects are removed by using a functional connectivity estimator that is insensitive to these effects, namely the Phase Lag Index (PLI). Our analysis approach was applied to eyes-closed resting-state MEG data for thirteen healthy participants. We first demonstrate that functional connectivity estimates based on phase coherence, even at the source-level, are biased due to the effects of volume conduction and field spread. In contrast, functional connectivity estimates based on PLI are not affected by these biases. We then looked at mean PLI, or weighted degree, over areas and subjects and found significant mean connectivity in three (alpha, beta, gamma) of the five (including theta and delta) classical frequency bands tested. These frequency-band dependent patterns of resting-state functional connectivity were distinctive; with the alpha and beta band connectivity confined to posterior and sensorimotor areas respectively, and with a generally more dispersed pattern for the gamma band. Generally, these patterns corresponded closely to patterns of relative source power, suggesting that the most active brain regions are also the ones that are most-densely connected. Our results reveal for the first time, using an analysis framework that enables the reliable characterisation of resting-state dynamics in the human brain, how resting-state networks of functionally connected regions vary in a frequency-dependent manner across the cortex.

Usually, brain network analyses consider indexes linked to the shortest paths between cerebral regions. However, important information might be lost about alternative trails by neglecting longer pathways. We measured the redundancy of the connectivity by considering the multiple paths at the global level (i.e., scalar redundancy), across different path lengths (i.e., vector redundancy), and between node pairs (i.e., matrix redundancy). We applied this approach to a robust frequency domain functional connectivity measure, the corrected imaginary part of coherence. The redundancy in the MEG networks, for each frequency band, was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the random graphs, thus, confirming a natural tendency of the brain to present multiple interaction pathways between different specialized areas. Notably, this difference was more evident and localized among the channels covering the parietooccipital areas in the alpha range of MEG oscillations (7.5-13 Hz), as expected in the resting state conditions. Interestingly enough, the results obtained with the redundancy indexes were poorly correlated with those obtained using shortest paths only, and more sensitive with respect to those obtained by considering walk-based indexes.

Disturbed oscillatory brain dynamics in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Oscillations; Spectral analysis; Relative power; Vascular dementia; Cognition; White matter	MILD ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NINDS-AIREN; CORTICAL RHYTHMS; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA; ABNORMALITIES; IMPAIRMENT; STATE; POWER	Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) can lead to dementia but the underlying physiological mechanisms are unclear. We compared relative oscillatory power from electroencephalographic studies (EEGs) of 17 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, based on extensive white matter hyperintensities (SIVD-WMH) with 17 controls to investigate physiological changes underlying this diagnosis. Results: Differences between the groups were large, with a decrease of relative power of fast activity in patients (alpha power 0.25 +/- 0.12 versus 0.38 +/- 0.13, p = 0.01; beta power 0.08 +/- 0.04 versus 0.19 +/- 0.07; p<0.001) and an increase in relative powers of slow activity in patients (theta power 0.32 +/- 0.11 versus 0.14 +/- 0.09; p<0.001 and delta power 0.31 +/- 0.14 versus 0.23 +/- 0.09; p<0.05). Lower relative beta power was related to worse cognitive performance in a linear regression analysis (standardized beta = 0.67, p<0.01). Conclusions: This pattern of disturbance in oscillatory brain activity indicate loss of connections between neurons, providing a first step in the understanding of cognitive dysfunction in SIVD-WMH.

The further advances in the fields of life sciences, systems biology, nano-sciences, information systems, and physical sciences, have made it increasingly important to develop complexity measures that incorporate the concept of scale explicitly, so that different behaviors of the signals on varying scales can be simultaneously characterized by the same scale-dependent measure. Here, we propose such a measure, the scale-dependent Lyapunov exponent (SDLE), and develop a unified theory of multiscale analysis of complex data. We show that the SDLE can readily characterize low-dimensional chaos and random 1/f(alpha) processes, as well as accurately detect epileptic seizures from EEG data and distinguish healthy subjects from patients with congestive heart failure from heart rate variability (HRV) data. More importantly, our analyses of EEG and HRV data illustrate that commonly used complexity measures from information theory, chaos theory, and random fractal theory can be related to the values of the SDLE at specific scales, and useful information on the structured components of the data is also embodied by the SDLE.

Methods: Eleven healthy adults underwent two electroencephalographic (EEG) sessions separated by 1 week, following a cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind paradigm. In both sessions, they performed a visual go/no-go task before real exposure to GSM-EMFs or after a sham condition with no EMF exposure. In the GSM real session, temporal cortex was continuously exposed to GSM-EMFs for 45 min. In the sham session, the subjects were not aware that the EMFs had been switched off for the duration of the experiment. In the go/no-go task, a central fixation stimulus was followed by a green (50% of probability) or red visual stimulus. Subjects had to press the mouse button after the green stimuli (go trials). With reference to a baseline period, power decrease of low-(about 8-10 Hz) and high-frequency (about 10-12 Hz) alpha rhythms indexed the cortical activity. Results: It was found less power decrease of widely distributed high-frequency alpha rhythms and faster reaction time to go stimuli in the post-than pre-exposure period of the GSM session. No effect was found in the sham session. Conclusions: These results suggest that the peak amplitude of alpha ERD and the reaction time to the go stimuli are modulated by the effect of the GSM-EMFs on the cortical activity. Significance: Exposure to GSM-EMFs for 45 min may enhance human cortical neural efficiency and simple cognitive-motor processes in healthy adults.

Gamma band pitch responses in human auditory cortex measured with magnetoencephalography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pitch; Auditory; Magnetoencephalography; Gamma; Beamformer; Perception	REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; EEG	We have previously used direct electrode recordings in two human subjects to identify neural correlates of the perception of pitch (Griffiths, Kumar, Sedley et al., Direct recordings of pitch responses from human auditory cortex, Curr. Biol. 22 (2010), pp. 1128-1132). The present study was carried out to assess virtual-electrode measures of pitch perception based on non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG). We recorded pitch responses in 13 healthy volunteers using a passive listening paradigm and the same pitch-evoking stimuli (regular interval noise; RIN) as in the previous study. Source activity was reconstructed using a beamformer approach, which was used to place virtual electrodes in auditory cortex. Time-frequency decomposition of these data revealed oscillatory responses to pitch in the gamma frequency band to occur, in Heschl's gyrus, from 60 Hz upwards. Direct comparison of these pitch responses to the previous depth electrode recordings shows a striking congruence in terms of spectrotemporal profile and anatomical distribution. These findings provide further support that auditory high gamma oscillations occur in association with RIN pitch stimuli, and validate the use of MEG to assess neural correlates of normal and abnormal pitch perception.

Dynamic network structure of interhemispheric coordination	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						community detection; network dynamics; split-brain; temporal network; neural oscillations	HUMAN BRAIN NETWORKS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL INFORMATION; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; CEREBRAL COMMISSURES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL AREAS; EEG ALPHA	Fifty years ago Gazzaniga and coworkers published a seminal article that discussed the separate roles of the cerebral hemispheres in humans. Today, the study of interhemispheric communication is facilitated by a battery of novel data analysis techniques drawn from across disciplinary boundaries, including dynamic systems theory and network theory. These techniques enable the characterization of dynamic changes in the brain's functional connectivity, thereby providing an unprecedented means of decoding interhemispheric communication. Here, we illustrate the use of these techniques to examine interhemispheric coordination in healthy human participants performing a split visual field experiment in which they process lexical stimuli. We find that interhemispheric coordination is greater when lexical information is introduced to the right hemisphere and must subsequently be transferred to the left hemisphere for language processing than when it is directly introduced to the language-dominant (left) hemisphere. Further, we find that putative functional modules defined by coherent interhemispheric coordination come online in a transient manner, highlighting the underlying dynamic nature of brain communication. Our work illustrates that recently developed dynamic, network-based analysis techniques can provide novel and previously unapproachable insights into the role of interhemispheric coordination in cognition.

It can be reasonably hypothesized that distinct (hyper)excitability mechanisms underlie these electrophysiological signatures. The question is What are these mechanisms?. Solving this difficult question would considerably help our understanding of epileptogenic processes and would also advance our interpretation of electrophysiological signals. In this paper, we show how computational models of brain epileptic activity can be used to address this issue. With a special emphasis on the hippocampal activity recorded in various experimental models (in vivo and in vitro) as well as in epileptic patients, we confront results and insights we can get from computational models lying at two different levels of description, namely macroscopic (neural mass) and microscopic (detailed network of neurons). At each level, we show how spikes, seizures and HFOs can (or cannot) be generated depending on the model features. The replication of observed signals, the prediction of possible mechanisms as well as their experimental validation are described and discussed; as are the advantages and limitations of the two modelling approaches.

Perceptual Echoes at 10 Hz in the Human Brain	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; AUGMENTING RESPONSES; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HUMAN EEG; CORTEX; FLICKER; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; STATE	The occipital alpha rhythm (similar to 10 Hz) is the most prominent electrophysiological activity in the awake human brain [1], yet its functional role [2-4] and relation to visual perception [5] are little understood. Transient stimuli normally elicit a short series of positive and negative deflections lasting between 300 and 500 ms [6-8]: the visual-evoked potential (VEP). Alpha oscillations, on the other hand, are generally suppressed by transient visual input [1, 8]; they only augment in response to periodic ("steady-state") inputs around 10 Hz [9, 10]. Here, we applied reverse-correlation techniques to the visual presentation of random, nonperiodic dynamic stimulation sequences and found that the brain response to each stimulus transient was not merely a short-lived VEP but also included a strong similar to 10 Hz oscillation that lasted for more than 1 s. In other words, the alpha rhythm implements an "echo" or reverberation of the input sequence. These echoes are correlated in magnitude and frequency with the observer's occipital alpha rhythm, are enhanced by visual attention, and can be rendered perceptually apparent in the form of similar to 10 Hz flicker. These findings suggest a role for the alpha rhythm in the maintenance of sensory representations over time.

Cognit activation: a mechanism enabling temporal integration in working memory	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FMRI; PHASE; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; LOAD; OSCILLATIONS	Working memory is critical to the integration of information across time in goal-directed behavior, reasoning and language, yet its neural substrate is unknown. Based on recent research, we propose a mechanism by which the brain can retain working memory for prospective use, thereby bridging time in the perception/action cycle. The essence of the mechanism is the activation of 'cognits', which consist of distributed, overlapping and interactive cortical networks that in the aggregate encode the long-term memory of the subject. Working memory depends on the excitatory reentry between perceptual and executive cognits of posterior and frontal cortices, respectively. Given the pervasive role of working memory in the structuring of purposeful cognitive sequences, its mechanism looms essential to the foundation of behavior, reasoning and language.

They are associated with abnormal brain rhythms, including disturbances in ? frequency (3080 Hz) oscillations (GFO) in cortex-related networks. However, the underlying anatomofunctional mechanisms remain elusive. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that these deficits result from a hyporegulation of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Here we modeled these deficits in rats with ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and a translational psychotomimetic substance at subanesthetic doses. We tested the hypothesis that ketamine-induced sensory deficits involve an impairment of the ability of the thalamocortical (TC) system to discriminate the relevant information from the baseline activity. Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether ketamine disrupts synaptic plasticity in TC systems. We conducted multisite network recordings in the rat somatosensory TC system, natural stimulation of the vibrissae and high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the thalamus. A single systemic injection of ketamine increased the amount of baseline GFO, reduced the amplitude of the sensory-evoked TC response and decreased the power of the sensory-evoked GFO. Furthermore, cortical application of ketamine elicited local and distant increases in baseline GFO. The ketamine effects were transient. Unexpectedly, HFS of the TC pathway had opposite actions. In conclusion, ketamine and thalamic HFS have opposite effects on the ability of the somatosensory TC system to discriminate the sensory-evoked response from the baseline GFO during information processing. Investigating the link between the state and function of the TC system may conceptually be a key strategy to design innovative therapies against neuropsychiatric disorders.

J	Salami, P; Levesque, M; Gotman, J; Avoli, M				Salami, Pariya; Levesque, Maxime; Gotman, Jean; Avoli, Massimo			A comparison between automated detection methods of high-frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz) during seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						High frequency oscillation; Automated detection; Analysis; Epilepsy; Seizure	STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EPILEPTOGENESIS	High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples: 80-200 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) recorded from the epileptic brain are thought to reflect abnormal network-driven activity. They are also better markers of seizure onset zones compared to interictal spikes. There is thus an increasing number of studies analysing HFOs in vitro, in vivo and in the EEG of human patients with refractory epilepsy. However, most of these studies have focused on HFOs during interictal events or at seizure onset, and few have analysed HFOs during seizures. In this study, we are comparing three different automated methods of HFO detection to two methods of visual analysis, during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods on multiple channels using the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The first method (method 1) detected HFOs using the average of the normalised period, the second (method 2) detected HFOs using the average of the normalised period in 1 s windows and the third (method 3) detected HFOs using the average of a reference period before seizure onset. Overall, methods 2 and 3 showed higher sensitivity compared to method 1. When dividing the analysed traces in pre-, ictal and post-ictal periods, method 3 showed the highest sensitivity during the ictal period compared to method 1, while method 2 was not significantly different from method 1. These findings suggest that method 3 could be used for automated and reliable detection of HFOs on large data sets containing multiple channels during the ictal period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Vision at an attended location is faster, more accurate, of higher spatial resolution, and has an enhanced sensitivity for fine changes. Earlier hypotheses suggest that the neuronal mechanisms of these processes are based on the interactions among different neuronal groups by means of cortical oscillations in the gamma range. The aim of the current study was to modulate these oscillations externally, using a new technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We investigated the effect of covert spatial attention within and outside its focus by probing contrast sensitivity and contrast discrimination at high resolution across the visual field of 20 healthy human subjects. While applying 40, 60, and 80 Hz tAC stimulation over the primary visual cortex (V1), subjects' contrast-discrimination thresholds were obtained using two different conditions: in the first condition we presented a black disc as a peripheral cue that automatically attracted the subject's attention, whereas there was no cue in the second condition. We found that the spatial profile of contrast sensitivity was not affected by the stimulation. Contrast-discrimination thresholds on the other hand decreased significantly during 60 Hz tACS, whereas there was no effect of 40 and 80 Hz stimulation. These results suggest that attention plays an important role in contrast discrimination based on V1 activities that are influences by gamma range tACS stimulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to examine alpha oscillatory activity during the preparation of simple left or right finger movements, contrasting the external and internal mode of action selection. Three preparation conditions were examined using a precueing paradigm with Si as the preparatory and S2 as the imperative cue: Full, laterality instructed by Si; Free, laterality freely selected and None, laterality instructed by S2. Time-frequency (IF) analysis was performed in the alpha frequency range during the S1 S2 interval, and alpha motor-related amplitude asymmetries (MRAA) were also calculated. The significant MRAA during the Full and Free conditions indicated effective external and internal motor response preparation. In the absence of specific motor preparation (None), a posterior alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) dominated, reflecting the main engagement of attentional resources. In Full and Free motor preparation, posterior alpha ERD was accompanied by a midparietal alpha event-related synchronization (ERS), suggesting a concomitant inhibition of task-irrelevant visual activity. In both Full and Free motor preparation, analysis of alpha power according to MRAA amplitude revealed two types of functional activation patterns: (1) a motor alpha pattern, with predominantly midparietal alpha ERS and large MRAA corresponding to lateralized motor activation/visual inhibition and (2) an attentional alpha pattern, with dominating right posterior alpha ERD and small MRAA reflecting visuospatial attention. The present results suggest that alpha oscillatory patterns do not resolve the selection mode of action, but rather distinguish separate functional strategies of motor preparation.

Glissandi: transient fast electrocorticographic oscillations of steadily increasing frequency, explained by temporally increasing gap junction conductance	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Very fast oscillations; Electrocorticography; Gap junction; pH; Epilepsy model	CELLS; EEG; HZ; MECHANISM; NETWORK; TRANSMISSION; DISCHARGES; GENERATION; CHANNELS; SEIZURES	Purpose: We describe a form of very fast oscillation (VFO) in patient electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings, that can occur prior to ictal events, in which the frequency increases steadily from similar to 3040 to >120 Hz, over a period of seconds. We dub these events glissandi and describe a possible model for them. Methods: Four patients with epilepsy had presurgical evaluations (with ECoG obtained in two of them), and excised tissue was studied in vitro, from three of the patients. Glissandi were seen spontaneously in vitro, associated with ictal eventsusing acute slices of rat neocortexand they were simulated using a network model of 15,000 detailed layer V pyramidal neurons, coupled by gap junctions. Key findings: Glissandi were observed to arise from human temporal neocortex. In vitro, they lasted 0.24.1 s, prior to ictal onset. Similar events were observed in the rat in vitro in layer V of frontal neocortex when alkaline solution was pressure-ejected; glissandi persisted when ?-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA), GABAB, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors were blocked. Nonalkaline conditions prevented glissando generation. In network simulations it was found that steadily increasing gap junction conductance would lead to the observed steady increase in VFO field frequency. This occurred because increasing gap junction conductance shortened the time required for an action potential to cross from cell to cell. Significance: The in vitro and modeling data are consistent with the hypothesis that glissandi arise when pyramidal cell gap junction conductances rise over time, possibly as a result of an alkaline fluctuation in brain pH.

Consolidation of temporal order in episodic memories	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal order; NREM/REM cycles; Sleep spindles; EEG; Sleep deprivation; Memory consolidation	LATE NOCTURNAL SLEEP; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLES; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUMENT; ACTIVATION; SEQUENCES; RIPPLES; RECALL	Even though it is known that sleep benefits declarative memory consolidation, the role of sleep in the storage of temporal sequences has rarely been examined. Thus we explored the influence of sleep on temporal order in an episodic memory task followed by sleep or sleep deprivation. Thirty-four healthy subjects (17 men) aged between 19 and 28 years participated in the randomized, counterbalanced, between-subject design. Parameters of interests were NREM/REM cycles, spindle activity and spindle-related EEG power spectra. Participants of both groups (sleep group/sleep deprivation group) performed retrieval in the evening, morning and three days after the learning night. Results revealed that performance in temporal order memory significantly deteriorated over three days only in sleep deprived participants. Furthermore our data showed a positive relationship between the ratios of the (i) first NREM/REM cycle with more REM being associated with delayed temporal order recall. Most interestingly, data additionally indicated that (ii) memory enhancers in the sleep group show more fast spindle related alpha power at frontal electrode sites possibly indicating access to a yet to be consolidated memory trace. We suggest that distinct sleep mechanisms subserve different aspects of episodic memory and are jointly involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Expectancy-related modulations of neural oscillations in continuous performance tasks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillations; Alpha; Beta; AX-CPT; Cognitive; Motor preparation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN CORTICOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CHANGING PLANS; MOTOR SYSTEMS; BETA-RHYTHM	Analysis of neural oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during cognitive tasks provides valuable information about underlying neuronal processing not accessible by other methods such as event-related potentials (ERPs) and the BOLD signal in fMRI. We investigated neural substrates of motor preparation and expectancy by analyzing neural oscillations of healthy subjects performing the AX continuous performance task (AX-CPT), a task widely used to evaluate processes such as cognitive control, motor preparation and anticipatory and sustained attention. The task consists of letters presented sequentially on a monitor, and subjects are required to respond only when they see the letter A (cue) followed by the letter X (target). In this study, to emphasize expectation and motor preparation, three versions of AX-CPT were used in which the overall propensity to respond was differentially modulated, by changing the probability of the letter sequences. Neural activity was investigated in three time windows following presentation of the cue: sensory, evaluation and preparation. Alpha power was reduced following cue onset similarly in all versions of the task in both the sensory and evaluation periods, but in the later preparation period there were task dependent modulations. Alpha was decreased when an infrequent cue increased the chance of a response, and increased when a propensity to respond had to be overcome, possibly reflecting an anticipatory attentional mechanism to gate visuo-motor processing. Beta power was modulated by task and cue in both evaluation and preparation periods. In the latter, beta power reflected the propensity to respond and correlated both with amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an ERP that reflects response preparation, and with reaction time. Some clinical populations such as patients with schizophrenia or attention-deficit disorder show specific deficits when performing the AX-CPT. These results provide a basis for investigating the differential neural underpinnings of oscillatory cognitive control deficits observed in various patient populations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Whole-cortex magnetoencephalography data were collected while 50 children (27 with ASD, 23 controls) underwent an eyes-closed resting-state exam. A Fast Fourier Transform was applied and oscillatory activity examined from 1 to 120 Hz at 15 regional sources. Associations between oscillatory anomalies and symptom severity were probed. Children with ASD exhibited regionally specific elevations in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and high frequency (20-120 Hz) power, supporting an imbalance of neural excitation/inhibition as a neurobiological feature of ASD. Increased temporal and parietal alpha power was associated with greater symptom severity and thus is of particular interest.	[Cornew, Lauren; Roberts, Timothy P. L.; Blaskey, Lisa; Edgar, J.

These dynamics are known to arise from spatially heterogeneous tissue, but the relationship between specific spatial abnormalities and epileptic rhythm generation is not well understood. We formulate a simplified macroscopic modelling framework with which to study the role of spatial heterogeneity in the generation of epileptiform spatio-temporal rhythms. We characterize the overall model dynamics in terms of spontaneous activity and excitability and demonstrate normal and abnormal spreading of activity. We introduce a means to systematically investigate the topology of abnormal sub-networks and explore its impact on spontaneous and stimulus-evoked rhythmic dynamics. This computationally efficient framework complements results from detailed biophysical models, and allows the testing of specific hypotheses about epileptic dynamics on the macroscopic scale.

They administered the Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP), Dissociation Experience Scale, and Tellegen Absorption Scale to 10 healthy volunteers and measured subjects' EEGs while the subjects listened to sounds, either selecting or ignoring tones of different decibels, in waking and hypnotic states. DFA scaling exponents were closest to 0.5 when subjects reported the tones in the hypnotic state. Different DFA values at C3 showed significant positive correlations with the HIP eye-roll sign. Adding to the literature supporting the state theory of hypnosis, the DFA values at F3 and C3 showed significant differences between waking and hypnotic states. Application of auditory stimuli is useful for understanding neurophysiological characteristics of hypnosis using DFA.

Here, we examined the role of sleep in the object-place recognition task, a task closely comparable to tasks typically applied for testing human declarative memory: It is a one-trial task, hippocampus-dependent, not stressful and can be repeated within the same animal. A test session consisted of the Sample trial, followed by a 2-h retention interval and a Test trial, the latter examining the memory the rat had for the places of two objects presented at the Sample trial. In Experiment 1, each rat was tested twice, with the retention interval taking place either in the morning or evening, i.e., in the inactive or active phase, respectively. Rats showed significantly (p < 0.01) better memory for object place after the Morning session. To control for confounding circadian factors, in Experiment 2 rats were tested four times, i.e., in the morning or in the evening while sleep was or was not deprived. Sleep during the retention interval was recorded polysomnographically. Rats only showed significant memory for the target object place in the Test trial after the Morning retention interval in the absence of sleep deprivation, and recognition performance in this condition was significantly superior to that in the three other conditions (p < 0.05). EEG recordings during spontaneous morning sleep revealed increased slow oscillation (0.85-2.0 Hz) and upper delta (2.0-4.0 Hz), but reduced spindle band (10.5-13.5 Hz) activity, as compared to evening sleep. However, spindle band power was increased in the Morning retention interval in comparison to a Morning Baseline period (p < 0.05). We conclude that consolidation of object-place memory depends on sleep, and presumably requires NonREM sleep rich in both slow wave and spindle activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Dash, MB; Tononi, G; Cirelli, C				Dash, Michael B.; Tononi, Giulio; Cirelli, Chiara			Extracellular Levels of Lactate, but Not Oxygen, Reflect Sleep Homeostasis in the Rat Cerebral Cortex	SLEEP			English	Article						Lactate; oxygen; in vivo amperometry; sleep; rat; cerebral cortex; EEG; slow-wave activity	FREELY MOVING RATS; BRAIN-TISSUE OXYGEN; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BLOOD-FLOW; IN-VIVO; SYNAPTIC HOMEOSTASIS; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; ENERGY-METABOLISM	Study Objective: It is well established that brain metabolism is higher during wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Most of the brain's energy is used to maintain neuronal firing and glutamatergic transmission. Recent evidence shows that cortical firing rates, extracellular glutamate levels, and markers of excitatory synaptic strength increase with time spent awake and decline throughout NREM sleep. These data imply that the metabolic cost of each behavioral state is not fixed but may reflect sleep-wake history, a possibility that is investigated in the current report. Design: Chronic (4d) electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in the rat cerebral cortex were coupled with fixed-potential amperometry to monitor the extracellular concentration of oxygen ([oxy]) and lactate ([lac]) on a second-by-second basis across the spontaneous sleep-wake cycle and in response to sleep deprivation. Setting: Basic sleep research laboratory. Patients or Participants: Wistar Kyoto (WKY) adult male rats. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Within 30-60 sec [lac] and [oxy] progressively increased during wake and REM sleep and declined during NREM sleep (n = 10 rats/metabolite), but with several differences. [Oxy], but not [lac], increased more during wake with high motor activity and/or elevated EEG high-frequency power. Meanwhile, only the NREM decline of [lac] reflected sleep pressure as measured by slow-wave activity, mirroring previous results for cortical glutamate. Conclusions: The observed state-dependent changes in cortical [lac] and [oxy] are consistent with higher brain metabolism during waking and REM sleep in comparison with NREM sleep. Moreover, these data suggest that glycolytic activity, most likely through its link with glutamatergic transmission, reflects sleep homeostasis.

The dominant features of these experimentally observed dynamics are reproduced by the dynamics of a quantitative neural field model subject to periodic drive. Model power spectra over a range of drive frequencies show agreement with multiple features of experimental measurements, exhibiting nonlinear effects including entrainment over a range of frequencies around the natural alpha frequency f(alpha), subharmonic entrainment near 2f(alpha), and harmonic generation. Further analysis of the driven dynamics as a function of the drive parameters reveals rich nonlinear dynamics that is predicted to be observable in future experiments at high drive amplitude, including period doubling, bistable phase-locking, hysteresis, wave mixing, and chaos indicated by positive Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, photosensitive seizures are predicted for physiologically realistic model parameters yielding bistability between healthy and seizure dynamics. These results demonstrate the applicability of neural field models to the new regime of periodically driven nonlinear dynamics, enabling interpretation of experimental data in terms of specific generating mechanisms and providing new tests of the theory.

As the theta rhythm is known to modulate in power during the recognition memory process, we aimed to determine how the phase synchronization of the theta rhythms across the brain changes with recognition memory. Fourteen human participants performed a visual object recognition task in a virtual reality environment Electroencephalograms were recorded from the scalp of the participants while they either recognized objects that had been presented previously or identified new objects. From the electroencephalogram recordings, we analyzed the phase-locking value of the theta rhythms, which indicates the degree of phase synchronization. We found that the overall phase-locking value recorded during the recognition of previously viewed objects was greater than that recorded during the identification of new objects. Specifically, the theta rhythms became strongly synchronized between the frontal and the left parietal areas during the recognition of previously viewed objects. These results suggest that the recognition memory process may involve an interaction between the frontal and the left parietal cortical regions mediated by theta phase synchronization.

Epileptic high-frequency oscillations in intraoperative electrocorticography: The effect of propofol	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Ripples; Focal epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Electrocorticography; Anesthesia	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; FAST RIPPLES; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; 100-500 HZ; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FOCAL SEIZURES; IN-VITRO; BRAIN	Purpose: Epileptic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80500 Hz) may be used to guide neurosurgeons during epilepsy surgery to identify epileptogenic tissue. We studied the effect of the anesthetic agent propofol on the occurrence of HFOs in intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG). Methods: We selected patients who were undergoing surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy with a standardized electrode grid placement. Intraoperative ECoG was recorded at 2,048 Hz following cessation of propofol. The number and distribution of interictal spikes, ripples (R [80250 Hz]), and fast ripples (FRs; 250500 Hz) were analyzed. The amount of events on mesiotemporal channels and lateral neocortical channels were compared between patients with a suspected mesiotemporal and lateral epileptogenic area (Students t-test), and HFOs were compared with the irritative zone, using correlation between amounts of events per channel, to provide evidence for the epileptic nature of the HFOs. Next, the amount of events within the first minute and the last minute were compared to each other and the change in events over the entire epochs was analyzed using correlation analyses of 10 epochs during the emergence periods (Spearman rank test). We studied whether the duration of HFOs changed over time. The change in events within presumed epileptogenic area was compared to the change outside this area (Students t-test). Periods of burst suppression and continuous background activity were compared between and within patients (t-test). Key Findings: Twelve patients were included: five with suspected mesiotemporal epileptogenic area and three with suspected lateral epileptogenic area (and four were other). Spikes, ripples, and FRs were related to the suspected epileptogenic areas, and HFO zones were related to the irritative zones. Ripples and FRs increased during emergence from propofol anesthesia (mean number of ripples from first minutelast minute: 61.573.0, R = 0.46, p < 0.01; FRs: 3.15.7, R = 0.30, p < 0.01) and spikes remained unchanged (80.179.9, R = -0.05, p = 0.59). There was a decrease in number of channels with spikes (R = -0.18, p = 0.05), but no change in ripples (R = -0.13, p = 0.16) or FRs (R = 0.11, p = 0.45). There was no change in the durations of HFOs. The amount of HFOs in the presumed epileptogenic areas did not change more than the amount outside the presumed epileptogenic area, whereas spikes paradoxically decreased more within the suspected epileptogenic area. Six patients showing burst-suppression had lower rates of ripples than six other patients with continuous background activity (p = 0.02). No significant difference was found between burst suppression and continuous background activity in four patients, but there was a trend toward showing more ripples during continuous background activity (p = 0.16). Significance: Propofol, known for its antiepileptic effects, reduces the number of epileptic HFOs, but has no effect on spikes. This enforces the hypothesis that, in epilepsy, HFOs mirror the disease activity and HFOs might be useful for monitoring antiepileptic drug treatment. It is feasible to record HFOs during surgery, but propofol infusion should be interrupted for some minutes to improve detection.

We compare their ability to estimate workload level in a well-controlled task. In addition, we combine both types of measures in a single classification model to examine whether this results in higher classification accuracy than either one alone. Participants watched a sequence of visually presented letters and indicated whether or not the current letter was the same as the one (n instances) before. Workload was varied by varying n. We developed different classification models using ERP features, frequency power features or a combination (fusion). Training and testing of the models simulated an online workload estimation situation. All our ERP, power and fusion models provide classification accuracies between 80% and 90% when distinguishing between the highest and the lowest workload condition after 2 min. For 32 out of 35 participants, classification was significantly higher than chance level after 2.5 s (or one letter) as estimated by the fusion model. Differences between the models are rather small, though the fusion model performs better than the other models when only short data segments are available for estimating workload.

FLUCTUATIONS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BRAIN WAVES DURING DEEP AND SHALLOW ANESTHESIA	FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS			English	Article						Brain; anesthesia; connectivity; EEG waves; spontaneous activity	CONSCIOUSNESS; NONLINEARITY; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; RATS	Using gold plated electrodes, inserted into the rat's head above the dura of the left and right parietal cortex, we recorded EEG during deep and shallow anesthesia with either pentobarbital (PB) or ketamine-xylazine (KX). The fluctuations in time series were then analyzed using wavelet transforms and the spectral power was determined within 7 frequency intervals (slow wave 2, S2, 0.0067-0.0167 Hz; slow wave 1, S1, 0.02-0.19 Hz; delta, 0.2-3.9 Hz; theta, 4-7.9 Hz; alpha, 8-12.9 Hz; beta, 13-24.9 Hz and gamma, 25-34.9 Hz). In addition, the coupling strengths between individual oscillatory components during deep and shallow anesthesia were evaluated for both anesthetics. We show specific changes for both anesthetics indicating that during deep anesthesia PB reduces high and low frequency activity (0.2-35 Hz) and enhances coupling especially between delta, theta and alpha waves, while KX reduces low frequency activity (0.005 to 0.2 Hz) and enhances coupling between frequency waves alpha, beta and gamma. Our results, using two anesthetics known to block different ion channels, provide an insight into brain dynamics and could have wide implications in creating biomarkers for detecting various neurophysiological modifications, such as in Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease or Autism spectrum disorder, as well as in providing more realistic models of brain dynamics.

This study aims at elucidating the pathophysiology of the thalamic asterixis. Methods: Two cases with unilateral asterixis caused by an infarction in the lateral thalamus were studied by analysing the asterixis-related cortical activities, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for motor cortex excitability and probabilistic diffusion tractography for the thalamo-cortical connectivity. Results: Averaging of electroencephalogram ( EEG) time-locked to the asterixis revealed rhythmic oscillations of a beta band at the central area contralateral to the affected hand. TMS revealed a decrease in the motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitude and a prolongation of the silent period (SP). The anatomical mapping of connections between the thalamus and cortical areas using a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) showed that the lateral thalamus involved by the infarction was connected to the premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the corresponding hemisphere. Conclusions: The thalamic asterixis is mediated by the sensorimotor cortex, which is subjected to excessive inhibition as a result of the thalamic lesion involving the ventral lateral nucleus.

Temporal integration refers to how chunks of information perceived at different time scales are linked together by the listener in mapping speech sounds onto meaning. The neural implementation of this integration remains unclear. This study explores the role of short and long windows of integration in accessing meaning from long samples of speech. In a cross-linguistic study, we explore the time course of oscillatory brain activity between 1 and 100 Hz, recorded using EEG, during the processing of native and foreign languages. We compare oscillatory responses in a group of Italian and Spanish native speakers while they attentively listen to Italian, Japanese, and Spanish utterances, played either forward or backward. The results show that both groups of participants display a significant increase in gamma band power (55-75 Hz) only when they listen to their native language played forward. The increase in gamma power starts around 1000 msec after the onset of the utterance and decreases by its end, resembling the time course of access to meaning during speech perception. In contrast, changes in low-frequency power show similar patterns for both native and foreign languages. We propose that gamma band power reflects a temporal binding phenomenon concerning the coordination of neural assemblies involved in accessing meaning of long samples of speech.

J	Spitzer, B; Blankenburg, F				Spitzer, Bernhard; Blankenburg, Felix			Supramodal Parametric Working Memory Processing in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; FLUTTER; INCREASE; LOAD	Previous studies of delayed-match-to-sample (DMTS) frequency discrimination in animals and humans have succeeded in delineating the neural signature of frequency processing in somatosensory working memory (WM). During retention of vibrotactile frequencies, stimulus-dependent single-cell and population activity in prefrontal cortex was found to reflect the task-relevant memory content, whereas increases in occipital alpha activity signaled the disengagement of areas not relevant for the tactile task. Here, we recorded EEG from human participants to determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be generalized to frequency retention in the visual and auditory domains. Subjects performed analogous variants of a DMTS frequency discrimination task, with the frequency information presented either visually, auditorily, or by vibrotactile stimulation. Examining oscillatory EEG activity during frequency retention, we found characteristic topographical distributions of alpha power over visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, indicating systematic patterns of inhibition and engagement of early sensory areas, depending on stimulus modality. The task-relevant frequency information, in contrast, was found to be represented in right prefrontal cortex, independent of presentation mode. In each of the three modality conditions, parametric modulations of prefrontal upper beta activity (20-30 Hz) emerged, in a very similar manner as recently found in vibrotactile tasks. Together, the findings corroborate a view of parametric WM as supramodal internal scaling of abstract quantity information and suggest strong relevance of previous evidence from vibrotactile work for a more general framework of quantity processing in human working memory.

This, in turn, places an ever-increasing burden on healthcare due to the increasing prevalence of patients with chronic illnesses and the reducing income-generating population base needed to sustain them. The need to urgently address this healthcare "time bomb" has accelerated the growth in ubiquitous, pervasive, distributed healthcare technologies. The current move from hospital-centric healthcare toward in-home health assessment is aimed at alleviating the burden on healthcare professionals, the health care system and caregivers. This shift will also further increase the comfort for the patient. Advances in signal acquisition, data storage and communication provide for the collection of reliable and useful in-home physiological data. Artifacts, arising from environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. The magnitude and frequency of these artifacts significantly increases when data collection is moved from the clinic into the home. Signal processing advances have brought about significant improvement in artifact removal over the past few years. This paper reviews the physiological signals most likely to be recorded in the home, documenting the artifacts which occur most frequently and which have the largest degrading effect. A detailed analysis of current artifact removal techniques will then be presented. An evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the proposed artifact detection and removal techniques, with particular application to the personal healthcare domain, is provided.

However, recent research questions the specificity of these regions and it has been suggested that it is not singular activations of brain areas, but their cross-communication that results in perception of pain. Moreover, frequency at which neurons are firing could be what separates pain from other sensory modalities which otherwise involve the same anatomical locations. In this test/retest study, we identified the network of sources and their frequencies following visceral pain. Methods: 62-channel evoked potentials following electrical stimulation in oesophagus were recorded in twelve healthy volunteers on two separate days. Multichannel matching pursuit (MMP) and dipolar source localisation were used. Multiple sources responsible for one MMP component were considered to act synchronously as each MMP component is mono-frequency and has a single topography. We first identified components that were reproducible within subjects over recording sessions. These components were then analysed across subjects. Results: MMP and source localisation showed three main brain networks; an early network at similar to 8.3 Hz and similar to 3.5 Hz involving brainstem, operculum, and pre-frontal cortex peaking at similar to 77 ms. This was followed by an operculum, amygdale, mid-cingulate, and anterior-cingulate network at similar to 4.5 Hz. Finally, there was an operculum and mid-cingulate network that persisted over the entire time interval, peaking at 245.5 +/- 51.4 ms at similar to 2.1 Hz. Conclusion: This study gives evidence of operculum's central integrative role for perception of pain and shows that MMP is a reliable method to study upstream brain activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the factors behind such age-related changes, using time-frequency analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). We hypothesized that brain rhythms was affected by age-related changes, which could be reflected in the ERP indices. An oddball task was conducted in two experimental groups, namely young participants (N = 15; mean age 23.7 +/- 2.8 years) and older participants (N = 15; mean age 70.1 +/- 7.9 years). Two types of stimuli were used: the target (1 kHz frequency) and standard (2 kHz frequency). We scrutinized three ERP indices: event-related spectral power (ERPSP), inter-trial phase-locking (ITPL), and event-related cross-phase coherence (ERP-COH). Both groups performed equally well for correct response rate. However, the results revealed a statistically significant age difference for inter-trial comparison. Compared with the young, the older participants showed the following age-related changes: (a) power activity decreased; however, an increase was found only in the late (P3, 280-450 ms) theta (4-7 Hz) component over the bilateral frontal and temporo-frontal areas; (b) low phase-locking in the early (N1, 80-140 ms) theta band over the parietal/frontal (right) regions appeared; (c) the functional connections decreased in the alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, but no difference emerged in the theta band between the two groups. These results indicate that age-related changes in task-specific brain activity for a normal aging population can be depicted using the three ERP indices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

According to recent evidence (Rossion and Boremanse, 2011), this face-related SSVEP is largely reduced in amplitude when the exact same face is repeated at every stimulation cycle as compared to the presentation of different individual faces. Here this SSVEP individual face repetition effect was tested in 20 participants stimulated with faces at a 4 Hz rate for 84 s, in 4 conditions: faces upright or inverted, normal or contrast-reversed (2 x 2 design). To study the temporal dynamics of this effect, all stimulation sequences started with 15 s of identical faces, after which, in half of the sequences, different faces were introduced. A larger response to different than identical faces at the fundamental (4 Hz) and second harmonic (8 Hz) components was observed for upright faces over the right occipito-temporal cortex. Weaker effects were found for inverted and contrast-reversed faces, two stimulus manipulations that are known to greatly affect the perception of facial identity. Addition of the two manipulations further decreased the effect. The phase of the fundamental frequency SSVEP response was delayed for inverted and contrast-reversed faces, to the same extent as the latency delay observed at the peak of the face-sensitive N170 component observed at stimulation sequence onset. Time-course analysis of the entire sequence of stimulation showed an immediate increase of 4 Hz amplitude at the onset (16th second) of different face presentation, indicating a fast, large and frequency-specific release to individual face adaptation in the human brain. Altogether, these observations increase our understanding of the characteristics of the human steady-state face potential response and provide further support for the interest of this approach in the study of the neurofunctional mechanisms of face perception.

Our study was designed to determine whether this organization is preserved in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) and intravenous sedation. Design: Observational study. Setting: Academic medical intensive care unit. Patients: Critically ill patients receiving MV and intravenous sedation. Methods: Continuous polysomnography (PSG) was initiated an average of 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) days after ICU admission and continued 36 h or until the patient was extubated. Sleep staging and power spectral analysis were performed using standard approaches. We also calculated the electroencephalography spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95), a parameter that is normally higher during wakefulness than during sleep. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed in 16 subjects through the measurement of aMT6s in urine samples collected hourly for 24-48 hours. Light intensity at the head of the bed was measured continuously. Measurements and Results: We analyzed 819.7 h of PSG recordings from 21 subjects. REM sleep was identified in only 2/21 subjects. Slow wave activity lacked the normal diurnal and ultradian periodicity and homeostatic decline found in healthy adults. In nearly all patients, SEF95 was consistently low without evidence of diurnal rhythmicity (median 6.3 [5.3, 7.8] Hz, n = 18). A circadian rhythm of aMT6s excretion was present in most (13/16, 81.3%) patients, but only 4 subjects had normal timing. Comparison of the SEF95 during the melatonin-based biological night and day revealed no difference between the 2 periods (P = 0.64). Conclusions: The circadian rhythms and PSG of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedation exhibit pronounced temporal disorganization. The finding that most subjects exhibited preserved, but phase delayed, excretion of aMT6s suggests that the circadian pacemaker of such patients may be free-running.

Auditory steady state response in the schizophrenia, first-degree relatives, and schizotypal personality disorder	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Auditory steady state potentials; Schizophrenia; Schizotypal personality disorder; First-degree relatives	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GENETIC RISK; GYRUS VOLUME; ABNORMALITIES; P300; SYNCHRONIZATION; ENDOPHENOTYPE; OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; STIMULATION	The power and phase synchronization of the auditory steady state response (ASSR) at 40 Hz stimulation is usually reduced in schizophrenia (SZ). The sensitivity of the 40 Hz ASSR to schizophrenia spectrum phenotypes, such as schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), or to familial risk has been less well characterized. We compared the ASSR of patients with SZ, persons with schizotypal personality disorder, first degree relatives of patients with SZ, and healthy control participants. ASSRs were obtained to 20, 30, 40 and 50 Hz click trains, and assessed using measures of power (mean trial power or MTP) and phase consistency (phase locking factor or PLF). The MTP to 40 Hz stimulation was reduced in relatives, and there was a trend for MTP reduction in SZ. The 40 Hz ASSR was not reduced in SPD participants. PLF did not differ among groups. These data suggest the 40 Hz ASSR is sensitive to familial risk factors associated with schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of isotretinoin treatment on sleep in patients with severe acne: a pilot study	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY			English	Article							RETINOIC ACID; RECEPTOR; GUIDELINES	Background There are a few case reports in literature that isotretinoin treatment may alter sleep architecture. Also studies in mice suggest a role of retinoids in the contribution of delta oscillations to the sleep electroencephalography. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of isotretinoin treatment on sleep architecture using polysomnography (PSG). Patients and methods Twelve severe acne vulgaris patients without any psychiatric and sleep disorders were treated with 0.5 mg/kg of isotretinoin. Clinician-administered acne questionnaire, psychiatric examination, Epworth sleepiness scale and PSG recordings were performed after the first month of treatment. Results Sleep efficiency was increased from 83.5% (62.889.0%, quartiles) to 89.5% (81.593.5%, quartiles; P = 0.036) and sleep latency decreased from 18.0 min (11.136.3, quartiles) to 15.5 min (9.319.0, quartiles; P = 0.023) following 1-month isotretinoin treatment. There were no significant changes in other sleep parameters of PSG and scores of Epworth sleepiness scale. Conclusions This study suggests that isotretinoin treatment slightly improves night-time sleep without any effects on sleep stages and daytime sleepiness.

Toward an electrocortical biomarker of cognition for newborn infants	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY CHANGE DETECTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG; DISCRIMINATION; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYSFUNCTION	The event-related potential (ERP) effect of mismatch negativity (MMN) was the first electrophysiological probe to evaluate cognitive processing (change detection) in newborn infants. Initial studies of MMN predicted clinical utility for this measure in identification of infants at risk for developmental cognitive deficits. These predictions have not been realized. We hypothesized that in sleeping newborn infants, measures derived from wavelet assessment of power in the MMN paradigm would be more robust markers of the brains response to stimulus change than the ERP-derived MMN. Consistent with this premise, we found increased power in response to unpredictable and infrequent tones compared to frequent tones. These increases were present at multiple locations on the scalp over a range of latencies and frequencies and occurred even in the absence of an ERP-derived MMN. There were two predominant effects. First, theta band power was elevated at middle and late latencies (200 to 600 ms), suggesting that neocortical theta rhythms that subserve working memory in adults are present at birth. Second, late latency (500 ms) increased power to the unpredictable and infrequent tones was observed in the beta and gamma bands, suggesting that oscillations involved in adult cognition are also present in the neonate. These findings support the expectation that frequency dependent measures, such as wavelet power, will improve the prospects for a clinically useful test of cortical function early in the postnatal period.

This novel excitation, also referred to as gyrosonic excitation in this work, has been found to have interesting effects such as stabilization effects on the left and right hemispheric brain signaling as captured by Galvanic Skin Resistance (GSR) measurements, control of cardiac rhythms (observed from ECG signals), mitigation of psychosomatic syndrome, and mitigation of migraine pain. Experimental data collected from human subjects are presented, and these data are examined to categorize the extent of systems disorder and reinforcement reward due to the gyrosonic stimulus. A multi-path reduced-order model has been developed to analyze the GSR signals. The filtered results are indicative of complicated reinforcing reward patterns due to the gyrosonic stimulation when it is used as a control input for patients with psychosomatic and cardiac disorders.

However, when elements of this network fail, pathological changes ensue, including epilepsy, one of the most common brain disorders. This review examines some aspects of cortical network organization that distinguish epileptic cortex from normal brain as well as the dynamics of network activity before and during seizures, focusing primarily on focal seizures. The review is organized around four phases of the seizure: the interictal period, onset, propagation, and termination. For each phase, the authors discuss the most common rhythmic characteristics of macroscopic brain voltage activity and outline the observed functional network features. Although the characteristics of functional networks that support the epileptic seizure remain an area of active research, the prevailing trends point to a complex set of network dynamics between, before, and during seizures.

This activity may be closely related to an oscillation between subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus. Since STN is the target of deep brain stimulation, it had been assumed that its action is on the nucleus itself. By means of simultaneous recordings of the firing activities from populations of neurons and the local field potentials in the motor cortex of freely moving Parkinsonian rats, this study casts doubt on this assumption. Instead, we found evidence that the corrective action is upon the cortex, where stochastic antidromic spikes originating from the STN directly modify the firing probability of the corticofugal projection neurons, destroy the dominance of beta rhythm, and thus restore motor control to the subjects, be they patients or rodents.

Here, we show that there is a sharp delineation between areas showing intense, hypersynchronous firing indicative of recruitment to the seizure, and adjacent territories where there is only low-level, unstructured firing. Thus, there is a core territory of recruited neurons and a surrounding 'ictal penumbra'. The defining feature of the 'ictal penumbra' is the contrast between the large amplitude EEG signals and the low-level firing there. Our human recordings bear striking similarities with animal studies of an inhibitory restraint, indicating that they can be readily understood in terms of this mechanism. These findings have important implications for how we localize seizure activity and map its spread.

Tibial nerve somatosensory evoked response detection using uni and multivariate coherence	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON)	MAY, 2010	GREECE	Int Federat Med & Biomed Engn (IFMBE), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Univ Patras		Somatosensory evoked potential; Magnitude-Squared Coherence (MSC); Ordinary Coherence; Multiple Coherence (MC); Objective Response Detection (ORD); Tibial nerve	MAGNITUDE-SQUARED COHERENCE; INTERMITTENT STIMULATION; POTENTIAL ESTIMATION; SENSORY STIMULATION; MULTIPLE COHERENCE; MULTICHANNEL EEG; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; PERIODIC SIGNAL; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	This work aims at comparing the capability of two Objective Response Detection techniques, the Magnitude-Squared Coherence (MSC or Ordinary Coherence) and its multivariate extension, the Multiple Coherence (MC), of detecting the somatosensory evoked response. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were collected during somatosensory stimulation from forty adult volunteers without history of neurological disease and with normal somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), using the 10-20 International System. All leads were referenced to the earlobe average. Current pulses with 200 mu s of duration were applied to the right posterior tibial nerve at the motor threshold intensity level (the lowest intensity able to produce hallux oscillations) at the rate of 5 Hz. The MSC was applied to the derivations [Cz], [Fz], [C3] and [C4] - commonly used for tibial nerve SEP recordings with bipolar derivations - and the MC was applied to the pairs [Cz][Fz] and [C3][C4]. Both estimates (MC and MSC) were calculated with M = 100 and 500 epochs and the response detection was based on rejecting the null hypothesis of response absence, which is achieved when the estimates exceed the critical value (detection threshold) calculated for a given significance level (alpha = 0.05). The results showed that if two leads are available, the application of the MC is better than the MSC applied to each lead individually. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Early Behavioral Intervention Is Associated With Normalized Brain Activity in Young Children With Autism	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism; early behavioral intervention; Early Start Denver Model; event-related potentials; brain activity	FACE; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; INFANTS	Objective: A previously published randomized clinical trial indicated that a developmental behavioral intervention, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), resulted in gains in IQ, language, and adaptive behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder. This report describes a secondary outcome measurement from this trial, EEG activity. Method: Forty-eight 18- to 30-month-old children with autism spectrum disorder were randomized to receive the ESDM or referral to community intervention for 2 years. After the intervention (age 48 to 77 months), EEG activity (event-related potentials and spectral power) was measured during the presentation of faces versus objects. Age-matched typical children were also assessed. Results: The ESDM group exhibited greater improvements in autism symptoms, IQ language, and adaptive and social behaviors than the community intervention group. The ESDM group and typical children showed a shorter Nc latency and increased cortical activation (decreased a power and increased 0 power) when viewing faces, whereas the community intervention group showed the opposite pattern (shorter latency event-related potential [ERP] and greater cortical activation when viewing objects). Greater cortical activation while viewing faces was associated with improved social behavior. Conclusions: This was the first trial to demonstrate that early behavioral intervention is associated with normalized patterns of brain activity, which is associated with improvements in social behavior, in young children with autism spectrum disorder.

A novel self-guided approach to alpha activity training	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha activity; Instrumental conditioning; Neurofeedback; Random beta training; Relaxation	EEG-ALPHA; NEUROFEEDBACK; OSCILLATIONS; FEEDBACK; RHYTHMS; IMPACT; TIME	Fifty healthy participants took part in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which they were either given auditory alpha activity (8-12 Hz) training (N=18), random beta training (N=12), or no training at all (N=20). A novel wireless electrode system was used for training without instructions, involving water-based electrodes mounted in an audio headset. Training was applied approximately at central electrodes. Post-training measurement using a conventional full-cap EEG system revealed a 10% increase in alpha activity at posterior sites compared to pre-training levels, when using the conventional index of alpha activity and a non-linear regression fit intended to model individual alpha frequency. This statistically significant increase was present only in the group that received the alpha training, and remained evident at a 3 month follow-up session, especially under eyes open conditions where an additional 10% increase was found. In an exit interview, approximately twice as many participants in the alpha training group (53%) mentioned that the training was relaxing, compared to those in either the beta (20%) or no training (21%) control groups. Behavioural measures of stress and relaxation were indicative of effects of alpha activity training but failed to reach statistical significance. These results are discussed in terms of a lack of statistical power. Overall, results suggest that self-guided alpha activity training using this novel system is feasible and represents a step forward in the ease of instrumental conditioning of brain rhythms.

In this study, a novel CIT method based on denoised P3 and machine learning was proposed to improve the accuracy of lie detection. Thirty participants were chosen as the guilty and innocent participants to perform the paradigms of 3 types of stimuli. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded and separated into many single trials. In order to enhance the signal noise ratio (SNR) of P3 components, the independent component analysis (ICA) method was adopted to separate non-P3 components (ie, artifacts) from every single trial. In order to automatically identify the P3 independent components (ICs), a new method based on topography template was proposed to automatically identify the P3 ICs. Then the P3 waveforms with high SNR were reconstructed on Pz electrodes. Second, the 3 groups of features based on time, frequency, and wavelets were extracted from the reconstructed P3 waveforms. Finally, 2 classes of feature samples were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier because it has higher performance compared with several other classifiers. Meanwhile, the optimal number of P3 ICs and some other parameter values in the classifiers were determined by the cross-validation procedures. The presented method achieved a balance test accuracy of 84.29% on detecting P3 components for the guilty and innocent participants. The presented method improves the efficiency of CIT in comparison with previous reported methods.

The medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) has been shown to support the expression of memories that initially depend on the hippocampus (HPC), yet the mechanisms by which the HPC and mPFC access the distributed representations in the neocortex are unknown. By measuring phase synchronization of local field potential (LFP) oscillations, we found that learning initiated changes in neuronal communication of the HPC and mPFC with the lateral entorhinal cortex(LEC), an area that is connected with many other neocortical regions. LFPs were recorded simultaneously from the three brain regions while rats formed an association between an auditory stimulus(CS) and eyelid stimulation(US) in a trace eyeblink conditioning paradigm, as well as during retention 1 month following learning. Over the course of learning, theta oscillations in the LEC and mPFC became strongly synchronized following presentation of the CS on trials in which rats exhibited a conditioned response (CR), and this strengthened synchronization was also observed during remote retention. In contrast, CS-evoked theta synchronization between the LEC and HPC decreased with learning. Our results suggest that communication between the LEC and mPFC are strengthened with learning where as the communication between the LEC and HPC are concomitantly weakened, suggesting that enhanced LEC-mPFC communication may be a neuronal correlate for theoretically proposed neocortical reorganization accompanying encoding and consolidation of a memory.

The rationale is that reverse speech is comparable to forward speech in terms of auditory characteristics, while omitting the linguistic components. Thus, it may control for non-language auditory functions. This finds some support in fMRI studies indicating that reverse speech resulted in less blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity in perisylvian regions than forward speech. We attempted to externally validate a reverse speech control task using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) in eight patients with intractable focal epilepsy. We studied adolescent and adult patients who underwent extraoperative ECoG prior to resective epilepsy surgery. All patients received an auditory language task during ECoG recording. Patients were presented 115 audible question stimuli, including 30 reverse speech trials. Reverse speech trials more strongly engaged bilateral superior temporal sites than did the corresponding forward speech trials. Forward speech trials elicited larger gamma-augmentation at frontal lobe sites not attributable to sensorimotor function. Other temporal and frontal sites of significant augmentation showed no significant difference between reverse and forward speech. Thus, we failed to validate reported evidence of weaker activation of temporal neocortices during reverse compared to forward speech. Superior temporal lobe engagement may indicate increased attention to reverse speech. Reverse speech does not appear to be a suitable task for the control of non-language auditory functions on ECoG.

In contrast, here, we used the attentional blink paradigm in combination with event-related brain potentials to examine whether the ongoing state of the brain before a stimulus can determine both conscious access and the poststimulus neural events associated with consciousness. Participants were required to detect 2 target letters from digit distractors while their brain activity was being recorded. Trials were classified based on whether the secondcritical target (T2) was detected. We found that T2-detection was predetermined by brain activity prior to the onset of the stimulation stream. Specifically, T2-detected trials were predicated by a frontocentral positive going deflection that started more than 200 ms before the stream began. Accurate T2 detection was also accompanied by enhanced poststimulus neural activity, as reflected by a larger P3b component. Furthermore, prestimulus and poststimulus markers of T2-detection were highly correlated with one another. We therefore argue that conscious experiences are shaped by potentially random fluctuations in neural activity. Overall, the results reveal that conscious access is underpinned by an important relationship involving predictive prestimulus neural activity and responsive poststimulus brain activity.

Channelrhodopsins shed light on a new pathway in absence epilepsy	FUTURE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; optogenetics; thalamus		Absence seizures are a common form of epilepsy characterized by sudden behavioral arrest in conjunction with a stereotypical spike-and-wave discharge on electroencephalography. A reciprocally connected network of thalamocortical neurons that normally controls sleep and other functions, misfires to cause absence epilepsy and is perhaps one of the most studied seizure networks. In a recent paper, Paz and colleagues further dissect this network to understand the basis of seizure initiation in a new animal model of absence epilepsy. Exploiting state-of-the-art 'optogenetic' methodology they systematically isolate monosynaptic connections in thalamocortical nuclei to reveal the key pathological mechanism underlying absence seizures in the Gria4(-/-)mouse. The main finding is a reduction in the strength of synapses made by excitatory cortical projection neurons onto the reticular thalamic nucleus. The consequent fall in reticular thalamic nucleus inhibitory neuron output results in less feed-forward inhibition of thalamocortical neurons and an increase in thalamic excitability that is, presumably, sufficient to initiate oscillations and absence seizures. The manuscript adds significantly to our understanding of how absence seizures can initiate by implicating, in this case, a thalamic rather than cortical basis. Further, the demonstration of this mode of circuit activity may have significant implications for how the thalamocortical network behaves physiologically.

Looming Signals Reveal Synergistic Principles of Multisensory Integration	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CORTICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; POTENTIAL ERP; VISUAL AREAS; PERCEPTION; STIMULUS; HUMANS	Multisensory interactions are a fundamental feature of brain organization. Principles governing multisensory processing have been established by varying stimulus location, timing and efficacy independently. Determining whether and how such principles operate when stimuli vary dynamically in their perceived distance (as when looming/receding) provides an assay for synergy among the above principles and also means for linking multisensory interactions between rudimentary stimuli with higher-order signals used for communication and motor planning. Human participants indicated movement of looming or receding versus static stimuli that were visual, auditory, or multisensory combinations while 160-channel EEG was recorded. Multivariate EEG analyses and distributed source estimations were performed. Nonlinear interactions between looming signals were observed at early poststimulus latencies (similar to 75 ms) in analyses of voltage waveforms, global field power, and source estimations. These looming-specific interactions positively correlated with reaction time facilitation, providing direct links between neural and performance metrics of multisensory integration. Statistical analyses of source estimations identified looming-specific interactions within the right claustrum/insula extending inferiorly into the amygdala and also within the bilateral cuneus extending into the inferior and lateral occipital cortices. Multisensory effects common to all conditions, regardless of perceived distance and congruity, followed (similar to 115 ms) and manifested as faster transition between temporally stable brain networks (vs summed responses to unisensory conditions). We demonstrate the early-latency, synergistic interplay between existing principles of multisensory interactions. Such findings change the manner in which to model multisensory interactions at neural and behavioral/perceptual levels. We also provide neurophysiologic backing for the notion that looming signals receive preferential treatment during perception.

Neural restoration of degraded audiovisual speech	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Audiovisual integration; Auditory evoked potentials; EEG; Illusory filling-in; Phase-locking; Theta band	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; PHONEMIC RESTORATION; SENTENCE CONTEXT; ILLUSORY CONTINUITY; RECOGNITION; INTEGRATION; PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES	When speech is interrupted by noise, listeners often perceptually "fill-in" the degraded signal, giving an illusion of continuity and improving intelligibility. This phenomenon involves a neural process in which the auditory cortex (AC) response to onsets and offsets of acoustic interruptions is suppressed. Since meaningful visual cues behaviorally enhance this illusory filling-in, we hypothesized that during the illusion, lip movements congruent with acoustic speech should elicit a weaker AC response to interruptions relative to static (no movements) or incongruent visual speech. AC response to interruptions was measured as the power and inter-trial phase consistency of the auditory evoked theta band (4-8 Hz) activity of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the N1 and P2 auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). A reduction in the NI and P2 amplitudes and in theta phase-consistency reflected the perceptual illusion at the onset and/or offset of interruptions regardless of visual condition. These results suggest that the brain engages filling-in mechanisms throughout the interruption, which repairs degraded speech lasting up to similar to 250 ms following the onset of the degradation. Behaviorally, participants perceived speech continuity over longer interruptions for congruent compared to incongruent or static audiovisual streams. However, this specific behavioral profile was not mirrored in the neural markers of interest. We conclude that lip-reading enhances illusory perception of degraded speech not by altering the quality of the AC response, but by delaying it during degradations so that longer interruptions can be tolerated.

This biophysical relationship is common to popular algorithms that infer neuronal generators via inverse solutions. It may be further simplified as Poisson's source equation, which identifies underlying current generators from estimates of the second spatial derivative of the field potential (Laplacian transformation). Intracranial current source density (CSD) studies have dissected the "cortical dipole" into intracortical sources and sinks, corresponding to physiologically-meaningful patterns of neuronal activity at a sublaminar resolution, much of which is locally cancelled (i.e., closed field). By virtue of the macroscopic scale of the scalp-recorded EEG, a surface Laplacian reflects the radial projections of these underlying currents, representing a unique, unambiguous measure of neuronal activity at scalp. Although the surface Laplacian requires minimal assumptions compared to complex, model-sensitive inverses, the resulting waveform topographies faithfully summarize and simplify essential constraints that must be placed on putative generators of a scalp potential topography, even if they arise from deep or partially-closed fields. CSD methods thereby provide a global empirical and biophysical context for generator localization, spanning scales from intracortical to scalp recordings.

Methods: Electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from freely moving rats (n=23) before status epilepticus (SE) induced by i.p. pilocarpine (PILO) injection as baseline, and on days 1, 3 and 7 after SE. We assessed several features from cardiac interbeat intervals, including linear, non-linear and frequency parameters of interbeat intervals, and power spectra of interpolated intervals during epileptogenesis. After thresholding, the altered values were applied to a non-linear classifier. The non-linear classifier divided animals into two groups; with and without epilepsy, based on all collected data. Results: We found that none of the single altered parameters in cardiac activity emerged as a sole biomarker for epileptogenesis. However, the non-linear classifier distinguished animals that later developed from those and did not develop epilepsy. The non-linear classification was performed on preliminary findings from 23 animals; six did not develop epilepsy and the rest did. The average positive predictive value (precision rate) was 78%. This was calculated based on the average sensitivity and specificity, which were 80.6% and 35.2% respectively, for the 100 classification passes. We also showed that these numbers would have increased as the number of subjects increased. Conclusion: Changes to the brain caused by status epilepticus that lead to epileptogenesis have systemic effects, and alter cardiac activity. A non-linear classifier performed on several extracted features of cardiac interbeat intervals may be useful as a biomarker to identify animals with low and high probability of developing epilepsy after status epilepticus.

Here, we used EEG to record cortical responses evoked by single letters to directly test if their visual processing is actually influenced by their motor content. We manipulated the "motor familiarity" of letters that we considered high for letters written by the observers themselves, medium for letters written by other individuals, and low for printed, machine designed letters. In order to relate the effects of motor familiarity to the activation of the primary motor cortex, we also directly manipulated its availability during the visual task: we computed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) over the posterior cortex during a dual task where participants had to observe the letters while performing unrelated self-paced brief movements of the right hand approximately every 5 s (allowing the primary motor cortex to successively activate and "idle"). At 300-350 ms and 500-600 ms after stimulus onset, the amplitude of the ERP components markedly reflected the level of motor familiarity of the observed letter. Nonetheless, this was true only when the primary motor cortex was in an "idling" state: when the motor cortex was in an activation state, this motor familiarity effect was dropped. This clearly indicates that, at these latencies, the motor information embedded in letters is processed in the brain and that this processing depends on the activation state of the left primary motor cortex.

These regions are also engaged when preparing to stop. We aimed to elucidate the roles of these regions by harnessing the high spatio-temporal resolution of electrocorticography (ECoG), and by using a task that engages both preparing to stop and stopping outright. First, we validated the task using fMRI in 16 healthy control participants to confirm that both the preSMA and the rIFG were active. Next, we studied a rare patient with intracranial grid coverage of both these regions, using macrostimulation, diffusion tractography, cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) and task-based ECoG. Macrostimulation of the preSMA induced behavioral motor arrest. Diffusion tractography revealed a structural connection between the preSMA and rIFG. CCEP analysis showed that stimulation of the preSMA evoked strong local field potentials within 30 ms in rIFG. During the task, when preparing to stop, there was increased high gamma amplitude (similar to 70-250 Hz) in both regions, with preSMA preceding rIFG by similar to 750 ms. For outright stopping there was also a high gamma amplitude increase in both regions, again with preSMA preceding rIFG. Further, at the time of stopping, there was an increase in beta band activity (similar to 16 Hz) in both regions, with significantly stronger inter-regional coherence for successful vs. unsuccessful stop trials. The results complement earlier reports of a structural/functional action control network between the preSMA and rIFG. They go further by revealing between-region timing differences in the high gamma band when preparing to stop and stopping outright. They also reveal strong between-region coherence in the beta band when stopping is successful. Implications for theories of action control are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Seizure characteristics in Pallister-Killian syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						Pallister; Killian; seizures; epilepsy; 12p; tetrasomy	WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME; ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; RETT-SYNDROME; EPILEPTIC SPASMS; AICARDI-SYNDROME; PHENOTYPE; DELETION; SPECTRUM; PATTERNS; CHILDREN	PallisterKillian syndrome (PKS) is a congenital disorder attributed to supernumerary isochromosome 12p mosaicism. Craniofacial dysmorphism, learning impairment and seizures are considered cardinal features. However, little is known regarding the seizure and epilepsy patterns in PKS. To better define the prevalence and spectrum of seizures in PKS, we studied 51 patients (39 male, 12 female; median age 4 years and 9 months; age range 7 months to 31 years) with confirmed 12p tetrasomy. Using a parent-based structured questionnaire, we collected data regarding seizure onset, frequency, timing, semiology, and medication therapy. Patients were recruited through our practice, at PKS Kids family events, and via the PKS Kids website. Epilepsy occurred in 27 (53%) with 23 (85%) of those with seizures having seizure onset prior to 3.5 years of age. Mean age at seizure onset was 2 years and 4 months. The most common seizure types were myoclonic (15/27, 56%), generalized convulsions (13/27, 48%), and clustered tonic spasms (similar to infantile spasms; 8/27, 30%). Thirteen of 27 patients with seizures (48%) had more than one seizure type with 26 out of 27 (96%) ever having taken antiepileptic medications. Nineteen of 27 (70%) continued to have seizures and 17/27 (63%) remained on antiepileptic medication. The most commonly used medications were: levetiracetam (10/27, 37%), valproic acid (10/27, 37%), and topiramate (9/27, 33%) with levetiracetam felt to be most helpful by parents (6/27, 22%). Further exploration of seizure timing, in-depth analysis of EEG recordings, and collection of MRI data to rule out confounding factors is warranted. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

They share major common characteristics: the appearance and resolution of electroclinical features are age related, there is a strong genetic predisposition, the clinical course is often mild with infrequent and easy to control seizures, interictal epileptiform activity is disproportionately abundant when compared with the clinical correlate, and tends to potentiate and generalize during sleep. In this review, we outline the relevant pathophysiology underlying this electroclinical spectrum. Then, the initial description of individual syndromes is followed by a summary of overlapping features and intermediate presentations that question the boundaries between these entities and provide the basis for the concept of a childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome. Additionally, we outline the main features of the related epileptic encephalopathies. An outlook on potential future lines of research completes this review.

Fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform were compared to classical automated cycle counting in the time domain. With fast Fourier and wavelet transform, test results with healthy adult subjects, demented and psychiatric patients revealed typical short-term variations of the instantaneous IAFs of about +/- 2 Hz. When cycles were counted in the time domain, however, variations of only +/- 1 Hz were recorded. Thus, IAF measurement in the time domain appears to be particularly suitable. We also observed long-term IAF trends that typically amounted to about +/- 0.5 to +/- 1.0 Hz. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the IAF does not constitute an intra-individual constant but varies with time and cognitive state. Our fully automatic real-time signal-processing procedure includes pre-processing for artifact detection and for localization of segments with synchronized alpha oscillations where the IAF should preferably be measured.

The medial frontal cortex (MFC) is thought to detect conflicts and recruit additional resources from other brain areas including the lateral prefrontal cortices. Here we investigated how the MFC acts in concert with visual, motor, and lateral prefrontal cortices to support adaptations of goal-directed behavior. Physiologically, these interactions may occur through local and long-range synchronized oscillation dynamics, particularly in the theta range (4-8 Hz). A speeded flanker task allowed us to investigate conflict-type-specific control networks for perceptual and response conflicts. Theta power over MFC was sensitive to both perceptual and response conflict. Interareal theta phase synchrony, however, indicated a selective enhancement specific for response conflicts between MFC and left frontal cortex as well as between MFC and the presumed motor cortex contralateral to the response hand. These findings suggest that MFC theta-band activity is both generally involved in conflict processing and specifically involved in linking a neural network controlling response conflict.

A definite AD diagnosis is established after examination of brain tissue. However, an accurate identification should be attempted to effectively apply therapeutic strategies. The aim of the present study was to perform regional analysis of spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity to describe brain dynamics in AD. Several spectral and non-linear parameters were calculated to obtain a comprehensive description of the spatial abnormalities in brain dynamics. Our findings showed a significant global slowing of MEG activity in AD, as well as a significant loss of irregularity and complexity in several brain regions. Spectral and non-linear parameters reached classification accuracies of around 80%. The results suggest the potential usefulness of spectral and non-linear parameters to characterize the cognitive and functional abnormalities of dementia. These parameters can yield information useful in clinical AD diagnosis and provide further insights on underlying brain dynamics.

Experiments were carried out on naive and epileptic mice under urethane anesthesia. Local field potentials were recorded with chronically implanted microelectrodes and single unit activity was recorded with glass microelectrodes. Recorded neurons were labeled by neurobiotin and identified later as granular cells or interneurons in histological sections. The following major features differentiate the pattern of UDS in epilepsy from normal. (1) The duration of UP and Down phases is significantly longer. (2) Recovery of network excitability after termination of the UP phase is longer. (3) UP-spikes occur during the UP phase, which transiently interrupt the development of the normal electrographic pattern of UP phase. Our data provide evidence that UP-spikes result from gigantic EPSPs generated in response to afferent activity. UP-spikes in the neocortex and dentate gyrus occur in close temporal relationship indicating the existence of direct or indirect pathological functional connections between these areas. Changes in the duration of UP and Down phases as well increased time of recovery of excitability of epileptic brain after termination of UP phase suggest alterations in the homeostatic properties of neuronal network in epileptic brain. We suggest that the existence of UP-spikes in epileptic brain may be an additional electrographic pattern indicating epileptogenicity. Unraveling the neuronal substrates of UP-spikes may further improve our understanding of the mechanisms of epilepsy. (C) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several explanations have been proposed, which focus primarily on cognitive aspects, such as attentional filter-, capacity limitation- and retrieval failure-processes. Here, we focus on the hypothesis that an entrainment of alpha oscillations (with a frequency of about 10 Hz) is a critical factor for the attentional blink phenomenon. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that item presentation rate in the RSVP typically lies in the alpha frequency range and is motivated by theories assuming an inhibitory function for alpha. We predict that entrainment - during the time window of T2 presentation - is larger for attentional blink (AB) items (when T2 cannot be reported) than for NoAB trials (when T2 cannot be reported). The results support our hypothesis and show that alpha entrainment as measured by the amplitude of the alpha evoked response and the extent of alpha phase concentration is larger for AB than for NoAB trials. Together with the lack of differences in alpha power these findings demonstrate that the differences between AB and NoAB trials - during presentation onset of T2 - are due to an entrainment of alpha phase and not due to an amplitude modulation. Thus, we conclude that alpha entrainment may be considered the critical factor underlying the attentional blink phenomenon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Gamma-Band Activity in Human Prefrontal Cortex Codes for the Number of Relevant Items Maintained in Working Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; PARIETAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; MOTOR AREA; EEG-ALPHA; TASK	Previous studies in electrophysiology have provided consistent evidence for a relationship between neural oscillations in different frequency bands and the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). While the amplitude and cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations have been shown to be modulated by the number of items retained during WM, interareal phase synchronization has been associated with the integration of distributed activity during WM maintenance. Together, these findings provided important insights into the oscillatory dynamics of cortical networks during WM. However, little is known about the cortical regions and frequencies that underlie the specific maintenance of behaviorally relevant information in WM. In the current study, we addressed this question with magnetoencephalography and a delayed match-to-sample task involving distractors in 25 human participants. Using spectral analysis and beamforming, we found a WM load-related increase in the gamma band (60-80 Hz) that was localized to the right intraparietal lobule and left Brodmann area 9 (BA9). WM-load related changes were also detected at alpha frequencies (10-14 Hz) in Brodmann area 6, but did not covary with the number of relevant WM-items. Finally, we decoded gamma-band source activity with a linear discriminant analysis and found that gamma-band activity in left BA9 predicted the number of target items maintained in WM. While the present data show that WM maintenance involves activity in the alpha and gammab and, our results highlight the specific contribution of gammab and delay activity in prefrontal cortex for the maintenance of behaviorally relevant items.

While gamma band power can be modulated by attention, the frequency of gamma band activity is known to decrease with age. The present study tested the hypothesis that reduced visual attention is associated with a change in induced gamma band activity. To this end, 26 patients with liver cirrhosis and 8 healthy controls were tested. A subset of patients showed symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a frequent neuropsychiatric complication in liver disease, which comprises a gradual increase of cognitive dysfunction including attention deficits. All participants completed a behavioral task requiring shifts of attention between simultaneously presented visual and auditory stimuli. Brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The individual critical flicker frequency (CFF) was assessed as it is known to reliably reflect the severity of HE. Results showed correlations of behavioral data and HE severity, as indexed by CFF. Individual visual gamma band peak frequencies correlated positively with the CFF (r = 0.41). Only participants with normal, but not with pathological CFF values showed a modulation of gamma band power with attention. The present results suggest that CFF and attentional performance are related. Moreover, a tight relation between the CFF and occipital gamma band activity both in frequency and power is shown. Thus, the present study provides evidence that a reduced CFF in HE, a disease associated with attention deficits, is closely linked to a slowing of gamma band activity and impaired modulation of gamma band power in a bimodal attention task.

Thalamic model of awake alpha oscillations and implications for stimulus processing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							TERM-MEMORY TASK; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MU RHYTHM; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; MODULATION; NUCLEUS; EEG	We describe a unique conductance-based model of awake thalamic alpha and some of its implications for function. The full model includes a model for a specialized class of high-threshold thalamocortical cells (HTC cells), which burst at the alpha frequency at depolarized membrane potentials (similar to-56 mV). Our model generates alpha activity when the actions of either muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) agonists on thalamic reticular (RE), thalamocortical (TC), and HTC cells are mimicked. In our model of mGluR1-induced alpha, TC cells are equally likely to fire during any phase of alpha, consistent with in vitro experiments. By contrast, in our model of mAChR-induced alpha, TC cells tend to fire either at the peak or the trough of alpha, depending on conditions. Our modeling suggests that low levels of mGluR1 activation on a background of mAChR agonists may be able to initiate alpha activity that biases TC cells to fire at certain phases of alpha, offering a pathway for cortical control. If we introduce a strong stimulus by increasing the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to TC cells, an increase in alpha power is needed to mimic the level of phasing of TC cells observed in vivo. This increased alpha power reduces the probability that TC cells spike near the trough of alpha. We suggest that mAChR-induced alpha may contribute to grouping TC activity into discrete perceptual units for processing, whereas mGluR1-induced alpha may serve the purpose of blocking unwanted stimuli from reaching the cortex.

We then tested the modulatory effect of the emotional conditions on auditory responses. Novel distractor sounds did not affect behavioural accuracy on subjects' visual task performance in neutral context but markedly decreased hit rate in the appetitive one. Similarly, gamma-PS to novel sounds remained intact in neutral context, whereas it showed an increase, within the 35-Hz sub-range, in the appetitive context. These results suggest that a context of processing positive emotional stimuli results into an enhanced processing of task-irrelevant novel auditory events, and, furthermore, that gamma-PS is tuned under conditions that could promote long-term survival.

J	Dumas, G; Chavez, M; Nadel, J; Martinerie, J				Dumas, Guillaume; Chavez, Mario; Nadel, Jacqueline; Martinerie, Jacques			Anatomical Connectivity Influences both Intra- and Inter-Brain Synchronizations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MRI; SMALL-WORLD; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; MULTISTABILITY; COMMUNICATION; COMPLEXITY; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS	Recent development in diffusion spectrum brain imaging combined to functional simulation has the potential to further our understanding of how structure and dynamics are intertwined in the human brain. At the intra-individual scale, neurocomputational models have already started to uncover how the human connectome constrains the coordination of brain activity across distributed brain regions. In parallel, at the inter-individual scale, nascent social neuroscience provides a new dynamical vista of the coupling between two embodied cognitive agents. Using EEG hyperscanning to record simultaneously the brain activities of subjects during their ongoing interaction, we have previously demonstrated that behavioral synchrony correlates with the emergence of inter-brain synchronization. However, the functional meaning of such synchronization remains to be specified. Here, we use a biophysical model to quantify to what extent inter-brain synchronizations are related to the anatomical and functional similarity of the two brains in interaction. Pairs of interacting brains were numerically simulated and compared to real data. Results show a potential dynamical property of the human connectome to facilitate inter-individual synchronizations and thus may partly account for our propensity to generate dynamical couplings with others.

We hypothesized that distinguishable iGBA suppression effects can be related to the processing of (a) perceptual aspects, and (b) conceptual aspects of cortical object representations. Participants were asked to perform a semantic classification task with pictures of real world objects and their semantically corresponding words, using a design that isolated distinct levels of the neural suppression effect. By means of volumetric source analysis we located stimulus domain-specific iGBA repetition suppression effects (60-90 Hz) in temporal, parietal, and occipital areas of the human cortex. In contrast, domain-unspecific iGBA repetition suppression, corresponding to conceptual priming, was restricted to left temporal brain regions. We propose that the selective involvement of left temporal areas points to the activation of conceptual representations, whereas more posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas probably reflect perceptual aspects of higher-order visual object processing.

From Spinal Central Pattern Generators to Cortical Network: Integrated BCI for Walking Rehabilitation	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; KINEMATIC COORDINATION; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; CORD-INJURY; MOVEMENT; STIMULATION; CORTEX; IDENTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Success in locomotor rehabilitation programs can be improved with the use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Although a wealth of research has demonstrated that locomotion is largely controlled by spinal mechanisms, the brain is of utmost importance in monitoring locomotor patterns and therefore contains information regarding central pattern generation functioning. In addition, there is also a tight coordination between the upper and lower limbs, which can also be useful in controlling locomotion. The current paper critically investigates different approaches that are applicable to this field: the use of electroencephalogram (EEG), upper limb electromyogram (EMG), or a hybrid of the two neurophysiological signals to control assistive exoskeletons used in locomotion based on programmable central pattern generators (PCPGs) or dynamic recurrent neural networks (DRNNs). Plantar surface tactile stimulation devices combined with virtual reality may provide the sensation of walking while in a supine position for use of training brain signals generated during locomotion.

Current research within the framework of Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) emphasizes the nexus between dynamic cycles in the brain and cognitive development which unfold in a nonlinear way and allow for individual variation. Careful observations over multiple timescales and levels of organization suggest a link to system-specific developmental changes in the central nervous system with more functional specialization opening up more efficient information processing. This can be seen in spurts of EEG energy and altered cortical coherence. Data of age- and experience-related changes in synaptic density and metabolism, shifts in blood flow and improvement of (sub) cortical connections are projected on a dynamic trajectory of cognition moving from diffuse to more refined constructions in the various subsystems, each of which exhibiting its own developmental path. Pending questions are the generation of rules amidst diversity and fluctuation, and the correlation of growth rate and critical mass in developmental dynamics and interaction.

In particular, pictures of familiar or unfamiliar objects were presented sequentially, with stimulus repetitions occurring within few trials. The results of both studies indicated close agreement between the pattern found in fMRI-BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) responses and in source localizations of induced gamma-band activity derived from MEG. In both studies, the brain regions that were significantly associated with repetition suppression in response to familiar visual objects encompassed bilaterally the medial and lateral occipital cortex, inferior occipitotemporal regions including the left fusiform cortex, as well as parietal areas. Modulations by stimulus familiarity occurred mainly within this network. Overall, we found noticeable correspondences between the results of fMRI-BOLD signals and MEG gamma-band activity, suggesting that both methods can be used in analogous ways to study the neural basis of repetition priming and object recognition.

However, the neural mechanisms that integrate information coded in long-term memory (LTM) with ongoing perceptual processing remain unknown. Here, we explore how the contents of LTM optimize perception by modulating anticipatory brain states. By using a paradigm that integrates LTM and attentional orienting, we first demonstrate that the contents of LTM sharpen perceptual sensitivity for targets presented at memory-predicted spatial locations. Next, we examine oscillations in EEG to show that memory-guided attention is associated with spatially specific desynchronization of alpha-band activity over visual cortex. Additionally, we use functional MRI to confirm that target-predictive spatial information stored in LTM triggers spatiotopic modulation of preparatory activity in extrastriate visual cortex. Finally, functional MRI results also implicate an integrated cortical network, including the hippocampus and a dorsal frontoparietal circuit, as a likely candidate for organizing preparatory states in visual cortex according to the contents of LTM.

We retrospectively studied four patients with a seizure focus of the left frontal lobe who underwent language mapping via electrocorticography. In three patients, we could group language task trials into 'spike' and 'non-spike' trials, based upon occurrence of spikes arising from the seizure onset zone during presentation of question stimuli. In one patient, we demonstrated a reduction in language-related gamma activity (80-100 Hz) at one dorsal superior frontal site outside the seizure onset zone; reduction in mean peak amplitude of 58.4% of baseline reference (95% C.I.: 31.6% to 85.1%). This site was located near the seizure onset zone and was associated with the greatest spike rate among sites of similar function. This is the first preliminary study to show an effect of interictal spikes upon language-related gamma activity of the lateral frontal lobe. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we identify six issues with existing effective connectivity methods that need to be addressed. The issues are discussed within the framework of linear dynamic systems for fMRI (LDSf). The first concerns the use of deterministic models to identify inter-regional effective connectivity. We show that deterministic dynamics are incapable of identifying the trial-to-trial variability typically investigated as the marker of connectivity while stochastic models can capture this variability. The second concerns the simplistic (constant) connectivity modeled by most methods. Connectivity parameters of the LDSf model can vary at the same timescale as the input data. Further, extending LDSf to mixtures of multiple models provides more robust connectivity variation. The third concerns the correct identification of the network itself including the number and anatomical origin of the network nodes. Augmentation of the LDSf state space can identify additional nodes of a network. The fourth concerns the locus of the signal used as a "node" in a network. A novel extension LDSf incorporating sparse canonical correlations can select most relevant voxels from an anatomically defined region based on connectivity. The fifth concerns connection interpretation. Individual parameter differences have received most attention. We present alternative network descriptors of connectivity changes which consider the whole network. The sixth concerns the temporal resolution of fMRI data relative to the timescale of the inter-regional interactions in the brain. LDSf includes an "instantaneous" connection term to capture connectivity occurring at timescales faster than the data resolution. The LDS framework can also be extended to statistically combine fMRI and EEG data. The LDSf framework is a promising foundation for effective connectivity analysis.

In contrast, neurophysiological insights from ERPs have been limited, as several different mechanisms lead to ERPs. Apart from stereotypically repeated responses (additive evoked responses), these mechanisms are asymmetric amplitude modulations and phase-resetting of ongoing oscillatory activity. Therefore, a method is needed that differentiates between these mechanisms and moreover quantifies the stability of a response. We propose a constrained subspace independent component analysis that exploits the multivariate information present in the all-to-all relationship of recordings over trials. Our method identifies additive evoked activity and quantifies its stability over trials. We evaluate identification performance for biologically plausible simulation data and two neurophysiological test cases: Local field potential (LFP) recordings from a visuomotor-integration task in the awake behaving macaque and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of steady-state visual evoked fields (SSVEFs). In the LFPs we find additive evoked response contributions in visual areas V2/4 but not in primary motor cortex A4, although visually triggered ERPs were also observed in area A4. MEG-SSVEFs were mainly created by additive evoked response contributions. Our results demonstrate that the identification of additive evoked response contributions is possible both in invasive and in non-invasive electrophysiological recordings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Theoretical accounts of cognitive control highlight anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central node in this network. However, a better understanding of the relative primacy and functional contributions of these areas to decision conflict requires insight into the neural dynamics of successive processing stages including conflict detection, response selection and execution. Moderate alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive control as it interferes with the ability to inhibit dominant, prepotent responses when they are no longer correct. To examine the effects of moderate intoxication on successive processing stages during cognitive control, spatio-temporal changes in total event-related theta power were measured during Stroop-induced conflict. Healthy social drinkers served as their own controls by participating in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) approach was applied to complex power spectra for theta (4-7 Hz) frequencies. The principal generator of event-related theta power to conflict was estimated to ACC, with contributions from fronto-parietal areas. The ACC was uniquely sensitive to conflict during both early conflict detection, and later response selection and execution stages. Alcohol attenuated theta power to conflict across successive processing stages, suggesting that alcohol-induced deficits in cognitive control may result from theta suppression in the executive network. Slower RTs were associated with attenuated theta power estimated to ACC, indicating that alcohol impairs motor preparation and execution subserved by the ACC. In addition to their relevance for the currently prevailing accounts of cognitive control, our results suggest that alcohol-induced impairment of top-down strategic processing underlies poor self-control and inability to refrain from drinking.

Neuromagnetic Indicators of Tinnitus and Tinnitus Masking in Patients with and without Hearing Loss	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						thalamocortical dysrhythmia; tinnitus masking; magnetoencephalography; cortical oscillations	RESIDUAL INHIBITION FUNCTIONS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; STIMULI; SPECTRA	Tinnitus is an auditory phenomenon characterised by the perception of a sound in the absence of an external auditory stimulus. Chronic subjective tinnitus is almost certainly maintained via central mechanisms, and this is consistent with observed measures of altered spontaneous brain activity. A number of putative central auditory mechanisms for tinnitus have been proposed. The influential thalamocortical dysrhythmia model suggests that tinnitus can be attributed to the disruption of coherent oscillatory activity between thalamus and cortex following hearing loss. However, the extent to which this disruption specifically contributes to tinnitus or is simply a consequence of the hearing loss is unclear because the necessary matched controls have not been tested. Here, we rigorously test several predictions made by this model in four groups of participants (tinnitus with hearing loss, tinnitus with clinically normal hearing, no tinnitus with hearing loss and no tinnitus with clinically normal hearing). Magnetoencephalography was used to measure oscillatory brain activity within different frequency bands in a 'resting' state and during presentation of a masking noise. Results revealed that low-frequency activity in the delta band (1-4 Hz) was significantly higher in the 'tinnitus with hearing loss' group compared to the 'no tinnitus with normal hearing' group. A planned comparison indicated that this effect was unlikely to be driven by the hearing loss alone, but could possibly be a consequence of tinnitus and hearing loss. A further interpretative linkage to tinnitus was given by the result that the delta activity tended to reduce when tinnitus was masked. High-frequency activity in the gamma band (25-80 Hz) was not correlated with tinnitus (or hearing loss). The findings partly support the thalamocortical dysrhythmia model and suggest that slow-wave (delta band) activity may be a more reliable correlate of tinnitus than high-frequency activity.

Gamma synchrony: Towards a translational biomarker for the treatment-resistant symptoms of schizophrenia	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Schizophrenia; Gamma oscillations; Electrophysiology; Endophenotype; Animal models; GABA	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; MIDLATENCY AUDITORY ERPS; RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VITRO; WORKING-MEMORY; 40 HZ; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; STEADY-STATE	The lack of efficacy for antipsychotics with respect to negative symptoms and cognitive deficits is a significant obstacle for the treatment of schizophrenia. Developing new drugs to target these symptoms requires appropriate neural biomarkers that can be investigated in model organisms, be used to track treatment response, and provide insight into pathophysiological disease mechanisms. A growing body of evidence indicates that neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) are disturbed in schizophrenia. Gamma synchrony has been shown to mediate a host of sensory and cognitive functions, including perceptual encoding, selective attention, salience, and working memory - neurocognitive processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and largely refractory to treatment. This review summarizes the current state of clinical literature with respect to gamma-band responses (GBRs) in schizophrenia, focusing on resting and auditory paradigms. Next, preclinical studies of schizophrenia that have investigated gamma-band activity are reviewed to gain insight into neural mechanisms associated with these deficits. We conclude that abnormalities in gamma synchrony are ubiquitous in schizophrenia and likely reflect an elevation in baseline cortical gamma synchrony ('noise') coupled with reduced stimulus-evoked GBRs ('signal'). Such a model likely reflects hippocampal and cortical dysfunction, as well as reduced glutamatergic signaling with downstream GABAergic deficits, but is probably less influenced by dopaminergic abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Finally, we propose that analogous signal-to-noise deficits in the flow of cortical information in preclinical models are useful targets for the development of new drugs that target the treatment-resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.

Both traditional literature and clinical data indicated that modulation effects largely depend on specific designated acupoints. However, scientific representations of acupoint specificity remain controversial. In the present study, considering the new findings on the sustained effects of acupuncture and its time-varied temporal characteristics, we employed an electrophysiological imaging modality namely magnetoencephalography with a temporal resolution on the order of milliseconds. Taken into account the differential band-limited signal modulations induced by acupuncture, we sought to explore whether or not stimulation at Stomach Meridian 36 (ST36) and a nearby non-meridian point (NAP) would evoke divergent functional connectivity alterations within delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Whole-head scanning was performed on 28 healthy participants during an eyes-closed no-task condition both preceding and following acupuncture. Data analysis involved calculation of band-limited power (BLP) followed by pair-wise BLP correlations. Further averaging was conducted to obtain local and remote connectivity. Statistical analyses revealed the increased connection degree of the left temporal cortex within delta (0.5-4 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-48 Hz) bands following verum acupuncture. Moreover, we not only validated the closer linkage of the left temporal cortex with the prefrontal and frontal cortices, but further pinpointed that such patterns were more extensively distributed in the ST36 group in the delta and beta bands compared to the restriction only to the delta band for NAP. Psychophysical results for significant pain threshold elevation further confirmed the analgesic effect of acupuncture at ST36. In conclusion, our findings may provide a new perspective to lend support for the specificity of neural expression underlying acupuncture.

CNTF-mediated preactivation of astrocytes attenuates neuronal damage and epileptiform activity in experimental epilepsy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Hippocampus; Granule cell dispersion; Cell death; Ciliary neurotrophic factor; Kainate; EEG; Fast ripples	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GRANULE CELL DISPERSION; CILIARY NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; ISCHEMIC TOLERANCE; REELIN DEFICIENCY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MOUSE MODEL	Activated astrocytes display a broad spectrum of properties, ranging from neuroprotection to active contribution to demise of neural tissue. To investigate if activation of astrocytes by a single, defined stimulus enhances neuroprotective properties, we tested whether injection of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) can ameliorate epilepsy-related brain damage. Intrahippocampal CNTF injection in mice induced a rapid (within 2 days) and persistent (3 weeks) activation of astrocytes reflected by strong upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA synthesis and GFAP immunoreactivity. Moreover, CNTF signaling via phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was specifically activated in GFAP-positive astrocytes. CNTF-mediated activation of astrocytes 2 days prior to an epileptogenic intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) resulted in strongly reduced cell death in the hilus and CA3 region of the hippocampus, revealed by Fluoro-Jade B staining. Granule cell dispersion, the pathological widening of the granule cell layer, was also significantly reduced 16 days after KA injection. Importantly, intrahippocampal in vivo recordings 3 weeks after KA injection showed that the occurrence of high frequency oscillations (fast ripples, FR), a surrogate marker for epileptic activity, was significantly reduced in CNTF + KA-injected mice as compared to KA-injected animals. However, when CNTF was applied in the chronic epileptic phase at 3 weeks after KA injection, no reduction of FR activity was observed. In summary, our results indicate that the activation of astrocytes prior to an excitotoxic injury effectively reduces neuronal damage and the severity of epileptiform activity, whereas activation in the chronic phase is no longer protective.

Intracerebral Evidence for Top-Down Activation of Temporal Voice Areas during Reading	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL MRI; CAUSAL CONNECTIVITY; AUDITORY IMAGERY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SELECTIVE AREAS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; TASK; REGIONS	As you might experience it while reading this sentence, silent reading often involves an imagery speech component: we can hear our own "inner voice" pronouncing words mentally. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have associated that component with increased metabolic activity in the auditory cortex, including voice-selective areas. It remains to be determined, however, whether this activation arises automatically from early bottom-up visual inputs or whether it depends on late top-down control processes modulated by task demands. To answer this question, we collaborated with four epileptic human patients recorded with intracranial electrodes in the auditory cortex for therapeutic purposes, and measured high-frequency (50 - 150 Hz) "gamma" activity as a proxy of population level spiking activity. Temporal voice-selective areas (TVAs) were identified with an auditory localizer task and monitored as participants viewed words flashed on screen. We compared neural responses depending on whether words were attended or ignored and found a significant increase of neural activity in response to words, strongly enhanced by attention. In one of the patients, we could record that response at 800 ms in TVAs, but also at 700 ms in the primary auditory cortex and at 300 ms in the ventral occipital temporal cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis revealed a considerable jitter between activation peaks in visual and auditory cortices. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the multimodal mental experience of reading is in fact a heterogeneous complex of asynchronous neural responses, and that auditory and visual modalities often process distinct temporal frames of our environment at the same time.

DCM for complex-valued data: Cross-spectra, coherence and phase-delays	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; NEURAL MASS MODEL; EVOKED-RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; SPREAD; NOISE	This note describes an extension of Bayesian model inversion procedures for the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) of complex-valued data. Modeling complex data can be particularly useful in the analysis of multivariate ergodic (stationary) time-series. We illustrate this with a generalization of DCM for steady-state responses that models both the real and imaginary parts of sample cross-spectra. DCM allows one to infer underlying biophysical parameters generating data (like synaptic time constants, connection strengths and conduction delays). Because transfer functions and complex cross-spectra can be generated from these parameters, one can also describe the implicit system architecture in terms of conventional (linear systems) measures; like coherence, phase-delay or cross-correlation functions. Crucially, these measures can be derived in both sensor and source-space. In other words, one can examine the cross-correlation or phase-delay functions between hidden neuronal sources using non-invasive data and relate these functions to synaptic parameters and neuronal conduction delays. We illustrate these points using local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, with a special focus on the relationship between conduction delays and the ensuing phase relationships and cross-correlation time lags between population activities.

In this study, we analyzed cortical connectivity in patients with severe neurocognitive disorder (SND) and in the minimally conscious state (MCS). We found two synchronized networks subserving consciousness; one retrolandic (cognitive network) and the other frontal (executive control network). The synchrony between these networks is severely disrupted in patients in the MCS as compared to those with better levels of consciousness and a preserved state of alertness (SND). The executive control network could facilitate the synchronization and coherence of large populations of distant cortical neurons using high frequency oscillations on a precise temporal scale. Consciousness is altered or disappears after losing synchrony and coherence. We suggest that the synchrony between anterior and retrolandic regions is essential to awareness, and that a functioning frontal lobe is a surrogate marker for preserved consciousness.

The weighted phase lag index (WPLI) was employed for estimating connectivity and compared to coherence. To further evaluate the network structure, a graph analysis based on WPLI was used to determine clustering coefficient (C) and betweenness centrality (BC) as local coefficients as well as the characteristic path length (L) as a parameter for global interconnectedness. The network's modular structure was also calculated to estimate functional segregation. A seed region was identified in the central occipital area based on the power distribution at the sensor level in the alpha band. WPLI reveals a specific connectivity map different from power and coherence. BC and modularity show a strong level of connectedness in the occipital area between lateral and central sensors. C shows different isolated areas of occipital sensors. Globally, a network with the shortest L is detected in the alpha band, consistently with the local results. Our results are in agreement with findings in adults, indicating a similar functional network in children at this age in the alpha band. The integrated use of WPLI and graph analysis can help to gain a better description of resting state networks.

Measuring functional connectivity in MEG: A multivariate approach insensitive to linear source leakage	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Neural oscillations; Functional connectivity; Multivariate analysis	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG DATA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; BEAMFORMER; HUMANS	A number of recent studies have begun to show the promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a means to non-invasively measure functional connectivity within distributed networks in the human brain. However, a number of problems with the methodology still remain - the biggest of these being how to deal with the non-independence of voxels in source space, often termed signal leakage. In this paper we demonstrate a method by which non-zero lag cortico-cortical interactions between the power envelopes of neural oscillatory processes can be reliably identified within a multivariate statistical framework. The method is spatially unbiased, moderately conservative in false positive rate and removes linear signal leakage between seed and target voxels. We demonstrate this methodology in simulation and in real MEG data. The multivariate method offers a powerful means to capture the high dimensionality and rich information content of MEG signals in a single imaging statistic. Given a significant interaction between two areas, we go on to show how classical statistical tests can be used to quantify the importance of the data features driving the interaction.

A crossmodal crossover: Opposite effects of visual and auditory perceptual load on steady-state evoked potentials to irrelevant visual stimuli	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Distractor interference; Frequency tagging; Neural oscillations; Perceptual load; Selective attention	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MOTION; MODULATION; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; RESPONSES; LOCUS; EEG	Mechanisms of attention are required to prioritise goal-relevant sensory events under conditions of stimulus competition. According to the perceptual load model of attention, the extent to which task-irrelevant inputs are processed is determined by the relative demands of discriminating the target: the more perceptually demanding the target task, the less unattended stimuli will be processed. Although much evidence supports the perceptual load model for competing stimuli within a single sensory modality, the effects of perceptual load in one modality on distractor processing in another is less clear. Here we used steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) to measure neural responses to irrelevant visual checkerboard stimuli while participants performed either a visual or auditory task that varied in perceptual load. Consistent with perceptual load theory, increasing visual task load suppressed SSEPs to the ignored visual checkerboards. In contrast, increasing auditory task load enhanced SSEPs to the ignored visual checkerboards. This enhanced neural response to irrelevant visual stimuli under auditory load suggests that exhausting capacity within one modality selectively compromises inhibitory processes required for filtering stimuli in another.

Adaptive time-varying detrended fluctuation analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Long-range temporal correlations; Long-range dependence; Scaling exponent; Neurophysiological time series; EEG; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Kalman filter; Non stationarity	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATION; ESTIMATORS; MODULATION; NETWORKS; NOISE	Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a technique commonly used to assess and quantify the presence of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in neurophysiological time series. Convergence of the method is asymptotic only and therefore its application assumes a constant scaling exponent. However, most neurophysiological data are likely to involve either spontaneous or experimentally induced scaling exponent changes. We present a novel extension of the DFA method that permits the characterisation of time-varying scaling exponents. The effectiveness of the methodology in recovering known changes in scaling exponents is demonstrated through its application to synthetic data. The dependence of the method on its free parameters is systematically explored. Finally, application of the methodology to neurophysiological data demonstrates that it provides experimenters with a way to identify previously un-recognised changes in the scaling exponent in the data. We suggest that this methodology will make it possible to go beyond a simple demonstration of the presence of scaling to an appreciation of how it may vary in response to either intrinsic changes or experimental perturbations.

Neurocognitive networks: Findings, models, and theory	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Cognition; Network; Attention; fMRI; Resting-state; Connectivity; Dynamics; Modeling; Dynamical systems; Synergy; Metastability	SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DEFAULT-MODE; CORTICAL NETWORKS; PARIETAL CORTEX; CELL ASSEMBLIES; DYNAMICS; EEG	Through its early history, cognitive neuroscience largely followed a modular paradigm wherein high-level cognitive functions were mapped onto locally segregated brain regions. However, recent evidence drives a continuing shift away from modular theories of cognitive brain function, and toward theories which hold that cognition arises from the integrated activity of large-scale, distributed networks of brain regions. A growing consensus favors the fundamental concept of this new paradigm: the large-scale cognitive brain network, or neurocognitive network. This consensus was the motivation for Neurocognitive Networks 2010 (NCN 2010), a conference sponsored by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program of the National Science Foundation, organized by Drs. Steven Bressler and Craig Richter of Florida Atlantic University (FAU), and held at FAU in Boca Raton, FL on January 29-30, 2010. NCN 2010 gathered together some of today's leading investigators of neurocognitive networks. This paper serves to review their presentations as they relate to the paradigm of neurocognitive networks, as well as to compile the emergent themes, questions, and possible future research directions that arose from the conference.

Detecting effective connectivity in networks of coupled neuronal oscillators	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Granger causality; Partial directed coherence; Phase dynamics modeling; Effective connectivity; Neuronal oscillators; Decision tree classifiers	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; GRANGER CAUSALITY; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; LINEAR-DEPENDENCE; SPIKE TRAINS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODELS; INHIBITION; FEEDBACK; EEG	The application of data-driven time series analysis techniques such as Granger causality, partial directed coherence and phase dynamics modeling to estimate effective connectivity in brain networks has recently gained significant prominence in the neuroscience community. While these techniques have been useful in determining causal interactions among different regions of brain networks, a thorough analysis of the comparative accuracy and robustness of these methods in identifying patterns of effective connectivity among brain networks is still lacking. In this paper, we systematically address this issue within the context of simple networks of coupled spiking neurons. Specifically, we develop a method to assess the ability of various effective connectivity measures to accurately determine the true effective connectivity of a given neuronal network. Our method is based on decision tree classifiers which are trained using several time series features that can be observed solely from experimentally recorded data. We show that the classifiers constructed in this work provide a general framework for determining whether a particular effective connectivity measure is likely to produce incorrect results when applied to a dataset.

Previous studies have succeeded in classifying movement intention and predicting hand trajectories from ECoG. Despite such successes, however, there still remains considerable work for the realization of ECoG-based BMIs as neuroprosthetics. We developed a method to predict multiple muscle activities from ECoG measurements. We also verified that ECoG signals are effective for predicting muscle activities in time varying series when performing sequential movements. ECoG signals were band-pass filtered into separate sensorimotor rhythm bands, z-score normalized, and smoothed with a Gaussian filter. We used sparse linear regression to find the best fit between frequency bands of ECoG and electromyographic activity. The best average correlation coefficient and the normalized root-mean-square error were 0.92 +/- 0.06 and 0.06 +/- 0.10, respectively, in the flexor digitorum profundus finger muscle. The delta (1.5 similar to 4Hz) and gamma 2 (50 gamma 90Hz) bands contributed significantly more strongly than other frequency bands (P<0.001). These results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting muscle activity from ECoG signals in an online fashion.

Direction of information flow was determined with the directed phase lag index (dPLI) defined as the probability that the instantaneous phase of X was smaller than the phase of Y (modulo pi). X was said to phase-lead Y if 0.5 < dPLI(xy) < = 1. The dPLI was used to characterize the phase relations between simulated EEG time series. The model consisted of 78 brain regions, coupled according to DTI findings in human subjects (Gong et al., 2009). Activity of each brain region was simulated with a neural mass model. Phase patterns were investigated as a function of coupling strength without stimulation, and with stimulation of the primary visual areas. At rest a clear spatial pattern of phase relations emerged with regions belonging to the anterior part of the default mode network leading in phase and regions belonging to the posterior part of the default mode network and surrounding visual areas lagging in phase. Patterns of phase leading and lagging displayed characteristic patterns with time scales from a few hundred milliseconds to 1-2 s. Stimulation of the primary visual areas induced a reversal of the global phase pattern with the visual and basal temporal areas leading and the anterior and superior frontal areas lagging in phase. This study shows that the directed phase lag index (dPLI) is an effective measure to characterize spatial temporal patterns of phase relations at rest and during stimulation. Coupling strength and node degree were found to be critical determinants of the direction of information flow. At a timescale of milliseconds to seconds the phase dynamics revealed spontaneous structure that might correspond to previously described "microstates". Stimulation of two visual areas reversed the global pattern of phase relations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Stam, C. J.; van Straaten, E. C.

The optimal location of high frequency deep brain stimulation (HF DBS) within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) region and the location of maximal beta hypersynchrony are currently matters of debate. Additionally, the effect of STN HF DBS on neural synchrony in functionally connected regions of motor cortex is unknown and is of great interest.. Scalp EEG studies demonstrated that stimulation of the STN can activate motor cortex antidromically, but the spatial specificity of this effect has not been examined. The present study examined the effect of STN HF DBS on neural synchrony within the cortico-basal ganglia network in patients with PD. We measured local field potentials dorsal to and within the STN of PD patients, and additionally in the motor cortex in a subset of these patients. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to guide the placement of subdural cortical surface electrodes over the DTI identified origin of the hyper direct pathway (HDP) between motor cortex and the STN. The results demonstrated that local beta power was attenuated during HF DBS both dorsal to and within the STN. The degree of attenuation was monotonic with increased DBS voltages in both locations, but this voltage-dependent effect was greater in the central STN than dorsal to the STN (p<0.05). Cortical signals over the estimated origin of the HDP also demonstrated attenuation of beta hypersynchrony during DBS dorsal to or within STN, whereas signals from non-specific regions of motor cortex were not attenuated. The spatially-specific suppression of beta synchrony in the motor cortex support the hypothesis that DBS may treat Parkinsonism by reducing excessive synchrony in the functionally connected sensorimotor network.

Methods: Dyads of subjects performed rhythmic finger movement under three different task conditions: intrinsic - maintain self-produced movement while ignoring their partner's movement; in-phase - synchronize with partner; and anti-phase - maintain syncopation with partner. Movement profiles of the dyads were used to estimate a synchronization index (SI) to verify differences in coordination according to each task. EEG was recorded during task performance and at baseline (partner's actions hidden from view). Log power ratios of mu band activity (active against baseline) were used to assess the relative levels of synchronization/de-synchronization in both the upper and lower mu bands. Results: Results confirm a functional dissociation of lower (8-10 Hz) and upper (10-12 Hz) mu bands in social coordination tasks. Lower mu band activity was independent of specific modulations across tasks and hemispheric preferences. Upper mu band activity was sensitive to coordination tasks and exhibited marked differences between the hemispheres. Accentuated de-synchronization of right relative to left hemisphere in the anti-phase task appeared related to the greater demand of perceptual-motor discrimination. Left hemisphere de-synchronization in both in-phase and anti-phase coordination was interpreted in terms of successful production of imitation. Right hemisphere synchronization in the intrinsic task was interpreted as inhibition of an imitative response tendency. Conclusions: Functional dissociation of lower and upper mu band and hemispheric preferences exists in real-time social coordination. Significance: This research attests to the merit of analyzing sub-band activity in the alpha-mu domain in order to identify neural correlates of social coordination. Such 'neuromarkers' may be relevant for brain disorders such as apraxia and autism. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Disruption of Rolandic Gamma-Band Functional Connectivity by Seizures is Associated with Motor Impairments in Children with Epilepsy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; MEMORY FORMATION; EEG ACTIVITY; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; RESPONSES; RESECTION	Although children with epilepsy exhibit numerous neurological and cognitive deficits, the mechanisms underlying these impairments remain unclear. Synchronization of oscillatory neural activity in the gamma frequency range (>30 Hz) is purported to be a mechanism mediating functional integration within neuronal networks supporting cognition, perception and action. Here, we tested the hypothesis that seizure-induced alterations in gamma synchronization are associated with functional deficits. By calculating synchrony among electrodes and performing graph theoretical analysis, we assessed functional connectivity and local network structure of the hand motor area of children with focal epilepsy from intracranial electroencephalographic recordings. A local decrease in inter-electrode phase synchrony in the gamma bands during ictal periods, relative to interictal periods, within the motor cortex was strongly associated with clinical motor weakness. Gamma-band ictal desychronization was a stronger predictor of deficits than the presence of the seizure-onset zone or lesion within the motor cortex. There was a positive correlation between the magnitude of ictal desychronization and impairment of motor dexterity in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral hand. There was no association between ictal desynchronization within the hand motor area and non-motor deficits. This study uniquely demonstrates that seizure-induced disturbances in cortical functional connectivity are associated with network-specific neurological deficits.

J	Kasprzak, C				Kasprzak, C.			Influence of Infrasound on the Alpha Rhythm of EEG Signal	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A			English	Article								The alpha waves were first registered and named by Berger in 1929. They are oscillations in the frequency range 8-12 Hz, originating from the occipital lobe during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The alpha blockage is the result of desynchronisation of the bioelectric activity of the brain induced by sensory stimulation. When the subject's eyes are closed, the alpha rhythm is generated. As soon as the eyes are open, alpha disappears. This is called alpha block and may be elicited also by any form of sensory stimulation. This replacement of the alpha rhythm is also called desynchronization because it represents a change of the synchronized activity of neural elements. This state is also called arousal or alerting response. Infrasounds are acoustic waves of frequency below 20 Hz. They are not directly perceived by humans because the natural frequency of vibrations of the past of the basilar membrane distant from the round window is about 20 Hz. The hearing organ, therefore, is well adapted to receive waves with frequency in excess of 20 Hz. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effects of infrasound waves on variations in the alpha waves. Tests were done on a group of 32 participants. The experiment showed that infrasounds of frequency f = 7 Hz and acoustic pressure level SPL = 120 dB (HP) cause a statistically significant reduction of the alpha rhythm power.

Vestibular lesions also impair hippocampal theta rhythm in rats. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether restoring theta rhythm to the hippocampus of a rat, via stimulation of the medial septum, would repair the deficits caused by vestibular lesions. It was hypothesized that the restoration of theta would repair the deficits and the vestibular rats would exhibit behavior and EEG similar to that of the sham rats. Rats were given either sham surgery or bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) followed in a later operation by electrode implants. Half of the lesioned rats received stimulation. Subjects were tested in open field, elevated T-maze and spatial nonmatching to sample tests. BVD caused a deficit in hippocampal theta rhythm. Stimulation restored theta power at a higher frequency in the vestibular-lesioned rats, however, the stimulation did not repair the cognitive and emotional deficits caused by the lesions. It was concluded that stimulation, at least in the form used here, would not be a viable treatment option for vestibular damaged humans. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the present work we study the variability of ice winter severity index in the Baltic Sea since the 15th century and its possible connection with solar activity. Based on a new method for finding and measuring amplitude-phase cross-frequency coupling in time series with a low signal/noise ratio, we suggest that the ice winter severity index in the Baltic Sea is modulated by solar activity and solar motion in several frequency bands during the last 500 years. According to our model a strong coupling between the decadal periodicity in the ice winter severity index time series and the secular periodicity of solar activity is present. We found that the ice winter severity index is strongly modulated by solar activity at the decadal periodicity. We also found that the 180 year periodicity of the Barycentre motion modulates the amplitudes of the decadal periodicity of solar activity and the ice winter severity index. This method represents a useful tool to study the solar-terrestrial relationship. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Velasco Herrera, V.

Thalamus and cerebral cortex are the brain areas that have attracted most of the attention from both clinical and experimental researchers. However, these studies have often favored either one or the other structure in playing a major role, thus leading to conflicting interpretations. Beginning with Jasper and Penfields topistic view of absence seizures as the result of abnormal functions in the so-called centrencephalon, we witness the naissance of a broader concept that considered both thalamus and cortex as equal players in the process of SW discharge generation. Furthermore, we discuss how recent studies have identified fine changes in cortical and thalamic excitability that may account for the expression of absence seizures in naturally occurring genetic rodent models and knockout mice. The end of this fascinating tale is presumably far from being written. However, I can confidently conclude that in the unfolding of this novel, we have discovered several molecular, cellular, and pharmacologic mechanisms that govern forebrain excitability, and thus consciousness, during the awake state and sleep.

With this purpose in mind, we noninvasively recorded electroencephalographic signals, using a modified version of the Wisconsin card sorting task, in which feedback processing and task switching could be studied separately. A similar late positive component was observed for the switch and correct feedback signals on the first trials of a series, but feedback-related negativity was observed only for incorrect feedback. Moreover, whereas theta power showed a significant increase after a switch cue and after the first positive feedback of a new series, a selective frontal beta-gamma increase was observed exclusively in the first positive feedback (i.e., after the selection of the new rule). Importantly, for the switch cue, beta-alpha activity was suppressed rather than increased. This clear dissociation between the cue and feedback stimuli in task switching emphasizes the need to accurately study brain oscillatory activity to disentangle the role of different cognitive control processes.

With time, a reorganization of brain areas supporting memory takes place, which can ultimately result in memories becoming independent of the hippocampus. While it is theorized that with time, the neocortical representations become linked by higher order neocortical association areas, this remains to be experimentally supported. In this study, 24 human participants encoded sets of face-location associations, which they retrieved 1 or 25 h later ("recent" and "remote" conditions, respectively), while their brain activity was recorded using whole-head magnetoencephalography. We investigated changes in the functional interactions between the neocortical representational areas emerging over time. To assess functional interactions, trial-by-trial high gamma (60-140 Hz) power correlations were calculated between the neocortical representational areas relevant to the encoded information, namely the fusiform face area (FFA) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). With time, both the FFA and the PPC increased their functional interactions with the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Given that the ATL is involved in semantic representation of paired associates, our results suggest that, already within 25 h after acquiring new memory associations, neocortical functional links are established via higher order semantic association areas.

Increasing evidence in the visual modality emphasizes the anticipatory adjustment of visual cortex excitability through modulations of oscillatory alpha power. In the auditory system, however, this relationship has not yet been established. Furthermore, the association between anticipatory modulations of auditory alpha power and a potential top-down network within these anticipatory preparation processes remains unexplained. To disclose these processes, we recorded magnetoencephalography while visually cuing participants to attend to either ear and to anticipate forthcoming auditory stimuli. For the cue-stimulus phase, we expected an asymmetric modulation of auditory alpha power when attending to the left or right ear, assuming that frontoparietal regions would phase synchronize with the auditory cortex in an asymmetric pattern. Beamformer source solutions demonstrate an asymmetric modulation of auditory alpha power following visual cues expressed in a strong right auditory alpha power increase when attending to the right ear. Furthermore, the right auditory cortex is functionally connected to the frontal eye fields during the ipsilateral alpha increase. Altogether, these results contribute significantly to the understanding of how auditory anticipation acts on a local as well as on a network level.

J	Waldhauser, GT; Johansson, M; Hanslmayr, S				Waldhauser, Gerd T.; Johansson, Mikael; Hanslmayr, Simon			Alpha/Beta Oscillations Indicate Inhibition of Interfering Visual Memories	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LONG-TERM-MEMORY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; NETWORK MODEL; BOLD SIGNAL; EEG; RETRIEVAL	Selective retrieval of a specific target memory often leads to the forgetting of related but irrelevant memories. Current cognitive theory states that such retrieval-induced forgetting arises due to inhibition of competing memory traces. To date, however, direct neural evidence for this claim has not been forthcoming. Studies on selective attention suggest that cortical inhibition is mediated by increased brain oscillatory activity in the alpha/beta frequency band. The present study, testing 18 human subjects, investigated whether these mechanisms can be generalized to selective memory retrieval in which competing memories interfere with the retrieval of a target memory. Our experiment was designed so that each cue used to search memory was associated with a target memory and a competitor memory stored in separate brain hemispheres. Retrieval-induced forgetting was observed in a condition in which the competitor memory interfered with target retrieval. Increased oscillatory alpha/beta power was observed over the hemisphere housing the sensory representation of the competitor memory trace and predicted the amount of retrieval-induced forgetting in the subsequent memory test. These results provide the first direct evidence for inhibition of competing memories during episodic memory retrieval and suggest that competitive retrieval is governed by inhibitory mechanisms similar to those employed in selective attention.

We applied a non-linear complexity analysis to resting-state neural activity as measured using whole-head MEG. Recordings were obtained from 20 unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder and 19 matched healthy controls. Subsequently, after 6 months of pharmacological treatment with the antidepressant mirtazapine 30 mg/day, patients received a second MEG scan. A measure of the complexity of neural signals, the Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), was derived from the MEG time series. We found that depressed patients showed higher pre-treatment complexity values compared with controls, and that complexity values decreased after 6 months of effective pharmacological treatment, although this effect was statistically significant only in younger patients. The main treatment effect was to recover the tendency observed in controls of a positive correlation between age and complexity values. Importantly, the reduction of complexity with treatment correlated with the degree of clinical symptom remission. We suggest that LZC, a formal measure of neural activity complexity, is sensitive to the dynamic physiological changes observed in depression and may potentially offer an objective marker of depression and its remission after treatment.

J	Shahin, AJ; Pitt, MA				Shahin, Antoine J.; Pitt, Mark A.			Alpha activity marking word boundaries mediates speech segmentation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha activity; auditory object; EEG; neural inhibition; speech segmentation	MEMORY LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CUES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESTORATION; PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE; INCREASE	This study examined the neurophysiological mechanisms of speech segmentation, the process of parsing the continuous speech signal into isolated words. Individuals listened to sequences of two monosyllabic words (e.g. gas source) and non-words (e.g. nas sorf). When these phrases are spoken, talkers usually produce one continuous s-sound, not two distinct s-sounds, making it unclear where one word ends and the next one begins. This ambiguity in the signal can also result in perceptual ambiguity, causing the sequence to be heard as one word (failed to segment) or two words (segmented). We compared listeners' electroencephalogram activity when they reported hearing one word or two words, and found that bursts of fronto-central alpha activity (914 Hz), following the onset of the physical /s/ and end of phrase, indexed speech segmentation. Left-lateralized beta activity (1418 Hz) following the end of phrase distinguished word from non-word segmentation. A hallmark of enhanced alpha activity is that it reflects inhibition of task-irrelevant neural populations. Thus, the current results suggest that disengagement of neural processes that become irrelevant as the words unfold marks word boundaries in continuous speech, leading to segmentation. Beta activity is likely associated with unifying word representations into coherent phrases.

However, an explicit causal influence between the neural generators of P300 and alpha-ERD has not yet been investigated. In the present study, using an oddball task paradigm, we assessed the task effect (target vs. non-target) on P300 and alpha-ERD elicited by stimuli of four sensory modalities, i.e., audition, vision, somatosensory, and pain, estimated their respective neural generators, and investigated the information flow among their neural generators using time-varying effective connectivity in the target condition. Across sensory modalities, the scalp topographies of P300 and alpha-ERD were similar and respectively maximal at parietal and occipital regions in the target condition. Source analysis revealed that P300 and alpha-ERD were mainly generated from posterior cingulate cortex and occipital lobe respectively. As revealed by time-varying effective connectivity, the cortical information was consistently flowed from alpha-ERD sources to P300 sources in the target condition for all four sensory modalities. All these findings showed that P300 in the target condition is modulated by the changes of alpha-ERD, which would be useful to explore neural mechanism of cognitive information processing in the human brain.

We attempted to identify precursors of seizures in the functional networks of electrocorticograms by applying graph theory. Long-term electrocorticograms for periods of 39-76 h from three patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were investigated using pair-wise cross-correlations. Time-varying network properties suggested that there were several distinct brain states. Although functional networks during seizures could be characterized as having a regular topography, no consistent characteristics of functional networks were found immediately prior to seizure onsets. However, it was found that seizures under an identical state were followed by similar transients of the network properties. These results suggest that network properties themselves could not serve as reliable predictors of seizure onset. Yet, some significant pre-seizure changes in the parameters tested appear likely to depend on the brain state. To predict seizures, it may be necessary to take into consideration the states of the brain. In addition to stationary network properties we characterized in the present study, dynamic interactions of epileptic activities with the network might be taken into account to predict the spread of a seizure.

How Bodies and Voices Interact in Early Emotion Perception	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LIGHT BIOLOGICAL MOTION; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; POINT-LIGHT; BODY EXPRESSIONS; INFLUENCE RECOGNITION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; LOOMING SIGNALS; VISUAL SPEECH; MU-RHYTHMS	Successful social communication draws strongly on the correct interpretation of others' body and vocal expressions. Both can provide emotional information and often occur simultaneously. Yet their interplay has hardly been studied. Using electroencephalography, we investigated the temporal development underlying their neural interaction in auditory and visual perception. In particular, we tested whether this interaction qualifies as true integration following multisensory integration principles such as inverse effectiveness. Emotional vocalizations were embedded in either low or high levels of noise and presented with or without video clips of matching emotional body expressions. In both, high and low noise conditions, a reduction in auditory N100 amplitude was observed for audiovisual stimuli. However, only under high noise, the N100 peaked earlier in the audiovisual than the auditory condition, suggesting facilitatory effects as predicted by the inverse effectiveness principle. Similarly, we observed earlier N100 peaks in response to emotional compared to neutral audiovisual stimuli. This was not the case in the unimodal auditory condition. Furthermore, suppression of beta-band oscillations (15-25 Hz) primarily reflecting biological motion perception was modulated 200-400 ms after the vocalization. While larger differences in suppression between audiovisual and audio stimuli in high compared to low noise levels were found for emotional stimuli, no such difference was observed for neutral stimuli. This observation is in accordance with the inverse effectiveness principle and suggests a modulation of integration by emotional content. Overall, results show that ecologically valid, complex stimuli such as joined body and vocal expressions are effectively integrated very early in processing.

Methods: We analyzed the basal polysomnographic recordings of 40 patients (20 male and 20 female; mean age: 31 +/- 10 years) with a diagnosis of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Conventional sleep measures and CAP parameters were assessed. Polysomnographic recordings were subdivided in sleep cycles. The distribution of the epileptic motor events (including minor motor events, paroxysmal arousals, tonic-dystonic, or hyperkinetic seizures and epileptic nocturnal wandering) was analyzed throughout: total sleep time, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, light sleep (S1 + S2), slow wave sleep (SWS), each sleep cycle, CAP or non-CAP sleep, phase A and phase B of CAP. Only clear epileptic motor events supported by videopolysomnographic evidence were taken into consideration. Polysomnographic findings of patients with NFLE were compared with those of 24 age- and gender-balanced healthy subjects without sleep complaints. Key Findings: Compared to controls, patients with NFLE showed a significant increase in wake after sleep onset, SWS duration, and REM latency, whereas REM sleep duration was significantly lower in NFLE patients. The patients with NFLE showed a significant increase of CAP time, CAP rate (72% vs. 32% in control group), CAP cycles, and mean duration of a CAP sequence. These findings were associated with a significant enhancement of all subtypes of the A phases of CAP (mainly subtype A1). A total of 139 epileptic motor events supported by video-polysomnographic evidence were counted: 98% of all seizures occurred in NREM sleep and 72% of NREM seizures emerged from SWS, the latter being particularly collected in the first sleep cycles and decreasing in frequency together with the progressive decline of deep sleep. Ninety percent of total NREM seizures occurred during a CAP sequence, and CAP-related seizures occurred in association with a phase A. Significance: Significant polysomnographic alterations seem to emerge in patients with NFLE (increased REM latency, epileptic fragmentation of SWS, and increase of CAP rate). The analysis of seizure distribution showed that most epileptic events occurred in SWS, with predominance in the first sleep cycle and decreasing in frequency together with the homeostatic decline of SWS across the night. Within the NREM sleep, CAP is a manifestation of unstable sleep and represents a powerful predisposing condition for the occurrence of nocturnal motor seizures, which arise in concomitance with a phase A.

Two types of interdependent spike-LFP measures exist. The first approach is to directly quantify the consistency of single spike-LFP phases across spikes, referred to here as point-field phase synchronization measures. We show that conventional point-field phase synchronization measures are sensitive not only to the consistency of spike-LFP phases, but are also affected by statistical dependencies between spike-LFP phases, caused by e.g. non-Poissonian history-effects within spike trains such as bursting and refractoriness. To solve this problem, we develop a new pairwise measure that is not biased by the number of spikes and not affected by statistical dependencies between spike-LFP phases. The second approach is to quantify, similar to EEG-EEG coherence, the consistency of the relative phase between spike train and LFP signals across trials instead of across spikes, referred to here as spike train to field phase synchronization measures. We demonstrate an analytical relationship between point-field and spike train to field phase synchronization measures. Based on this relationship, we prove that the spike train to field pairwise phase consistency (PPC), a quantity closely related to the squared spike-field coherence, is a monotonically increasing function of the number of spikes per trial. This derived relationship is exact and analytic, and takes a linear form for weak phase-coupling. To solve this problem, we introduce a corrected version of the spike train to field PPC that is independent of the number of spikes per trial. Finally, we address the problem that dependencies between spike-LFP phase and the number of spikes per trial can cause spike-LFP phase synchronization measures to be biased by the number of trials. We show how to modify the developed point-field and spike train to field phase synchronization measures in order to make them unbiased by the number of trials.

Characterization of early partial seizure onset: Frequency, complexity and entropy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High-frequency; Complexity; Entropy; Early ictal onset; Partial seizures; Seizure detection	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE PATIENTS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; STATISTICAL MEASURE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; TIME-SERIES; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: A clear classification of partial seizures onset features is not yet established. Complexity and entropy have been very widely used to describe dynamical systems, but a systematic evaluation of these measures to characterize partial seizures has never been performed. Methods: Eighteen different measures including power in frequency bands up to 300 Hz, Gabor atom density (GAD), Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity, Shannon entropy, sample entropy, and permutation entropy, were selected to test sensitivity to partial seizure onset. Intracranial recordings from 45 patients with mesial temporal, neocortical temporal and neocortical extratemporal seizure foci were included (331 partial seizures). Results: GAD, Lempel-Ziv complexity, HFD, high frequency activity, and sample entropy were the most reliable measures to assess early seizure onset. Conclusions: Increases in complexity and occurrence of high-frequency components appear to be commonly associated with early stages of partial seizure evolution from all regions. The type of measure (frequency-based, complexity or entropy) does not predict the efficiency of the method to detect seizure onset. Significance: Differences between measures such as GAD and HFD highlight the multimodal nature of partial seizure onsets. Improved methods for early seizure detection may be achieved from a better understanding of these underlying dynamics. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

First published December 14, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00817.2011.-How do human brain networks react to dynamic changes in the sensory environment? We measured rapid changes in brain network organization in response to brief, discrete, salient auditory stimuli. We estimated network topology and distance parameters in the immediate central response period, < 1 s following auditory presentation of standard tones interspersed with occasional deviant tones in a mismatch-negativity (MMN) paradigm, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure synchronization of high-frequency (gamma band; 33-64 Hz) oscillations in healthy volunteers. We found that global small-world parameters of the networks were conserved between the standard and deviant stimuli. However, surprising or unexpected auditory changes were associated with local changes in clustering of connections between temporal and frontal cortical areas and with increased interlobar, long-distance synchronization during the 120- to 250-ms epoch (coinciding with the MMN-evoked response). Network analysis of human MEG data can resolve fast local topological reconfiguration and more long-range synchronization of high-frequency networks as a systems-level representation of the brain's immediate response to salient stimuli in the dynamically changing sensory environment.

Self-regulation of brain oscillations as a treatment for aberrant brain connections in children with autism	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; WHITE-MATTER; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; NEUROFEEDBACK TREATMENT; MU-RHYTHMS; BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT; CORTICAL ACTIVATION	Autism is a highly varied developmental disorder typically characterized by deficits in reciprocal social interaction, difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Although a wide range of behavioral, pharmacological, and alternative medicine strategies have been reported to ameliorate specific symptoms for some individuals, there is at present no cure for the condition. Nonetheless, among the many incompatible observations about aspects of the development, anatomy, and functionality of the autistic brain, it is widely agreed that it is characterized by widespread aberrant connectivity. Such disordered connectivity, be it increased, decreased, or otherwise compromised, may complicate healthy synchronization and communication among and within different neural circuits, thereby producing abnormal processing of sensory inputs necessary for normal social life. It is widely accepted that the innate properties of brain electrical activity produce pacemaker elements and linked networks that oscillate synchronously or asynchronously, likely reflecting a type of functional connectivity. Using phase coherence in multiple frequency EEG bands as a measure of functional connectivity, studies have shown evidence for both global hypoconnectivity and local hyperconnectivity in individuals with ASD. However, the nature of the brain's experience-dependent structural plasticity suggests that these abnormal patterns may be reversed with the proper type of treatment. Indeed, neurofeedback (NF) training, an intervention based on operant conditioning that results in self-regulation of brain electrical oscillations, has shown promise in addressing marked abnormalities in functional and structural connectivity. It is hypothesized that neurofeedback produces positive behavioral changes in ASD children by normalizing the aberrant connections within and between neural circuits. NF exploits the brain's plasticity to normalize aberrant connectivity patterns apparent in the autistic brain. By grounding this training in known anatomical (e.g., mirror neuron system) and functional markers (e.g., mu rhythms) of autism, NF training holds promise to support current treatments for this complex disorder. The proposed hypothesis specifically states that neurofeedback-induced alpha mu (8-12 Hz) rhythm suppression or desynchronization, a marker of cortical activation, should induce neuroplastic changes and lead to normalization in relevant mirroring networks that have been associated with higher-order social cognition.

Scale-free and multifractal time dynamics of fMRI signals during rest and task	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						scale invariance; self-similarity; multifractality; wavelet Leader; fMRI; brain dynamics; rest; task	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURES; STATE NETWORKS; LOW-FREQUENCY; CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; DECONVOLUTION	Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as intrinsic characteristics of ongoing brain activity (Zarahn et al., 1997). Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011): notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in activating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were obtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence focusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs) and raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation in RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling exponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on models that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic) self-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either of those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one, using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm (Varoguaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis (ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMR1 dataset comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.

Corticomuscular coherence during bilateral isometric arm voluntary activity in healthy humans. J Neurophysiol 107: 2154-2162, 2012. First published January 25, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00722.2011.-Bilateral voluntary contractions involve functional changes in both primary motor cortices. We investigated whether a voluntary contraction controlled by one hemisphere can influence oscillatory processes contralaterally. Corticomuscular coherence was calculated between EEG recorded over the motor cortex hand representation and electromyogram from the first dorsal interosseous muscle when the nondominant hand performed a precision grip task. The dominant arm remained at rest or performed a finger abduction or an elbow flexion task at 10, 40, and 70% of maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC). Mean coherence in the 15- to 30-Hz range in the hand performing a precision grip increased during 40% (by 72%) and 70% (by 73%) but not during 10% of MVC in the finger abduction task. Similarly, in the elbow flexion task, mean coherence increased during 40% (by 40%) and 70% (by 48%) but not during 10% of MVC. No differences were observed between the increments in coherence between the finger abduction and elbow flexion tasks at a given force level. We speculate that these results reflect the increased complexity of controlling a fine motor task with one hand while performing a strong contraction with the contralateral hand and suggest that increased oscillatory corticomuscular coupling may contribute to successful task performance.

Methods: Fourteen patients undergoing invasive monitoring (six patients with PF and eight with RS) were studied with CCEPs. A repetitive 1 Hz bipolar electrical stimulus was applied to both the ictal onset region (iCCEP) and to a control region (nCCEP) and CCEPs were recorded from the surrounding electrodes. The two groups were compared by subtracting the amplitude of nCCEP from that of iCCEP (CCEPictal (control)) at each stimulus intensity, and then normalizing the amplitudes of iCCEP at maximum stimulus intensity by dividing by nCCEP (CCEPictal/control). Results: The CCEP response to stimulation in the ictal onset region was significantly larger than to control stimulation for both ictal patterns (paroxysmal fast: P = 0.02, repetitive spiking: P < 0.01), with repetitive spiking group amplitudes higher than the paroxysmal fast group (CCEPictal (control): P < 0.01 and CCEPictal/control: P = 0.04). Conclusions: Pro-epileptic excitability is more accentuated in regions showing an ictal repetitive spiking pattern than a paroxysmal fast pattern. Significance: These findings confirm in a new way that cortical excitability varies depending on the ictal onset pattern.

Methods: Spatio-temporal interrelations and synchronicity of multi-sited ERP activity peaks were extracted in a group of 13 ADHD patients and 13 control subjects for the No-go stimulus in a Go/No-go task. Participants were scored by cross-validation against the most discriminative ensuing group patterns and scores were correlated to neuropsychological evaluation scores. Results: A distinct frontal-central-parietal pattern in the delta frequency range, dominant at the P3 latency, was unraveled in controls, while central activity in the theta and alpha frequency ranges predominated in the ADHD pattern, involving early ERP components (P1-N1-P2-N2). Cross-validation based on this analysis yielded 92% specificity and 84% sensitivity and individual scores correlated well with behavioral assessments. Conclusions: These results suggest that the ADHD group was more characterized by the process of exerting attention in the early monitoring stages of the No-go signal while the controls were more characterized by the process of inhibiting the response to that signal. Significance: The BNA method may provide both diagnostic and drug development tools for use in diverse neurological disorders. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Corticomuscular coherence with and without additional task in the elderly. J Appl Physiol 112: 970-981, 2012. First published January 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01079.2011.-Aging and dual-task paradigms often degrade fine motor performance, but the effects of aging on correlated neural activity between motor cortex and contracting muscle are unknown during dual tasks requiring fine motor performance. The purpose of this study was to compare corticomuscular coherence between young and elderly adults during the performance of a unilateral fine motor task and concurrent motor and cognitive tasks. Twenty-nine healthy young (18-38 yr) and elderly (61-75 yr) adults performed unilateral motor, bilateral motor, concurrent motor-cognitive, and cognitive tasks. Peak corticomuscular coherence between the electroencephalogram from the primary motor cortex and surface electromyogram from the first dorsal interosseous muscle was compared during steady abduction of the index finger with visual feedback. In the alpha-band (8-14 Hz), corticomuscular coherence was greater in elderly than young adults especially during the motor-cognitive task. The beta-band (15-32 Hz) corticomuscular coherence was higher in elderly than young adults across unilateral motor and dual tasks. In addition, beta-band corticomuscular coherence in the motor-cognitive task was negatively correlated with motor output error across young but not elderly adults. The results suggest that 1) corticomuscular coherence was increased in senior age with a greater influence of an additional cognitive task in the alpha-band and 2) individuals with greater beta-band corticomuscular coherence may exhibit more accurate motor output in young, but not elderly adults, during steady contraction with visual feedback.

Activity of cortical and thalamic neurons during the slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm in the mouse in vivo	PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Oscillations; Sleep; Neocortex; Thalamocortical; Electroencephalogram; T-type calcium channel; Thalamus; Neocortical neurons	THALAMOCORTICAL RELAY NEURONS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LOW-FREQUENCY RHYTHMS; NETWORK MECHANISMS; WAVE SLEEP; CORTICOTHALAMIC NETWORKS; NEOCORTICAL NETWORKS; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; RETICULARIS THALAMI; CALCIUM CURRENTS	During NREM sleep and under certain types of anaesthesia, the mammalian brain exhibits a distinctive slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm. At the cellular level, this rhythm correlates with so-called UP and DOWN membrane potential states. In the neocortex, these UP and DOWN states correspond to periods of intense network activity and widespread neuronal silence, respectively, whereas in thalamocortical (TC) neurons, UP/DOWN states take on a more stereotypical oscillatory form, with UP states commencing with a low-threshold Ca2+ potential (LTCP). Whilst these properties are now well recognised for neurons in cats and rats, whether or not they are also shared by neurons in the mouse is not fully known. To address this issue, we obtained intracellular recordings from neocortical and TC neurons during the slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm in anaesthetised mice. We show that UP/DOWN states in this species are broadly similar to those observed in cats and rats, with UP states in neocortical neurons being characterised by a combination of action potential output and intense synaptic activity, whereas UP states in TC neurons always commence with an LTCP. In some neocortical and TC neurons, we observed 'spikelets' during UP states, supporting the possible presence of electrical coupling. Lastly, we show that, upon tonic depolarisation, UP/DOWN states in TC neurons are replaced by rhythmic high-threshold bursting at similar to 5 Hz, as predicted by in vitro studies. Thus, UP/DOWN state generation appears to be an elemental and conserved process in mammals that underlies the slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm in several species, including humans.

The rapid detection of salient targets, independently of the number of other items in the scene, is thought to be mediated by efficient search brain mechanisms. It is not clear, however, whether efficient search is actually an "effortless" bottom-up process or whether it also involves regions of the prefrontal cortex generally associated with top-down sustained attention. We addressed this question with intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings designed to identify brain regions underlying a classic visual search task and correlate neural activity with target detection latencies on a trial-by-trial basis with high temporal precision recordings of these regions in epileptic patients. The spatio-temporal dynamics of single-trial spectral analysis of iEEG recordings revealed sustained energy increases in a broad gamma band (50-150 Hz) throughout the duration of the search process in the entire dorsal attention network both in efficient and inefficient search conditions. By contrast to extensive theoretical and experimental indications that efficient search relies exclusively on transient bottom-up processes in visual areas, we found that efficient search is mediated by sustained gamma activity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, alongside the superior parietal cortex and the frontal eye field. Our findings support the hypothesis that active visual search systematically involves the frontal-parietal attention network and therefore, executive attention resources, regardless of target saliency.

S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for insomnia, depression, and anxiety consisting of pulsed, low-intensity current applied to the earlobes or scalp. Despite empirical evidence of clinical efficacy, its mechanism of action is largely unknown. The goal was to characterize the acute effects of CES on resting state brain activity. Our primary hypothesis was that CES would result in deactivation in cortical and subcortical regions. Eleven healthy controls were administered CES applied to the earlobes at subsensory thresholds while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging in the resting state. We tested 0.5- and 100-Hz stimulation, using blocks of 22 sec "on" alternating with 22 sec of baseline (device was "off"). The primary outcome measure was differences in blood oxygen level dependent data associated with the device being on versus baseline. The secondary outcome measures were the effects of stimulation on connectivity within the default mode, sensorimotor, and fronto-parietal networks. Both 0.5- and 100-Hz stimulation resulted in significant deactivation in midline frontal and parietal regions. 100-Hz stimulation was associated with both increases and decreases in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). Results suggest that CES causes cortical brain deactivation, with a similar pattern for high-and low-frequency stimulation, and alters connectivity in the DMN. These effects may result from interference from high-or low-frequency noise. Small perturbations of brain oscillations may therefore have significant effects on normal resting state brain activity. These results provide insight into the mechanism of action of CES, and may assist in the future development of optimal parameters for effective treatment.

However, their specific significance and the pathophysiological changes leading to either FRs or IESs remain elusive. The objective of this study was to analyze the conditions in which hyperexcitable networks can generate either IESs or FRs and to reveal shared or distinct mechanisms that underlie both types of events. Methods: This study is the first to comparatively analyze mechanisms that induce either IESs or FRs using an approach that combines computational modeling and experimental data ( in vivo and in vitro). A detailed CA1 hippocampal network model is introduced. A parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which model parameters ( cell related and network related) allow the most accurate simulation of FRs and IESs. Results: Our model indicates that although FRs and IESs share certain common mechanisms ( shifted gamma-aminobutyric acid [ GABA] A reversal potential, altered synaptic transmission), there are also critical differences in terms of number of pyramidal cells involved ( small vs large), spatial distribution of hyperexcitable pyramidal cells ( clustered vs uniform), and firing patterns ( weakly vs highly synchronized). In vitro experiments verified that subtle changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission favor either FRs or IESs, as predicted by the model. Interpretation: This study provides insights into the interpretation of 2 interictal markers observed in intracerebral electroencephalographic data. Depending on the degree and spatiotemporal features of hyperexcitability, not only IESs or FRs are generated but also transitions between both types of events.

Over the last few years, a considerable effort has been devoted to exploring new biomarkers. Nevertheless, a better understanding of brain dynamics is still required to optimize therapeutic strategies. In this regard, the characterization of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial, due to the high conversion rate from MCI to AD. However, only a few studies have focused on the analysis of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) rhythms to characterize AD and MCI. In this study, we assess the ability of several parameters derived from information theory to describe spontaneous MEG activity from 36 AD patients, 18 MCI subjects and 26 controls. Three entropies (Shannon, Tsallis and Renyi entropies), one disequilibrium measure (based on Euclidean distance ED) and three statistical complexities (based on Lopez Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet complexity LMC) were used to estimate the irregularity and statistical complexity of MEG activity. Statistically significant differences between AD patients and controls were obtained with all parameters (p < 0.01). In addition, statistically significant differences between MCI subjects and controls were achieved by ED and LMC (p < 0.05). In order to assess the diagnostic ability of the parameters, a linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was applied. The accuracies reached 83.9% and 65.9% to discriminate AD and MCI subjects from controls, respectively. Our findings suggest that MCI subjects exhibit an intermediate pattern of abnormalities between normal aging and AD. Furthermore, the proposed parameters provide a new description of brain dynamics in AD and MCI.

Dissociation between Neuronal Activity in Sensorimotor Cortex and Hand Movement Revealed as a Function of Movement Rate	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT CHANGES; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; INTRACRANIAL EEG; JOINT MOVEMENTS; BETA-RHYTHM	It is often assumed that similar behavior is generated by the same brain activity. However, this does not take into account the brain state or recent behavioral history and movement initiation or continuation may not be similarly generated in the brain. To study whether similar movements are generated by the same brain activity, we measured neuronal population activity during repeated movements. Three human subjects performed a motor repetition task in which they moved their hand at four different rates (0.3, 0.5, 1, and 2Hz). From high-resolution electrocorticography arrays implanted on motor and sensory cortex, high-frequency power (65-95 Hz) was extracted as a measure of neuronal population activity. During the two faster movement rates, high-frequency power was significantly suppressed, whereas movement parameters remained highly similar. This suppression was nonlinear: after the initial movement, neuronal population activity was reduced most strongly, and the data fit a model in which a fast decline rapidly converged to saturation. The amplitude of the beta-band suppression did not change with different rates. However, at the faster rates, beta power did not return to baseline between movements but remained suppressed. We take these findings to indicate that the extended beta suppression at the faster rates, which may suggest a release of inhibition in motor cortex, facilitates movement initiation. These results show that the relationship between behavior and neuronal activity is not consistent: recent movement influences the state of motor cortex and facilitates next movements by reducing the required level of neuronal activity.

Classically, the regions participating in language were thought to be modular with a linear sequence of activations. More recently, modern theoretical models have posited a more hierarchical and distributed interaction of an atomic areas for the various stages of speech processing. Traditional imaging techniques can only define the location or time of cortical activation, which impedes the further evaluation and refinement of these models. In this study, we take advantage of recordings from the surface of the brain [electrocorticography (ECoG)], which can accurately detect the location and timing of cortical activations, to study the time course of ECoG high gamma (HG) modulations during an overt and covert word repetition task for different cortical areas. For overt word production, our results show substantial perisylvian cortical activations early in the perceptual phase of the task that were maintained through word articulation. However, this broad activation is attenuated during the expressive phase of covert word repetition. Across the different repetition tasks, the utilization of the different cortical sites within the perisylvian region varied in the degree of activation dependent on which stimulus was provided (auditory or visual cue) and whether the word was to be spoken or imagined. Taken together, the data support current models of speech that have been previously described with functional imaging. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the broad perisylvian speech network activates early and maintains suprathreshold activation through out the word repetition task that appears to be modulated by the demands of different conditions.

Reduced Sleep Spindles and Spindle Coherence in Schizophrenia: Mechanisms of Impaired Memory Consolidation?	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Memory consolidation; motor skill; procedural learning; schizophrenia; sleep; sleep spindles	RETICULAR NUCLEUS; EEG COHERENCE; MOTOR SKILL; SLOW; RETENTION; NEURONS; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS; ARCHITECTURE; DYSFUNCTION	Background: Sleep spindles are thought to induce synaptic changes and thereby contribute to memory consolidation during sleep. Patients with schizophrenia show dramatic reductions of both spindles and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which may be causally related. Methods: To examine the relations of sleep spindle activity to sleep-dependent consolidation of motor procedural memory, 21 chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients and 17 healthy volunteers underwent polysomnography on two consecutive nights. On the second night, participants were trained on the finger-tapping motor sequence task (MST) at bedtime and tested the following morning. The number, density, frequency, duration, amplitude, spectral content, and coherence of stage 2 sleep spindles were compared between groups and examined in relation to overnight changes in MST performance. Results: Patients failed to show overnight improvement on the MST and differed significantly from control participants who did improve. Patients also exhibited marked reductions in the density (reduced 38% relative to control participants), number (reduced 36%), and coherence (reduced 19%) of sleep spindles but showed no abnormalities in the morphology of individual spindles or of sleep architecture. In patients, reduced spindle number and density predicted less overnight improvement on the MST. In addition, reduced amplitude and sigma power of individual spindles correlated with greater severity of positive symptoms. Conclusions: The observed sleep spindle abnormalities implicate thalamocortical network dysfunction in schizophrenia. In addition, the findings suggest that abnormal spindle generation impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation in schizophrenia, contributes to positive symptoms, and is a promising novel target for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

Requirement of longitudinal synchrony of epileptiform discharges in the hippocampus for seizure generation: a pilot study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						hippocampus; mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; multiple hippocampal transections; parahippocampal gyrus; spike synchronization; spike propagation; epilepsy	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; DENTATE GYRUS; KAINIC ACID; PROPAGATION; TRANSECTION; NETWORKS; BRAIN	Object. The goal in this study was to assess the role of longitudinal hippocampal circuits in the generation of interictal and ictal activity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and to evaluate the effects of multiple hippocampal tran. sections (MHT). Methods. In 6 patients with TLE, the authors evaluated the synchrony of hippocampal interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges by using a cross-correlation analysis, and the effect of MHT on hippocampal interictal spikes was studied. Five of the 6 patients were studied with depth electrodes, and epilepsy surgery was performed in 4 patients (anterior temporal lobectomy in 1 and MHT in 3). Results. Four hundred eighty-two (95.1%) of 507 hippocampal spikes showed an anterior-to-posterior propagation within the hippocampus, with a fixed peak-to-peak interval. During seizures, a significant increase of synchronization between different hippocampal regions and between the hippocampus and the ipsilateral anterior parahippocampal gyrus was observed in all seizures. An ictal increase in synchronization between the hippocampus and ipsilateral amygdala was seen in only 24.1% of the seizures. No changes in synchronization were noticed during seizures between the hippocampi and the amygdalae on either side. The structure leading the epileptic seizures varied over time during a given seizure and also from one seizure to another. Spike analysis during MHT demonstrated that there were two spike populations that reacted differently to this procedure-namely, 1) spikes that showed maximum amplitude at the head of the hippocampus (type H); and 2) spikes that showed the highest amplitude at the hippocampal body (type B). A striking decrease in amplitude and frequency of type B spikes was noticed in all 3 patients after transections at the head or anterior portion of the hippocampal body. Type H,spikes were seen in 2 cases and did not change in amplitude and frequency throughout MHT. Type B spikes showed constantly high cross-correlation values in different derivations and a relatively fixed peak-to-peak interval before MHT. This fixed interpeak delay disappeared after the first transection, although high cross-correlation values persisted unchanged. All patients who underwent MHT remained seizure free for more than 2 years. Conclusions. These data suggest that synchronized discharges involving the complete anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampal/parahippocampal (H/P) formation underlie the spread of epileptiform discharges outside the H/P structures and, therefore, for the generation of epileptic seizures originating in the H/P structures. This conclusion is supported by the following observations. 1) Hippocampal spikes are consistently synchronized in the whole hippocampal structures, with a fixed delay between the different hippocampal areas. 2) One or two transections between the head and body of the hippocampal formation are sufficient to abolish hippocampal spikes that are synchronized along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. 3) Treatment with MHT leads to seizure freedom in patients with H/P epilepsy.

In particular, REM sleep (REMS) is reduced in homeotherms under a thermal load, due to an impairment of hypothalamic regulation of body temperature. The aim of this work was to assess whether osmoregulation, which is regulated at a hypothalamic level, but, unlike thermoregulation, is maintained across the different W-S states, could influence W-S occurrence. Sprague-Dawley rats, kept at an ambient temperature of 24 degrees C and under a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle, were exposed to a prolonged osmotic challenge of three days of water deprivation (WD) and two days of recovery in which free access to water was restored. Two sets of parameters were determined in order to assess: i) the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis (water and food consumption; changes in body weight and fluid composition); ii) the effects of the osmotic challenge on behavioral states (hypothalamic temperature (Thy), motor activity, and W-S states). The first set of parameters changed in WD as expected and control levels were restored on the second day of recovery, with the exception of urinary Ca++ that almost disappeared in WD, and increased to a high level in recovery. As far as the second set is concerned, WD was characterized by the maintenance of the daily oscillation of Thy and by a decrease in activity during the dark periods. Changes in W-S states were small and mainly confined to the dark period: i) REMS slightly decreased at the end of WD and increased in recovery; ii) non-REM sleep (NREMS) increased in both WD and recovery, but EEG delta power, a sign of NREMS intensity, decreased in WD and increased in recovery. Our data suggest that osmoregulation interferes with the regulation of W-S states to a much lesser extent than thermoregulation.

However the exact interactions between cortex and different thalamic nuclei needed for the generation and maintenance of SWD are still to be elucidated. This study aims to shed more light on these interactions via multisite cortical and thalamic local-field-potential recordings. Methods: WAG/Rij rats were equipped with multiple electrodes targeting layers 4 to 6 of the somatosensory-cortex, rostral and caudal RTN, VPM, anterior (ATN)- and posterior (Po) thalamic nucleus. The maximal-association-strength between signals was calculated for pre-ictal -> ictal transition periods and in control periods using non-linear-association-analysis. Dynamics of changes in coupling-direction and time-delays between channels were analyzed. Results: Earliest and strongest increases in coupling-strength were seen between cortical layers 5/6 and Po. Other thalamic nuclei became later involved in SWD activity. During the first 500 ms of SWDs the cortex guided most thalamic nuclei while cortex and Po kept a bidirectional crosstalk. Most thalamic nuclei started to guide the Po until the end of the SWD. While the rostral RTN showed increased coupling with Po, the caudal RTN decoupled. Instead, it directed its activity to the rostral RTN. Conclusions: Next to the focal cortical instigator zone of SWDs, the Po seems crucial for their occurrence. This nucleus shows early increases in coupling and is the only nucleus which keeps a bidirectional crosstalk to the cortex within the first 500 ms of SWDs. Other thalamic nuclei seem to have only a function in SWD maintenance. Rostral and caudal-RTN have opposite roles in SWD occurrence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nicotine Normalizes Event Related Potentials in COMT-Val-tg Mice and Increases Gamma and Theta Spectral Density	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						catechol-O-methyltransferase; COMT; mouse; nicotine; event-related potential; EEG; gamma; theta	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS; VAL(158)MET POLYMORPHISM; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; PREPULSE INHIBITION	Regulation of dopamine neurotransmission is essential for cognitive processes. In humans and rodents, the relationship between dopamine signaling and cognitive performance is described as a dose-dependent, inverted-U curve whereby excess or insufficiency of dopamine in prefrontal cortex has detrimental effects. Previous studies have indicated that prefrontal dopamine levels are associated with genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a regulatory enzyme that controls dopamine availability. Furthermore, smokers who carry the high-activity COMT-Val allele are more prone to cognitive deficits and have an increased risk of smoking relapse. The present study employed transgenic mice expressing the human COMT-Val variant to determine the effects of the high-activity COMT allele on electrophysiological markers, including the P20, N40, and P80 components of the auditory event-related potential, as well as baseline and auditory event-related power and phase-synchrony in theta and gamma ranges. We also examined the effects of nicotine on these measures to investigate the potential effects of smoking on COMT-mediated electrophysiological activity. COMT-Val-tg mice displayed increased N40 latency and decreased P80 amplitude as well as reduced baseline theta and gamma power. Nicotine increased P20 and P80 amplitudes, decreased N40 amplitude, increased P20 and N40 latencies, and reduced P80 latency. Nicotine also increased the event-related power and phase synchrony, yielding an increase in signal-to-noise ratio across theta and gamma ranges. COMT activity specifically alters long-latency components of the event-related response. Nicotine restored normal event-related activity among COMT-Val-tg mice, suggesting one mechanism through which nicotine may normalize cognitive function among people with the high-activity allele.

EFFECT OF CONTRAST MASSAGE ON BIOELECTRIC ACTIVITY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE AND BRAIN OF WOMEN WITH OVERWEIGHT	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						contrast massage; body shaping; electromyography; electroencephalography		The study group included 75 women-volunteers with the body weight of 72.0+/-4.5 kg, aged 39 to 48. The criterion for inclusion in the group was manifestation of the same degree of aesthetic defects (abdomen volume 114+/-5.74, hips 117+/-4.91). Exclusion criterion was the presence of chronic diseases of the cardiovascular or endocrine system, spine, and skin. All respondents received 12 contrast massage sessions during 24 days. The effect of contrast massage correction for women with overweight manifested as changes in anthropometric parameters-the weight loss of 10.1%, the volumes in the abdominal and pelvic-femoral area 7-10% lower, the decrease of the ratio of waist circumference to the volume of hips of 24%. The achieved changes lasted for nine months of observation. Contrast massage of women with excess body weight contributed to the increase of the amplitude and increased spectral power of alpha rhythm in the occipital and temporal regions of the central, while reducing the power of slow rhythms, delta-range. The reduced the amplitude of the beta rhythm was also noted. The degree of asymmetry of the electrical activity of the cortex decreased, which was particularly noticeable in the temporal leads. The mechanism of the identified changes is apparently due to the rising influences of massage effects on the central nervous system. In the second part we investigated the electrical activity of muscles before and after contrast massage by electromyography. All the muscle groups under study registered an increase of maximum credible amplitude of bioelectrical activity. There was a much more pronounced increase in the average amplitude of bioelectrical activity. At the same time, the oscillation frequency of all muscles was significantly reduced. This suggests that in this case the most rational mechanism for reducing the rate of force is realized -synchronization of motor units, simultaneous fulfillment of their involvement in the movement. After a course of contrast massage a reliable increase of the amplitude and duration of the M-response is marked, and the duration of the latent period is significantly reduced. The results indicate that under the influence of contrast normalization massage is the process of neuromuscular transmission, which may be associated with improved energy metabolism in tissues and reconstruction of regulatory influences from the central nervous system.

Dissociated mean and functional connectivity BOLD signals in visual cortex during eyes closed and fixation. J Neurophysiol 108: 2363-2372, 2012. First published August 8, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00900.2011.-We investigated the effects of resting state type on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal and functional connectivity in two paradigms: participants either alternated between fixation and eyes closed or maintained fixation or eyes closed throughout each scan. The BOLD signal and functional connectivity of lower and higher tiers of the visual cortical hierarchy were found to be differentially modulated during eyes closed versus fixation. Fixation was associated with greater mean BOLD signals in primary visual cortex and lower mean BOLD signals in extrastriate visual areas than periods of eyes closed. In addition, analysis of thalamocortical functional connectivity during scans in which participants maintained fixation showed synchronized BOLD fluctuations between those thalamic nuclei whose mean BOLD signal was systematically modulated during alternating epochs of eyes closed and fixation, primary visual cortex and the attention network, while during eyes closed negatively correlated fluctuations were seen between the same thalamic nuclei and extrastriate visual areas. Finally, in all visual areas the amplitude of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations was greater during eyes closed than during fixation. The dissociation between early and late tiers of visual cortex, which characterizes both mean and functionally connected components of the BOLD signal, may depend on the reorganization of thalamocortical networks. Since dissociated changes in local blood flow also characterize transitions between different stages of sleep and wakefulness (Braun AR, Balkin TJ, Wesenten NJ, Gwadry F, Carson RE, Varga M, Baldwin P, Belenky G, Herscovitch P. Science 279: 91-95, 1998), our results suggest that dissociated endogenous neural activity in primary and extrastriate cortex may represent a general aspect of brain function.

To address this question we performed Event Related Potential (ERP) (128 channels) study by using the Wavelet Transform (WT), a time frequency representation in 9 healthy volunteers in the same culture during the presentation of bared head face and hijab wearing face with randomly presented cross and house picture as two other neutral stimuli within the face presentation. There had two experiments, Face-target and Hijab-face target experiment. In Face-target experiment, subjects pressed '1' button when saw bared head face and in Hijab-target experiment, subjects pressed the same button when saw Hijab wearing face. The stimuli were presented for 1 s with 1.5 s interstimulus interval (ISI). Upon the stimulus types, event-related responses in the 0 Hz-30 Hz range were distributed mainly in the Fz, Cz, Pz, O1 and O2 locations. Data formed visual ERPs. The cue stimuli evoked posterior N170 ERP components both in the face-target and hijab-target experiments at O1 and O2 locations. Both face and hijab-picture stimuli were analyzed in both face and hijab-target experiments. Amplitude was higher of N170 at face-picture stimuli in both experiments. But significantly higher (P=0.03) in hijab-target experiment. Latency had no significant change in both experiments in all areas. In the face-target experiment, face-picture gave significantly (P=0.03) higher beta power at O1 area comparing the hijab-picture, where as remarkable decreased (P=0.03) theta power was found in the same stimuli at O2 area. Results suggest that in the same culture, hijab did not give any special neural stimulants. Increased Beta activity and decreased theta waveform indicate that similar society facial picture give the face-picture impression at O1 and O2, respectively and subjects give more attention to face-picture than hijab-picture where O1 and O2 locations are the crucial for this case.

Short- and long-latency somatosensory neuronal responses reveal selective brain injury and effect of hypothermia in global hypoxic ischemia	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						short-/long-latency somatosensory response; multiunit activity; cardiac arrest	HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; OSCILLATIONS; TEMPERATURE; CORTEX; RESUSCITATION; PREDICTION	Wu D, Xiong W, Jia X, Geocadin RG, Thakor NV. Short- and long-latency somatosensory neuronal responses reveal selective brain injury and effect of hypothermia in global hypoxic ischemia. J Neurophysiol 107: 1164-1171, 2012. First published December 7, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00681.2011.-Evoked potentials recorded from the somatosensory cortex have been shown to be an electrophysiological marker of brain injury in global hypoxic ischemia (HI). The evoked responses in somatosensory neurons carry information pertaining to signal from the ascending pathway in both the subcortical and cortical areas. In this study, origins of the subcortical and cortical signals are explored by decomposing the evoked neuronal activities into short-and long-latency responses (SLR and LLR), respectively. We evaluated the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on SLR and LLR during early recovery from cardiac arrest (CA)-induced HI in a rodent model. Twelve rats were subjected to CA, after which half of them were treated with hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) and the rest were kept at normal temperature (36-37 degrees C). Evoked neuronal activities from the primary somatosensory cortex, including multiunit activity (MUA) and local field potential (LFP), were continuously recorded during injury and early recovery. Results showed that upon initiation of injury, LLR disappeared first, followed by the disappearance of SLR, and after a period of isoelectric silence SLR reappeared prior to LLR. This suggests that cortical activity, which primarily underlies the LLR, may be more vulnerable to ischemic injury than SLR, which relates to subcortical activity. Hypothermia potentiated the SLR but suppressed the LLR by delaying its recovery after CA (hypothermia: 38.83 +/- 5.86 min, normothermia: 23.33 +/- 1.15 min; P < 0.05) and attenuating its amplitude, suggesting that hypothermia may selectively downregulate cortical activity as an approach to preserve the cerebral cortex. In summary, our study reveals the vulnerability of the somatosensory neural structures to global HI and the differential effects of hypothermia on these structures.

Sleep is known to be regulated by homeostatic factors, which mediate sleep propensity, and the circadian oscillator, a clocklike mechanism. However, it is unknown how epileptic episodes that occur at different zeitgeber times (ZTs) alter sleep regulation. This study was designed to elucidate the sleep disruptions associated with epilepsy and their underlying mechanisms by delivering kindled epilepsy at different ZTs: ZT0, ZT6, and ZT13. Design: Kindled epilepsy was induced at 3 different ZTs, and sleep-wake activities were analyzed before and after full-blown seizure. Ribonuclease protection assay, radioimmunoassay, and immunohistochemistry were respectively employed to determine the levels of interleukin-1 mRNA, corticosterone, and PER1 protein. Setting: The experiments were performed at Neurophysiology Laboratory at National Taiwan University. Participant and Interventions: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes, a bipolar stimulating electrode, and a guide cannula. Kindling stimuli were delivered via a bipolar electrode placed in the right central nucleus of the amygdala. Measurement and Results: Kindled epilepsy occurring at ZT0 and ZT13 predominantly affected homeostatic factors, whereas ZT6-kindling stimuli altered the circadian oscillator. ZT0-kindling decreased rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which was mediated by corticotrophin-releasing hormone, but did not alter the rhythm of sleep-wake fluctuation. On the other hand, ZT13-kindling enhanced interleukin-1 and consequently increased NREM sleep without altering the sleep-wake fluctuation. Nevertheless, the expression of PER1 protein in suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and the circadian rhythm of sleep fluctuation were respectively advanced 6 h and 2 h when kindling stimulation was delivered at ZT6. Shifts of sleep circadian rhythm and PER1 oscillation induced by ZT6-kindling were blocked by administration of hypocretin receptor antagonist SB334867 into the SCN, indicating the involvement of hypocretin. Conclusion: These observations suggest that the occurrence of epilepsy at different ZTs alters sleep processes differently.

To study GABA signaling in vivo, we recently used a novel positron emission tomography (PET) paradigm measuring the change in binding of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site radiotracer [C-11]flumazenil associated with increases in extracellular GABA induced via GABA membrane transporter (GAT1) blockade with tiagabine. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in [C-11] flumazenil binding potential (BPND) over baseline in the major functional domains of the cortex, consistent with preclinical studies showing that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands. In the current study we sought to replicate our previous results and to further validate this approach by demonstrating that the magnitude of increase in [C-11] flumazenil binding observed with PET is directly correlated with tiagabine dose. [C-11] flumazenil distribution volume (VT) was measured in 18 healthy volunteers before and after GAT1 blockade with tiagabine. Two dose groups were studied (n = 9 per group; Group I: tiagabine 0.15 mg/kg; Group II: tiagabine 0.25 mg/kg). GAT1 blockade resulted in increases in mean (+/-SD) [C-11]flumazenil VT in Group II in association cortices (6.8+/-0.8 mL g(-1) vs. 7.3+/-0.4 mL g(-1); p = 0.03), sensory cortices (6.7+/-0.8 mL g(-1) vs. 7.3+/-0.5 mL g(-1); p = 0.02) and limbic regions (5.2+/-0.6 mL g(-1) vs. 5.7+/-0.3 mL g(-1); p = 0.03). No change was observed at the low dose (Group I). Increased orbital frontal cortex binding of [C-11] flumazenil in Group II correlated with the ability to entrain cortical networks (r = 0.67, p = 0.05) measured via EEG during a cognitive control task. These data provide a replication of our previous study demonstrating the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute shifts in extracellular GABA.	[Frankle, W.

Abnormalities in gamma-band responses to language stimuli in first-degree relatives of children with autism spectrum disorder: an MEG study	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-INCIDENCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FAMILIES; MEMORY; EEG; LATERALIZATION; PHENOTYPE; PARENTS; HUMANS	Background: Synchronous neural oscillatory activity in the gamma range (30-80 Hz) has been shown to be abnormal in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their first-degree relatives in response to simple auditory stimuli. Gamma-band abnormalities in ASD probands have been seen in response to language stimuli, but this has not been investigated in first-degree relatives. This is of particular interest given that language impairments are a core symptom of ASD and may be part of the broad autism phenotype (BAP) seen in relatives. Methods: Magnetoencephalography recordings during a continuous word recognition task were obtained for 23 parents of a child with ASD (pASD) and 28 adult control participants. Total and evoked gamma-band activity, as well as inter-trial phase-locking factor (PLF), were measured in response to the task. Beta-band activity was also measured, due to its suggested role in language processing. Participants completed a series of language measures to assess the relationship between brain activity and language function, and lateralization of task-related activity was assessed. Results: The pASD group showed increased evoked gamma and beta activity, while controls had decreased evoked activity. Additionally, while both groups showed a reduction in total gamma power (commonly seen in language tasks), this reduction was more prominent in the control group. The pASD group demonstrated significantly worse performance on a measure of phonology compared to controls. Significant but distinct relationships were found between gamma/beta activity and language measures within the two groups. In addition, while the overall task generally elicited left lateralized responses, pASD showed greater left lateralization than controls in some regions of interest. Conclusions: Abnormalities in oscillatory responses to language were seen in pASD that are consistent with previous findings in ASD probands. Gamma-band responses to language stimuli have not previously been assessed in first-degree relatives of ASD probands and these findings are supportive of gamma-band activity as a heritable, neurophysiological biomarker of ASD. The possible relationship seen between language function and neural activity in the current study should be investigated further to assess if oscillatory response abnormalities may contribute to behavioural manifestations of the BAP.

Glut1 deficiency (G1D): Epilepsy and metabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of the most common human phenotype	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Brain metabolism; TCA cycle; Acetyl-coenzyme A; Glutamate; Glutamine; GABA; GLUT1; GLUT-1; Glucose transporter; Ketones; Fatty acids; EEG	GLUTAMATE-GLUTAMINE CYCLE; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CITRIC-ACID CYCLE; ENERGY-METABOLISM; GLUCOSE-TRANSPORT; ABSENCE SEIZURES; LIPID-SYNTHESIS; KETOGENIC DIET; AMINO-ACIDS; HUMAN BRAIN	Brain glucose supplies most of the carbon required for acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) generation (an important step for myelin synthesis) and for neurotransmitter production via further metabolism of acetylCoA in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, it is not known whether reduced brain glucose transporter type! (GLUT-1) activity, the hallmark of the GLUT-1 deficiency (G1D) syndrome, leads to acetyl-CoA. TCA or neurotransmitter depletion. This question is relevant because, in its most common form in man, G1D is associated with cerebral hypomyelination (manifested as microcephaly) and epilepsy, suggestive of acetyl-CoA depletion and neurotransmitter dysfunction, respectively. Yet, brain metabolism in G1D remains under-explored both theoretically and experimentally, partly because computational models of limited brain glucose transport are subordinate to metabolic assumptions and partly because current hemizygous G1D mouse models manifest a mild phenotype not easily amenable to investigation. In contrast, adult antisense G1D mice replicate the human phenotype of spontaneous epilepsy associated with robust thalamocortical electrical oscillations. Additionally, and in consonance with human metabolic imaging observations, thalamus and cerebral cortex display the lowest GLUT-1 expression and glucose uptake in the mutant mouse. This depletion of brain glucose is associated with diminished plasma fatty acids and elevated ketone body levels, and with decreased brain acetyl-CoA and fatty acid contents, consistent with brain ketone body consumption and with stimulation of brain beta-oxidation and/or diminished cerebral lipid synthesis. In contrast with other epilepsies, astrocyte glutamine synthetase expression, cerebral TCA cycle intermediates, amino acid and amine neurotransmitter contents are also intact in G1D. The data suggest that the TCA cycle is preserved in G1D because reduced glycolysis and acetyl-CoA formation can be balanced by enhanced ketone body utilization. These results are incompatible with global cerebral energy failure or with neurotransmitter depletion as responsible for epilepsy in G1D and point to an unknown mechanism by which glycolysis critically regulates cortical excitability.
