We established a postincisional pain model of rats with plantar incision to mimic the clinical pathological pain state, tested the analgesic effects of EA, and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) activities before and after the EA application. By analysis of power spectrum and bicoherence of EEG, we found that in rats with postincisional pain, ongoing activities at the delta-frequency band decreased, while activities at theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands increased. EA treatment on these postincisional pain rats decreased the power at high-frequency bands especially at the beta-frequency band and reversed the enhancement of the cross-frequency coupling strength between the beta band and low-frequency bands. After searching for the PubMed, our study is the first time to describe that brain oscillations are correlated with the processing of spontaneous pain information in postincisional pain model of rats, and EA could regulate these brain rhythmical frequency oscillations, including the power and cross-frequency couplings.

Analysis of the EEG records can provide valuable insight and improve understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. In this paper, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet transform are used as spectral analysis tools of the EEG signals. These methods are chosen because they provide time-frequency shifted on the EEG signals. Since the frequency characteristics are important information that can be observed from the signals. FFT and wavelet transform are among the best methods in analysis of EEG signals. The comparisons between these two methods are also carried out. Result showed that the wavelet transform is better than FFT in analysis of EEG signals. A software for analysing EEG signal is also developed using C++ programming. The software is able to compute and show the results of the analysis signal data by both of the two methods in graphical form.

What changes in neural oscillations can reveal about developmental cognitive neuroscience: Language development as a case in point	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural oscillations; EEG; Language development; Theta; Gamma	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; THETA-POWER INCREASES; EEG ACTIVITY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; POTENTIALS	EEG is a primary method for studying temporally precise neuronal processes across the lifespan. Most of this work focuses on event related potentials (ERPs); however, using time-locked time frequency analysis to decompose the EEG signal can identify and distinguish multiple changes in brain oscillations underlying cognition (Bastiaansen et al., 2010). Further this measure is thought to reflect changes in inter-neuronal communication more directly than ERPs (Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006). Although time frequency has elucidated cognitive processes in adults, applying it to cognitive development is still rare. Here, we review the basics of neuronal oscillations, some of what they reveal about adult cognitive function, and what little is known relating to children. We focus on language because it develops early and engages complex cortical networks. Additionally, because time frequency analysis of the EEG related to adult language comprehension has been incredibly informative, using similar methods with children will shed new light on current theories of language development and increase our understanding of how neural processes change over the lifespan. Our goal is to emphasize the power of this methodology and encourage its use throughout developmental cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantitative EEG (qEEG) makes use of quantitative techniques to analyze EEG characteristics such as frequency, amplitude, coherence, power, phase, and symmetry over time independently or in combination. QEEG has been evaluated for its use in making a diagnosis of mTBI and assessing prognosis, including the likelihood of progressing to the postconcussive syndrome (PCS) phase. We review the EEG and qEEG changes of mTBI described in the literature. An attempt is made to separate the findings seen during the acute, subacute, and chronic phases after mTBI. Brief mention is also made of the neurobiological correlates of qEEG using neuroimaging techniques or in histopathology. Although the literature indicates the promise of qEEG in making a diagnosis and indicating prognosis of mTBI, further study is needed to corroborate and refine these methods.

Modulation of gamma and spindle-range power by slow oscillations in scalp sleep EEG of children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep; Electroencephalography; Slow oscillation; Spindles; Gamma; Development; Synaptic density; Children	DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; WAVE ACTIVITY; HZ; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYNCHRONIZATION; DENSITY; RHYTHMS; CORTEX	Deep sleep is characterized by slow waves of electrical activity in the cerebral cortex. They represent alternating down states and up states of, respectively, hyperpolarization with accompanying neuronal silence and depolarization during which neuronal firing resumes. The up states give rise to faster oscillations, notably spindles and gamma activity which appear to be of major importance to the role of sleep in brain function and cognition. Unfortunately, while spindles are easily detectable, gamma oscillations are of very small amplitude. No previous sleep study has succeeded in demonstrating modulations of gamma power along the time course of slow waves in human scalp EEG. As a consequence, progress in our understanding of the functional role of gamma modulation during sleep has been limited to animal studies and exceptional human studies, notably those of intracranial recordings in epileptic patients. Because high synaptic density, which peaks some time before puberty depending on the brain region (Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997), generates oscillations of larger amplitude, we considered that the best chance to demonstrate a modulation of gamma power by slow wave phase in regular scalp sleep EEG would be in school-aged children. Sleep EEG was recorded in 30 healthy children (aged 10.7 +/- 0.8 years; mean +/- s.d.). Time-frequency analysis was applied to evaluate the time course of spectral power along the development of a slow wave. Moreover, we attempted to modify sleep architecture and sleep characteristics through automated acoustic stimulation coupled to the occurrence of slow waves in one subset of the children. Gamma power increased on the rising slope and positive peak of the slow wave. Gamma and spindle activity is strongly suppressed during the negative peak. There were no differences between the groups who received and did not receive acoustic stimulation in the sleep parameters and slow wave-locked time-frequency analysis. Our findings show, for the first time in scalp EEG in humans, that gamma activity is associated with the up-going slope and peak of the slow wave. We propose that studies in children provide a uniquely feasible opportunity to conduct investigations into the role of gamma during sleep. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They are considered as a prominent mechanism for information processing within and communication between brain areas. More recently, it has been proposed that interactions between periodic components at different frequencies, known as cross-frequency couplings, may support the integration of neuronal oscillations at different temporal and spatial scales. The present study details methods based on an adaptive frequency tracking approach that improve the quantification and statistical analysis of oscillatory components and cross-frequency couplings. This approach allows for time-varying instantaneous frequency, which is particularly important when measuring phase interactions between components. We compared this adaptive approach to traditional band-pass filters in their measurement of phase-amplitude and phase-phase cross-frequency couplings. Evaluations were performed with synthetic signals and EEG data recorded from healthy humans performing an illusory contour discrimination task. First, the synthetic signals in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations highlighted two desirable features of the proposed algorithm vs. classical filter-bank approaches: resilience to broad-band noise and oscillatory interference. Second, the analyses with real EEG signals revealed statistically more robust effects (i.e. improved sensitivity) when using an adaptive frequency tracking framework, particularly when identifying phase-amplitude couplings. This was further confirmed after generating surrogate signals from the real EEG data. Adaptive frequency tracking appears to improve the measurements of cross-frequency couplings through precise extraction of neuronal oscillations.

In the present study, electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from sixteen healthy human participants while they were performing a color-word Stroop task within a novel look-to-do transition design that included two response modalities. In the 'look' condition, participants were informed to look at the color of presented words but no responses were required; in the 'do' condition, they were informed to make arranged responses to the color of presented words. Behaviorally, a reliable conflict adaptation was observed. Time-frequency analysis revealed that (1) in the 'look' condition, theta-band activity in the left- and right-frontal regions reflected a conflict-related process at a response inhibition level; and (2) in the 'do' condition, both theta-band activity in the left-frontal region and alpha-band activity in the left-, right-, and centro-frontal regions reflected a process of conflict control, which triggered neural and behavioral adaptation. Taken together, these results suggest that there are frontal mechanisms involving neural oscillations that can mediate response inhibition processes and control behavioral conflict.

Approximate entropy(ApEn), as a complexity based method appears to have potential application to physiological and clinical time-series data. Therefore, we present an ApEn based statistical measure for patient's EEG consciousness analysis. However, it is found that high frequency noise such as electronic interference and its harmonic from the surrounding containing in the real-life recorded EEG lead to inconsistent ApEn result. To solve this problem, first we design a bandstop filter to filter high frequency noise. Then the proposed method is supported by analysis on a real world example of distinguishing between the brain consciousness states of coma and brain death. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method in patient's EEG consciousness analysis.

While there are new ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) systems, few have been directly compared to a gold standard system. Here, an ultra-low power wireless EEG system designed by Imec is tested against the gold standard Neuroscan SynAmps2 EEG system, recording simultaneously from the same laboratory cap prepared with electrode gel. The data was analyzed using correlation analysis for both time domain and frequency domain data. The analysis indicated a high Pearson's correlation coefficient (mean=0.957, median=0.985) with high confidence (mean P=0.002) for 10-second sets of data transformed to the frequency domain. The time domain results had acceptable Pearson's coefficient (mean=0.580, median =0.706) with high confidence (mean P =0.008).

The aim is to understand the neural correlates of alpha rhythm slowing (decrease in mean frequency of oscillation), a hallmark in the EEG of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. The neural mass model used, referred to herein as the modARm, is a modified version of Lopes da Silva's alpha rhythm model (ARm). Previously, the power spectral behaviour of the modARm was analysed in context to AD. In this work, we revisit the modARm to make a combined study of the dynamical behaviour of the model and its power spectral behaviour within the alpha band while simulating the hallmark neuropathological condition of 'synaptic depletion' in AD. The results show that the modARm exhibits two 'operating modes' in the time-domain i.e. a point attractor and a limit cycle mode; the alpha rhythmic content in the model output is maximal at the vicinity of the point of bifurcation. Furthermore, the inhibitory synaptic connectivity from the cells of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus to the Thalamo-Cortical Relay cells significantly influence bifurcation behaviour while a decrease in the inhibition can induce limit-cycle behaviour corresponding to abnormal brain states such as seizures, an increase in inhibition in awake state corresponding to a point attractor mode may result in the slowing of the alpha rhythms as observed in AD. These observations help emphasise the importance of bifurcation analysis of model behaviour in inferring the biological relevance of results obtained from power-spectral analysis of the neural models in the context of understanding neurodegeneration.

Time-frequency mixed-norm estimates: Sparse M/EEG imaging with non-stationary source activations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Inverse problem; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Electroencephalography (EEG); Sparse structured priors; Convex optimization; Time-frequency; Algorithms	INVERSE PROBLEM; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG; MEG; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; SHRINKAGE; ALGORITHM; PURSUIT	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow functional brain imaging with high temporal resolution. While solving the inverse problem independently at every time point can give an image of the active brain at every millisecond, such a procedure does not capitalize on the temporal dynamics of the signal. Linear inverse methods (minimum-norm, dSPM, sLORETA, beamformers) typically assume that the signal is stationary: regularization parameter and data covariance are independent of time and the time varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Other recently proposed non-linear inverse solvers promoting focal activations estimate the sources in both space and time while also assuming stationary sources during a time interval. However such a hypothesis holds only for short time intervals. To overcome this limitation, we propose time-frequency mixed-norm estimates (TF-MxNE), which use time-frequency analysis to regularize the ill-posed inverse problem. This method makes use of structured sparse priors defined in the time-frequency domain, offering more accurate estimates by capturing the non-stationary and transient nature of brain signals. State-of-the-art convex optimization procedures based on proximal operators are employed, allowing the derivation of a fast estimation algorithm. The accuracy of the TF-MxNE is compared with recently proposed inverse solvers with help of simulations and by analyzing publicly available MEG datasets. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG/MEG signals can play an important role in providing measures of functional and effective connectivity in the brain. After a brief description of the foundations and basic methodological aspects of EEG/MEG signals, the relevance of the signals to obtain novel insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive processes is surveyed, with emphasis on neuronal oscillations (ultra-slow, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and HFO5) and combinations of oscillations. Three main functional roles of brain oscillations are put in evidence: (1) coding specific information, (2) setting and modulating brain attentional states, and (3) assuring the communication between neuronal populations such that specific dynamic workspaces may be created. The latter form the material core of cognitive functions.

This paper proposes a method of automatically grading the degree of abnormality in an hour long epoch of neonatal EEG. The automated grading system (AGS) was based on a multi-class linear classifier grading of short-term epochs of EEG which were converted into a long-term grading of EEG using a majority vote operation. The features used in the AGS were summary measurements of two sub-signals extracted from a quadratic time-frequency distribution: the amplitude modulation and instantaneous frequency. These sub-signals were based on a model of EEG as a multiplication of a coloured random process with a slowly varying pseudo-periodic waveform and may be related to macroscopic neurophysiological function. The 4 grade AGS had a classification accuracy of 83% compared to human annotation of the EEG (level of agreement, kappa = 0.76). Features estimated on the developed sub-signals proved more effective at grading the EEG than measures based solely on the EEG and the incorporation of additional sub-grades based on EEG states into the AGS also improved performance.

Multivariate empirical mode decomposition(MEMD) and approximate entropy(ApEn) are often used in the EEG signal analysis process. MEMD is an extended approach of empirical mode decomposition(EMD), in which it overcomes the problem of the decomposed number and frequency, and enables to extract brain activity features from multi-channel EEG simultaneously. ApEn as a complexity based method appears to have potential for the application to physiological and clinical time series data. In our previous studies, MEMD method and ApEn measure were always used severally, if MEMD and ApEn are used to analysis the same EEG signal simultaneously, the result of experiment will be more accurate. In this paper, we present MEMD method and ApEn measure based blind test without knowing about the clinical symptoms of patients beforehand.

Frontal theta is a signature of successful working memory manipulation	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Theta oscillations; Working memory; Manipulation; Cognitive control; Neural oscillations	EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; MAINTENANCE; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION; GANGLIA; ERRORS; LINKS; BAND	It has been proposed that working memory (WM) is updated/manipulated via a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit. One way that this could happen is via the synchronization of neural oscillations. A first step toward testing this hypothesis is to clearly establish a frontal scalp EEG signature of WM manipulation. Although many EEG studies have indeed revealed frontal EEG signatures for WM, especially in the theta frequency band (3-8 Hz), few of them required subjects to manipulate WM, and of those that did, none specifically tied the EEG signature to the manipulation process per se. Here we employed a WM manipulation task that has been shown with imaging to engage the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. We adapted this task to titrate the success of WM manipulation to approximately 50 %. Using time-frequency analysis of EEG, we showed that theta power increased over frontal cortex for successful versus failed WM manipulation, specifically at the time of the manipulation event. This establishes a clear-cut EEG signature of WM manipulation. Future studies could employ this to test the fronto-basal-ganglia hypothesis of WM updating/manipulation.

Data of 3 epileptic patients recorded by depth intracranial electrodes are analyzed with time-frequency algorithms to observe the abnormal changes in different frequency ranges. Comparing the frequency domain of the normal and epileptic signals that contain several periods of clinical seizures and intervals, a remarkable range of high frequency is identified and corresponds to the seizure. According to the corresponding position of those channels that produced abnormal signals, the epileptic focus is determined theoretically and verified by comparison with the clinical diagnosis and surgical results. Furthermore, the order of the presence of different frequency ranges is listed. The finding proposed in this study could be a fresh method to improve the diagnosis of epilepsy.

NEURON 58; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-LOCKING; ORDER INFORMATION; GENERIC METHOD	Working memory (WM) processes help keep information in an active state so it can be used to guide future behavior. Although numerous studies have investigated brain activity associated with spatial WM in humans and monkeys, little research has focused on the neural mechanisms of WM for temporal order information, and how processing of temporal and spatial information might differ. Available evidence indicates that similar frontoparietal regions are recruited during temporal and spatial WM, although there are data suggesting that they are distinct processes. The mechanisms that allow for differential maintenance of these two types of information are unclear. One possibility is that neural oscillations may differentially contribute to temporal and spatial WM. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare patterns of oscillatory activity during maintenance of spatial and temporal information in WM. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed enhanced left frontal theta (5-8 Hz), enhanced posterior alpha (9-12 Hz), and enhanced left posterior beta (14-28 Hz) power during the delay period of correct temporal order trials compared to correct spatial trials. In contrast, gamma (30-50 Hz) power at right lateral frontal sites was increased during the delay period of spatial WM trials, as compared to temporal WM trials. The present results are consistent with the idea that neural oscillatory patterns provide distinct mechanisms for the maintenance of temporal and spatial information in WM. Specifically, theta oscillations are most critical for the maintenance of temporal information in WM. Possible roles of higher frequency oscillations in temporal and spatial memory are also discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional stage between normal aging and AD; however, not all subjects with MCI progress to AD. Prediction of conversion to AD at an early stage would enable an earlier, and potentially more effective, treatment of AD. Electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers would provide a non-invasive and relatively cheap screening tool to predict conversion to AD; however, traditional EEG biomarkers have not been considered accurate enough to be useful in clinical practice. Here, we aim to combine the information from multiple EEG biomarkers into a diagnostic classification index in order to improve the accuracy of predicting conversion from MCI to AD within a 2-year period. We followed 86 patients initially diagnosed with MCI for 2 years during which 25 patients converted to AD. We show that multiple EEG biomarkers mainly related to activity in the beta-frequency range (13-30 Hz) can predict conversion from MCI to AD. Importantly, by integrating six EEG biomarkers into a diagnostic index using logistic regression the prediction improved compared with the classification using the individual biomarkers, with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 82%, compared with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 62% of the best individual biomarker in this index. In order to identify this diagnostic index we developed a data mining approach implemented in the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (http://www.nbtwiki.net/). We suggest that this approach can be used to identify optimal combinations of biomarkers (integrative biomarkers) also in other modalities. Potentially, these integrative biomarkers could be more sensitive to disease progression and response to therapeutic intervention.

Detecting alpha spindle events in EEG time series using adaptive autoregressive models	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alpha spindle; Adaptive autoregressive model; Classification; Electroencephalography; Time series; Fatigue; Change point detection	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MATCHING PURSUIT; SLEEP EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; SEGMENTATION; WAKEFULNESS; ARTIFACTS; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	Background: Rhythmic oscillatory activity is widely observed during a variety of subject behaviors and is believed to play a central role in information processing and control. A classic example of rhythmic activity is alpha spindles, which consist of short (0.5-2 s) bursts of high frequency alpha activity. Recent research has shown that alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital area are statistically related to fatigue and drowsiness. These spindles constitute sharp changes in the underlying statistical properties of the signal. Our hypothesis is that change point detection models can be used to identify the onset and duration of spindles in EEG. In this work we develop an algorithm that accurately identifies sudden bursts of narrowband oscillatory activity in EEG using techniques derived from change point analysis. Our motivating example is detection of alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital areas of the brain. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that can be applied to any type of rhythmic oscillatory activity of interest for accurate online detection. Methods: In this work we propose modeling the alpha band EEG time series using discounted autoregressive (DAR) modeling. The DAR model uses a discounting rate to weigh points measured further in the past less heavily than points more recently observed. This model is used together with predictive loss scoring to identify periods of EEG data that are statistically significant. Results: Our algorithm accurately captures changes in the statistical properties of the alpha frequency band. These statistical changes are highly correlated with alpha spindle occurrences and form a reliable measure for detecting alpha spindles in EEG. We achieve approximately 95% accuracy in detecting alpha spindles, with timing precision to within approximately 150 ms, for two datasets from an experiment of prolonged simulated driving, as well as in simulated EEG. Sensitivity and specificity values are above 0.9, and in many cases are above 0.95, for our analysis. Conclusion: Modeling the alpha band EEG using discounted AR models provides an efficient method for detecting oscillatory alpha activity in EEG. The method is based on statistical principles and can generally be applied to detect rhythmic activity in any frequency band or brain region.

A fast statistical significance test for baseline correction and comparative analysis in phase locking	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						MEG; phase locking; oscillation; cross-talk; circular statistics		Human perception, cognition, and action are supported by a complex network of interconnected brain regions. There is an increasing interest in measuring and characterizing these networks as a function of time and frequency, and inter-areal phase locking is often used to reveal these networks. This measure assesses the consistency of phase angles between the electrophysiological activity in two areas at a specific time and frequency. Non-invasively, the signals from which phase locking is computed can be measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, due to the lack of spatial specificity of reconstructed source signals in MEG and EEG, inter-areal phase locking may be confounded by false positives resulting from crosstalk. Traditional phase locking estimates assume that no phase locking exists when the distribution of phase angles is uniform. However, this conjecture is not true when crosstalk is present. We propose a novel method to improve the reliability of the phase-locking measure by sampling phase angles from a baseline, such as from a prestimulus period or from resting-state data, and by contrasting this distribution against one observed during the time period of interest.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms, specifically the relation to the electrophysiological signal, we used simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI during eyes open resting state (RS). Earlier studies using the EEG signal as independent variable show inconclusive results, possibly due to variability in the temporal correlations between RSNs and power in the low EEG frequency bands, as recently reported (Goncalves et al., 2006, 2008; Meyeretal., 2013). In this study we use three different methods including one that uses RSN timelines as independent variable to explore the temporal relationship of RSNs and EEG frequency power in eyes open RS in detail. The results of these three distinct analysis approaches support the hypothesis that the correlation between low EEG frequency power and BOLD RSNs is instable over time, at least in eyes open RS.

Early gamma oscillations during rapid auditory processing in children with a language-learning impairment: Changes in neural mass activity after training	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory temporal processing; Computerized training; Electroencephalography; Phase locking; Specific language impairment; Spectral power	DEVELOPMENTAL APHASIA; BAND RESPONSE; PERCEPTION; EEG; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; DYSLEXIA; PREDICTS; SPEECH	Children with language-learning impairment (LLI) have consistently shown difficulty with tasks requiring precise, rapid auditory processing. Remediation based on neural plasticity assumes that the temporal precision of neural coding can be improved by intensive training protocols. Here, we examined the extent to which early oscillatory responses in auditory cortex change after audio-visual training, using combined source modeling and time-frequency analysis of the human electroencephalogram (EEG). Twenty-one elementary school students diagnosed with LLI underwent the intervention for an average of 32 days. Pre- and post-training assessments included standardized language/literacy tests and EEG recordings in response to fast-rate tone doublets. Twelve children with typical language development were also tested twice, with no intervention given. Behaviorally, improvements on measures of language were observed in the LLI group following completion of training. During the first EEG assessment, we found reduced amplitude and phase-locking of early (45-75 ms) oscillations in the gamma-band range (29-52 Hz), specifically in the LLI group, for the second stimulus of the tone doublet. Amplitude reduction for the second tone was no longer evident for the LLI children post-intervention, although these children still exhibited attenuated phase-locking. Our findings suggest that specific aspects of inefficient sensory cortical processing in LLI are ameliorated after training. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since SVD is used frequently in computations of the real-time EEG system, a low-latency and high-accuracy SVD processor is essential. During the EEG system process, the proposed SVD processor aims to solve the diagonal, inverse and inverse square root matrices of the target matrices in real time. Generally, SVD requires a huge amount of computation in hardware implementation. Therefore, this work proposes a novel design concept for data flow updating to assist the pipeline VLSI implementation. The SVD processor can greatly improve the feasibility of real-time EEG system applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). The proposed architecture is implemented using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The sample rate of EEG raw data adopts 128 Hz. The core size of the SVD processor is 580x580 um(2), and the speed of operation frequency is 20MHz. It consumes 0.774mW of power during the 8-channel EEG system per execution time.

Measuring GABAergic Inhibitory Activity with TMS-EEG and Its Potential Clinical Application for Chronic Pain	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNE PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Chronic pain; GABA; Cortical inhibition; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Gamma oscillations; Electroencephalography	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOCORTICAL INHIBITION; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; 40 HZ	Chronic pain is debilitating disorder in which the underlying pathophysiology is still unknown. Impaired cortical inhibition is one mechanism that is associated with chronic pain. Cortical inhibition refers to a neurophysiological process in which gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory interneurons selectively attenuate the activity of pyramidal neurons in the cortex. Previous studies have capitalized on the ability of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to index cortical inhibition by stimulating the motor cortex and measuring the resulting peripheral motor evoked potentials with electromyography. Chronic pain has been shown to induce changes in cortical inhibition within the motor cortex using TMS. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies also demonstrate that gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations in the prefrontal and somatosensory cortex are associated with the experience of pain. As gamma oscillations are mediated by GABA, the combination of TMS with EEG allows for the examination of the relationship between cortical inhibition, gamma and chronic pain. In this paper, we summarize the evidence of impaired GABAergic and gamma oscillations in chronic pain patients. We then demonstrate TMS-EEG as a reliable method in which to record cortical inhibition directly from the prefrontal cortex to examine the modulatory effect of GABAB receptor inhibition on cortical oscillations. Finally, the modulation of GABA and gamma oscillations with repetitive TMS will be suggested as the possible mechanism through which rTMS exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of pain. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to present the TMS-EEG as a potential method through which to better classify, diagnose and treat chronic pain.

In the present study, electroencephalography (EEG) is applied to study mental fatigue development during an air traffic control (ATC) task. Specifically, the frontal theta EEG dynamics are firstly dissolved into a unique frontal independent component (IC) through a novel time-frequency independent component analysis (tfICA) method. Then the temporal fluctuations of the identified frontal ICs every minute are compared to workload (reflected by number of clicks per minute) and time-on-task effect by correlational analysis and linear regression analysis. It is observed that the frontal theta activity significantly increase with workload augment and time-on-task. The present study demonstrates that the frontal theta EEG activity identified by tfICA method is a sensitive and reliable metric to assess mental workload and time-on-task effect in a real-world task, i.e., ATC task, at the resolution of minute(s).

The results showed that the theta power at the frontal midline decreased with increased arousal level related to tempo. The alpha power induced by original music at the bilateral occipital-parietal regions was stronger than that by tempo-transformed music. The beta power did not change with tempo. At the network level, the original music-related alpha network had high global efficiency and the optimal path length. This study was the first to use EEG to investigate multi-oscillatory activities and the data support the tempo-specific timing hypothesis.

Its relative ease of deployment, low cost, and high availability have secured for this recording technique a place of choice in the neuroscience and neuromedecine armada. Given these qualities and its important user base, investigation of the central nervous system could largely benefit from the development of new analysis techniques for EEG recordings. This paper contributes to a better exploitation of EEG databases by proposing a new methodology to assess temporal displacements of transient activity of scalp action potential fields. This technique establishes relationships through a cross-correlation analysis - between the time-frequency representations of different recording channels. An example application is given for the propagation of EEG sleep spindles but larger applicability to other transient waveforms recorded on dense arrays of sensors is also possible.

This method is a multivariate extension of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and can be applied to short and/or sparse time series. Cross-trial and/or cross-channel spectra (CTS) can be obtained for electroencephalography (EEG) data where multiple short data segments of the same experiment are available. There are two versions of CTS: The first one assumes some phase coherency across the trials while the second one is independent of phase coherency. We demonstrate that the phase dependent version is more consistent with traditional spectral methods as implemented in EEGLAB. This multivariate spectral analysis is a spatio-temporal extension of DFT and should not be confused with cross-spectral analysis. We applied this method to EEG data recorded while participants reached for and grasped a virtual object where we compared a cross-trial spectrogram (CTS) of data around a stimulus with traditional event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) analysis. We show that CTS can be applied to shorter data windows than ERSP by using spatio-temporal information in the EEG and therefore yields higher temporal resolution. Furthermore a CTS can be computed for each individual subject while ERSP is commonly computed on a whole population of subjects.

In an effort to understand neurophysiological substrates, identify etiopathophysiologically distinct subgroups of patients, and track outcomes of novel treatments with translational biomarkers, EEG (electroencephalography) studies offer a promising research strategy in ASD. Resting-state EEG studies of ASD suggest a U-shaped profile of electrophysiological power alterations, with excessive power in low-frequency and high-frequency bands, abnormal functional connectivity, and enhanced power in the left hemisphere of the brain. In this review, we provide a summary of recent findings, discuss limitations in available research that may contribute to inconsistencies in the literature, and offer suggestions for future research in this area for advancing the understanding of ASD.

These rhythms can be externally modulated during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a perturbation method to trigger oscillatory brain activity. EEG-TMS co-registration was performed during standard wake, during wake after sleep deprivation and in sleep in six healthy subjects. Dynamic changes in the regional neural oscillatory activity of the cortical areas were characterized using time frequency analysis based on the wave let method, and the modulation of induced oscillations were related to different vigilance states. A reciprocal synchronizing/desynchronizing effect on slow and fast oscillatory activity was observed in response to focal TMS after sleep deprivation and sleep. We observed a sleep-related slight desynchronization of alpha mainly over the frontal areas, and a widespread increase in theta synchronization. These findings could be interpreted as proof of the interference external brain stimulation can exert on the cortex, and how this could be modulated by the vigilance state. Potential clinical applications may include evaluation of hyperexcitable states such as epilepsy or disturbed states of consciousness such as minimal consciousness.

Application of Partial Directed Coherence to the Analysis of Resting-State EEG-fMRI Data	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						default mode network; directed coherence; Granger causality; resting-state networks; simultaneous data acquisition		The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data potentially allows measurement of brain signals with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Partial directed coherence (PDC) is a Granger causality measure in the frequency domain, which is often used to infer the intensity of information flow over the brain from EEG data. In the current study, we propose a new approach to investigate functional connectivity in resting-state (RS) EEG-fMRI data by combining time-varying PDC with the analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Basically, we aim to identify brain circuits that are more active when the information flow is increased between distinct remote neuronal modules. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by application to simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data from healthy subjects at rest. Using this approach, we decomposed the nodes of RS networks in fMRI data according to the frequency band and directed flow of information provided from EEG. This approach therefore has the potential to inform our understanding of the regional characteristics of oscillatory processes in the human brain.

Recently, studies have suggested that there is alcohol-related information in the non-stimulus-phase-locked (induced) theta TF activity. We applied TF analysis to target stimulus event-related EEG recorded during an oddball task from 41 long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) and 74 nonalcoholic controls (NAC) to investigate the relationship between P3b, evoked theta, and induced theta activity. Results showed that an event-related synchronization (ERS) of induced theta (1) was larger in LTAA compared to NAC, and (2) was sensitive to differences between LTAA and NAC groups that was independent of the differences accounted for by P3b amplitude or evoked theta. These findings suggest that increased induced theta ERS may likely be a biomarker for a morbid effect of alcohol abuse on brain function.

Midfrontal conflict-related theta-band power reflects neural oscillations that predict behavior	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; midfrontal; non-phase-locked; oscillations; theta	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE CONFLICT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; DYNAMICS; EEG; STIMULUS; ERP	Action monitoring and conflict resolution require the rapid and flexible coordination of activity in multiple brain regions. Oscillatory neural population activity may be a key physiological mechanism underlying such rapid and flexible network coordination. EEG power modulations of theta-band (4-8 Hz) activity over the human midfrontal cortex during response conflict have been proposed to reflect neural oscillations that support conflict detection and resolution processes. However, it has remained unclear whether this frequency-band-specific activity reflects neural oscillations or nonoscillatory responses (i.e., event-related potentials). Here, we show that removing the phase-locked component of the EEG did not reduce the strength of the conflict-related modulation of the residual (i.e., non-phase-locked) theta power over midfrontal cortex. Furthermore, within-subject regression analyses revealed that the non-phase-locked theta power was a significantly better predictor of the conflict condition than was the time-domain phase-locked EEG component. Finally, non-phase-locked theta power showed robust and condition-specific (high-vs. low-conflict) cross-trial correlations with reaction time, whereas the phase-locked component did not. Taken together, our results indicate that most of the conflict-related and behaviorally relevant midfrontal EEG signal reflects a modulation of ongoing theta-band oscillations that occurs during the decision process but is not phase-locked to the stimulus or to the response.

Gamma- and theta-band synchronization during semantic priming reflect local and long-range lexical-semantic networks	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Dynamic connectivity; Coherence; Electroencephalography; Language; Oscillatory dynamics	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; SINGLE-WORD; OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE; MEMORY; ALPHA; BRAIN; RETRIEVAL; DISSOCIATION	Anterior and posterior brain areas are involved in the storage and retrieval of semantic representations, but it is not known how these areas dynamically interact during semantic processing. We hypothesized that long-range theta-band coherence would reflect coupling of these areas and examined the oscillatory dynamics of lexical-semantic processing using a semantic priming paradigm with a delayed letter-search task while recording subjects' EEG. Time-frequency analysis revealed facilitation of semantic processing for Related compared to Unrelated conditions, which resulted in a reduced N400 and reduced gamma power from 150 to 450 ms. Moreover, we observed greater anterior-posterior theta coherence for Unrelated compared to Related conditions over the time windows 150-425 ms and 600-900 ms. We suggest that while gamma power reflects activation of local functional networks supporting semantic representations, theta coherence indicates dynamic coupling of anterior and posterior areas for retrieval and post-retrieval processing and possibly an interaction between semantic relatedness and working memory.

Various computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been introduced to confirm the visual inspection results. Of these methods, high gamma oscillation in iEEG has attracted interest because a series of studies have reported a close relationship between epileptogenic zones and cortical areas with high gamma oscillation. Meanwhile, frequency domain source imaging of EEG and MEG oscillations has proven to be a useful auxiliary tool for identifying rough locations of epileptogenic zones. To the best of our knowledge, however, frequency domain source imaging of high gamma iEEG oscillations has not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether the iEEG-based frequency domain source imaging of high gamma oscillation (60-100 Hz) would be a useful supplementary tool for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. The method was applied to three successfully operated on LGS patients, whose iEEG contained some ictal events with distinct high gamma oscillations before seizure onset. The resultant cortical source distributions were compared with surgical resection areas and with high gamma spectral power distributions on the intracranial sensor plane. While the results of the sensor-level analyses contained many spurious activities, the results of frequency domain source imaging coincided better with the surgical resection areas, suggesting that the frequency domain source imaging of iEEG high gamma oscillations might help enhance the accuracy of pre-surgical evaluations of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy.

Since the origin of these BFV oscillations is not known, we explored their possible causative relationships with oscillations in EEG-PV at around 0.06 Hz. We monitored 28 patients undergoing non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass using transcranial Doppler sonography and scalp electroencephalography at two levels of anesthesia, deep (prevalence of burst suppression rhythm) and moderate (prevalence of theta rhythm). Under deep anesthesia, the EEG bursts suppression pattern was highly correlative with BFV oscillations. Hence, a detailed quantitative picture of the coupling between electrical brain activity and BFV was derived, both in deep and moderate anesthesia, via linear and non linear processing of EEG-PV and BFV signals, resorting to widely used measures of signal coupling such as frequency of oscillations, coherence, Granger causality and cross-approximate entropy. Results strongly suggest the existence of coupling between EEG-PV and BFV. In moderate anesthesia EEG-PV mean dominant frequency is similar to frequency of BFV oscillations (0.065 +/- 0.010 Hz vs 0.045 +/- 0.019 Hz); coherence between the two signals was significant in about 55% of subjects, and the Granger causality suggested an EEG-PV BFV causal effect direction. The strength of the coupling increased with deepening anesthesia, as EEG-PV oscillations mean dominant frequency virtually coincided with the BFV peak frequency (0.062 +/- 0.017 Hz vs 0.060 +/- 0.024 Hz), and coherence became significant in a larger number (65%) of subjects. Cross-approximate entropy decreased significantly from moderate to deep anesthesia, indicating a higher level of synchrony between the two signals. Presence of a subcortical brain pacemaker that drives vascular infra-slow oscillations in the brain is proposed. These findings allow to suggest an original hypothesis explaining the mechanism underlying infra-slow neurovascular coupling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our objective is to improve this by introducing guidelines and algorithms to quantify various properties, focussing on the background pattern in adult EEGs. Methods: Five common properties were evaluated: (i) alpha rhythm frequency; (ii) reactivity; (iii) anterio- posterior gradients; (iv) asymmetries; and (v) diffuse slow-wave activity. A formal description was found for each together with a guideline and proposed quantitative algorithm. All five features were automatically extracted from routine EEG recordings. Modified time-frequency plots were calculated to summarize spectral and spatial characteristics. Visual analysis scores were obtained from diagnostic reports. Results: Automated feature extraction was applied to 384 routine EEGs. Inter-rater agreement was calculated between visual and quantitative analysis using Fleiss' kappa: kappa = {(i) 0.60; (ii) 0.35; (iii) 0.19; (iv) 0.12; (v) 0.76}. The method is further illustrated with three representative examples of automated reports. Conclusions: Automated feature extraction of several background EEG properties seems feasible. Inter-rater agreement differed between various features, ranging from slight to substantial. This may be related to the nature of various guidelines and inconsistencies in visual interpretation. Significance: Formal descriptions, standardized terminology, and quantitative analysis may improve inter-rater reliability in reporting of the EEG background pattern and contribute to more efficient and consistent interpretations.

Methods: 30 individuals with spinal cord injury and chronic pain were given an EEG and administered measures of pain before and after five procedures (hypnosis, meditation, transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS], neurofeedback, and a control sham tDCS procedure). Results: Each procedure was associated with a different pattern of changes in brain activity, and all active procedures were significantly different from the control procedure in at least three bandwidths. Very weak and mostly non-significant associations were found between changes in EEG-assessed brain activity and pain. Conclusions: Different non-pharmacological pain treatments have distinctive effects on brain oscillation patterns. However, changes in EEG-assessed brain oscillations are not significantly associated with changes in pain, and therefore such changes do not appear useful for explaining the benefits of these treatments. Significance: The results provide new findings regarding the unique effects of four non-pharmacological treatments on pain and brain activity.

CORTICAL CURRENT DENSITY OSCILLATIONS IN THE MOTOR CORTEX ARE CORRELATED WITH MUSCULAR ACTIVITY DURING PEDALING EXERCISE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; current density; EMG; motor cortex	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; MUSCLE ACTIVATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OXYGENATION; EEG; PERFORMANCE; CADENCE; FMRI	Despite modern imaging techniques, assessing and localizing changes in brain activity during whole-body exercise is still challenging. Using an active electroencephalography (EEG) system in combination with source localization algorithms, this study aimed to localize brain cortical oscillations patterns in the motor cortex and to correlate these with surface electromyography (EMG)-detected muscular activity during pedaling exercise. Eight subjects performed 2-min isokinetic (90 rpm) cycling bouts at intensities ranging from 1 to 5W kg(-1) body mass on a cycle ergometer. These bouts were interspersed by a minimum of 2 min of passive rest to limit to development of peripheral muscle fatigue. Brain cortical activity within the motor cortex was analyzed using a 32-channel active EEG system combined with source localization algorithms. EMG activity was recorded from seven muscles on each lower limb. EEG and EMG activity revealed comparatively stable oscillations across the different exercise intensities. More importantly, the oscillations in cortical activity within the motor cortex were significantly correlated with EMG activity during the high-intensity cycling bouts. This study demonstrates that it is possible to localize oscillations in brain cortical activity during moderate- to high-intensity cycling exercise using EEG in combination with source localization algorithms, and that these oscillations match the activity of the active muscles in time and amplitude. Results of this study might help to further evaluate the effects of central vs. peripheral fatigue during exercise. (C) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spectral power analysis in response to the different emotions revealed significant differences between fearful and happy faces over the right frontal regions at 7-8 Hz (low alpha), and between emotional and neutral faces over the left frontal sites at 12-13 Hz (low beta) in a time period between 100-400 ms after visual stimulus onset. These results demonstrate that emotional face processing occurs very early in time in the absence of any functional striate cortex, and further reveals the existence of specific oscillatory frequencies that reflect unconscious processing of facial expressions in affective blindsight (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Time-frequency mapping of the rhythmic limb movements distinguishes convulsive epileptic from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; Epileptic seizures; Time-frequency mapping; Limb movements		Purpose A definite diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) usually requires in-patient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Previous research has shown that convulsive psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) demonstrate a characteristic pattern of rhythmic movement artifact on the EEG. Herein we sought to examine the potential for time-frequency mapping of data from a movement-recording device (accelerometer) worn on the wrist as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between convulsive epileptic seizures and PNES. Methods Time-frequency mapping was performed on accelerometer traces obtained during 56 convulsive seizure-like events from 35 patients recorded during in-patient video-EEG monitoring. Twenty-six patients had PNES, eight had epileptic seizures, and one had both seizure types. The time-frequency maps were derived from fast Fourier transformations to determine the dominant frequency for sequential 2.56-s blocks for the course of each event. Key Findings The coefficient of variation (CoV) of limb movement frequency for the PNES events was less than for the epileptic seizure events (median, 17.18% vs. 52.23%; p<0.001). A blinded review of the time-frequency maps by an epileptologist was accurate in differentiating between the event types, that is, 38 (92.7%) of 41 and 6 (75%) of 8 nonepileptic and epileptic seizures, respectively, were diagnosed correctly, with seven events classified as nondiagnostic. Using a CoV cutoff score of 32% resulted in similar classification accuracy, with 42 (93%) of 45 PNES and 10 (91%) of 11 epileptic seizure events correctly diagnosed. Significance Time-frequency analysis of data from a wristband movement monitor could be utilized as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between epileptic and nonepileptic convulsive seizure-like events.

Visual marking of HFOs bursts is tedious, highly time-consuming particularly for analyzing long-term multichannel EEG recordings, inevitably subjective and can be error prone. Thus, the development of automatic, fast and robust detectors is necessary and crucial for HFOs investigation and for propelling their eventual clinical applications. This paper presents a proposed algorithm for detection and classification of HFOs, which is a combination of both smoothed Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and root mean square (RMS) feature. Performance evaluation in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) were respectively 90.72% and 8.23% related to process validation. Indeed, the proposed method was efficient in terms of high sensitivity in which the majority of HFOs visually identified by experienced reviewers was correctly detected, and had a lower FDR. This would mean that only a low rate of detected events was misclassified as candidate HFOs events. The presented software is extremely fast, suitable and can be considered a valuable clinical tool for HFOs investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Leite, M; Leal, A; Figueiredo, P				Leite, Marco; Leal, Alberto; Figueiredo, Patricia			Transfer function between EEG and BOLD signals of epileptic activity	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						BOLD; EEG-fMRI; epilepsy; ICA; heuristic	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; SPIKES; MODEL; MRI; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DISCHARGES; ARTIFACTS; ROBUST	Simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) recordings have seen growing application in the evaluation of epilepsy, namely in the characterization of brain networks related to epileptic activity. In EEG-correlated fMRI studies, epileptic events are usually described as boxcar signals based on the timing information retrieved from the EEG, and subsequently convolved with a hemodynamic response function to model the associated Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) changes. Although more flexible approaches may allow a higher degree of complexity for the hemodynamics, the issue of how to model these dynamics based on the EEG remains an open question. In this work, a new methodology for the integration of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data in epilepsy is proposed, which incorporates a transfer function from the EEG to the BOLD signal. Independent component analysis of the EEG is performed, and a number of metrics expressing different models of the EEG-BOLD transfer function are extracted from the resulting time courses. These metrics are then used to predict the fMRI data and to identify brain areas associated with the EEG epileptic activity. The methodology was tested on both ictal and interictal EEG-fMRI recordings from one patient with a hypothalamic hamartoma. When compared to the conventional analysis approach, plausible, consistent, and more significant activations were obtained. Importantly, frequency-weighted EEG metrics yielded superior results than those weighted solely on the EEG power, which comes in agreement with previous literature. Reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity should be addressed in an extended group of patients in order to further validate the proposed methodology and generalize the presented proof of concept.

As EEG is non-stationary, time-frequency analysis is essential to analyze brain states during different mental tasks. Further, the time-frequency information of EEG signal can be used as a feature for classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Methods: To accurately model the EEG, band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC), a linear combination of truncated multiple Fourier series models is employed. A state-space model for BMFLC in combination with Kalman filter/smoother is developed to obtain accurate adaptive estimation. By virtue of construction, BMFLC with Kalman filter/smoother provides accurate time-frequency decomposition of the bandlimited signal. Results: The proposed method is computationally fast and is suitable for real-time BCI applications. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a comparison with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for both synthesized and real EEG data is performed in this paper. The proposed method is applied to BCI Competition data IV for ERD detection in comparison with existing methods. Conclusions: Results show that the proposed algorithm can provide optimal time-frequency resolution as compared to STFT and CWT. For ERD detection, BMFLC-KF outperforms STFT and BMFLC-KS in real-time applicability with low computational requirement.

We aimed to study the metabolic and electrophysiological correlates of these changes in the DMN regions. We studied six epilepsy patients that underwent scalp EEG-fMRI and later stereotaxic intracerebral EEG (SEEG) sampling regions of DMN (posterior cingulate cortex, Pre-cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral frontal cortex) as well as non-DMN regions. SEEG recordings were subject to frequency analyses comparing sections with interictal epileptic discharges (IED) to IED-free baselines in the IED-generating region, DMN and non-DMN regions. EEG-fMRI and SEEG were obtained at rest. During IEDs, EEG-fMRI demonstrated deactivation in various DMN nodes in 5 of 6 patients, most frequently the pre-cuneus and inferior parietal lobule, and less frequently the other DMN nodes. SEEG analyses demonstrated decrease in gamma power (50150 Hz), and increase in the power of lower frequencies (<30 Hz) at times of IEDs, in at least one DMN node in all patients. These changes were not apparent in the non-DMN regions. We demonstrate that, at the time of IEDs, DMN regions decrease their metabolic demand and undergo an EEG change consisting of decreased gamma and increased lower frequencies. These findings, specific to DMN regions, confirm in a pathological condition a direct relationship between DMN BOLD activity and EEG activity. They indicate that epileptic activity affects the DMN, and therefore may momentarily reduce the consciousness level and cognitive reserve.

The resulting optimization problem is not convex, and we have to resort to a sub-optimal approach. Concretely, we propose a two-step solution consisting of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a "coherence" matrix followed by a rank-one matrix approximation. This technique is applied to blindly recovering signals in a model that is motivated by the study of neuronal dynamics in humans using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). A distinctive feature of this model is that it allows recovery of amplitude-amplitude coupling between neuronal processes.

For example, simply viewing one's own body can reduce pain, suggesting that the visual context may influence the processing of nociceptive stimuli. We studied changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory activity related to visual modulation of nociception, comparing cortical oscillations during innocuous or noxious contact heat, while participants viewed either their own hand or a neutral object at the same location. Viewing the body compared with viewing the object reduced the intensity ratings of noxious stimuli, but not of innocuous heat. Timefrequency analysis of EEG data revealed that noxious, as opposed to warm, stimulation was associated with reduced beta (1525Hz) power. Classically, such decreases in oscillatory power indicate increases in sensory cortical activation. These event-related oscillatory changes were moreover modulated by the visual context; viewing one's own body increased noxious stimulation-induced beta oscillatory activity bilaterally, relative to viewing a neutral object, possibly indicating inhibition of cortical nociceptive processing. These results demonstrate that visualnociceptive interactions involve changes in sensorimotor EEG rhythms.

Was used an electroencephalography (EEG) system developed for bovine and adapted to rats. The bipolar electrode system (needle electrodes) was glued on the surface of the head of the animal without surgical procedures and the other electrode was glued to the tail, as ground. The EEG activity was sampled at 120Hz for an hour. The accuracy and precision of the EEG measurement was performed using Fourier analysis and signal energy. For this, the digital signal was divided into sections successive of 3 seconds and was decomposed into four frequency bands: delta (0.3 to 4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) and energy (mu V-2) of the series of time filtered were calculated. The method allowed the acquisition of non-invasive electrical brain signals in conscious rats and their frequency patterns were in agreement with previous studies that used surgical procedures to acquire EEG in rats. This system showed accuracy and precision and will allow further studies on behavior and to investigate the action of drugs on the central nervous system in rats without surgical procedures.

However, there is a lack of studies on neurophysiological correlates of proportional reasoning. To explore the brain activity of healthy adults while performing a balance scale task, we used high-resolution EEG techniques and graph-theory based connectivity analysis. After unskilled subjects learned how to properly solve the task, their cortical power spectral density (PSD) maps revealed an increased parietal activity in the beta band. This indicated that subjects started to perform calculations. In addition, the number of inter-hemispheric connections decreased after learning, implying a rearrangement of the brain activity. Repeated performance of the task led to the PSD decrease in the beta and gamma bands among parietal and frontal regions along with a synchronization of lower frequencies. These findings suggest that repetition led to a more automatic task performance. Subjects were also divided in two groups according to their scores on the test of logical thinking (TOLT). Although no group differences in the accuracy and reaction times were found, EEG data showed higher activity in the beta and gamma bands for the group that scored better on TOLT. Learning and repetition induced changes in the pattern of functional connectivity were evident for all frequency bands. Overall, the results indicated that higher frequency oscillations in frontal and parietal regions are particularly important for proportional reasoning.

This period of EMG silence is referred to as the silent period (SP). The duration of SP shows intersubject variability and reflects the integrity of cortical and corticospinal pathways. A non-invasive technique for assessing the duration of SP is the combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with EMG. Utilizing TMS-EMG, several studies have reported on the shortening or lengthening of SP in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, cortical, corticospinal and peripheral components are difficult to disentangle from EMG alone. Here, we use the multimodal neuroimaging technique of TMS-EMG combined with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording to further examine the cortical origin of SP and the cortical oscillatory activity that underlies SP genesis. We demonstrate that the duration of SP is related to the temporal characteristics of the cortical reactivity and the power of delta to alpha oscillations in both local and remote areas ipsilateral and contalateral to the stimulation site, and beta oscillations locally. We illustrate that, compared to EMG, the EEG indices of the SP provide additional information about the brain dynamics and propose that the EEG measures of SP may be used in future clinical and research investigations to more precisely delineate the mechanisms underlying inhibitory impairments.

By characterizing the local properties of the EEG using power spectrum, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert-spectral analysis, we can examine the dynamics over a range of time-scales. We analyzed rat EEG during wake, NREMS and REMS using these methods. The average instantaneous phase, power spectral density (PSD) of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the energy content in various frequency bands show characteristic changes in each of the vigilance states. The 2nd and 7th IMFs show changes in PSD for wake and REMS, suggesting that those modes may carry wake-and REMS-associated cognitive, conscious and behavior-specific information of an individual even though the EEG may appear similar. The energy content in theta(2) (6Hz-9Hz) band of the 1st IMF for REMS is larger than that of wake. The decrease in the phase function of IMFs from wake to REMS to NREMS indicates decrease of the mean frequency in these states, respectively. The rate of information processing in waking state is more in the time scale described by the first three IMFs than in REMS state. However, for IMF5-IMF7, the rate is more for REMS than that for wake. We obtained Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy, which is a suitable measure of information processing in each of these state-specific EEG. It is possible to evaluate the complex dynamics of the EEG in each of the vigilance states by applying measures based on EMD and Hilbert-transform. Our results suggest that the EMD based nonlinear measures of the EEG can provide useful estimates of the information possessed by various oscillations associated with the vigilance states. Further, the EMD-based spectral measures may have implications in understanding anatamo-physiological correlates of sleep-waking behavior and clinical diagnosis of sleep-pathology.

In this paper, we present a simple and effective approach based on signal decomposition, using a novel variation of the Empirical Mode Decomposition called Empirical Mode Decomposition-Modified Peak Selection (EMD-MPS). EMD-MPS allows time-scale based de-trending of signals, allowing signals to be separated directly into a de-trended component, and a trend, according to a frequency separation criterion. Features are extracted from the decomposed components, and a simple classifier, namely the 1-NN classifier is used for three classification tasks. The technique is tested on a publicly available EEG database, and a classification accuracy of 99% for epilepsy diagnosis task, and 100% and 98.2% for two seizure detection tasks is obtained. These results are better than, or comparable to previous results using the same EEG database, but have been obtained with a simpler and computationally fast signal analysis and classification method.

Little is known about the neurophysiological underpinnings of social pain. We addressed this issue using intracranial electroencephalography in 15 patients performing a ball game where inclusion and exclusion blocks were alternated. Time-frequency analyses showed an increase in power of theta-band oscillations during exclusion in the anterior insula (AI) and posterior insula, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), and the fusiform "face area" (FFA). Interestingly, the AI showed an initial fast response to exclusion but the signal rapidly faded out. Activity in the sACC gradually increased and remained significant thereafter. This suggests that the AI may signal social pain by detecting emotional distress caused by the exclusion, whereas the sACC may be linked to the learning aspects of social pain. Theta activity in the FFA was time-locked to the observation of a player poised to exclude the participant, suggesting that the FFA encodes the social value of faces. Taken together, our findings suggest that theta activity represents the neural signature of social pain. The time course of this signal varies across regions important for processing emotional features linked to social information.

In the case of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, seizures may prove fatal and surgery becomes an option. Compared with EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magenetoencephalography) offers greater accuracy in epilepsy localization owing to higher spatial resolution. However, streaming data from MEG system for surgical evaluation involves cumbersome processes, e. g. down-sampling, artifact removal (via Independent Component Analysis most of the time) and time/frequency plotting. This paper proposes an automated framework using open-source solutions to visualize epilepsy. The capability of the framework is demonstrated with a case of epilepsy surgery.

In this work, a feature relevance analysis approach based on an eigen decomposition method is proposed to support automatic Motor Imagery (MI) discrimination in electroencephalography signals for BCI systems. We select a set of features representing the best as possible the studied process. For such purpose, a variability study is performed based on traditional Principal Component Analysis. EEG signals modelling is carried out by feature estimation of three frequency-based and one time-based. Our approach provides testing over a well-known MI dataset. Attained results show that presented algorithm can be used as tool to support discrimination of MI brain activity, obtaining acceptable results in comparison to state of the art approaches.

Ictal scalp gamma rhythms were investigated through time frequency analysis in two cases with a combination of focal seizures and spasms and another case with spasms associated with cortical dysplasia. In the two patients with combined seizures, the scalp distribution of ictal gamma rhythms was related to that of focal seizure activity. In the third patient, an asymmetric distribution of the ictal scalp gamma rhythms was transiently revealed in correspondence to the dysplasic cortex during hormonal treatment. Therefore, the dominant region of scalp gamma rhythms may correspond to the epileptogenic cortical area. The current findings have reinforced the possibility of the cortical generation of ictal scalp gamma rhythms associated with spasms The detection of high frequencies through scalp EEG is a technical challenge, however, and the clinical significance of scalp gamma rhythms may not be the same as that of invasively recorded high frequencies. Further studies on the pathophysiological mechanisms related to the generation of spasms involving high frequencies are necessary in the future, and the development of animal models of spasms will play an important role in this regard.

Clinical usefulness and feasibility of time-frequency analysis of chemosensory event-related potentials	RHINOLOGY			English	Article						chemosensory event-related potentials; olfaction; trigeminal; time-frequency analysis; EEG	OLFACTORY-BULB VOLUME; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETRONASAL; RECOVERY; SMELL; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULATION; TESTS; AGE	Background:The Clinical usefulness of olfactory event-related:brain potentials (OERPs) to assess olfactory function is limited by the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the responses identified using conventional time-domain averaging. Recently, it was shown that time-frequency analysis of the obtained EEG signals can markedly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of OERPs in healthy controls, because It enhances both phase-locked and non phase-locked EEG responses.The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of this approach and evaluate its feasibility in a clinical setting. Methodology: We retrospectively analysed EEG recordings-obtained from 45 patients (15 anosmic, 15 hyposmic and 15 normosmic).The responses to olfactory stimulation were analysed using conventional time-domain analysis and joint time-frequency analysis.The ability of the two methods to discriminate between anosmic, hyposmic and normosmic patients was assessed-using a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Results:The discrimination performance of OERPs identified using conventional time-domain averaging was poor. In contrast, the discrimination performance of the EEG response identified in the time-frequency domain was relatively high. Furthermore, we found a significant Correlation,between the magnitude of this response and the psychophysical olfactory score. Conclusion:Time-frequency analysis of the EEG responses to olfactory stimulation could be used as an effective and reliable diagnostic tool for the objective clinical evaluation of olfactory function in patients.

J	Boril, T; Sovka, P				Boril, Tomas; Sovka, Pavel			Autoregressive causal relation: Digital filtering approach to causality measures in frequency domain	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Autoregressive processes; Frequency domain analysis; Brain modeling; Electroencephalography	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; INFORMATION-FLOW; MODELS; EEG	A novel measure of the Autoregressive Causal Relation based on a multivariate autoregressive model is proposed. It reveals the strength of the connections among a simultaneous time series and also the direction of the information flow. It is defined in the frequency domain, similar to the formerly published methods such as: Directed Transfer Function, Direct Directed Transfer Function, Partial Directed Coherence, and Generalized Partial Directed Coherence. Compared to the Granger causality concept, frequency decomposition extends the possibility to reveal the frequency rhythms participating on the information flow in causal relations. The Autoregressive Causal Relation decomposes diagonal elements of a spectral matrix and enables a user to distinguish between direct and indirect causal relations. The main advantage lies in its definition using power spectral densities, thus allowing for a clear interpretation of strength of causal relation in meaningful physical terms. The causal measures can be used in neuroscience applications like the analysis of underlying structures of brain connectivity in neural multichannel time series during different tasks measured via electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging, or other areas using the multivariate autoregressive models for causality modeling like econometrics or atmospheric physics but this paper is focused on theoretical aspects and model data examples in order to illustrate a behavior of methods in known situations.

This work introduces a new method to obtain relevant features extracted from time-frequency plane for epileptic EEG signals. Particularly, EEG features are extracted by common spectral methods such as short time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelets transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Then, each method is evaluated by Stochastic Relevance Analysis (SRA) that is further used for EEG classification and channel selection. The classification measures are carried out based on the performance of the k-NN classifier, while the channels selected are validated by visual inspection and topographic scalp map. The study uses real and multi-channel EEG data and all the experiments have been supervised by an expert neurologist. Results obtained in this paper show that SRA is a good alternative for automatic seizure detection and also opens the possibility of formulating new criteria to select, classify or analyze abnormal EEG channels.

We combined experimental electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of 18 subjects and neural mass modeling approaches to investigate functional neural connectivity during walking on uneven terrain. Both approaches revealed a pattern of connectivity involving the anterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices at alpha frequencies. Further, the modeling identified that the timing of recovered connectivity can be affected by the complexity of inter-node connections. Understanding these cortical connections could lead to new insights into brain function during normal human behaviors.	[Snyder, K. L.; Ferris, D.

EEG alpha band synchrony predicts cognitive and motor performance in patients with ischemic stroke	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; stroke; functional networks; alpha band; plasticity	BRAIN	Functional brain networks are known to be affected by focal brain lesions. However, the clinical relevance of these changes remains unclear. This study assesses resting-state functional connectivity (FC) with electroencephalography (EEG) and relates observed topography of FC to cognitive and motor deficits in patients three months after ischemic stroke. Twenty patients (mean age 61.3 years, range 37-80, 9 females) and nineteen age-matched healthy participants (mean age 66.7 years, range 36-88, 13 females) underwent a ten-minute EEG-resting state examination. The neural oscillations at each grey matter voxel were reconstructed using an adaptive spatial filter and imaginary component of coherence (IC) was calculated as an index of FC. Maps representing mean connectivity value at each voxel were correlated with the clinical data. Compared to healthy controls, alpha band IC of stroke patients was locally reduced in brain regions critical to observed behavioral deficits. A voxel-wise Pearson correlation of clinical performances with FC yielded maps of the neural structures implicated in motor, language; and executive function. This correlation was again specific to alpha band coherence. Ischemic lesions decrease the synchrony of alpha band oscillations between affected brain regions and the rest of the brain. This decrease is linearly related to cognitive and motor deficits observed in the patients.

At that time the diagnostic tool continues to evolve, which is related to the development of both technological and innovative solutions proposed by scientists. One of possible solutions for automatic EEG analysis is to use modern signal processing tools, which are able to give a time-frequency representation of a signal. This paper presents a comparison of methods such as the discrete wavelet transform, the matching pursuit algorithm, and the S transform for feature extraction and then classification of neurological disorders.

Although fMRI experiments have investigated changes in brain activity after relative to before perceptual learning, brain activity during perceptual learning has not been explored. This work investigated brain activity related to auditory frequency discrimination learning using a variational Bayesian approach for source localization, during simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording. We investigated whether the practice effects are determined solely by activity in stimulus-driven mechanisms or whether high-level attentional mechanisms, which are linked to the perceptual task, control the learning process. Results: The results of fMRI analyses revealed significant attention and learning related activity in left and right superior temporal gyrus STG as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus IFG. Current source localization of simultaneously recorded EEG data was estimated using a variational Bayesian method. Analysis of current localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus revealed gamma band activity correlated with behavioral performance. Conclusions: Rapid improvement in task performance is accompanied by plastic changes in the sensory cortex as well as superior areas gated by selective attention. Together the fMRI and EEG results suggest that gamma band activity in the right STG and left IFG plays an important role during perceptual learning.

Here we compare whole-brain arterial spin labelling perfusion MRI and EEG in a group of healthy adults (n = 16, ten females, median age: 27 years, range 21-48) during an eyes closed rest condition. Correlations emerged between perfusion and global average EEG power in low (delta: 2-4 Hz and theta: 4-7 Hz), middle (alpha: 8-13 Hz), and high (beta: 13-30 Hz and gamma: 30-45 Hz) frequency bands in both cortical and sub-cortical regions. The correlations were predominately positive in middle and high-frequency bands, and negative in delta. In addition, central alpha frequency positively correlated with perfusion in a network of brain regions associated with the modulation of attention and preparedness for external input, and central theta frequency correlated negatively with a widespread network of cortical regions. These results indicate that the coupling between average EEG power/frequency and local cerebral blood flow varies in a frequency specific manner. Our results are consistent with longstanding concepts that decreasing EEG frequencies which in general map onto decreasing levels of activation.	[O'Gorman, R.

Different theoretical accounts implicate either medial frontal (MF) cognitive control processes or prestimulus occipital (OC) cortical oscillatory dynamics in errors during perceptual tasks. Here, we show that these 2 previously unconnected theoretical accounts can be reconciled, and the brain regions described by the 2 theories have complimentary and interactive roles in supporting error adaptation. Using a perceptual discrimination task and time-frequency network-based analyses of electroencephalography data, we show that perceptual anticipation and posterror top-down control mechanisms recruit distinct but interacting brain networks. MF sites were a hub for theta-band networks and theta-alpha coupling elicited after errors, whereas occipital sites were a network hub during stimulus anticipation and alpha-gamma coupling. Granger causality analyses revealed that these networks communicate in their preferred direction and frequency band: response-related MF -> OC interactions occurred in the theta band, whereas stimulus anticipation-related OC -> MF interactions occurred in the alpha band. Subjects with stronger network interactions were more likely to improve performance after errors. These findings demonstrate that multiple large-scale brain networks interact dynamically and in a directionally specific manner in different frequency bands to support flexible behavior adaptation during perceptual decision making.

Automatic seizure detection in SEEG using high frequency activities in wavelet domain	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Automatic seizure detection; Wavelet; High frequency; EMG removal	OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NEURAL-NETWORK; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; SYSTEM; ONSET; ALGORITHM	Existing automatic detection techniques show high sensitivity and moderate specificity, and detect seizures a relatively long time after onset. High frequency (80-500 Hz) activity has recently been shown to be prominent in the intracranial EEG of epileptic patients but has not been used in seizure detection. The purpose of this study is to investigate if these frequencies can contribute to seizure detection. The system was designed using 30 h of intracranial EEG, including 15 seizures in 15 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction, adaptive thresholding and artifact removal were employed in training data. An EMG removal algorithm was developed based on two features: Lack of correlation between frequency bands and energy-spread in frequency. Results based on the analysis of testing data (36h of intracranial EEG, including 18 seizures) show a sensitivity of 72%, a false detection of 0.7/h and a median delay of 5.7 s. Missed seizures originated mainly from seizures with subtle or absent high frequencies or from EMG removal procedures. False detections were mainly due to weak EMG or interictal high frequency activities. The system performed sufficiently well to be considered for clinical use, despite the exclusive use of frequencies not usually considered in clinical interpretation. High frequencies have the potential to contribute significantly to the detection of epileptic seizures. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM. All rights reserved.

J	Ding, N; Simon, JZ				Ding, Nai; Simon, Jonathan Z.			Power and phase properties of oscillatory neural responses in the presence of background activity	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Phase resetting; Neural oscillations; Phase coherence; Entrainment	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH; PATTERNS	Natural sensory inputs, such as speech and music, are often rhythmic. Recent studies have consistently demonstrated that these rhythmic stimuli cause the phase of oscillatory, i.e. rhythmic, neural activity, recorded as local field potential (LFP), electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), to synchronize with the stimulus. This phase synchronization, when not accompanied by any increase of response power, has been hypothesized to be the result of phase resetting of ongoing, spontaneous, neural oscillations measurable by LFP, EEG, or MEG. In this article, however, we argue that this same phenomenon can be easily explained without any phase resetting, and where the stimulus-synchronized activity is generated independently of background neural oscillations. It is demonstrated with a simple (but general) stochastic model that, purely due to statistical properties, phase synchronization, as measured by 'inter-trial phase coherence', is much more sensitive to stimulus-synchronized neural activity than is power. These results question the usefulness of analyzing the power and phase of stimulus-synchronized activity as separate and complementary measures; particularly in the case of attempting to demonstrate whether stimulus-synchronized neural activity is generated by phase resetting of ongoing neural oscillations.

J	Hipp, JF; Siegel, M				Hipp, Joerg F.; Siegel, Markus			Dissociating neuronal gamma-band activity from cranial and ocular muscle activity in EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beamforming; electroencephalography; gamma band activity; oscillation; saccadic spike artifact; source analysis; vision	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COVERT ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; SACCADIC INTRUSIONS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ARTIFACTS	EEG is the most common technique for studying neuronal dynamics of the human brain. However, electromyogenic artifacts from cranial muscles and ocular muscles executing involuntary microsaccades compromise estimates of neuronal activity in the gamma band (>30 Hz). Yet, the relative contributions and practical consequences of these artifacts remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected the effects of these different artifacts on studying visual gamma-band activity with EEG on the sensor and source level, and show strategies to cope with these confounds. We found that cranial muscle activity prevented a direct investigation of neuronal gamma-band activity at the sensor level. Furthermore, we found prolonged microsaccade-related artifacts beyond the well-known transient EEG confounds. We then show that if electromyogenic artifacts are carefully accounted for, the EEG nonetheless allows for studying visual gamma-band activity even at the sensor level. Furthermore, we found that source analysis based on spatial filtering does not only map the EEG signals to the cortical space of interest, but also efficiently accounts for cranial and ocular muscle artifacts. Together, our results clarify the relative contributions and characteristics of myogenic artifacts confounding visual gamma-band activity in EEG, and provide practical guidelines for future experiments.

The EEG indicators of the dynamic properties of sleep-wake regulating processes: comparison of the changes occurring across wake-sleep transition with the effects of prolonged wakefulness	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH			English	Article						sleep-wake cycle; two-process model; opponent-process model; sleep deprivation; sleep homeostasis; principal component analysis; EEG spectrum; delta activity	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; WAKING EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM; CIRCADIAN MODULATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; OPPONENT PROCESSES; DAYTIME AROUSAL; TIME-COURSE; DEPRIVATION; ALERTNESS	Everyday oscillations between wakefulness and sleep might be ultimately delineated as cyclic alternations between opposing neurobiological processes, i.e. those promoting arousal and inhibiting sleep and those promoting sleep and inhibiting arousal. The question arises of whether it is possible to delineate the signatures of such regulating mechanisms in the human electroencephalogram (EEG). The major aim of the present analysis was to reveal the EEG indicators of the processes underlying wake-sleep transitions. Data included power spectra calculated for 1-min segments of 699 EEG records (315 attempts of 15 subjects to stay permanently awake for 43-61 h, 356 successful attempts of 32 subjects to fall asleep during multiple naps, and 28 commencements and terminations of all-night sleep in 14 subjects). Principal component analysis was performed on the sets of 16 single-Hz log-transformed EEG powers (1-16 Hz). A close similarity was found between the patterns of changes in the EEG measures during prolonged wakefulness and across wake-sleep transitions. The observed time courses of scores on the first and second principal components were interpreted as the pure representatives of the wake and sleep drives, respectively, while the time courses of powers in separate frequency bands might reflect simultaneous influences of both drives.

Automatic classification of sleep stages is an important part for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. The smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) based time-frequency representation (TFR) of EEG signal has been used to obtain the time-frequency image (TFI). The segmentation of TFI has been performed based on the frequency-bands of the rhythms of EEG signals. The features derived from the histogram of segmented TFI have been used as an input feature set to multiclass least squares support vector machines (MC-LS-SVM) together with the radial basis function (RBF), Mexican hat wavelet, and Morlet wavelet kernel functions for automatic classification of sleep stages from EEG signals. The experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of sleep stages from EEG signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In non-clinical environs, once an exhaustive search for a particular item of knowledge seems to be impractical, there is the natural tendency to switch to heuristic methods to expedite the search. Conversely, when neuroscientists are in the same situation, they will trust exhaustive searches rather than heuristics such as clinical decision-support systems (CDSS). This is particularly when electroencephalography (EEG) sequences are used to search for pathologic oscillations in the brain. The purpose of this paper is to promising results illustrating how an intelligent agent can data mine explicit types of pathologic oscillations in the human brain.

It is frequently used in the diagnosis of various cognitive and neurological disorders in EEG (Electroencephalography) analysis. Volume conduction effects of various uncorrelated sources present in the brain can produce biased estimates into the estimated values of cross-bicoherence function. Previous studies have discussed volume conduction effects on coherence function which is used to measure linear relationship between EEG signals in terms of their phase and amplitude. However, volume conduction effect on cross-bicoherence analysis which is quite a different technique has not been investigated up to now to the best of our knowledge. This study is divided into two major parts, the first part deals with the investigation of VCUS (Volume Conduction effects due to Uncorrelated Sources) characteristics on EEG-cross-bicoherence analysis. The simulated EEG data due to uncorrelated sources present in the brain was used in this part of study. The next part of study is based upon investigating the effects of VCUS on the statistical analysis of results of EEG-based cross-bicoherence analysis. The study provides an important clinical application because most of studies based on EEG cross-bicoherence analysis have avoided the issue of VCUS. The cross-bicoherence analysis was performed by detecting the change in MSCB (Magnitude Square Cross-Bicoherence Function) between EEG activities of change detection and no-change detection trials. The real EEG signals were used which were recorded from 15 healthy subjects performing the visual modified delayed matching-to-sample paradigm experiment. The results obtained showed the significant effects of VCUS on the statistical analysis of the results for comparatively short inter-electrode spacing less than the 4cm.

On the other hand, the band 100 - 500 Hz, abbreviated by "High-Frequency Oscillations"-HFO, has been studied since 1995, focusing epilepsy in both human and rat models. Current challenges are highlighted from the literature, leading to guidelines for those starting in the field, so that at the end we present two examples of HF0 recorded (1-100 Hz) in normal individual and in a patient from our local university hospital.

It is evident that progress towards this goal will greatly benefit from multivariate pattern classification (MVPC) techniques that can decode representations in brain activity with high temporal resolution. Recently, progress along these lines has been achieved by applying MVPC to neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We highlight two examples of methodological approaches for MVPC of EEG and MEG data that can be used to study memory function. The first example aims at understanding the dynamic neural mechanisms that enable reactivation of memory representations, i.e., memory replay; we discuss how MVPC can help uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying memory replay during working memory maintenance and episodic memory. The second example aims at understanding representational differences between various types of memory, such as perceptual priming and conscious recognition memory. We also highlight the conceptual and methodological differences between these two examples. Finally, we discuss potential future applications for MVPC of EEG/MEG data in studies of memory. We conclude that despite its infancy and existing methodological challenges, MVPC of EEG and MEG data is a powerful tool with which to assess mechanistic models of memory.

These phenomena may serve as biomarkers for epileptic brain; however, a means of differentiating between pathological and normal physiological HFO is essential. We categorized task-induced physiological HFO during periods of HFO induced by a visual or motor task by measuring frequency, duration, and spectral amplitude of each event in single trial time-frequency spectra and compared them to pathological HFO similarly measured. Pathological HFO had higher mean spectral amplitude, longer mean duration, and lower mean frequency than physiological-induced HFO. In individual patients, support vector machine analysis correctly classified pathological HFO with sensitivities ranging from 70-98% and specificities >90% in all but one patient. In this patient, infrequent high-amplitude HFO were observed in the motor cortex just before movement onset in the motor task. This finding raises the possibility that in epileptic brain physiological-induced gamma can assume higher spectral amplitudes similar to those seen in pathologic HFO. This method if automated and validated could provide a step towards differentiating physiological HFO from pathological HFO and improving localization of epileptogenic brain.

Effective implementation of time-frequency matched filter with adapted pre and postprocessing for data-dependent detection of newborn seizures	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						EEG; Matched filter; Neonatal seizure detection; Time-frequency analysis; Time-frequency distribution	NEONATAL SEIZURES; NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; METHODOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; EPILEPSY	Neonatal EEG seizures often manifest as nonstationary and multicomponent signals, necessitating analysis in the time-frequency (TF) domain. This paper presents a novel neonatal seizure detector based on effective implementation of the TF matched filter. In the detection process, the TF signatures of EEG seizure are extracted to construct the TF templates used by the matched filter. Matching pursuit (MP) decomposition and narrowband filtering are proposed for the reduction of artifacts prior to seizure detection. Geometrical correlation is used to consolidate the multichannel detections and to reduce the number of false detections due to remnant artifacts. A data-dependent threshold is defined for the classification of EEG. Using 30 newborn EEG records with seizures, the classification process yielded an overall detection accuracy of 92.4% with good detection rate (GDR) of 84.8% and false detection rate of 0.36 FD/h. Better detection performance (accuracy >95%) was recorded for relatively long EEG records with short seizure events. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Khlif, M.

A SIGNAL-TUNED GABOR TRANSFORM WITH APPLICATION TO EEG ANALYSIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; S-transform; Gabor transform; EEG signal processing	COMPLEX PERMEABILITY; METAMATERIALS; PERMITTIVITY; FREQUENCIES	We introduce a time-frequency transform based on Gabor functions whose parameters are given by the Fourier transform of the analyzed signal. At any given frequency, the width and the phase of the Gabor function are obtained, respectively, from the magnitude and the phase of the signal's corresponding Fourier component, yielding an analyzing kernel which is a representation of the signal's content at that particular frequency. The resulting Gabor transform tunes itself to the input signal, allowing the accurate detection of time and frequency events, even in situations where the traditional Gabor and S-transform approaches tend to fail. This is the case, for instance, when considering the time-frequency representation of electroencephalogram traces (EEG) of epileptic subjects, as illustrated by the experimental study presented here.

Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has recently been proposed as one of the mechanisms involved in organizing brain activity. Here we investigated the phase-to-amplitude CFC (PA-CFC) patterns of the oscillatory activity in the cortico-basal ganglia network of healthy, freely moving rats. Within-structure analysis detected consistent PA-CFC patterns in the four regions analyzed, with the phase of delta waves modulating the amplitude of activity in the gamma (low-gamma similar to 50 Hz; high-gamma similar to 80 Hz) and high frequency ranges (high frequency oscillations HFO, similar to 150 Hz). Between-structure analysis revealed that the phase of delta waves parses the occurrence of transient episodes of coherence in the gamma and high frequency bands across the entire network, providing temporal windows of coherence between different structures. Significantly, this specific spatio-temporal organization was affected by the action of dopaminergic drugs. Taken together, our findings suggest that delta-mediated PA-CFC plays a key role in the organization of local and distant activities in the rat cortico-basal ganglia network by fine-tuning the timing of synchronization events across different structures.

The aim of our study was to further elucidate the validity of pupillography by investigating the association of pupillometric variables with subjective sleepiness and waking electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Methods: The level of sleepiness of 24 young healthy adults was evaluated during 40 h of sustained wakefulness using pupillography and subjective ratings with the Stanford sleepiness scale and a visual analog scale (VAS). During the assessment of sleepiness by pupillography, waking EEG was simultaneously recorded and subjected to spectral analyses. As a pupillographic measure of sleepiness the pupillary unrest index (PUI) was calculated. Results: PUI, subjective sleepiness, and power in the delta, theta, alpha 1, beta 1, and beta 3 frequency band exhibited significant variations over time. PUI showed a prominent circadian modulation under high homeostatic sleep pressure. At time points of maximum PUI indicating a high level of sleepiness, significant increases were found in subjective sleepiness as well as in delta, theta, alpha 1, and beta 1 power. Moreover, PUI showed a significant, high intraindividual correlation with subjective sleepiness and with power in the delta, theta, and alpha 1 frequency band. Conclusion: The novel finding of a close association between pupillometric variables and distinct changes in waking EEG activity underscores the validity of pupillography as a time-and cost-efficient objective measure of sleepiness that could ease the diagnostic and therapeutic workup of patients who report excessive daytime sleepiness.

The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

Its main symptoms, epileptic seizures and drug-resistant myoclonus, may be associated with neurophysiological evidence of abnormal cortical excitability or reduced inhibition. The aim of the present study was to utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce cortical responses measured with electroencephalography (EEG) in order to observe prevailing cortical excitability/inhibition changes, as well as power and coherence of the cortical oscillations in EPM1. We studied 7 genetically verified EPM1 patients (4 female; age 36 +/- 6 years) and 6 healthy control subjects (1 female; age 34 +/- 12 years). Navigated TMS was focused on the left primary motor cortex at the representation area of the right thumb. TMS-EEG response's were measured at 90% of the resting motor threshold intensity in 110-150 trials. We observed that P30 waveform following the TMS was significantly (p<0.05) increased in EPM1 patients suggesting increased cortico-cortical excitability, while the later N100/P180 waveform was significantly (p<0.05) decreased indicating reduced inhibition. In the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), we found that alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations following the TMS were significantly lower in power in the EPM1 patients compared to controls. In the alpha and beta bands, the inter-trial coherence (ITC) representing the degree of synchronization was also decreased in EPM1. Our results suggest abnormal reactivity in EPM1, and may indicate impaired cortico-cortical inhibition and attenuation of subsequent cortical circuits or the thalamic or subcortical nuclei.

In this study the nociceptive activity in the brain evoked by tissue-damaging skin lance was analyzed with electroencephalography (EEG) in 20 healthy adult volunteers (13 men and 7 women) aged 21-40 yr. Time-frequency analysis of the evoked activity revealed a distinct late event-related vertex potential (lance event-related potential, LERP) at 100-300 ms consisting of a phase-locked energy increase between 1 and 20 Hz (delta-beta bands). A pairwise comparison between lance and sham control stimulation also revealed a period of ultralate stronger desynchronization after lance in the delta band (1-5 Hz). Skin application of mustard oil before lancing, which sensitizes a subpopulation of nociceptors expressing the cation channel TRPA1, did not affect the ultralate desynchronization but reduced the phase-locked energy increase in delta and beta bands, suggesting a central interaction between different modalities of nociceptive inputs. Verbal descriptor screening of individual pain experience revealed that lance pain is predominantly due to A delta fiber activation, but when individuals describe lances as C fiber mediated, an ultralate delta band event-related desynchronization occurs in the brain-evoked activity. We conclude that pain evoked by acute tissue damage is associated with distinct A delta and C fiber-mediated patterns of synchronization and desynchronization of EEG oscillations in the brain.

Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is associated with slowing of resting-state brain activity: a longitudinal study	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Cognitive decline; Dementia; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Oscillatory brain dynamics; Longitudinal	QUANTITATIVE EEG; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; PROGRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; DISORDER; INCIDENT	The pathophysiological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related dementia (PDD) are still poorly understood. Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated widespread slowing of oscillatory brain activity as a neurophysiological characteristic of PD-related dementia. Here, we use MEG to longitudinally study early changes in oscillatory brain activity in initially nondemented PD patients that may be associated with cognitive decline. Using a longitudinal design, resting-state MEG recordings were performed twice at an approximate 4-year interval in 14 healthy controls and 49 PD patients. Changes in peak frequency and in relative spectral power for 10 brain regions were analyzed in relation to clinical measures of cognitive and motor function. In contrast to healthy controls, PD patients showed a slowing of the dominant peak frequency. Furthermore, analysis per frequency band revealed an increase in theta power over time, along with decreases in alpha1 and alpha2 power. In PD patients, decreasing cognitive performance was associated with increases in delta and theta power, as well as decreases in alpha1, alpha2, and gamma power, whereas increasing motor impairment was associated with a theta power increase only. The present longitudinal study revealed widespread progressive slowing of oscillatory brain activity in initially nondemented PD patients, independent of aging effects. The slowing of oscillatory brain activity strongly correlated with cognitive decline and therefore holds promise as an early marker for the development of dementia in PD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Borrowing methods from neuroimaging, we aimed to simplify data analysis and increase consistency between reviewers by using 3D surface projections of intracranial EEG poweR (3D-SPIER). We analyzed 139 seizures from 48 intractable epilepsy patients (28 temporal and 20 extratemporal) who had icEEG recordings, epilepsy surgery, and at least one year of post-surgical follow-up. We coregistered and plotted icEEG 13 frequency band signal power over time onto MRI-based surface renderings for each patient to create color 3D-SPIER movies. Two independent reviewers interpreted the icEEG data using visual analysis vs. 3D-SPIER, blinded to any clinical information. Overall agreement rates between 3D-SPIER and icEEG visual analysis or surgery were about 90% for side of seizure onset, 80% for lobe, and just under 80% for sublobar localization. These agreement rates were improved when flexible thresholds or frequency ranges were allowed for 3D-SPIER, especially for sublobar localization. Interestingly, agreement was better for patients with good surgical outcome than for patients with poor outcome. Localization using 3D-SPIER was measurably faster and considered qualitatively easier to interpret than visual analysis. These findings suggest that 3D-SPIER could be an improved diagnostic method for presurgical seizure localization in patients with intractable epilepsy and may also be useful for mapping normal brain function.

J	Chik, D				Chik, David			Theta-alpha cross-frequency synchronization facilitates working memory control - a modeling study	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Working memory; Synchronization; Cross-frequency	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORK MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; CAPACITY; LIMITS; AREAS	Despite decades of research, the neural mechanism of central executive and working memory is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model for the real-time control of working memory. The key idea is to consider separately the role of neural activation from that of oscillatory phase. Neural populations encoding different information would not confuse each other when the populations have different oscillatory phases. Depending on the current situation, relevant memories bind together through phase-locking between theta-frequency oscillation of a Central Unit and alpha-frequency oscillations of the relevant group of Memory Units. The Central Unit dynamically controls which Memory Units should be synchronized (and the encoded memory would be processed), and which units should be out of phase (the encoded memory is standby and would not be processed yet). Simulations of two working memory tasks are provided as examples. The model is in agreement with many recent experimental results of human scalp EEG analysis, which reported observations of neural synchronization and cross-frequency coupling during working memory tasks. This model offers a possible explanation of the underlying mechanism for these experiments.

EEG characterization of audiogenic seizures in the hamster strain GASH:Sal	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Animal model of epilepsy; Radiotelemetry recordings; Video-EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; REFLEX MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ANIMAL-MODELS; RECORDING EEG; RAT STRAIN; PRONE RAT; SYSTEM; RADIOTELEMETRY; PREDISPOSITION	The study was performed to characterize GASH:SAL audiogenic seizures as true epileptic activity based on electroencephalographic markers acquired with a wireless implanted radiotelemetry system. We analyzed cortical EEG patterns synchronized with video recordings of convulsive behavior of the GASH:Sal hamster following an acoustic stimulus. All GASH:Sal presented archetypal motor symptoms comparable to current animal models of generalized tonic clonic epilepsy. Seizures consisted of an initial bout of wild running, followed by opisthotonus, tonic clonic convulsions, tonic limb extension, and terminated in postictal depression. EEG patterns correlated with behavior and displayed phase appropriate spike wave complexes, low-amplitude desynchronized activity, and high frequency large-amplitude peaks. Our results confirm that electroencephalographic profiles of the audiogenic seizures of the hamster GASH:Sal are parallel to EEG patterns of other animal models of generalized tonic clonic seizures. Therefore, this animal may serve as an appropriate model for epilepsy research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The application of anaesthetic agents shows significant effects on electroencephalograph (EEG) waveform. In this paper we firstly estimated the depth of anaesthesia using detrended fluctuation analysis and wavelet analysis in order to characterize the patient state. Detrended fluctuation analysis assessed and examined the scaling behaviour of EEG in order to assess scaling information & long range correlations in time series. This scaling behaviour exponent consists in performing a linear regression fit of a scale-dependent quantity versus the scale in a logarithmic representation. This includes the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). But in time domain, analysis of EEG is complex and time-frequency approach is needed. Therefore, Wavelet analysis, in particular, provides means of time-frequency localization of the information. Time resolution is improved which allows detection of the time of its occurrence. In Discrete wavelet transform, EEG signals were decomposed into sub-bands. A mathematical Probability density of each sub-band of each EEG segment was calculated according to number of wavelet coefficients in order to obtain uniformly time distributed atoms of energy across all the scales. This second method provides more robust results and can be applied to more general models.

Alpha Oscillations in Response to Affective and Cigarette-Related Stimuli in Smokers	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							SMOKING CUES; DRUG-ADDICTION; EEG CHANGES; NICOTINE; ABSTINENCE; REACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS	Introduction: The presence of cigarette-related cues has been associated with smoking relapse. These cues are believed to activate brain mechanisms underlying emotion, attention, and memory. Electroencephalography (EEG) alpha desynchronization (i.e., reduction in alpha power) has been suggested to index the engagement of these mechanisms. Analyzing EEG alpha desynchronization in response to affective and smoking cues might improve our understanding of how smokers process these cues, and the potential impact of this processing on relapse. Methods: Before the start of a medication-assisted cessation attempt, we recorded EEG from 179 smokers during the presentation of neutral, pleasant, unpleasant, and cigarette-related pictures. Wavelet analysis was used to extract EEG alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) in response to these pictures. Alpha oscillations were analyzed as a function of picture valence and arousal dimensions. Results: Emotional and cigarette-related stimuli induced a higher level of alpha desynchronization (i.e., less power in the alpha frequency band) than neutral stimuli. In addition, the level of alpha desynchronization induced by cigarette-related stimuli was similar to that induced by highly arousing stimuli (i.e., erotica and mutilations). Conclusions: These results suggest that, for smokers, cigarette-related cues are motivationally significant stimuli that may engage emotional, attentional, and memory-related neural mechanisms at a level comparable to that seen in response to highly arousing stimuli. This finding suggests that activation of emotional, attentional, and memory-related brain mechanisms may be an important contributor to cue-induced smoking relapse.

Prestimulus Oscillatory Phase at 7 Hz Gates Cortical Information Flow and Visual Perception	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; CONTOUR INTEGRATION; GLOBAL SHAPES; AREA V1; CORTEX; ATTENTION; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISM; FREQUENCY	Although we have the impression that visual information flows continuously from our sensory channels, recent studies indicate that this is likely not the case. Rather, we sample visual stimuli rhythmically, oscillating at 5-10 Hz [1-3]. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies have demonstrated that this rhythmicity is reflected by the phase of ongoing brain oscillations in the same frequency [4-6]. Theoretically, brain oscillations could underlie the rhythmic nature of perception by providing transient time windows for information exchange [7], but this question has not yet been systematically addressed. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while human participants performed a contour integration task and show that ongoing brain oscillations prior to stimulus onset predict functional connectivity between higher and lower level visual processing regions. Specifically, our results demonstrate that the phase of a 7 Hz oscillation prior to stimulus onset predicts perceptual performance and the bidirectional information flow between the left lateral occipital cortex and right intraparietal sulcus, as indicated by psychophysiological interaction and dynamic causal modeling. These findings suggest that human brain oscillations periodically gate visual perception at around 7 Hz by providing transient time windows for long-distance cortical information transfer. Such gating might be a general mechanism underlying the rhythmic nature of human perception.

Together with clinical and neuroimaging data, presurgical ictal scalp-EEG findings are often sufficient to define the epileptogenic zone. It is widely believed that ictal scalp-EEG findings in temporal lobe epilepsy are represented by 5-9-Hz lateralised rhythmic theta activity or 2-5-Hz lateralised rhythmic delta activity. On the basis of experimental models and experience with intra-cerebral EEG recordings, the pattern of low-voltage fast activity is considered to be the electrophysiological hallmark of the epileptogenic zone. We reviewed the ictal scalp-EEG data relating to 111 seizures in 47 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent video-EEG recordings during presurgical work-up. We found that 35 patients (74.4%) showed flattening, low-voltage fast activity or fast activity as the initial EEG pattern. When visible, the rhythmic delta or theta activity followed the fast activity. Low-voltage fast activity, flattening or fast activity occurs in the majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and represents the main ictal EEG pattern. Low-voltage fast activity (or similar) is also identifiable as the initial ictal EEG pattern in scalp-EEG recordings.

Despite considerable knowledge about the mechanisms underlying these neuronal rhythms, their function remains poorly understood and current views are largely based on correlational evidence. Here, we review recent studies in humans and rodents that have begun to broaden our understanding of the role of spindles in the normal and disordered brain. We show that newly identified molecular substrates of spindle oscillations, in combination with evolving technological progress, offer novel targets and tools to selectively manipulate spindles and dissect their role in sleep-dependent processes.

Frequency selectivity is commonly investigated using an auditory filter model, while frequency specificity is often investigated as neural adaptation of the N1 response in electroencephalography (EEG). However, the effects of aging on frequency-specific adaptation, and the link between peripheral frequency selectivity and neural frequency specificity have not received much attention. Here, normal hearing younger (20-31 years) and older participants (49-63 years) underwent a psychophysical notched noise experiment to estimate individual auditory filters, and an EEG experiment to investigate frequency-specific adaptation in auditory cortex. The shape of auditory filters was comparable between age groups, and thus shows intact frequency selectivity in normal aging. In auditory cortex, both groups showed N1 frequency-specific neural adaptation effects that similarly varied with the spectral variance in the stimulation, while N1 responses were overall larger for older than younger participants. Importantly, the overall N1 amplitude, but not frequency-specific neural adaptation was correlated with the pass-band of the auditory filter. Thus, the current findings show a dissociation of peripheral frequency selectivity and neural frequency specificity, but suggest that widened auditory filters are compensated for by a response gain in frequency-specific areas of auditory cortex.

Dominant frequencies of resting human brain activity as measured by the electrocorticogram	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electrocorticogram; Oscillations; Resting state; Theta; Alpha; Beta	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; NETWORK; RHYTHMS; MODEL; SYNCHRONIZATION	The brain's spontaneous, intrinsic activity is increasingly being shown to reveal brain function, delineate large scale brain networks, and diagnose brain disorders. One of the most studied and clinically utilized types of intrinsic brain activity are oscillations in the electrocorticogram (ECoG), a relatively localized measure of cortical synaptic activity. Here we objectively characterize the types of ECoG oscillations commonly observed over particular cortical areas when an individual is awake and immobile with eyes closed, using a surface-based cortical atlas and cluster analysis. Both methods show that [1] there is generally substantial variability in the dominant frequencies of cortical regions and substantial overlap in dominant frequencies across the areas sampled (primarily lateral central, temporal, and frontal areas), [2] theta (4-8 Hz) is the most dominant type of oscillation in the areas sampled with a mode around 7 Hz, [3] alpha (8-13 Hz) is largely limited to parietal and occipital regions, and [4] beta (13-30 Hz) is prominent peri-Rolandically, over the middle frontal gyrus, and the pars opercularis. In addition, the cluster analysis revealed seven types of ECoG spectral power densities (SPDs). Six of these have peaks at 3, 5, 7 (narrow), 7 (broad), 10, and 17 Hz, while the remaining cluster is broadly distributed with less pronounced peaks at 8, 19, and 42 Hz. These categories largely corroborate conventional sub-gamma frequency band distinctions (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) and suggest multiple sub-types of theta. Finally, we note that gamma/high gamma activity (30 + Hz) was at times prominently observed, but was too infrequent and variable across individuals to be reliably characterized. These results should help identify abnormal patterns of ECoG oscillations, inform the interpretation of EEG/MEG intrinsic activity, and provide insight into the functions of these different oscillations and the networks that produce them. Specifically, our results support theories of the importance of theta oscillations in general cortical function, suggest that alpha activity is primarily related to sensory processing/attention, and demonstrate that beta networks extend far beyond primary sensorimotor regions.

That's why it is important to measure and analyze their brain activity. In this study, we tried to investigate the brain response to hearing subject's own name of healthy people and one patient with SMID by analyzing EEG. The results of time frequency analysis showed the inter trial coherence of a patient with SMID at theta oscillation was higher in response to SON specifically. On the other hand, that of healthy subjects was not so different with that in response to control condition. These results might reflect of the difference of lexical semantic process between the patient and healthy subjects.

Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier for 'Petit Mal' Epilepsy Detection using Mean Teager Energy	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATICS (ICACCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	AUG 22-25, 2013	Sri Jayachamarajendra Coll Engn, Mysore, INDIA	IEEE Commun Soc, IEEE, InderSci, ISCA, INNS India Reg Chapter, ICACCI, Hochschule Offenburg Univ Appl Sci, Res Publishing	Sri Jayachamarajendra Coll Engn	Electroencephalography; Epileptic seizures; Petit Mal; Mean Teager Energy; Wavelet decomposition; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier	EEG	An epileptic seizure is an abnormal harmonious neural activity in the brain characterized by the presence of spikes in the electroencephalographic patterns. Petit Mal is a common form of epilepsy (a neurological disorder resulting in recurrent seizures) in children. An automated detection of Petit Mal seizures assists the neurologists in effective diagnosis, thereby enabling proper on-time treatment of epileptic patients. The seizures were mainly detected previously using time-frequency analysis and artificial neural networks. The proposed approach utilizes the abnormality found in the EEG of a Petit Mal patient to create an efficient detection system involving five-level wavelet decomposition based features and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system as the classifier. Mean Teager Energy is the only feature used in the proposed method. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed work does not suffer from large noise and sensitivity, thus giving an accuracy of 100% and run-time delay of less than 30 seconds for 100 epochs. This is a tremendous improvement over other methods.

We used an asymmetric index of in-phase synchronization to analyze hyperbrain networks of directed functional connectivity in the alpha and beta frequency ranges for time segments around coordinated play onsets. After exploring the small-world characteristics of the networks at different thresholds, we examined the directed connection strengths within and between brains. As predicted, we found evidence suggesting that the musical roles of leader and follower are associated with different patterns of directed between-brain couplings. The functional significance of these differences for IAC requires further study.

Category-Specific Neural Oscillations Predict Recall Organization During Memory Search	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						category clustering; episodic memory; free recall; neural integration; pattern classification	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL CONTEXT; FMRI DATA; EEG; REPRESENTATION; HUMANS	Retrieved-context models of human memory propose that as material is studied, retrieval cues are constructed that allow one to target particular aspects of past experience. We examined the neural predictions of these models by using electrocorticographic/ depth recordings and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize category-specific oscillatory activity, while participants studied and recalled items from distinct, neurally discriminable categories. During study, these category-specific patterns predict whether a studied item will be recalled. In the scalp EEG experiment, category-specific activity during study also predicts whether a given item will be recalled adjacent to other same-category items, consistent with the proposal that a category-specific retrieval cue is used to guide memory search. Retrieved-context models suggest that integrative neural circuitry is involved in the construction and maintenance of the retrieval cue. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe category-specific patterns that rise in strength as multiple same-category items are studied sequentially, and find that individual differences in this category-specific neural integration during study predict the degree to which a participant will use category information to organize memory search. Finally, we track the deployment of this retrieval cue during memory search: Category-specific patterns are stronger when participants organize their responses according to the category of the studied material.

We intended to investigate the generative mechanisms of HFOs in CSWS by clarifying the effects of intravenous injection (IV) of diazepam (DZP), an agonist for the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor in the GABAergic interneuron system, in patients who had previously been treated with IV DZP. The subjects were three patients with epilepsy with CSWS. For each patient, EEG data before and after IV DZP were separated into consecutive 5-min sections. Time frequency power spectral analysis was performed on the spikes of each section, and peak-power and frequency of detected high-frequency spectral spots were compared before and after IV DZP. Spectral spots with peak-frequencies at 85.9-121.1 Hz in the ripple band were revealed in all three patients. Although the amplitudes of the spikes largely returned to the baseline levels 20-25 min after IV DZP, the recovery of the peak-power levels of HFOs lagged behind that of the spike amplitudes, and the power levels of HFOs were lower than the baseline data within 25 min after the injection of DZP. No consistent changes were found regarding the spectral frequencies of HFOs. The dissociation of the effect of IV DZP in terms of recovery when comparing spike-amplitudes and the power of HFOs may correspond to an already suggested difference in the pathophysiological mechanisms that generate the spikes and HFOs.

There is increasing evidence that the perturbation with an abnormal increase of spontaneous thalamocortical neural oscillations lead to a phenomenon termed Thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) which underlies the symptomatology of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, tinnitus, major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that has been shown to both induce a modulation of neural oscillations and alleviate a wide range of human neuropsychiatric pathologies. However, little is known about the precise electrophysiological mechanisms behind the therapeutic effect of rTMS and its potential to improve abnormal oscillations across diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we show, using combined rTMS and surface electroencephalography (EEG), a short lasting frequency-dependent rTMS after-effect on thalamocortical rhythmic interplay of low-frequency oscillations in healthy humans at rest. In particular, high-frequency rTMS (10 Hz) induces a transient synchronised activity for delta (5) and theta (0) rhythms thus mimicking the pathological TCD-like oscillations. In contrast rTMS 1 and 5 Hz have the opposite outcome of de-synchronising low-frequency brain rhythms. These results lead to a new neurophysiological insight of basic mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders and a probable electrophysiological mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of rTMS. Thus, we propose the use of rTMS and EEG as a platform to test possible treatments of TCD phenotypes by restoring proper neural oscillations across various neuropsychiatric disorders.

[Subjects and Methods] The participants were 30 healthy university students, who were randomly and equally divided into two groups, the experimental and control groups. They were treated using the Happy-sleep device or a sham device, respectively. All participants had a one-week training period. Before and after training sessions, a behavioral task test was performed and EEG alpha waves were measured to confirm the effectiveness of training on cognitive function. [Results] In terms of the behavioral task test, reaction time (RT) variations in the experimental group were significantly larger than in the control group for the attention item. Changes in the EEG alpha power in the experimental group were also significantly larger than those of the control group. [Conclusions] These findings suggest that sleep induced using the Happy-sleep device modestly enhances the ability to pay attention and focus during academic learning.

J	Sedley, W; Cunningham, MO				Sedley, William; Cunningham, Mark O.			Do cortical gamma oscillations promote or suppress perception? An under-asked question with an over-assumed answer	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						gamma oscillations; magnetoencephalography; electroencephalography; perception; inhibition; tinnitus; epilepsy	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SPIKING ACTIVITY; HEARING-LOSS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULUS SELECTION	Cortical gamma oscillations occur alongside perceptual processes, and in proportion to perceptual salience. They have a number of properties that make them ideal candidates to explain perception, including incorporating synchronized discharges of neural assemblies, and their emergence over a fast timescale consistent with that of perception. These observations have led to widespread assumptions that gamma oscillations' role is to cause or facilitate conscious perception (i.e., a "positive" role). While the majority of the human literature on gamma oscillations is consistent with this interpretation, many or most of these studies could equally be interpreted as showing a suppressive or inhibitory (i.e., "negative") role. For example, presenting a stimulus and recording a response of increased gamma oscillations would only suggest a role for gamma oscillations in the representation of that stimulus, and would not specify what that role were; if gamma oscillations were inhibitory, then they would become selectively activated in response to the stimulus they acted to inhibit. In this review, we consider two classes of gamma oscillations: "broadband" and "narrowband," which have very different properties (and likely roles). We first discuss studies on gamma oscillations that are nondiscriminatory, with respect to the role of gamma oscillations, followed by studies that specifically support specifically a positive or negative role. These include work on perception in healthy individuals, and in the pathological contexts of phantom perception and epilepsy. Reference is based as much as possible on magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, but we also consider evidence from invasive recordings in humans and other animals. Attempts are made to reconcile findings within a common framework. We conclude with a summary of the pertinent questions that remain unanswered, and suggest how future studies might address these.

An IC-PLS Framework for Group Corticomuscular Coupling Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Corticomuscular coupling; data fusion; electroencephalography (EEG); electromyography (EMG); group analysis; independent component analysis (ICA); Parkinson's disease (PD); partial least squares (PLS)	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; TASK; COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA	Corticomuscular coupling analysis, i.e., examining the relations between simultaneously recorded brain (e. g., electroencephalography-EEG) and muscle (e. g., electromyography-EMG) signals, is a useful tool for understanding aspects of human motor control. Traditionally, the most popular method to assess corticomuscular coupling has been the pairwise magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant EMG recordings. In this paper, we propose assessing corticomuscular coupling by combining partial least squares (PLS) and independent component analysis (ICA), which addresses many of the limitations of MSC, such as difficulty in robustly assessing group inference and relying on the biologically implausible assumption of pairwise interaction between brain and muscle recordings. In the proposed framework, response relevance and statistical independence are jointly incorporated into a multiobjective optimization function to meaningfully combine the goals of PLS and ICA under the same mathematical umbrella. Simulations, performed under realistic assumptions, illustrated the utility of such an approach. The method was extended to address intersubject variability to robustly discover common corticomuscular coupling patterns across subjects. We then applied the proposed framework to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results from applying the proposed technique revealed temporal components in the EEG and EMG that were significantly correlated with one another. In addition to the expected motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation patterns demonstrated enhanced occipital connectivity in PD subjects, consistent with previous studies suggesting that PD subjects rely excessively on visual information to counteract the deficiency in being able to generate internal commands from their affected basal ganglia.

We first revisit the heuristic model proposed in Kilner et al. (2005), which suggests that fMRI activation is associated with a frequency modulation of the EEG signal (rather than an amplitude modulation within frequency bands). We propose a quantitative derivation of the underlying idea, based upon a neural field formulation of cortical activity. In brief, dense lateral connections induce a separation of time scales, whereby fast (and high spatial frequency) modes are enslaved by slow (low spatial frequency) modes. This slaving effect is such that the frequency spectrum of fast modes (which dominate EEG signals) is controlled by the amplitude of slow modes (which dominate fMRI signals). We then use conjoint empirical EEG-fMRI data-acquired in epilepsy patients-to demonstrate the electrophysiological underpinning of neural fluctuations inferred from sDCM for fMRI.

This activity appears in resting, eyes-closed condition and is typically suppressed by eyes-opening. Other physiological rhythms in the alpha band, in particular the Rolandic mu rhythm, are proposed to include a fast component in the beta range. In this study we used spatial filtering techniques and permutation analysis to explore cortical source-power changes related to the magnetoencephalography (MEG) counterpart of the posterior alpha rhythm. We also aimed at determining a possible implication of components outside the alpha frequency range in the posterior rhythm reactivity to eye closure. We recorded resting brain activity using a whole-head MEG system in fifteen normal subjects. We applied an eyes-open/eyes-closed paradigm. A significant increase in alpha oscillations after eyes closing, representing the posterior alpha rhythm, was observed bilaterally in the occipital and parietal cortex, including the calcarine fissure and the parieto-occipital sulcus. We also found significant increase in beta (15-30 Hz) and low gamma (30-60 Hz) oscillations. This fast components and the classical alpha rhythm had similar topographic distribution in posterior brain regions, although with different strength and spatial extension. These features were highest for alpha synchronized oscillations, intermediate for beta, and lowest for gamma activity. These results suggest that, like the Rolandic mu rhythm, the MEG posterior dominant rhythm may be impure, with a mixture of predominant alpha oscillations and high-frequency components.

Musical training has structural and functional effects on the brain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate neural mechanisms during music listening and imaging in musicians and non-musicians. METHODS: Spontaneous brain activity was measured in 6 musicians and 5 non-musicians while listening to 2 pieces of classical music (Symphony No. 9 in E minor [From the New World] by Antonin Dvorak; "Dies Irae" from Requiem in D minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (2.5 min each) and imaging both pieces (1 min each). Electroencephalography was performed using a 60-channel electrode cap. Morlet wavelet time-frequency analysis was performed and root mean square was calculated for each frequency band. RESULTS: During music listening, gamma activity (30 to 50 Hz) was significantly decreased in all regions, especially the prefrontal cortex. During music imaging, gamma activity was significantly decreased in the entire brain in musicians, but was increased in the frontal lobe in non-musicians. CONCLUSIONS: Musicians have significantly lower frontal gamma activity during music listening and music imaging than resting state, possibly due to a trained ability to integrate implicit memory from acoustic memory and direct inner consciousness toward self-reference and attention. Music influences human cognition and emotion, and plasticity associated with musical training may be measured.

Existing knowledge originates primarily from lesion studies and increasingly from hemodynamic measures such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with some evidence in recent years from transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this context, we revisit the few existing records of intracranial recordings from the human cerebellum, and uncover additional little-known reports - three from the Soviet Union, published in Russian between 1949 and 1951, and one from Belgium, published in French in 1964. These studies together demonstrate electrical rhythms of the human cerebellar cortex at frequencies as high as 250 Hz, including task-related modulations. A reanalysis of their electrode traces with state-of-the-art spectral analysis techniques confirm the reported frequency bands, and showed that these modulations were sustained for 100-200 ms. These remarkable observations from the early ages of intracranial mapping of the human brain are in line with recent electrophysiological studies of oscillations in the rodent cerebellum as well as magnetoencephalographic findings in humans. Time-frequency analyses have provided valuable insight into the function of cerebral cortex, and may prove even more critical for the differing neurophysiology of the cerebellum. We contend that these insights will be invaluable to bridge the role of oscillatory networks in the cerebellum with those of cerebral cortex in mediating perception, action, and cognition and to investigate possible cerebellar involvement in neurological dysfunction.

The non-stop road from concrete to abstract: high concreteness causes the activation of long-range networks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						theta; beta; gamma; EEG frequency; long-range coherence; language; concreteness; embodiment	EEG COHERENCE; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR SYSTEM; CONTEXT-AVAILABILITY; SEMANTIC VIOLATION; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA	Current grounding theories propose that sensory-motor brain systems are not only modulated by the comprehension of concrete but also partly of abstract language. In order to investigate whether concrete or abstract language elicits similar or distinct brain activity, neuronal synchronization patterns were investigated by means of long-range EEG coherence analysis. Participants performed a semantic judgment task with concrete and abstract sentences. EEG coherence between distant electrodes was analyzed in various frequencies before and during sentence processing using a bivariate AR-model with time-varying parameters. The theta frequency band (3-7Hz) reflected common and different synchronization networks related to working memory processes and memory-related lexico-semantic retrieval during processing of both sentence types. In contrast, the beta 1 band (13-18 Hz) showed prominent differences between both sentence types, whereby concrete sentences were associated with higher coherence implicating a more widespread range and intensity of mental simulation processes. The gamma band (35-40 Hz) reflected the sentences' congruency and indicated the more difficult integration of incongruent final nouns into the sentence context. Most importantly, findings support the notion that different cognitive operations during sentence processing are associated with multiple brain oscillations.

The proposed EEG-based BCI system allows users to express their binary intentions without a need to open their eyes. A pair of glasses with two LEDs flickering at different frequencies was used to present visual stimuli to participants with their eyes closed. Through offline experiments performed with 11 participants, we confirmed that human SSVEP could be modulated by visual selective attention to a specific light stimulus penetrating through the eyelids. After customizing the parameters of the proposed paradigm based on the offline analysis results, binary intentions of five participants were classified in real time. The average ITR of our online experiments reached 10.83 bits/min, demonstrating the feasibility of our BCI paradigm.

Methods: We propose a novel construction of an optimal Gabor dictionary, based upon the metrics introduced in this paper. We implement this construction in a freely available software for MP decomposition of multivariate time series, with a user friendly interface via the Svarog package (Signal Viewer, Analyzer and Recorder On GPL, http://braintech.pl/svarog), and provide a hands-on introduction to its application to EEG. Finally, we describe numerical and mathematical optimizations used in this implementation. Results: Optimal Gabor dictionaries, based on the metric introduced in this paper, for the first time allowed for a priori assessment of maximum one-step error of the MP algorithm. Variants of multivariate MP, implemented in the accompanying software, are organized according to the mathematical properties of the algorithms, relevant in the light of EEG/MEG analysis. Some of these variants have been successfully applied to both multichannel and multitrial EEG and MEG in previous studies, improving preprocessing for EEG/MEG inverse solutions and parameterization of evoked potentials in single trials; we mention also ongoing work and possible novel applications. Conclusions: Mathematical results presented in this paper improve our understanding of the basics of the MP algorithm. Simple introduction of its properties and advantages, together with the accompanying stable and user-friendly Open Source software package, pave the way for a widespread and reproducible analysis of multivariate EEG and MEG time series and novel applications, while retaining a high degree of compatibility with the traditional, visual analysis of EEG.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals intrinsic networks whose BOLD signals have periods from 100 s (0.01 Hz) to about 10 s (0.1 Hz). Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, in contrast, commonly reflect cortical electrical fluctuations with periods up to 20 ms (50 Hz) or above. We examined the correspondence between intrinsic fMRI and EEG network activity at rest in order to characterize brain networks both spatially (with fMRI) and spectrally (with EEG). Brain networks were separately identified within the concurrently recorded fMRI and EEG at the aggregate group level with group independent component analysis and the association between spatial fMRI and frequency by spatial EEG sources was examined by deconvolving their component time courses. The two modalities are considered linked if the estimated impulse response function (IRF) is significantly non-zero at biologically plausible delays. We found that negative associations were primarily present within two of five alpha components, which highlights the importance of considering multiple alpha sources in EEG-fMRI. Positive associations were primarily present within the lower (e.g. delta and theta) and higher (e.g. upper beta and lower gamma) spectral regions, sometimes within the same fMRI components. Collectively, the results demonstrate a promising approach to characterize brain networks spatially and spectrally, and reveal that positive and negative associations appear within partially distinct regions of the EEG spectrum.

Therefore, we developed a source based Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) with an online detection of gamma band activity in a selective brain region in the visual cortex. The BCI incorporates modules for online detection of various artifacts (including microsaccades) and the artifacts were continuously fed back to the volunteer. We examined the efficiency of the source-based BCI for Neurofeedback training of gamma-and alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations and compared the specificity for the spatial and frequency domain. Our results demonstrated that volunteers learned to selectively switch between modulating alpha-or gamma-band oscillations and benefited from online artifact information. The analyses revealed a high level of accuracy with respect to frequency and topography for the gamma-band modulations. Thus, the developed BCI can be used to manipulate the fast oscillatory activity with a high level of specificity. These selective modulations can be used to assess the relevance of fast neural oscillations for information processing in a more direct way, i.e., by the adaptive presentation of stimuli within well-described brain states.

The EEG signals though are useful but due to a large variety of data in them, may look random in nature. We have to extract the proper information from the data by computational modelling of scalp EEG signals. The chaos theory helps in analysing the neurobiological parameters which include Lyapunov Exponent, Approximate Entropy and Hurst Exponent. The frequency filtering of the data helps us in calculation of parameters for different frequency range. It is found that the different classes of data can be catalogued by computing parameters in a specific range of frequencies. As the different frequency band represents different states of mind so the value of parameter for subjects of same classes exhibit same pattern and can be easily distinguished from the other class of benign subjects. Moreover the data is testified by the values of Hurst Exponent for auto correlation.

Unfortunately, high-frequency neural activity overlaps entirely with the spectral bandwidth of muscle activity (similar to 20-300 Hz). It is becoming appreciated that artifacts of muscle activity may contaminate a number of non-invasive reports of high-frequency activity. In this review, the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of muscle artifacts are compared with those described (so far) for high-frequency neural activity. In addition, several of the techniques that are being developed to help suppress muscle artifacts in MEG/EEG are reviewed. Suggestions are made for the collection, analysis, and presentation of experimental data with the aim of reducing the number of publications in the future that may contain muscle artifacts.

However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time- and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERD/ERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis. Our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a and BCI Competition II dataset IV clearly presented the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming other competing methods in the literature.

J	Hsu, YF; Hamalainen, JA; Waszak, F				Hsu, Yi-Fang; Hamalainen, Jarmo A.; Waszak, Florian			Temporal expectation and spectral expectation operate in distinct fashion on neuronal populations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Temporal expectation; Spectral expectation; EEG; ERPs; Low-frequency neuronal oscillations	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; N1 WAVE; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; TIME; ORGANIZATION; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS; AUDITION	The formation of temporal expectation (i.e., the prediction of "when") is of prime importance to sensory processing. It can modulate sensory processing at early processing stages probably via the entrainment of low-frequency neuronal oscillations in the brain. However, sensory predictions involve not only temporal expectation but also spectral expectation (i.e., the prediction of "what"). Here we investigated how temporal expectation may interrelate with spectral expectation by explicitly setting up temporal expectation and spectral expectation in a target detection task. We found that reaction time (RT) was shorter when targets were temporally expected than when they were temporally unexpected. The temporal expectation effect was larger with than without spectral expectation. However, this interaction in the behavioural data did not result from an interaction in the electroencephalography (EEG), where we observed independent main effects of temporal expectation and spectral expectation. More precisely, we found that the N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components and the entrainment of low-frequency neuronal oscillations were exclusively modulated by temporal expectation, whilst only the P3 ERP component was modulated by spectral expectation. Our results, thus, support the idea that temporal expectation and spectral expectation operate in distinct fashion on neuronal populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Altered resting state EEG in chronic pancreatitis patients: toward a marker for chronic pain	JOURNAL OF PAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						chronic pain; neuropathic pain; chronic pancreatitis; electroencephalography; EEG; alpha oscillations; peak frequency	NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FREQUENCY; POWER; CLASSIFICATION; ORIGIN; ALPHA	Objectives: Electroencephalography (EEG) may be a promising source of physiological biomarkers accompanying chronic pain. Several studies in patients with chronic neuropathic pain have reported alterations in central pain processing, manifested as slowed EEG rhythmicity and increased EEG power in the brain's resting state. We aimed to investigate novel potential markers of chronic pain in the resting state EEG of patients with chronic pancreatitis. Participants: Resting state EEG data from 16 patients with persistent abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis (CP) were compared to data from healthy controls matched for age, sex and education. Methods: The peak alpha frequency (PAF) and power amplitude in the alpha band (7.5-13 Hz) were compared between groups in four regions of interest (frontal, central, parietal, and occipital) and were correlated with pain duration. Results: The average PAF was lowered in CP patients compared with that in healthy controls, observed as a statistically significant between-group effect (mean 9.9 versus 9.5 Hz; P=0.049). Exploratory post hoc analysis of average PAF per region of interest revealed a significant difference, particularly in the parietal and occipital regions. In addition, we observed a significant correlation between pain duration and PAF and showed increased shifts in PAF with longer pain durations. No significant group differences were found in peak power amplitudes. Conclusion: CP pain is associated with alterations in spontaneous brain activity, observed as a shift toward lower PAF. This shift correlates with the duration of pain, which demonstrates that PAF has the potential to be a clinically feasible biomarker for chronic pain. These findings could be helpful for assisting diagnosis, establishing optimal treatment, and studying efficacy of new therapeutic agents in chronic pain patients.

Left parietal alpha enhancement during working memory-intensive sentence processing	CORTEX			English	Article						Alpha oscillations; Argument-verb dependency; Sentence processing; Source localization; Verbal working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FILLER-GAP DEPENDENCIES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SYNTACTIC INTEGRATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; TRACE POSITIONS; BROCAS AREA; COMPREHENSION; CORTEX; ERP	Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related brain potential (ERP) studies have shown that verbal working memory plays an important role during sentence processing. There is growing evidence from outside of sentence processing that human alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz) play a critical role in working memory. This study aims to link this to the sentence processing domain. Time-frequency analyses and source localization were performed on electroencephalography (EEG) data that were recorded during the processing of auditorily presented sentences involving either a short or a long distance between an argument (subject or object) and the respective sentence-final verb. We reasoned that oscillatory activity in the alpha band should increase during sentences with longer argument-verb distances, since decreased temporal proximity should result in increased memory demands. When verbal working memory-intensive long-dependency sentences were compared to short-dependency sentences, a sustained oscillatory enhancement at 10 Hz was found during storage prior to the sentence-final verb, turning into a transient power increase in the beta band (13-20 Hz) at the sentence-final verb. The sources of the alpha oscillations were localized to bilaterally occipital and left parietal cortices. Only the source activity in the left parietal cortex was negatively correlated with verbal working memory abilities. These findings indicate that the parsimonious role of alpha oscillations in domain-general working memory can be extended to language, that is, sentence processing. We suggest that the function of left parietal cortex underlying verbal working memory storage during sentence processing is to inhibit the premature release of verbal information that will subsequently be integrated.

The influence of emotion on reasoning has gained a lot of attention in computer science. One approach to incorporating emotions into computers is by extracting features from various physiological signals and inferring the corresponding emotions or emotional dimensions. However, physiological processes are dynamic rather than static, and physiological signals mainly interact with each other during emotional processes rather than act individually. This study suggests that dynamical interdependencies of various signals that emanate from either the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system might be involved in the emotional experience. Specifically, EEG (electroencephalography) signals captured from the temporal lobe are coupled with a narrow-band skin conductance response (SCR) while subjects are watching music clips, indicating that signals from the auditory cortex interact with SCR during this experience.

However, fewer studies have focused on examining whether or not the frontal alpha or posterior theta can play a role in the working memory task. This study investigates electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics and connectivity among different brain regions' theta and alpha oscillations. The EEG was collected from undergraduate students (n = 64) while they were performing a Sternberg-like working memory task involving chemistry concepts. The results showed that the frontal midline cluster exhibited sustained theta augmentation across the periods of stimulus presentations, maintenance, and probe presentation, suggesting that the frontal midline theta might associate with facilitating the central execute function to maintain information in the working memory. Study of the central parietal and the occipital clusters revealed a sequence of theta augmentation followed by alpha suppression at constant intervals after the onset of stimulus and probe presentations, suggesting that the posterior theta might be associated with sensory processing, theta gating, or stimulus selection. It further suggests that the posterior alpha event-related de-synchronization (ERD) might be linked to direct information flow into and out of the long-term memory (LTM) and precede stimulus recognition. An alternating phasic alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) and ERD following the 1st stimulus and probe presentations were observed at the occipital cluster, in which alpha ERS might be linked to the inhibition of irrelevant information.

Loss of balance during balance beam walking elicits a multifocal theta band electrocortical response	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; source analysis; neural control; gait; independent component analysis	CENTER-OF-MASS; TREADMILL WALKING; POSTURAL CONTROL; CORTICAL CONTROL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OLDER-ADULTS; EEG; DYNAMICS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	Determining the neural correlates of loss of balance during walking could lead to improved clinical assessment and treatment for individuals predisposed to falls. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) combined with independent component analysis (ICA) to study loss of balance during human walking. We examined 26 healthy young subjects performing heel-to-toe walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam as well as walking on the treadmill belt (both at 0.22 m/s). ICA identified clusters of electrocortical EEG sources located in or near anterior cingulate, anterior parietal, superior dorsolateral-prefrontal, and medial sensorimotor cortex that exhibited significantly larger mean spectral power in the theta band (4-7 Hz) during walking on the balance beam compared with treadmill walking. Left and right sensorimotor cortex clusters produced significantly less power in the beta band (12-30 Hz) during walking on the balance beam compared with treadmill walking. For each source cluster, we also computed a normalized mean time/frequency spectrogram time locked to the gait cycle during loss of balance (i.e., when subjects stepped off the balance beam). All clusters except the medial sensorimotor cluster exhibited a transient increase in theta band power during loss of balance. Cluster spectrograms demonstrated that the first electrocortical indication of impending loss of balance occurred in the left sensorimotor cortex at the transition from single support to double support prior to stepping off the beam. These findings provide new insight into the neural correlates of walking balance control and could aid future studies on elderly individuals and others with balance impairments.

J	Henry, MJ; Obleser, J				Henry, Molly J.; Obleser, Jonas			Dissociable Neural Response Signatures for Slow Amplitude and Frequency Modulation in Human Auditory Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; SPEECH-INTELLIGIBILITY; PHASE; TONES; DISCRIMINATION; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS; STIMULI; MEG; AM	Natural auditory stimuli are characterized by slow fluctuations in amplitude and frequency. However, the degree to which the neural responses to slow amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) are capable of conveying independent time-varying information, particularly with respect to speech communication, is unclear. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, participants listened to amplitude- and frequency-modulated narrow-band noises with a 3-Hz modulation rate, and the resulting neural responses were compared. Spectral analyses revealed similar spectral amplitude peaks for AM and FM at the stimulation frequency (3 Hz), but amplitude at the second harmonic frequency (6 Hz) was much higher for FM than for AM. Moreover, the phase delay of neural responses with respect to the full-band stimulus envelope was shorter for FM than for AM. Finally, the critical analysis involved classification of single trials as being in response to either AM or FM based on either phase or amplitude information. Time-varying phase, but not amplitude, was sufficient to accurately classify AM and FM stimuli based on single-trial neural responses. Taken together, the current results support the dissociable nature of cortical signatures of slow AM and FM. These cortical signatures potentially provide an efficient means to dissect simultaneously communicated slow temporal and spectral information in acoustic communication signals.

Abnormal task modulation of oscillatory neural activity in schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; oscillations; alpha; beta; AX-CPT; cognitive; motor preparation	CONTEXT-PROCESSING DEFICITS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CHANGING PLANS; MOTOR SYSTEMS	Schizophrenia patients have deficits in cognitive function that are a core feature of the disorder. AX-CPT is commonly used to study cognition in schizophrenia, and patients have characteristic pattern of behavioral and ERP response. In AX-CPT subjects respond when a flashed cue "A" is followed by a target "X," ignoring other letter combinations. Patients show reduced hit rate to "go" trials, and increased false alarms to sequences that require inhibition of a prepotent response. EEG recordings show reduced sensory (P1/N1), as well as later cognitive components (N2, P3, CNV). Behavioral deficits correlate most strongly with sensory dysfunction. Oscillatory analyses provide critical information regarding sensory/cognitive processing over and above standard ERP analyses. Recent analyses of induced oscillatory activity in single trials during AX-CPT in healthy volunteers showed characteristic response patterns in theta, alpha, and beta frequencies tied to specific sensory and cognitive processes. Alpha and beta modulated during the trials and beta modulation over the frontal cortex correlated with reaction time. In this study, EEG data was obtained from 18 schizophrenia patients and 13 controls during AX-CPT performance, and single trial decomposition of the signal yielded power in the target wavelengths. Significant task-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed in both alpha and beta frequency bands over parieto-occipital cortex related to sensory encoding of the cue. This modulation was reduced in patients for beta, but not for alpha. In addition, significant beta ERD was observed over motor cortex, related to motor preparation for the response, and was also reduced in patients. These findings demonstrate impaired dynamic modulation of beta frequency rhythms in schizophrenia, and suggest that failures of oscillatory activity may underlie impaired sensory information processing in schizophrenia that in turn contributes to cognitive deficits.

Distinguishing mechanisms of gamma frequency oscillations in human current source signals using a computational model of a laminar neocortical network	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gamma oscillations; pyramidal interneuronal gamma; laminar neocortex; computational neuroscience; magnetoencephalography (MEG); electroencephalography (EEG)	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL RHYTHMS; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; BAND ACTIVITY; INHIBITORY NEURONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES	Gamma frequency rhythms have been implicated in numerous studies for their role in healthy and abnormal brain function. The frequency band has been described to encompass as broad a range as 30-150 Hz. Crucial to understanding the role of gamma in brain function is an identification of the underlying neural mechanisms, which is particularly difficult in the absence of invasive recordings in macroscopic human signals such as those from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Here, we studied features of current dipole (CD) signals from two distinct mechanisms of gamma generation, using a computational model of a laminar cortical circuit designed specifically to simulate CDs in a biophysically principled manner (Jones et al., 2007, 2009). We simulated spiking pyramidal interneuronal gamma (PING) whose period is regulated by the decay time constant of GABA(A)-mediated synaptic inhibition and also subthreshold gamma driven by gamma-periodic exogenous excitatory synaptic drive. Our model predicts distinguishable CD features created by spiking PING compared to subthreshold driven gamma that can help to disambiguate mechanisms of gamma oscillations in human signals. We found that gamma rhythms in neocortical layer 5 can obscure a simultaneous, independent gamma in layer 2/3. Further, we arrived at a novel interpretation of the origin of high gamma frequency rhythms (100-150 Hz), showing that they emerged from a specific temporal feature of CDs associated with single cycles of PING activity and did not reflect a separate rhythmic process. Last we show that the emergence of observable subthreshold gamma required highly coherent exogenous drive. Our results are the first to demonstrate features of gamma oscillations in human current source signals that distinguish cellular and circuit level mechanisms of these rhythms and may help to guide understanding of their functional role.

Delta BROs have been linked with continuous gathering of information from the surrounding environment, which is classically attributed to the precuneus. Furthermore, fMRI studies have shown that precuneal activity is reduced or missing when consciousness is low or absent. We therefore hypothesized that the source of delta BROs in healthy subjects could be located in the precuneus and that delta BROs could be absent or reduced in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). To test these hypotheses, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at rest was recorded in 12 healthy controls and nine patients with DOC (four vegetative states, and five minimally conscious states). Three-second-lasting EEG epochs centred on each blink instance were analyzed in both time- (BROs) and frequency domains (event-related spectral perturbation or ERSP and intertrial coherence or ITC). Cortical sources of the maximum blink-related delta power, corresponding to the positive peak of the delta BROs, were estimated by standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography. In control subjects, as expected, the source of delta BROs was located in the precuneus, whereas in DOC patients, delta BROs were not recognizable and no precuneal localization was possible. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between spectral indexes and levels of cognitive functioning in all subjects participating in the study. This reinforces the hypothesis that delta BROs reflect neural processes linked with awareness of the self and of the environment. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2178-2189, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time-and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERDIERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis. Our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a clearly presented the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming other competing methods in the literature.

J	Staudigl, T; Hanslmayr, S				Staudigl, Tobias; Hanslmayr, Simon			Theta Oscillations at Encoding Mediate the Context-Dependent Nature of Human Episodic Memory	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIITEM WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL; EEG; RETRIEVAL; POWER; CA1	Human episodic memory is highly context dependent. Therefore, retrieval benefits when a memory is recalled in the same context compared to a different context [1, 2]. This implies that items and contexts are bound together during encoding, such that the reinstatement of the initial context at test improves retrieval. Animal studies suggest that theta oscillations and theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling modulate such item-context binding [3], but direct evidence from humans is scarce. We investigated this issue by manipulating the overlap of contextual features between encoding and retrieval. Participants studied words superimposed on movie clips and were later tested by presenting the word with either the same or a different movie. The results show that memory performance and the oscillatory correlates of memory formation crucially depend on the overlap of the context between encoding and test. When the context matched, high theta power during encoding was related to successful recognition, whereas the opposite pattern emerged in the context-mismatch condition. In addition, cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed a context-dependent theta-to-gamma memory effect specifically in the left hippocampus. These results reveal for the first time that context-dependent episodic memory effects are mediated by theta oscillatory activity.

Sequential Selection of Window Length for Improved SSVEP-Based BCI Classification	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			COMPUTER; SYSTEMS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) utilizing steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) have exciting potential to enable new systems for disabled individuals and novel controls for robotic and computer systems. To interact with SSVEP-based BCIs, users attend to visual stimuli modulated at predetermined frequencies. A key problem for SSVEP-based BCIs is to classify which modulation frequency the user is attending, for which there is an inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy. As SSVEP signals vary with time and stimulation frequency, a fixed-length data window does not necessarily optimize this trade-off. We propose a strategy, developed from sequential analysis, to vary the window-length used for classification. Our proposed technique adapts to the data, continuing to collect data until it is confident enough to make a classification decision. Our strategy was compared to a fixed window-length method using a simple experiment involving five frequencies presented individually to three participants. Using a canonical correlation analysis classifier to compare the proposed variable-length scheme to a standard fixed-length scheme, the variable-length approach improved the classifier information transfer rate by an average of 43%.

Oscillatory Underpinnings of Mismatch Negativity and Their Relationship with Cognitive Function in Patients with Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; GENERATION; KETAMINE; DURATION; DELTA; SCALE	Background: Impairments in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail. Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia. Method: 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN. Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking (PL) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering. A comprehensive battery (CANTAB) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning. Results: Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (95% CI 0.18 - 0.77). Patients showed significantly lower EEG power (95% CI -1.02 - -0.014) in the similar to 4-7 Hz frequency range (theta band) between 170 and 210 ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB. However, MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures, medication dose, social functioning or neurocognitive performance. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes, it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes. Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery.

The system must similarly recognize if the movement is executed or imagined. The EEG signals are recordings of the electrical activity of the brain and are subdivided into frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Mu, and Theta). The interest waves alpha, beta and mu reflect the cerebral activation due to real or imagined movement. These signals vary in time and frequency hindered their identification and classification. With the help of the literature, statistical analysis, wavelet analysis and classification tests were selected 8 EEG channels to use. The wavelet transformed (WT) was applied to the signal to extract time and frequency characteristics. The approximation coefficients of WT were integrated as vectors to system classification inputs. These vectors are composed of different decomposition levels for some channels depending of the wave (alpha, betha, mu). In the classification we used a multilayer perceptron neural network. Finally we identified four movements (real and imagined) of the arms of a healthy person: right hand back and forth, left hand back and forth. The accuracy obtained was 88.72% for 4 movements and 82.71% for 5 movements with the leg movement as the 5th class.

Such patterns in the brain signals can be associated with coordinated neural oscillations, which can be modeled by non-linear systems. Further, these patterns can be quantified through dynamical non-stationarity based on detection of qualitative changes in the state of the systems underlying the observed brain signals. This study explored age-related changes in dynamical non-stationarity of the brain signals recorded at rest, longitudinally with 128-channel EEG during early adolescence (10 to 13 years of age, 56 participants). Dynamical non-stationarity was analyzed based on segmentation of the time series with subsequent grouping of the segments into clusters with similar dynamics. Age-related changes in dynamical non-stationarity were described in terms of the number of stationary states and the duration of the stationary segments. We found that the EEG signal became more non-stationary with age. Specifically, the number of states increased whereas the mean duration of the stationary segment decreased with age. These two effects had global and parieto-occipital distribution, respectively, with the later effect being most dominant in the alpha (around 10 Hz) frequency band.

Time-frequency Techniques in Biomedical Signal Analysis A Tutorial Review of Similarities and Differences	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Review						Gabor transform; Morlet wavelet transform; Wigner-Ville distribution; matching pursuit; Hilbert-Huang transform	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WIGNER DISTRIBUTION; EEG; TRANSFORMATION; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATICS; COUPLINGS; AMPLITUDE; SPECTRUM; TOOL	Objectives: This review outlines the methodological fundamentals of the most frequently used non-parametric time-frequency analysis techniques in biomedicine and their main properties, as well as providing decision aids concerning their applications. Methods: The short-term Fourier transform (SIFT), the Gabor transform (GT), the S-transform (ST), the continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMWT), and the Hilbert transform (HT) are introduced as linear transforms by using a unified concept of the time-frequency representation which is based on a standardized analytic signal. The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) serves as an example of the 'quadratic transforms' class. The combination of WVD and GT with the matching pursuit (MP) decomposition and that of the HT with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are explained; these belong to the class of signal-adaptive approaches. Results: Similarities between linear transforms are demonstrated and differences with regard to the time-frequency resolution and interference (cross) terms are presented in detail. By means of simulated signals the effects of different time-frequency resolutions of the GT, CMWT, and WVD as well as the resolution-related properties of the interference (cross) terms are shown. The method-inherent drawbacks and their consequences for the application of the time-frequency techniques are demonstrated by instantaneous amplitude, frequency and phase measures and related time-frequency representations (spectrogram, scalogram, time-frequency distribution, phase-locking maps) of measured magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Conclusions: The appropriate selection of a method and its parameter settings will ensure readability of the time-frequency representations and reliability of results. When the, time-frequency characteristics of a signal strongly correspond with the time-frequency resolution of the analysis then a method may be considered 'optimal'. The MP-based signal-adaptive approaches are preferred as these provide an appropriate time-frequency resolution for all frequencies while simultaneously reducing interference (cross) terms.

Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of Human EEG: Preliminary Investigation and Comparison with the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima Technique	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURONAL AVALANCHES; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-STATE; SLEEP-APNEA; SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; SERIES	Recently, many lines of investigation in neuroscience and statistical physics have converged to raise the hypothesis that the underlying pattern of neuronal activation which results in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is nonlinear, with self-affine dynamics, while scalp-recorded EEG signals themselves are nonstationary. Therefore, traditional methods of EEG analysis may miss many properties inherent in such signals. Similarly, fractal analysis of EEG signals has shown scaling behaviors that may not be consistent with pure monofractal processes. In this study, we hypothesized that scalp-recorded human EEG signals may be better modeled as an underlying multifractal process. We utilized the Physionet online database, a publicly available database of human EEG signals as a standardized reference database for this study. Herein, we report the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis on human EEG signals derived from waking and different sleep stages, and show evidence that supports the use of multifractal methods. Next, we compare multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to a previously published multifractal technique, wavelet transform modulus maxima, using EEG signals from waking and sleep, and demonstrate that multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis has lower indices of variability. Finally, we report a preliminary investigation into the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis as a pattern classification technique on human EEG signals from waking and different sleep stages, and demonstrate its potential utility for automatic classification of different states of consciousness. Therefore, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis may be a useful pattern classification technique to distinguish among different states of brain function.

Although aging is known to affect sensory processing, its impact on the top-down control of attention remains a matter of debate. We investigated age-related modulations of brain oscillatory activity during visual attention using a variant of the attention network test (ANT) in 20 young and 28 elderly adults. We examined the EEG oscillatory responses to warning and target signals, and explored the correlates of temporal and spatial orienting as well as conflict resolution at target presentation. Time-frequency analysis was performed between 4 and 30 Hz, and the relationship between behavioral and brain oscillatory responses was analyzed. Whereas temporal cueing and conflict had similar reaction time effects in both age groups, spatial cueing was more beneficial to older than younger subjects. In the absence of cue, posterior alpha activation was drastically reduced in older adults, pointing to an age-related decline in anticipatory attention. Following both cues and targets, older adults displayed pronounced motor-related activation in the low beta frequency range at the expense of attention-related posterior alpha activation prominent in younger adults. These findings support the recruitment of alternative motor-related circuits in the elderly, in line with the dedifferentiation hypothesis. Furthermore, older adults showed reduced midparietal alpha inhibition induced by temporal orienting as well as decreased posterior alpha activation associated with both spatial orienting and conflict resolution. Altogether, the results are consistent with an overall reduction of task-related alpha activity in the elderly, and provide functional evidence that younger and older adults engage distinct brain circuits at different oscillatory frequencies during attentional functions.

HIRREM (TM): a noninvasive, allostatic methodology for relaxation and auto-calibration of neural oscillations	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Allostasis; auto-calibration; biofeedback; electroencephalography; hemispheric asymmetry; HIRREM; insomnia; neural oscillation; relaxation; stochastic resonance	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EEG COMPLEXITY; STRESS; BRAIN; ASYMMETRY; DYNAMICS; DISORDER; DISEASE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY	Disturbances of neural oscillation patterns have been reported with many disease states. We introduce methodology for HIRREM (TM) (high-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring), also known as Brainwave Optimization (TM), a noninvasive technology to facilitate relaxation and auto-calibration of neural oscillations. HIRREM is a precision-guided technology for allostatic therapeutics, intended to help the brain calibrate its own functional set points to optimize fitness. HIRREM technology collects electroencephalic data through two-channel recordings and delivers a series of audible musical tones in near real time. Choices of tone pitch and timing are made by mathematical algorithms, principally informed by the dominant frequency in successive instants of time, to permit resonance between neural oscillatory frequencies and the musical tones. Relaxation of neural oscillations through HIRREM appears to permit auto-calibration toward greater hemispheric symmetry and more optimized proportionation of regional spectral power. To illustrate an application of HIRREM, we present data from a randomized clinical trial of HIRREM as an intervention for insomnia (n = 19). On average, there was reduction of right-dominant temporal lobe high-frequency (23-36 Hz) EEG asymmetry over the course of eight successive HIRREM sessions. There was a trend for correlation between reduction of right temporal lobe dominance and magnitude of insomnia symptom reduction. Disturbances of neural oscillation have implications for both neuropsychiatric health and downstream peripheral (somatic) physiology. The possibility of noninvasive optimization for neural oscillatory set points through HIRREM suggests potentially multitudinous roles for this technology. Research is currently ongoing to further explore its potential applications and mechanisms of action.

The P3 has been linked to attention and memory brain functions. Methods: In 24 schizophrenia patients and 28 control subjects, wavelet transform was used to reveal event-related modulations of the EEG signal during target trials in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Results: Patients showed reductions in P3 amplitude accompanied by reduced low frequency delta-theta and increased beta-gamma band EEG activity. Conclusions: These results indicate abnormalities in the synchronization and/or efficiency of neural processes involved in memory and attention networks in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous simultaneous EEG/fMRI findings in healthy controls suggest that a consistent spatiotemporal coupling between neural oscillations (EEG frequency correlates) and RSN activity is necessary to organize cognitive processes optimally. We hypothesized that this coupling is disorganized in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, in particular regarding higher cognitive RSNs such as the default-mode (DMN) and left-working-memory network (LWMN). Methods: Resting state was investigated in eleven patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 11) and matched healthy controls (n = 11) using simultaneous EEG/fMRI. The temporal association of each RSN to topographic spectral changes in the EEG was assessed by creating Covariance Maps. Group differences within, and group similarities across frequencies were estimated for the Covariance Maps. Results: The coupling of EEG frequency bands to the DMN and the LWMN respectively, displayed significant similarities that were shifted towards lower EEG frequencies in patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: By combining EEG and fMRI, each measuring different properties of the same pathophysiology, an aberrant relationship between EEG frequencies and altered RSNs was observed in patients. RSNs of patients were related to lower EEG frequencies, indicating functional alterations of the spatiotemporal coupling. Significance: The finding of a deviant and shifted coupling between RSNs and related EEG frequencies in patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is significant, as it might indicate how failures in the processing of internal and external stimuli, as commonly seen during this symptomatology (i.e. thought disorders, hallucinations), arise.

This study aims at determining whether different manifestations of load-dependent amplitude and phase dynamics in the alpha band can coexist over different cortical regions. To address this question, we increased information load by manipulating the number and spatial configuration of domino spots. Time-frequency analysis of EEG source activity revealed (i) load-independent increases of both alpha power and interregional alpha-phase synchrony within task-irrelevant, posterior cortical regions and (ii) load-dependent decreases of alpha power over areas of the left pFC and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) preceded in time by load-dependent decreases of alpha-phase synchrony between the left pFC and the left PPC. The former results support the role of alpha oscillations in inhibiting irrelevant sensorimotor processing, whereas the latter likely reflect release of parietal task-relevant areas from top-down inhibition with load increase. This interpretation found further support in a significant latency shift of 15 msec from pFC to the PPC. Together, these results suggest that amplitude and phase alpha dynamics in both local and long-range cortical networks reflect different neural mechanisms of top-down control that might be crucial in mediating the different working memory processes.

It was found that the activity of deep cerebral structures in boys suffering from neurosis-like stammering is probably excessively intense, since the normalized number of significant- and high-level coherence relations between low-frequency EEG oscillations (delta waves) in these boys exceeded the analogous indices in healthy preschool children. In boys with stammering, we also found certain specificity of the pattern of coherent relations of theta oscillations and greater coherence of oscillations in symmetrical loci of the left and right hemispheres.

While increased gamma power and synchronization is generally observed during cognitive tasks performed during wake, several studies have additionally reported increased gamma power during sleep or anesthesia, raising questions about the characteristics of gamma oscillation during impaired consciousness and its role in conscious processing. Phase-amplitude modulation has been observed between slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4 Hz) and gamma oscillations during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia or sleep, showing increased gamma activity corresponding to the depolarized (ON) state of SWA. Here we divided gamma activity into its ON and OFF (hyperpolarized) state components based on the phase of SWA induced by ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and compared their power and synchrony with wake state levels in mice. We further investigated the state-dependent changes in both gamma power and synchrony across primary motor and primary somatosensory cortical regions and their interconnected thalamic regions throughout anesthesia and recovery. As observed previously, gamma power was as high as during wake specifically during the ON state of SWA. However, the synchrony of this gamma activity between somatosensory-motor cortical regions was significantly reduced compared to the baseline wake state. In addition, the somatosensory-motor cortical synchrony of gamma oscillations was reduced and restored in an anesthetic state-dependent manner, reflecting the changing depth of anesthesia. Our results provide evidence that during anesthesia changes in long-range information integration between cortical regions might be more critical for changes in consciousness than changes in local gamma oscillatory power.

While a gross somatotopic layout has been revealed also for neuronal oscillations responding to sensorimotor stimulation of distant body parts (e.g. hand vs. foot), it is still unclear whether these oscillatory dynamics exhibit fine spatial layout comparable to those found in evoked responses. In twelve healthy subjects we applied electric stimuli to the first (D1) and fifth finger (D5) of the same hand while performing high-density electroencephalography. We used Common Spatial Pattern analysis to optimally extract components showing the strongest Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in neuronal alpha oscillations. In agreement with the previous studies, dipole locations of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) confirmed the existence of spatially distinct representations of each finger. In contrast, dipole locations of alpha-ERD patterns did not yield spatially different source locations, indicating that the stimulation of different fingers most likely resulted in oscillatory activity of overlapping neuronal populations. When both fingers were stimulated simultaneously the SEP dipole strength was found increased in comparison to a stimulation of either finger alone, in agreement with spatially distinct SEP to finger stimulation. The strength of ERD, on the other hand, was the same regardless of whether either one or both fingers were stimulated. Our findings might reflect anatomical constraints on the sequential temporal activation of fingers' skin where almost simultaneous activation of many fingers usually occurs in everyday activities, such as grasping or holding objects. Such simultaneity is unlikely to benefit from slow amplitude modulation of alpha oscillations, which would rather be beneficial for contrasting somatosensory processing of distinct body parts.

For the last 4 min, a three-stimulus auditory oddball series was presented during both meditation and control periods through headphones and no task imposed. Time-frequency analysis demonstrated that meditation relative to the control condition evinced decreased evoked delta (2-4 Hz) power to distracter stimuli concomitantly with a greater event-related reduction of late (500-900 ms) alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) activity, which indexed altered dynamics of attentional engagement to distracters. Additionally, standard stimuli were associated with increased early event-related alpha phase synchrony (inter-trial coherence) and evoked theta (4-8 Hz) phase synchrony, suggesting enhanced processing of the habituated standard background stimuli. Finally, during meditation, there was a greater differential early-evoked gamma power to the different stimulus classes. Correlation analysis indicated that this effect stemmed from a meditation state-related increase in early distracter-evoked gamma power and phase synchrony specific to longer-term expert practitioners. The findings suggest that Vipassana meditation evokes a brain state of enhanced perceptual clarity and decreased automated reactivity.	[Cahn, B.

The aim of our study was to estimate the accuracy of source localization of rhythmic ictal EEG activity using a distributed source model. MethodsSource localization of rhythmic ictal scalp EEG activity was performed in 42 consecutive cases fulfilling inclusion criteria. The study was designed according to recommendations for studies on diagnostic accuracy (STARD). The initial ictal EEG signals were selected using a standardized method, based on frequency analysis and voltage distribution of the ictal activity. A distributed source modellocal autoregressive average (LAURA)was used for the source localization. Sensitivity, specificity, and measurement of agreement (kappa) were determined based on the reference standardthe consensus conclusion of the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery team. Predictive values were calculated from the surgical outcome of the operated patients. To estimate the clinical value of the ictal source analysis, we compared the likelihood ratios of concordant and discordant results. Source localization was performed blinded to the clinical data, and before the surgical decision. Key FindingsReference standard was available for 33 patients. The ictal source localization had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 76%. The mean measurement of agreement (kappa) was 0.61, corresponding to substantial agreement (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.84). Twenty patients underwent resective surgery. The positive predictive value (PPV) for seizure freedom was 92% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 43%. The likelihood ratio was nine times higher for the concordant results, as compared with the discordant ones. SignificanceSource localization of rhythmic ictal activity using a distributed source model (LAURA) for the ictal EEG signals selected with a standardized method is feasible in clinical practice and has a good diagnostic accuracy. Our findings encourage clinical neurophysiologists assessing ictal EEGs to include this method in their armamentarium.

Theta Power During Encoding Predicts Subsequent-Memory Performance and Default Mode Network Deactivation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; memory; theta; default mode network	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG DYNAMICS; ACTIVATION; FMRI; RETRIEVAL; TASK	The subsequent memory paradigm, according to which cerebral activity for later remembered (LR) and later forgotten (LF) items is contrasted, can be used to characterize the processes necessary for successful memory encoding. Previous simultaneous electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) memory studies suggest an inverse relationship between frontal theta band power and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in the default mode network (DMN). The principal aim of this EEG/fMRI study was to test the hypothesis that this putative theta-DMN relationship is less evident in LF compared with LR trials. Fourteen healthy participants performed an episodic memory task in which pictorial stimuli were presented during encoding, and categorized (as LR or LF) by subsequent memory performance. For each encoding trial, the mean of the Hilbert envelope of the theta signal from 400 to 800 ms after stimulus presentation was calculated. To integrate the EEG and fMRI data, general linear models (GLMs) were used to assess the extent to which these single-trial theta values (as modulators of the main effect of stimulus) predicted DMN BOLD signal change, using: (i) whole-head univariate GLMs and (ii) GLMs in which the outcome variable was the time-course of a DMN component derived from spatial independent component analysis of the fMRI data. Theta was significantly greater for LR than LF stimuli. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between theta and BOLD in the DMN was consistently stronger for LR than LF pictures. These findings imply that theta oscillations are key to attenuating processes which may otherwise impair memory encoding. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2929-2943, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

When neurons are activated, the synaptic currents are produced within the dendrites. This current produces the magnetic field giving rise to mapping of cortical activity measurable by magneto-encephalography (MEG) machines and a secondary electrical field over the scalp measurable by EEG systems. Mastery and expertise in clinical EEG interpretation is one of the most desirable diagnostic clinical skills in interpreting seizures, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other neurocognitive studies. In most cases EEG activity is described in terms of frequency, amplitude, distribution or location, symmetry, synchrony, reactivity, morphology, rhythmicity and regulation. The dynamic nature of epileptic phenomena causes EEG signals to exhibit stochastic and non-stationary behavior. The time frequency distributions are potentially very useful for detecting and analyzing non-stationary epileptic EEGs. Although visual analysis of raw EEG traces is still the major clinical tool and the point of reference for other methods, we can relate visual analysis to mathematics with a time-frequency description. The EEG signal analysis is often complemented with MEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to correlate specific EEG findings with pathology of the brain and selectively demonstrate the diagnosis of certain neuronal disease processes, and assessment parameters. This diagnostic tool is in no way to be taken as a final word to replace physician's clinical consultation and opinion, rather it is intended to be an early monitoring and warning tool which will aid in diagnosis of certain aspects of critical care and emergency medicine. This interactive teaching module will be highly beneficial since it will facilitate progressive learning of students by enhancing their understanding of clinical EEG parameters and their relationship with differential diagnosis of the patients.

We recorded cortical activity in 17 dyslexic participants and 15 matched controls using simultaneous EEG and fMRI during passive viewing of an audiovisual movie. We compared the distribution of brain oscillations in the delta, theta and gamma ranges over left and right auditory cortices. In controls, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a dominance of gamma oscillations in the left hemisphere and a dominance of delta-theta oscillations in the right hemisphere. In dyslexics, we did not find such an interaction, but similar oscillations in both hemispheres. Thus, our results confirm that the primary cortical disruption in dyslexia lies in a lack of hemispheric specialization for gamma oscillations, which might disrupt the representation of or the access to phonemic units.

This paper describes a novel method, adaptive filtering without using an extra channel, for elimination of blink from EEG. The artifact reference is extracted from blink-contaminated EEG by EMD approach. The proposed method is compared to a fourth order Butterworth high pass filtering with cutoff frequency at 2 Hz.

The information of interest is located in well defined frequency bands, and a number of standard frequency estimation algorithms have been used for feature extraction. To deal with data nonstationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and closely spaced frequency bands of interest, we investigate the effectiveness of recently introduced multivariate extensions of empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) in motor imagery BCI. We show that direct multi-channel processing via MEMD allows for enhanced localization of the frequency information in EEG, and, in particular, its noise-assisted mode of operation (NA-MEMD) provides a highly localized time-frequency representation. Comparative analysis with other state of the art methods on both synthetic benchmark examples and a well established BCI motor imagery dataset support the analysis.

In neurophysiology, different analytical tools stemming from these concepts have added to the 'traditional' set of linear methods, which includes the cross-correlation and the coherency function in the time and frequency domain, respectively, or more elaborated tools such as Granger Causality. This increase in the number of approaches to tackle the existence of functional (FC) or effective connectivity (EC) between two (or among many) neural networks, along with the mathematical complexity of the corresponding time series analysis tools, makes it desirable to arrange them into a unified-easy-to-use software package. The goal is to allow neuroscientists, neurophysiologists and researchers from related fields to easily access and make use of these analysis methods from a single integrated toolbox. Here we present HERMES (http://hermes.ctb.upm.es), a toolbox for the MatlabA (R) environment (The Mathworks, Inc), which is designed to study functional and effective brain connectivity from neurophysiological data such as multivariate EEG and/or MEG records. It includes also visualization tools and statistical methods to address the problem of multiple comparisons. We believe that this toolbox will be very helpful to all the researchers working in the emerging field of brain connectivity analysis.

Proof of concept evaluation of the electroencephalophone as a discriminator between wakefulness and general anaesthesia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						consciousness monitors; electroencephalography; monitoring; intraoperative	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; INDEX; DEPTH; OSCILLATIONS; INDUCTION; AWARENESS; SIGNAL; STATE; EEG	Depth of anaesthesia (DOA) monitors based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) are commonly used in anaesthetic practice. Their technology relies on mathematical analysis of the EEG waveform, generally resulting in a number which corresponds to anaesthetic depth. We have created a novel method of interpreting the EEG, which retains its underlying complexity. This method consists of turning the EEG into a sound: the electroencephalophone (EEP). In a pilot study, we recorded awake and anaesthetized EEGs from six patients. We transformed each EEG into an audio signal using a ring buffer with a write frequency of 1 kHz and a read frequency of 48 kHz, thus elevating all output frequencies by a factor of 48. In essence, the listener hears the previous 12 s of EEG data compressed into 250 ms, updated every 250 ms. From these data, we generated a bank of 5 s audio clips, which were then used to train and test a sample of 23 anaesthetists. After training, 21 of the 23 anaesthetists were able to use the EEP to correctly identify the conscious state of 5 of 10 randomly selected patients (P0.001). The median score was 8 out of 10, with an inter-quartile range of 79. The EEP shows promise as a DOA monitor. However, extensive validation would be required in a variety of clinical settings before it could be accepted into mainstream clinical practice.

To provide further evidence of the relationship of EEG signal and depression, we reported a pilot result based on the resting EEG. By recording the resting EEG signals in the three groups of normal control, unmedicated depressed patients and medicated depressed patients, after the analysis of fast fourier transform (FFT) to change time base signal into frequency information, we found that signals in many frequency bands of brain waves were related to the value of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), especially in the Beta frequency band and in the frontal area in the unmedicated depressed group. Furthermore, we also found that comparing to the normal controls, the unmedicated depressed patients showed a stronger asymmetry in many frequency bands both in the frontal and parietal regions, which meant that the EEG signals were weaker in the left brain than in the right in the unmedicated depressed group.

Many studies have pursued the idea that there are recognizable electrographic (EEG-based) features which occur before overt clinical seizure activity. However, development of reliable EEG-based seizure detection and prediction algorithms has been difficult. In this review, we discuss the concepts of seizure detection vs. prediction and the pre-ictal "clinical milieu" and "EEG milieu". We proceed to discuss novel concepts of seizure detection based on the pre-ictal "physiological milieu"; in particular, we indicate some early evidence for the hypothesis that pre-ictal cell swelling/extracellular space constriction can be detected with novel optical methods. Development and validation of optical seizure detection technology could provide an entirely new translational approach for the many patients with intractable epilepsy.

In this paper, we propose modeling corticomuscular activity by combining partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The proposed method takes advantage of both PLS and CCA to ensure that the extracted components are maximally correlated across two data sets and meanwhile can well explain the information within each data set. This complementary combination generalizes the statistical assumptions beyond both PLS and CCA methods. Simulations were performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. We also applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results reveal several highly correlated temporal patterns between EEG and EMG signals and indicate meaningful corresponding spatial activation patterns. In PD subjects, enhanced connections between occipital region and other regions are noted, which is consistent with previous medical knowledge. The proposed framework is a promising technique for performing multisubject and bimodal data analysis.	[Chen, Xun; Liu, Aiping; Wang, Z.

Consistent with this notion, detection probability of near-threshold somatosensory, visual, and auditory targets has been reported to co-vary with the phase of oscillations in the EEG. In audition, entrainment of delta-oscillations to the periodic occurrence of sounds has been suggested to function as a mechanism of attentional selection. Here, we examine in humans whether the detection of brief near-threshold sounds in quiet depends on the phase of EEG oscillations. When stimuli were presented at irregular intervals, we did not find a systematic relationship between detection probability and phase. When stimuli were presented at regular intervals (2-s), reaction times were significantly shorter and we observed phase entrainment of EEG oscillations corresponding to the frequency of stimulus presentation (0.5 Hz), revealing an adjustment of the system to the regular stimulation. The amplitude of the entrained oscillation was higher for hits than for misses, suggesting a link between entrainment and stimulus detection. However, detection was independent of phase at frequencies >= 1 Hz. Furthermore, we show that when the data are analyzed using acausal, though common, algorithms, an apparent "entrainment" of the delta-phase to presented stimuli emerges and detection probability appears to depend on delta-phase, similar to reports in the literature. We show that these effects are artifacts from phase distortion at stimulus onset by contamination with the event-related potential, which differs markedly for hits and misses. This highlights the need to carefully deal with this common problem, since otherwise it might bias and mislead this exciting field of research.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oxytocin (OT) on local field potentials (LFPs) in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injected with rotenone (3 mu g/mu l in DMSO) into the left substantia nigra pars compacta whereas vehicle group was received only DMSO. PD-developed rats were then administered either OT (160 mu g/kg/day, i.p.) or saline for three weeks. Following treatment period, LFPs were recorded from the left striatum of freely moving rats and neuronal cell loss was evaluated by Nissl staining. We found significant increase in all frequency bands except delta in saline group when compared with vehicle (p <0.0005), while treatment of OT prevented these alterations in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Besides, histopathological evaluation of the striatal sections revealed a significant cell loss (p <0.005), whereas administration of rats with OT significantly lessened the neuronal death. These findings suggest that injury of dopaminergic neurons triggers exaggerated neuronal oscillations in the striatum and oxytocin may have some inhibitory effects on neuronal activity in PD.

Here we investigated whether modifications in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) are associated with cognitive function of AD patients. Methods: High-density electroencephalograms (EEGs) were obtained from patients with early stages of AD and elderly healthy controls. Cortical oscillations were reconstructed with an adaptive spatial filter. Maps of imaginary coherence (IC) between brain areas were compared between groups and correlated with cognitive performance. Results: Parietal and medial temporal lobes of AD patients showed a disruption of alpha band FC to the rest of the brain. However, an adaptive extension of the language network to the right hemisphere could be observed in AD patients and was correlated with better verbal fluency. A shift of FC from alpha frequencies to theta frequencies could be observed in a memory network and was associated with better verbal memory performance.

In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n?=?17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n?=?26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30?min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30?min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

A useful approach is to analyze the brain electroencephalogram (EEG) for differences in brain frequency bands in the signals obtained from potentially injured and healthy normal subjects. However, significant shortcomings include: (1) contrary to empirical evidence, current spectral signal analysis based methods often assume that the EEG signal is linear and stationary; (2) nonlinear time series analysis methods are mostly numerical and do not possess any predictive features. In this work, we develop models based on stochastic differential equations that can output signals with similar frequency and magnitude characteristics of the brain EEG. Initially, a coupled linear oscillator model with a large number of degrees of freedom is developed and shown to capture the characteristics of the EEG signal in the major brain frequency bands. Then, a nonlinear stochastic model based on the Duffing oscillator with far fewer degrees of freedom is developed and shown to produce outputs that can closely match the EEG signal. It is shown that such a compact nonlinear model can provide better insight into EEG dynamics through only few parameters, which is a step towards developing a framework with predictive capabilities for addressing brain injuries.

Ethosuximide Reduces Ethanol WithdrawalMediated Disruptions in Sleep-Related EEG Patterns	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Ethanol Withdrawal; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Seizure; T-Type Calcium Channels	THALAMOCORTICAL-THETA COHERENCE; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; DRUG ETHOSUXIMIDE; ANIMAL-MODEL; ALCOHOL; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; POWER; RAT; MODULATION	Background Chronic ethanol (EtOH) leads to disruptions in resting electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and in sleep patterns that can persist into the withdrawal period. These disruptions have been suggested to be predictors of relapse. The thalamus is a key structure involved in both normal brain oscillations, such as sleep-related oscillations, and abnormal rhythms found in disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Previously, we have shown progressive changes in mouse thalamic T-type Ca2+ channels during chronic intermittent EtOH exposures that occurred in parallel with alterations in theta (4 to 8Hz) EEG patterns. Methods Two groups of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were implanted with wireless EEG/electromyogram (EMG) telemetry and subjected to 4weeks of chronic, intermittent EtOH vapor exposure and withdrawal. During the week after the final withdrawal, mice were administered ethosuximide (ETX; 200mg/kg) or saline. EEG data were analyzed via discrete Fourier transform, and sleep-scored for further analysis. Results Chronic intermittent EtOH exposure produced changes in the diurnal rhythms of the delta (0.5 to 4Hz) and theta bands that persisted into a subsequent week of sustained withdrawal. These disruptions were restored with the T-channel blocker ETX. Repeated EtOH exposures preferentially increased the relative proportion of lower frequency power (delta and theta), whereas higher frequencies (8 to 24Hz) were decreased. The EtOH-induced decreases in relative power for the higher frequencies continued into the sustained withdrawal week for both groups. Increases in absolute delta and theta power were observed in averaged nonrapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep spectral data during withdrawal in ETX-treated animals, suggesting increased sleep intensity. Conclusions These results suggest that persistent alterations in delta and theta EEG rhythms during withdrawal from chronic intermittent EtOH exposure can be ameliorated with ETX and that this treatment might also increase sleep intensity during withdrawal.

Many studies have demonstrated that the complexity of EEG can reflect the states of brain function, so we propose to adopt order recurrence quantification analysis combined with discrete wavelet transform, to analyze the dynamical characteristics of different EEG rhythms under acupuncture, further to explore the effects of MA on the complexity of brain activities from multi-scale point of view. By analyzing the complexity of five EEG rhythms, it is found that the complexity of delta rhythm during acupuncture is lower than before acupuncture, and for alpha rhythm that is higher, but for beta, theta and gamma rhythms there are no obvious changes. All of those effects are especially obvious during acupuncture with frequency of 200 times/min. Furthermore, the determinism extracted from delta, alpha and gamma rhythms can be regarded as a characteristic parameter to distinguish the state acupuncture at 200 times/min and the state before acupuncture. These results can provide a theoretical support for selecting appropriate acupuncture frequency for patients in clinical, and the proposed methods have the potential of exploring the effects of acupuncture on brain activities.

Detection of Seizure and Epilepsy Using Higher Order Statistics in the EMD Domain	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); empirical mode decomposition (EMD); epileptic seizure; neural network	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	In this paper, a method using higher order statistical moments of EEG signals calculated in the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) domain is proposed for detecting seizure and epilepsy. The appropriateness of these moments in distinguishing the EEG signals is investigated through an extensive analysis in the EMD domain. An artificial neural network is employed as the classifier of the EEG signals wherein these moments are used as features. The performance of the proposed method is studied using a publicly available benchmark database for various classification cases that include healthy, interictal (seizure-free interval) and ictal (seizure), healthy and seizure, nonseizure and seizure, and interictal and ictal, and compared with that of several recent methods based on time-frequency analysis and statistical moments. It is shown that the proposed method can provide, in almost all the cases, 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, especially in the case of discriminating seizure activities from the nonseizure ones for patients with epilepsy while being much faster as compared to the time-frequency analysis-based techniques.

Abnormal sensory gating, one such endophenotype, is associated with reduced expression of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor. However, typical gating measures such as the P50 evoked response are often low-pass filtered, and it is unclear how a7 expression affects gating at higher frequencies. Therefore, this study used time -frequency analysis to compare sensory gating at the beta and gamma frequencies between human patients and healthy controls as well as between alpha 7 heterozygote mutant mice and wild type Gating of Loral beta (15-26 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) power during paired clicks was assessed from mouse in vivo hippocampal CA3 recordings. Gating was also assessed in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls using electroencephalography. Relative to wild type. u7 heLerozygore mice showed impaired gating of Loral beta and gamma power. Similarly, relative to controls, patients showed impaired gating of Loral beta and gamma power. Poor beta gating was associated with negative symptoms. These results demonstrate that schizophrenia patients and alpha 7 heLerozygoLe mice show similar deficits in gaLing high frequency power. Time frequency analysis of beta and gamma gating may thus be a translational method of assessing the genetic basis of gating deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Four major frequency ranges identified in EEG are called delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms. A system for removal of artifact from multichannel EEG signal is designed based on Independent Component Analysis using rhythmic components. Since different artifacts are overlapped with different EEG rhythms wavelet decomposition as a preprocessing step increases the redundancy and rejection of the suitable wavelet components decreases the probability of rejecting useful information. Two step identification of artifactual content before and after ICA using Kurtosis as a parameter helps in automation of the artifact removal process. This automation increases the accuracy and reduces the processing time. Using this method we can process more number of channels easily. The wavelet coefficients can be easily processed and therefore these transforms can be used as a preprocessor in clinical applications where various states of EEG signal correspond to different representation of information.

The retention period during which subjects were asked to memorize a pattern in a square matrix is analyzed with a graph theoretical approach. The functional coupling among EEG electrodes are quantified via mutual information in the time-frequency plane. A spectral clustering algorithm followed by bootstrapping is used to parcellate memory related circuits and for identifying significant clusters in the brain. The main outcome of the study is that the size of the significant clusters formed by alpha oscillations decreases as the memory load increases. This finding corroborates the active inhibition hypothesis about alpha oscillations.

High temporal resolution achieved by EEG recordings allows the study of the dynamical properties of synchronous patterns of activity at a very fine temporal scale but with very low spatial resolution. Spatial resolution can be improved by retrieving the neural sources of EEG signal, thus solving the so-called inverse problem. Although many methods have been proposed to solve the inverse problem and localize brain activity, few of them target the synchronous brain regions. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm aimed at localizing specifically synchronous brain regions and reconstructing the time course of their activity. Using multivariate wavelet ridge analysis, we extract signals capturing the synchronous events buried in the EEG and then solve the inverse problem on these signals. Using simulated data, we compare results of source reconstruction accuracy achieved by our method to a standard source reconstruction approach. We show that the proposed method performs better across a wide range of noise levels and source configurations. In addition, we applied our method on real dataset and identified successfully cortical areas involved in the functional network underlying visual face perception. We conclude that the proposed approach allows an accurate localization of synchronous brain regions and a robust estimation of their activity.

Temporal changes of neocortical high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; HFO; oscillation; machine learning; classifier	FAST RIPPLES; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; RECORDINGS; SEIZURES; SPIKES; EEG	High-frequency (100-500 Hz) oscillations (HFOs) recorded from intracranial electrodes are a potential biomarker for epileptogenic brain. HFOs are commonly categorized as ripples (100-250 Hz) or fast ripples (250-500 Hz), and a third class of mixed frequency events has also been identified. We hypothesize that temporal changes in HFOs may identify periods of increased the likelihood of seizure onset. HFOs (86,151) from five patients with neocortical epilepsy implanted with hybrid (micro + macro) intracranial electrodes were detected using a previously validated automated algorithm run over all channels of each patient's entire recording. HFOs were characterized by extracting quantitative morphologic features and divided into four time epochs (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal) and three HFO clusters (ripples, fast ripples, and mixed events). We used supervised classification and nonparametric statistical tests to explore quantitative changes in HFO features before, during, and after seizures. We also analyzed temporal changes in the rates and proportions of events from each HFO cluster during these periods. We observed patient-specific changes in HFO morphology linked to fluctuation in the relative rates of ripples, fast ripples, and mixed frequency events. These changes in relative rate occurred in pre- and postictal periods up to thirty min before and after seizures. We also found evidence that the distribution of HFOs during these different time periods varied greatly between individual patients. These results suggest that temporal analysis of HFO features has potential for designing custom seizure prediction algorithms and for exploring the relationship between HFOs and seizure generation.

While the relation between oscillation amplitude (power) and sensory-cognitive variables has been extensively studied, recent work reveals that the dynamic oscillation signature (phase pattern) can carry information about such processes to a greater degree than amplitude. To elucidate the neural correlates of oscillatory phase patterns, we compared the stimulus selectivity of neural firing rates and auditory-driven electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations. We employed the same naturalistic sound stimuli in 2 experiments, one recording scalp EEGs in humans and one recording intracortical local field potentials (LFPs) and single neurons in macaque auditory cortex. Using stimulus decoding techniques, we show that stimulus selective firing patterns imprint on the phase rather than the amplitude of slow (theta band) oscillations in LFPs and EEG. In particular, we find that stimuli which can be discriminated by firing rates can also be discriminated by phase patterns but not by oscillation amplitude and that stimulus-specific phase patterns also persist in the absence of increases of oscillation power. These findings support a neural basis for stimulus selective and entrained EEG phase patterns and reveal a level of interrelation between encephalographic signals and neural firing beyond simple amplitude covariations in both signals.

It is not all about phase: Amplitude dynamics in corticomuscular interactions	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Amplitude envelope; Phase coupling; Corticomuscular coherence; Synchronization; Beta oscillation; Event-related desynchronization	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; CORTICO-MUSCULAR COHERENCE; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MUSCLE COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; STATE	Corticomuscular interactions are studied mostly with EEG/EMG coherence, which, however, does not allow quantification of amplitude dynamics of sensorimotor oscillations. Here, we investigated the amplitude dynamics of sensorimotor EEG beta oscillations during an isometric task and their relation to corticomuscular coherence (CMC). We used amplitude envelopes of beta oscillations, derived from multichannel EEG and EMG recordings, as a measure of local cortical and spinal-cord synchronization. In general, we showed that the amplitude of cortical beta oscillations can influence CMC in two ways. First, we showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of pre-stimulus beta oscillations affects CMC. Second, we demonstrated that the attenuation of beta oscillations upon imperative stimulus correlated with the CMC strength. Attenuation of cortical beta oscillations was previously hypothesized to reflect increased motor cortex excitability. Consequently, this correlation might indicate that high cortical excitability, produced by imperative stimulus, facilitates the recruitment of neuronal networks responsible for establishing reliable corticospinal control manifested in larger CMC. Critically, we demonstrated that the amplitude envelopes of beta oscillations in EEG and EMG are positively correlated on time scales ranging from 50 to 1000 ms. Such correlations indicate that the amplitude of cortical beta oscillations might relate to the rhythmic spiking output of both corticospinal neurons and their spinal targets. Compared to CMC, however, amplitude-envelope correlations were detected in fewer cases, which might relate to a higher susceptibility of these correlations to signal-to-noise ratio. We conclude that EEG beta oscillations, originating from the sensorimotor cortex, can transmit not only their phase but also amplitude dynamics through the spinal motoneurons down to peripheral effectors.

Although the PD group has significantly more symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, frequency-domain HRV can not differentiate these two groups. However, different patterns of central oscillation and their correlation with peripheral autonomic indices could be found for the two groups. While the power of specific EEG bands under electrodes F4, F7, Cz and Pz (parietal-lateral premotor cortex, which is considered as a compensatory area for the relative deficiency of mesial frontal-striatal circuits in PD) correlated significantly with the power of peripheral heart rate variability (HRV) indices in the PD group, those under electrodes C3, P3, P4 and F8 had significant correlation in the control group. In conclusion, functional connectivity between areas of cerebral cortex and peripheral autonomic system can be measured and differs between PD patients with autonomic dysfunction and healthy controls. The central autonomic network may play a role in brain re-organization in PD patients with autonomic dysfunction. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG Power During Waking and NREM Sleep in Primary Insomnia	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Insomnia; EEG; NREM sleep; wakefulness; spectral analysis	DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; PITTSBURGH; SYMPTOMS; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUMENT; ALERTNESS; SPECTRA; MARKERS; PERIOD; NIGHT	Objective: Pathophysiological models of insomnia invoke the concept of 24-hour hyperarousal, which could lead to symptoms and physiological findings during waking and sleep. We hypothesized that this arousal could be seen in the waking electroencephalogram (EEG) of individuals with primary insomnia (PI), and that waking EEG power would correlate with non-REM (NREM) EEG. Methods: Subjects included 50 PI and 32 good sleeper controls (GSC). Five minutes of eyes closed waking EEG were collected at subjects' usual bedtimes, followed by polysomnography (PSG) at habitual sleep times. An automated algorithm and visual editing were used to remove artifacts from waking and sleep EEGs, followed by power spectral analysis to estimate power from 0.5-32 Hz. Results: We did not find significant differences in waking or NREM EEG spectral power of PI and GSC. Significant correlations between waking and NREM sleep power were observed across all frequency bands in the PI group and in most frequency bands in the GSC group. Conclusions: The absence of significant differences between groups in waking or NREM EEG power suggests that our sample was not characterized by a high degree of cortical arousal. The consistent correlations between waking and NREM EEG power suggest that, in samples with elevated NREM EEG beta activity, waking EEG power may show a similar pattern.

Harmonic fractals in the brain: transient tuning and synchronic coordination in the quasi-chaotic background of ongoing neural EEG activity	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Information Technology and Quantitative Management (ITQM)	MAY 16-18, 2013	Suzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Acad Informat Technol & Quantitat Management, Chinese Acad Sci Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, China Singapore Suzhou Ind Pk, China Data Technol (Suzhou) Co Ltd, Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Univ Nebraska Omaha, Chinese Soc Management Modernizat, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, China Financial Futures Exchange, Yihaodian Com, Wintek Corp, Footdisc Inc, Emerald		EEG; fractal harmonics; chaos theory; neuroscience brain functional time architecture; data analysis and visualization		Despite the long-time that EEG has been used in neurophysiological characterization of the brain functioning and the diverse methods that has been used to enhance its predictive power, frequency resolution and time dependent description of EEG features, it remain at the level of gross depictions. By mean of collapsing time, through doing a power spectrum analysis, the focus is put on amplitude differences among wide EEG (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) frequency bands or, without any further consideration of the mid- or long-term time course evolution, of the ever changing neural processes of the brain. To try to solve this, we took an exploratory approach that consider both weaknesses of the problem by taking into account, simultaneously, the synchrony of the time course of the EEG signal and the harmonic tuning among single narrow short-time frequency bands along the whole spectrum from 0,5 to 60 Hz. To characterize the neural phenomena in these terms we cleaned and selectively filtered and transformed the EEG signal into music, and used the so-transformed EEG recording to find harmonic fractal elements in it during the execution of a number of exploratory basal and experimental tests in humans. We sustained our search on the fact that EEG signal can be described as a particular type of quasi-predictable noise, also called pink or fractal noise. We looked for detection of specific and transient synchronized and wide tuned elements of EEG brain activity characterized by high self-similarity or high values of statistical autocorrelation expressed in regular shaped associated plots. We found and characterized harmonic fractals coining from EEG of 5 subjects during the execution of three exploratory experimental conditions: basal resting state with eyes open and closed; a cognitive challenge consisting in the execution of an abbreviated version of the Raven visual intelligence test; and during four minutes playing an action video game. Results showed the presence of characteristic harmonic fractals in all the conditions tested and revealed intra and inter-individual differences that can eventually be used to characterize particular brain activity states related to specific sensory, or cognitive, processes or may be indicating individual differences in the way to process information, in particular situations, developmental stage, illness or neuropsychological disorders.

However, epileptic EEG is often contaminated with lots of artifacts such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG). These artifacts confuse EEG interpretation, while rejecting EEG segments containing artifacts probably results in a substantial data loss and it is very time-consuming. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel algorithm for removing artifacts from epileptic EEG automatically. The collected multi-channel EEG data are decomposed into statistically independent components with Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Then temporal and spectral features of each independent component, including Hurst exponent, skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent and frequency-band energy extracted with wavelet packet decomposition, are calculated to quantify the characteristics of different artifact components. These features are imported into trained support vector machine to determine whether the independent components represent EEG activity or artifactual signals. Finally artifact-free EEGs are obtained by reconstructing the signal with artifact-free components. The method is evaluated with EEG recordings acquired from 15 epilepsy patients. Compared with previous work, the proposed method can remove artifacts such as baseline drift, ECG, EMG, BOG, and power frequency interference automatically and efficiently, while retaining important features for epilepsy diagnosis such as interictal spikes and ictal segments.

However, the cortical effects are generally indirectly evaluated with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) reflective of modulation of cortico-spinal excitability. In this study, we aim to provide direct measures of cortical plasticity by combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG). Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) was applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) of young healthy adults, and we measured modulation of (i) MEPs, (ii) TMS-induced EEG evoked potentials (TEPs), (iii) TMS-induced EEG synchronization and (iv) eyes-closed resting EEG. Our results show the expected cTBS-induced decrease in MEP size, which we found to be paralleled by a modulation of a combination of TEPs. Furthermore, we found that cTBS increased the power in the theta band of eyes-closed resting EEG, whereas it decreased single-pulse TMS-induced power in the theta and alpha bands. In addition, cTBS decreased the power in the beta band of eyes-closed resting EEG, whereas it increased single-pulse TMS-induced power in the beta band. We suggest that cTBS acts by modulating the phase alignment between already active oscillators; it synchronizes low-frequency (theta and/or alpha) oscillators and desynchronizes high-frequency (beta) oscillators. These results provide novel insight into the cortical effects of cTBS and could be useful for exploring cTBS-induced plasticity outside of the motor cortex.

J	Mu, Y; Han, SH				Mu, Yan; Han, Shihui			Neural oscillations dissociate between self-related attentional orientation versus evaluation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Neural oscillation; Phase synchrony; Self-reflection; Trait judgment	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; EEG-DATA; MEMORY; BRAIN; MODULATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; NEUROSCIENCE; INFORMATION	To investigate whether self-reflection on personality traits engages distinct neural mechanisms of self-related attentional orientation and self-related evaluation, we recorded electroencephalograms from adults while they made trait judgments about themselves and an age- and gender-matched friend, or judgments of word valence. Each trial consisted of a cue word that indicated a target person for trait judgment or instructed valence judgment, followed by a trait adjective to be evaluated. Using a wavelet analysis, we calculated time-frequency power at each electrode and phase synchrony between electrode pairs associated with self-, friend- or valence-cues and with trait adjectives during trait or valence judgments. Relative to friend- and valence-cues, self-cues elicited increased synchronous activity in delta (2-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-26 Hz), and gamma (28-40 Hz) bands, and increased large-scale phase synchrony in these frequency bands. Self-related evaluation compared to friend-related evaluation during trait judgments induced stronger desynchronization in alpha, beta and gamma band activities, and decreased phase synchrony in alpha and gamma band activities. Our findings suggest that self-related attentional orientation and self-related evaluation engage distinct neural mechanisms that are respectively characterized by synchrony and desynchrony of neural activity in local assemblies and between long-distance brain regions.

Two brakes are better than one: The neural bases of inhibitory control of motor memory traces	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha band; Electroencephalography (EEG); Inhibition; Phase coherence; Sensorimotor cortex	INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; ALPHA SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; BAND; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; CORTEX	Inhibitory control of actions is one important aspect in daily life to warrant adequate context related behavior. Alpha activity (oscillatory brain activity around 10 Hz) has been suggested to play a major role for the implementation of inhibitory control. In the present study electrophysiological correlates of voluntary suppression of acquired, memorized motor actions have been compared to the suppression of novel motor actions. Multichannel EEG analyses of alpha power and alpha phase coherence were used. Healthy subjects were asked to inhibit the execution of either well-trained, memorized or untrained, novel sequential finger movements depending on the respective context. An increase of focal upper alpha activity at bilateral sensorimotor cortices was found during suppression of movements independent of whether these were memorized or novel. This represents a memory unspecific mechanism of motor cortical inhibition. In contrast, interregional phase synchronization between frontal and (left) central recording sites showed a differential effect with decoupling during suppression of memorized movements which was not the case with novel ones. Increase of fronto-central coupling at upper alpha frequency during retrieval of the memory trace and decrease during suppression of retrieval were obtained. This further supports the view of the functional relevance of upper alpha oscillations as a mechanism of context-dependent sustained inhibition of memory contents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from 9 medication-na < ve children with Tourette syndrome and 10 age-matched healthy subjects in resting conditions and during tic suppression. Their cortical oscillations were examined using the power spectral method and partial directed coherence. The authors found increased oscillations of broad frequency bands in the frontomotor regions of patients during tic expression, suggesting the involvement of aberrant cortical oscillations in Tourette syndrome. More significantly, prominent increases in theta oscillation in the prefrontal area and directed frontomotor interactions in the theta and beta bands were observed during tic suppression. Furthermore, the directed EEG interaction from the frontal to motor regions was positively correlated with the severity of tic symptoms. These findings suggest that the frontal to motor interaction of cortical oscillations plays a significant role in tic suppression.

EEG-Based Classification of Music Appraisal Responses Using Time-Frequency Analysis and Familiarity Ratings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Appraisal classification; EEG; familiarity; music; pattern recognition; signal processing	LIKING; RECORDINGS; FLUENCY; EMOTION; MEMORY	A time-windowing feature extraction approach based on time-frequency (TF) analysis is adopted here to investigate the time-course of the discrimination between musical appraisal electroencephalogram (EEG) responses, under the parameter of familiarity. An EEG data set, formed by the responses of nine subjects during music listening, along with self-reported ratings of liking and familiarity, is used. Features are extracted from the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-49 Hz) EEG bands in time windows of various lengths, by employing three TF distributions (spectrogram, Hilbert-Huang spectrum, and Zhao-Atlas-Marks transform). Subsequently, two classifiers (k-NN and SVM) are used to classify feature vectors in two categories, i.e., "like" and "dislike," under three cases of familiarity, i.e., regardless of familiarity (LD), familiar music (LDF), and unfamiliar music (LDUF). Key findings show that best classification accuracy (CA) is higher and it is achieved earlier in the LDF case {91.02 +/- 1.45% (7.5-10.5 s)} as compared to the LDUF case {87.10 +/- 1.84% (10-15 s)}. Additionally, best CAs in LDF and LDUF cases are higher as compared to the general LD case {85.28 +/- 0.77%}. The latter results, along with neurophysiological correlates, are further discussed in the context of the existing literature on the time-course of music-induced affective responses and the role of familiarity.

Trevis. (Lycopodiaceae), acts as a selective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and shows memory-enhancing properties. Although Hup-A has shown promising expectation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, controlled clinical trials supporting its use are limited. The aim of thisworkwas to study in vivo, in an animal model of AD, the pharmacological activity of systemic administration of Hup-A on cortex-and hippocampus-dependent memory. With this purpose, a set of experiments was planned to evaluate attention, learning, working and spatial memory with respect to cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) theta rhythm during the object recognition test and Morris water maze in animals with lesion of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). In NBM-lesioned animals, compared with control, an increased theta power in the cortex and a reduced theta rhythm oscillation in the hippocampus were found. These EEG changes were correlated with worse performance in learning and memory tasks. In rats with damaged NBM, HupA (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) was able to restore EEG architecture, producing cortical desynchronization and reduction in theta power, while in the hippocampus the drug increased theta oscillation and reduced the impairment in attention/working memory as well as spatial navigation performance in the behavioral tasks. Taken together, the present data suggest that Hup-A is able to restore cholinergic cortico-hippocampal functional connectivity. In conclusion, the present results are in agreement with other experimental evidence that promote the clinical use of this natural drug.

We used neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-90 Hz), which emerge from a balanced interaction of excitation and inhibition in the brain, to assess contextual modulation processes in early visual perception. Electroencephalography was recorded in 12 high-functioning adults with ASD and 12 age- and IQ-matched control participants. Oscillations in the gamma frequency range were analyzed in response to stimuli consisting of small line-like elements. Orientation-specific contextual modulation was manipulated by parametrically increasing the amount of homogeneously oriented elements in the stimuli. The stimuli elicited a strong steady-state gamma response around the refresh-rate of 60 Hz, which was larger for controls than for participants with ASD. The amount of orientation homogeneity (contextual modulation) influenced the gamma response in control subjects, while for subjects with ASD this was not the case. The atypical steady-state gamma response to contextual modulation in subjects with ASD may capture the link between an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal processing and atypical visual processing in ASD.

Subject position affects EEG magnitudes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Current source modeling; Neuroanatomy; Gamma power; ERP magnitude; Brain shift	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ATROPHY; MOTOR CORTEX; STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; DIAGNOSIS; SLEEP; ALPHA; CSF	EEG (electroencephalography) has been used for decades in thousands of research studies and is today a routine clinical tool despite the small magnitude of measured scalp potentials. It is widely accepted that the currents originating in the brain are strongly influenced by the high resistivity of skull bone, but it is less well known that the thin layer of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) has perhaps an even more important effect on EEG scalp magnitude by spatially blurring the signals. Here it is shown that brain shift and the resulting small changes in CSF layer thickness, induced by changing the subject's position, have a significant effect on EEG signal magnitudes in several standard visual paradigms. For spatially incoherent high-frequency activity the effect produced by switching from prone to supine can be dramatic, increasing occipital signal power by several times for some subjects (on average 80%). MRI measurements showed that the occipital CSF layer between the brain and skull decreases by approximately 30% in thickness when a subject moves from prone to supine position. A multiple dipole model demonstrated that this can indeed lead to occipital EEG signal power increases in the same direction and order of magnitude as those observed here. These results suggest that future EEG studies should control for subjects' posture, and that some studies may consider placing their subjects into the most favorable position for the experiment. These findings also imply that special consideration should be given to EEG measurements from subjects with brain atrophy due to normal aging or neurodegenerative diseases, since the resulting increase in CSF layer thickness could profoundly decrease scalp potential measurements.

Methods: This method is based on a two-stage procedure: (i) global detection of events of interest (EOIs, defined as transient signals accompanied with an energy increase in the frequency band of interest 250-600 Hz) and (ii) local energy vs. frequency analysis of detected EOIs for classification as FRs, interictal epileptic spikes or artifacts. For this second stage, two variants were implemented based either on Fourier or wavelet transform. The method was evaluated on simulated and real depth-EEG signals (human, animal). The performance criterion was based on receiving operator characteristics. Results: The proposed detector showed high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: As designed to specifically detect FRs, the method outperforms any method simply based on the detection of energy changes in high-pass filtered signals and avoids spurious detections caused by sharp transient events often present in raw signals. Significance: In most of epilepsy surgery units, huge data sets are generated during pre-surgical evaluation. We think that the proposed detection method can dramatically decrease the workload in assessing the presence of FRs in intracranial EEGs. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These features consist of summarizing variables defined as total activity (e.g., total normalized log-power), computed over sets of sites in a discrete domain, such as the time frequency topography space. These sets are obtained as those that maximize the linear separation between the two populations, and the corresponding maps provide information that may complement that obtained by standard procedures, such as statistical parametric mapping. It is shown experimentally, using both simulated and real data, that the proposed approach may provide useful information even when the standard procedures fail, due to the conservative nature of the multiple comparison correction that must be applied in the later case.

Sequential sampling models (SSMs) have greatly advanced the decision sciences by assuming decisions to emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process so that response times (RTs) become predictable. Here, we demonstrate a difficulty of SSMs that occurs when people are not forced to respond at once but are allowed to sample information sequentially: The decision maker might decide to delay the choice and terminate the accumulation process temporarily, a scenario not accounted for by the standard SSM approach. We developed several SSMs for predicting RTs from two independent samples of an electroencephalography (EEG) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. Standard SSM implementations did not describe RT distributions adequately. However, by adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model we obtained an accurate fit to the data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de-and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies (14-30 Hz), indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited and thus lending further support for the existence of a decision not to decide. Finally, the extended model accounted for the results of an adapted version of our paradigm in which participants had to press a button for sampling more information. Our results show how computational modeling of decisions and RTs support a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.

The question remains unsolved whether these differences are also linked to negative emotion regulation strategies that configure a depressive style. In this study we applied detrended fluctuation analysis to the amplitude envelope of broad band and narrow band (theta and alpha) spontaneous EEG oscillations of a sample (N = 56) of young nondepressed adults to whom several emotion regulation and depression questionnaires were administered. Linear positive correlations between the scaling exponents of both broad band and theta band oscillations and negative emotion regulation strategies and depression scores were found. These results suggest that previously found differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals may exist before depression manifests, as differences could be linked to a negative emotion regulation style that in some cases could lead to the development of a depressive disorder.

However, less is known about if and how sensory and motor information are integrated in the subsequent process of response evaluation. We used a modified Simon Task to investigate how these streams of information are integrated in response evaluation processes, applying an in-depth neurophysiological analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), time-frequency decomposition and sLORETA. The results show that response evaluation processes are differentially modulated by afferent proprioceptive information and efference copies. While the influence of proprioceptive information is mediated via oscillations in different frequency bands, efference copy based information about the motor execution is specifically mediated via oscillations in the theta frequency band. Stages of visual perception and attention were not modulated by the interaction of proprioception and motor efference copies. Brain areas modulated by the interactive effects of proprioceptive and efference copy based information included the middle frontal gyrus and the supplementary motor area (SMA), suggesting that these areas integrate sensory information for the purpose of response evaluation. The results show how motor response evaluation processes are modulated by information about both the execution and the location of a response.

Oscillation analyses conducted on the Think/No-Think (TNT) task and volitional suppression of retrieval are of interest to broaden our knowledge of neural oscillations associated not only during successful memory retrieval but also when retrieval is unwanted or suppressed. In the current study, we measured EEG during a TNT task and performed ERP and EEG spectral power band analyses. ERP results replicated other researchers' observations of increases in 500-800 msec parietal effects for items where retrieval was instructed to be elaborated compared with being suppressed. Furthermore, EEG analyses indicated increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (3-8 Hz) oscillations across parietal electrodes for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus those to be elaborated. Additionally, during the second half of the experiment (after repeated attempts at control), increases in theta oscillations were found across both frontal and parietal electrodes for items that were instructed to be suppressed and that were ultimately forgotten versus those ultimately remembered. Increased alpha power for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus elaborated may indicate reductions of retrieval attempts or lack of retrieval success. Increased theta power for items that were instructed to be suppressed versus elaborated may indicate increased or prolonged cognitive control to monitor retrieval events.

Frequency specific interactions of MEG resting state activity within and across brain networks as revealed by the multivariate interaction measure	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Imaginary coherence; Magnetoencephalography; Resting state networks	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG/MEG DATA; TOP-DOWN; EEG DATA; ALPHA; CORTEX; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS	Resting state networks (RSNs) are sets of brain regions exhibiting temporally coherent activity fluctuations in the absence of imposed task structure. RSNs have been extensively studied with fMRI in the infra-slow frequency range (nominally <10(-1) Hz). The topography of fMRI RSNs reflects stationary temporal correlation over minutes. However, neuronal communication occurs on a much faster time scale, at frequencies nominally in the range of 10(0)-10(2) Hz. We examined phase-shifted interactions in the delta (2-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands of resting-state source space MEG signals. These analyses were conducted between nodes of the dorsal attention network (DAN), one of the most robust RSNs, and between the DAN and other networks. Phase shifted interactions were mapped by the multivariate interaction measure (MIM), a measure of true interaction constructed from the maximization of imaginary coherency in the virtual channels comprised of voxel signals in source space. Non-zero-phase interactions occurred between homologous left and right hemisphere regions of the DAN in the delta and alpha frequency bands. Even stronger non-zero-phase interactions were detected between networks. Visual regions bilaterally showed phase-shifted interactions in the alpha band with regions of the DAN. Bilateral somatomotor regions interacted with DAN nodes in the beta band. These results demonstrate the existence of consistent, frequency specific phase-shifted interactions on a millisecond time scale between cortical regions within RSN as well as across RSNs.

And the short-term fractal property reflects the sympathovagal modulation of heart rate variability (HRV). The properties of EEG and HRV strongly correlated with sleep status and are interesting in clinic diagnosis. New method: 19 healthy female subjects were included for over-night standard polysomnographic study. Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) was used to characterize the temporal features of slow- and fast-wave oscillations decomposed from sleep EEG at different stages. Masking signals were used for solving the mode-mixing problem in HHT. On the other hand, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was used to assess short-term property of HRV denoted as DFA al, which reflects the temporal activity of autonomic nerve system (ANS). Thus, the dynamic interaction between sleep EEG and HRV can be examined through the relationship between the features of sleep EEG and DFA al of HRV. Results: The frequency feature of sleep EEG serves as a good indicator for the depth of sleep during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and amplitude feature of fast-wave oscillation is a good index for distinguishing rapid eye movement (REM) from NREM sleep. Comparison with existing method: The relationship between DFA al of HRV and the mean amplitude of fast-wave oscillation of sleep EEG affirmed with Pearson correlation coefficient is more significant than the correlation verified by the traditional spectral analysis. Conclusion: The dynamic properties of sleep EEG and HRV derived by EMD and DFA represent important features for cortex and ANS activities during sleep. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has recently been proposed that ongoing brain oscillations are not symmetric, so that task-related amplitude modulations generate a baseline shift that does not average out, leading to slow event-related potentials. We test this hypothesis using multivariate methods to formally assess the co-variation between task-related evoked potentials and spectral changes in scalp EEG during a visual working memory task, which is known to elicit both evoked and sustained cortical activities across broadly distributed cortical regions. 64-channel EEG data were acquired from eight healthy human subjects who completed a visuo-spatial associative working memory task as memory load was parametrically increased from easy to hard. As anticipated, evoked activity showed a complex but robust spatio-temporal waveform maximally expressed bilaterally in the parieto-occipital and anterior midline regions, showing robust effects of memory load that were specific to the stage of the working memory trial. Similarly, memory load was associated with robust spectral changes in the theta and alpha range, throughout encoding in posterior regions and through maintenance and retrieval in anterior regions, consistent with the additional resources required for decision making in prefrontal cortex. Analysis of the relationship between event-related changes in slow potentials and cortical rhythms, using partial least squares, is indeed consistent with the notion that the former make a causal contribution to the latter.

Network mechanisms of responsiveness to continuous theta-burst stimulation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; human; plasticity; spatial attention; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NONINVASIVE CORTICAL STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ATTENTION NETWORK; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; REPETITIVE TMS; DEFAULT MODE; NEURAL BASIS	Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) can modify behavior, but effects are inconsistent and their mechanisms insufficiently understood. As coherence in resting-state networks influences human behavior, we hypothesized that cTBS may act via modulation of neural oscillation coherence. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether behavioral effects of cTBS on visuospatial attention are associated with coherence changes in the attention network. In healthy human subjects, cTBS of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the right frontal eye field was compared with sham stimulation. Effects on visuospatial attention were quantified with a visual exploration task, and network effects were assessed from surface EEG with inverse solutions and source coherence analyses. Before stimulation, left visual exploration was linearly correlated with alpha-band coherence between the right temporo-parietal cortex and the rest of the brain. Posterior parietal cortex stimulation induced neglect-like visual exploration behavior in the majority, but not all, subjects. It reduced alpha-band coherence between the stimulation site and the rest of the brain but also enhanced it between the contralateral left parietal cortex and the rest of the brain. The contralateral increase correlated with the induced reduction in left visual attention. The behavioral response of individual participants to cTBS could be predicted by coherence in the right temporo-parietal junction before stimulation. Behavioral effects of cTBS therefore depend on network states before stimulation and are linearly associated with changes in network interactions. In particular, cTBS modulates an interhemispheric competition in alpha-band coherence. EEG network imaging might help to optimize therapeutic cTBS in the future.

Existing tools available to perform such analysis (e.g., detrended fluctuation analysis), however, provide limited gains in discriminability power over traditional spectral based EEG analysis. In this paper, we explore the use of an innovative EEG amplitude modulation analysis technique based on spectro-temporal signal processing. More specifically, full-band EEG signals are first decomposed into the five well-known frequency bands and the envelopes are then extracted via a Hilbert transform. Each of the five envelopes are further decomposed into four so-called modulation bands, which were chosen to coincide with the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Experiments on a resting-awake EEG dataset collected from 76 participants (27 healthy controls, 27 diagnosed with mild-AD, and 22 with moderate-AD) showed significant differences in amplitude modulations between the three groups. Most notably, i) delta modulation of the beta frequency band disappeared with an increase in disease severity (from mild to moderate AD), ii) delta modulation of the theta band appeared with an increase in severity, and iii) delta modulation of the beta frequency band showed to be a reliable discriminant feature between healthy controls and mild-AD patients. Taken together, it is hoped that the developed tool can be used to assist clinicians not only with early detection of Alzheimer's disease, but also to monitor its progression.

The aim of this study was to explore concurrent associations between quantified dissociative states and QEEG spectral parameters, in particular theta activity, in psychiatric patients. Fifty psychiatric patients completed the State Scale of Dissociation (SSD) immediately after a 15-min EEG recording. The EEG was assessed by conventional clinical visual analysis as well as by quantitative (QEEG) spectral analysis. Canonical analysis was performed between the set of SSD subscale scores and the following QEEG parameters: alpha-theta magnitude ratios, and relative as well as absolute theta magnitude obtained from right and left mid- to posterior-temporal and parieto-occipital derivations. The SSD transferred well to the present data in terms of reliability and internal criterion-related validity. The SSD and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) correlated significantly (r = .73, p < .001). Conventional EEG analysis identified 29 EEGs (58%) as abnormal. The main abnormality in 23 EEGs was slowing, maximal temporally in half of these cases. Canonical analyses confirmed a statistically significant relationship between the dissociation variables (especially conversion and depersonalization symptoms) and the QEEG variables (especially relative theta magnitude in the temporal regions; R = .72, p = .03, for SSD-QEEG; and R = .66, p = .04, for DES-QEEG). Quantified dissociative mental states are positively canonically associated with decreased temporal theta activity and increased alpha-theta ratios on QEEG in psychiatric patients with a high tendency to dissociate. The potential implications of the dissociation-theta-alpha relationship for understanding normal attentional processes need to be studied further.

Methods: EEG was recorded by six scalp electrodes from 19 migraine without aura patients (MO), 19 migraine with aura patients (MA) and 11 healthy subjects (control group (N)). Flash stimuli were presented at 9-27Hz frequencies. Phase synchronization after Hilbert transform and Granger causality were evaluated filtering the EEG in alpha and beta bands. Results: Phase synchronization increased in alpha band in MO, and decreased in beta band in MA, with respect to controls. The intensity of directed interactions in beta band, revealed by Granger causality, increased in MA compared to both MO patients and controls. Discussion: There were clear differences in ongoing EEG under visual stimulation, which emerged between the two forms of migraine, probably subtended by increased cortical activation in migraine with aura, and compensatory phenomena of reduced connectivity and functional networks segregation, occurring in patients not experiencing aura symptoms. Further investigation may confirm whether the clinical manifestation of aura symptoms is subtended by a peculiar neuronal connectivity pattern.

The experiment was conducted on a high fidelity driving simulator. Three different scenarios were designed to investigate the driver's state during normally driving (braking and accelerating) and turning (left or right). In the daily-urban scenario, a deer collision occurred. During each driving trial, the EEG signal was recorded by a 32-lead system. The EEG dynamics were analyzed using power spectrum density (PSD), event-related potential (ERP), independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency analysis (TFA). In normally driving, the EEG responses are similar during the three different scenarios. The power concentrates on the frontal and back lobes. During turning, the EEG response is somehow different from that in normally driving (only braking and accelerating). In the deer-collision event, a rapid response is apparent in the ERP mapping.

J	Tatum, WO				Tatum, William O.			Artifact-related epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; EEG; REMOVAL	Potentials that do not conform to an expected electrical field generated by the brain characterize an extracerebral source or artifact. Artifact is present in virtually every EEG. It is an essential component for routine visual analysis, yet it may beguile the interpreter into falsely identifying waveforms that simulate epileptiform discharges (ED). The principal importance of artifact is represented by the frequency of its occurrence in contrast to the limited frequency of normal variants that may imitate pathologic ED. Continuous EEG monitoring has uncovered newly identified artifacts unique to prolonged recording. The combined use of video and EEG has revolutionized our ability to distinguish cerebral and extracerebral influences through behavioral correlation that is time-locked to the electrophysiologic features that are present on EEG. Guidelines exist to ensure minimal standards of recording. Precise definitions are present for ED. Still, the ability to distinguish artifact from pathologic ED requires a human element that is to provide the essential identification of an abnormal EEG. The ramification of a misinterpreted record carries an acute risk of treatment and long-term consequences for diagnosis-related harm.

Period-Amplitude Analysis Reveals Wake-Dependent Changes in the Electroencephalogram during Sleep Deprivation	SLEEP			English	Article						Sleep deprivation; waking; homeostasis; sleep propensity; mice	EEG POWER-DENSITY; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; THETA ACTIVITY; LOCAL SLEEP; WAKING EEG; WAKEFULNESS; RAT; HOMEOSTASIS; DYNAMICS	Study Objectives: Electroencephalographic slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep results from the synchronous oscillation of cortical neurons and is the standard measurement of sleep homeostasis. SWA is not a direct measure of sleep pressure accumulation, but rather a measure of the NREM-sleep response to accumulated sleep pressure. Currently, no practical standard for the direct measurement of sleep pressure accumulation exists. Recently, it was demonstrated that rat cortical neurons undergo oscillations during wake that are similar to the cortical oscillations responsible for SWA. Furthermore, these oscillations increase in number as time awake increases. Here we hypothesize that period-amplitude analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which treats the EEG as a series of discrete waves, can measure these cortical oscillations, and thus, is a measure of sleep-pressure accumulation during extended wake. Design: Mice were sleep deprived for 24 h by confinement to a slowly rotating wheel in order to assess wake-dependent changes in EEG wave incidence. Measurements and Results: Continuous period-amplitude analysis of the waking EEG across 24 h of sleep deprivation revealed that the incidence of 2 to 6 Hz waves increased exponentially over the deprivation period. This increase in wave incidence appeared to occur in two phases with exponential time constants of approximately 0.12 h and 3 h. Further analysis revealed that the changes in wave incidence were significantly correlated with two established markers of sleep pressure, SWA and NREM sleep latency. Conclusions: The data suggest that wave incidence is an effective method of measuring sleep homeostasis in the waking EEG that provides better temporal resolution than spectral power analysis.

Epileptic seizures, which are characterized by a recurrent and sudden malfunction of the brain, reflect the clinical sign of an excessive and hyper-synchronous activity of neurons in the brain. EEG is the most economical one with high temporal resolution. The visual inspection of EEG data is prohibitively time-consuming and inefficient, even if the expert clinician reads the data ten times faster than the recording speed. The visual inspection lacks quantitative analysis which can uncover hidden characters of the data. We demonstrate in this paper with interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier to collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person is epileptic or not. By using multi-parameter quantification and signal analysis such as power spectrum, frequency, amplitude, signal to noise ratio, entropy etc., it is possible to detect the epilepsy with affected lobe for localization. The results are promising with 100% sensitivity and accuracy of 91% is achieved.

This paper aims to review electroencephalographic (EEG) studies of self-referential processing and to evaluate how they correspond, complement, or contradict the existing fMRI evidence. There are potentially two approaches to the study of EEG correlates of self-referential processing. Firstly, because simultaneous registration of EEG and fMRI has become possible, the degree of overlap between these two signals in brain regions related to self-referential processing could be determined. Second and more direct approach would be the study of EEG correlates of self-referential processing per se. In this review, I discuss studies, which employed both these approaches and show that in line with fMRI evidence, EEG correlates of self-referential processing are most frequently found in brain regions overlapping with the default network, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. In the time domain, the discrimination of self-and others-related information is mostly associated with the P300 ERP component, but sometimes is observed even earlier. In the frequency domain, different frequency oscillations have been shown to contribute to self-referential processing, with spontaneous self-referential mentation being mostly associated with the alpha frequency band.

However, evidence is lacking for correlates of sleep stages with electroencephalogram (EEG) in the hippocampus of monkeys. In the present study, we recorded hippocampal EEG from the dentate gyrus in monkeys overnight under conditions of polysomnographical monitoring. As result, the hippocampal EEG changed in a manner similar to that of the surface EEG: during wakefulness, the hippocampal EEG showed fast, desynchronized waves, which were partly replaced with slower waves of intermediate amplitudes during the shallow stages of non-REM sleep. During the deep stages of non-REM sleep, continuous, slower oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) with high amplitudes were predominant. During REM sleep, the hippocampal EEG again showed fast, desynchronized waves similar to those found during wakefulness. These results indicate that in the monkey, hippocampal rhythmic slow activity rarely occurs during REM sleep, which is in clear contrast to that of rodents. In addition, the increase in the slower oscillations of hippocampal EEG during non-REM sleep, which resembled that of the surface EEG, may at least partly reflect cortical inputs to the dentate gyrus during this behavioral state.

The effects of elevated endogenous GABA levels on movement-related network oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; GABA; Tiagabine; Beta rhythm; Event-related desynchronisation; Gamma oscillations; Motor cortex	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; UPTAKE INHIBITOR; TIAGABINE; FREQUENCY; RECEPTORS; TRANSPORTER	The EEG/MEG signal is generated primarily by the summation of the post-synaptic potentials of cortical principal cells. At a microcircuit level, these glutamatergic principal cells are reciprocally connected to GABAergic interneurons and cortical oscillations are thought to be dependent on the balance of excitation and inhibition between these cell types. To investigate the dependence of movement-related cortical oscillations on excitation-inhibition balance, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks GABA Transporter 1 (GAT-1), the GABA uptake transporter and increases endogenous GABA activity. In a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design, in 15 healthy participants we administered either 15 mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalograms, while the participants performed a movement task, prior to, one hour post, three hour post and five hour post tiagabine ingestion. Using time-frequency analysis of beamformer source reconstructions, we quantified the baseline level of beta activity (15-30 Hz), the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR), beta event-related desynchronisation (beta-ERD) and movement-related gamma synchronisation (MRGS) (60-90 Hz). Our results demonstrated that tiagabine, and hence elevated endogenous GABA levels causes, an elevation of baseline beta power, enhanced beta-ERD and reduced PMBR, but no modulation of MRGS. Comparing our results to recent literature (Hall et al., 2011) we suggest that beta-ERD may be a GABA(A) receptor mediated process while PMBR may be GABA(B) receptor mediated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Can waiting awaken the resting brain?" A comparison of waiting- and cognitive task-induced attenuation of very low frequency neural oscillations	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Very low frequency oscillation; Direct current EEG; Default mode network; Waiting; Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity; Disorder	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; ADHD; FLUCTUATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; ACTIVATION; IMPACT; DELAY; EEG	The default mode network (DMN) is characterised by coherent very low frequency (VLF) neural oscillations in the resting brain. The attenuation of this activity has been demonstrated following the transition from rest to performance of a broad range of cognitive goal-directed tasks. Whether the activity of resting state VLF oscillations is attenuated during non-cognitive goal-directed tasks such as waiting for rewarding outcomes is not known. This study examined the VLF EEG power from resting to performance of attention demanding task and two types of goal-directed waiting tasks. The association between the attenuation of VLF EEG power and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms was examined. Direct current EEG (DC-EEG) data were collected from 32 healthy young adults (half high and half low ADHD symptom scorers) during (i) a rest state, (ii) while performing a cognitive demanding reaction time task (2CRT), and (iii) while undertaking each of two different goal-directed waiting conditions: "forced-to-wait (FW)" and "choose-to-wait (CW)" tasks. The spatial distribution of VLF EEG power across scalp was similar to that seen in previous resting VLF EEG studies. Significant rest-to-task attenuation of VLF EEG power occurred during the 2CRT and the CW task, but not during the FW task. The association between self-ratings of ADHD symptoms and waiting-induced attenuation was not significant. This study suggests VLF EEG power attenuation that occurs following rest-to-task transition is not simply determined by changes in cognitive load. The goal-directed nature of a task, its motivated nature and/or the involvement of effortful attention may also contribute. Future studies should explore the attenuation of resting state VLF oscillations during waiting and impulsive choice. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We analyzed full-scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 40 healthy subjects to investigate spatial and temporal changes of EEG activity across the wake-sleep transition. We quantified EEG sleep recordings by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and by a better oscillation (BOSC) detection method to the EEG signals, which measured oscillatory activity within a signal containing a nonrhythmic portion. Results: The most representative spatial change at SO is the frontalization of slow-wave activity (SWA), while the theta activity, which mostly shares a similar temporal and spatial pattern with SWA, exhibits a temporo-occipital diffusion. The time course of these oscillations confirms that the changes of the dominant waves coexist with topographic changes. The waking occipital prevalence of alpha oscillations is progressively replaced by an occipital prevalence of theta oscillations. On the other hand, more anterior areas show a wide synchronization pattern mainly expressed by slow waves just below 4 Hz and by spindle oscillations. Conclusions: The whole pattern of results confirms that the centrofrontal areas showed an earlier synchronization (i.e., they fall asleep first). This finding implies a coexistence of wakelike and sleeplike electrical activity during sleep in different cortical areas. It also implies that the process of progressive brain disconnection from the external world as we fall asleep does not necessarily affect primary and higher-order cortices at the same time.

Many of these studies utilize microelectrodes connected to specialized amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We recently measured the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and demonstrated that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential difficulties in using microelectrodes. Methods Human iEEG data were digitally filtered to simulate the signal recorded by a hybrid grid (two macroelectrodes and eight microelectrodes) connected to a standard EEG amplifier. The filtered iEEG data were read by three trained epileptologists, and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) were detected with a well-known algorithm. The filtering method was verified experimentally by recording an injected EEG signal in a saline bath with the same physical acquisition system used to generate the model. Several electrodes underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Key Findings Macroelectrode recordings were unaltered compared to the source iEEG signal, but microelectrodes attenuated low frequencies. The attenuated signals were difficult to interpret: all three clinicians changed their clinical scoring of slowing and seizures when presented with the same data recorded on different sized electrodes. The HFO detection algorithm was oversensitive with microelectrodes, classifying many more HFOs than when the same data were recorded with macroelectrodes. In addition, during experimental recordings the microelectrodes produced much greater noise as well as large baseline fluctuations, creating sharply contoured transients, and superimposed false HFOs. SEM of these microelectrodes demonstrated marked variability in exposed electrode surface area, lead fractures, and sharp edges. Significance Microelectrodes should not be used with low impedance (<1G) amplifiers due to severe signal attenuation and variability that changes clinical interpretations. The current method of preparing microelectrodes can leave sharp edges and nonuniform amounts of exposed wire. Even when recorded with higher impedance amplifiers, microelectrode data are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to interpret. Great care must be taken when analyzing iEEG from high impedance microelectrodes.

Having a framework for evaluating the performance of dry electrodes would facilitate this process and help EEG system developers to test their designs. This paper describes an evaluation method for dry electrode EEG recordings. The framework includes a setup for synchronous recordings with a parallel dry and gel electrode montage procedure. Several protocols are implemented to evaluate both the time and frequency content of the signal and to compute the setup and settling time. Signal quality was evaluated using signal correlations, SNR and P300 component characteristics. The preliminary data analysis and results show that a comparison between gel and dry electrodes is possible but improvements need to be made to the current evaluation framework.

For cases where nonstationary signals are multi-component, a decomposition method like multi-channel empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is used to simultaneously decompose the multi-channel signals into their intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We then apply the Johansen method on the IF laws to assess the phase synchrony within multivariate nonstationary signals. The proposed approach is validated first using multi-channel synthetic signals. The method is then used for quantifying the inter-hemispheric EEG asynchrony during ictal and inter-ictal periods using a newborn EEG seizure/non-seizure database of five subjects. For this application, pair-wise phase synchrony measures may not be able to account for phase interactions between multiple channels. Furthermore, the classical definition of phase synchrony, which is based on the rational relationships between phases, may not reveal the hidden phase interdependencies caused by irrational long-run relationships. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the differentiation of unwrapped phase as well as other IF estimation techniques. The results obtained on newborn EEG signals confirm that the generalized phase synchrony within EEG channels increases significantly during ictal periods. A statistically consistent phase coupling is also observed within the non-seizure segments supporting the concept of constant inter-hemispheric connectivity in the newborn brain during inter-ictal periods.

Coupling of infraslow fluctuations in autonomic and central vigilance markers: Skin temperature, EEG beta power and ERP P300 latency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Skin temperature; Vigilance; Sustained attention; Event related potential; Electroencephalography; P300; Distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient; Beta oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOTAL SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; WAKING EEG; PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; CORE TEMPERATURE; TASK-PERFORMANCE; TIME-COURSE; BODY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Even under thermoneutral conditions, skin temperature fluctuates spontaneously, most prominently at distal parts of the body. These fluctuations were shown to be associated with fluctuations in vigilance: mild manipulation of skin temperature during nocturnal sleep affects sleep depth and the power spectral density of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and fluctuations in skin temperature during daytime wakefulness are related to sleep propensity and task performance. The association of daytime skin temperature fluctuations with EEG markers of vigilance has not previously been investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between daytime fluctuations in skin temperature with those in two quantitative EEG measures: the power spectral density of background EEG, and the event related potential (ERP) elicited by visual stimuli. High-density EEG and skin temperature were obtained in eight healthy adults five times a day while they performed a visual sustained-attention task. Assessments were made after a night of normal sleep and after the challenge of a night of total sleep deprivation. Fluctuations in the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient measured from the earlobe and mastoid were associated with fluctuations in parieto-occipital high beta band (20-40 Hz) power of the pre-stimulus background EEG, but only after sleep deprivation. The temperature fluctuations were moreover associated with fluctuations in the latency of the P300 elicited by the stimulus. The findings demonstrate close association between fluctuations in an autonomic correlate of the vigilance state (i.e. the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient), and fluctuations in central nervous system correlates of the vigilance state (i.e. background EEG and ERP). The findings are of theoretical and practical relevance for the assessment and manipulation of vigilance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Following his suggestion, Beck started studies on the electrical brain activity of animals. He recorded negative electrical potentials in several brain areas evoked by peripheral sensory impulses. Using this technique, Beck localised various centres in the brain of several animal species. In doing this, he discovered continuous electrical oscillations in the electrical brain activity and noted that these oscillations ceased after sensory stimulation. This was the first description of desynchronisation in electrical brain potentials. He published these findings in 1890 in the German Centralblatt fur Physiologie. Immediately, an intense discussion arose under physiologists on the question who could claim being the founder of electroencephalography. Ultimately, Richard Caton from Liverpool showed that he had performed similar experiments in monkeys years earlier. Nevertheless, Beck added several new elements to the nature of electrical brain activity, such as evoked potentials and desynchronisation. In looking back, Adolf Beck can be regarded, next to Richard Caton and together with Hans Berger (who later introduced the electrical brain recording method to humans), as one of the founders of electroencephalography.

We presented faces at 14 frequency rates (1.0-16.66 Hz) to human observers while recording high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). Different face exemplars elicited a larger steady-state visual evoked (ssVEP) response than when the same face was repeated, but only for stimulation frequencies between 4 and 8.33 Hz, with a maximal difference at 5.88 Hz (170 ms cycle). The effect was confined to the exact stimulation frequency and localized over the right occipito-temporal cortex. At high frequency rates ( > 10 Hz), the response to different and identical exemplars did not differ, suggesting that the fine-grained analysis needed for individual face discrimination cannot be completed before the next face interrupts, or competes, with the processed face. At low rates ( < 3 Hz), repetition suppression could not be identified at the stimulation frequency, suggesting that the neural response to an individual face is temporally dispersed and distributed over different processes. These observations indicate that at a temporal rate of 170 ms (6 faces/s) the face perception network is able to fully discriminate between each individual face presented, providing information about the temporal bottleneck of individual face discrimination in humans. These results also have important practical implications for optimizing paradigms that rely on repetition suppression, and open an avenue for investigating complex visual processes at an optimal range of stimulation frequency rates.

In particular, the modulations of beta power during preparation and execution of complex movements in different contexts were barely investigated. Here, we analysed the beta oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) in a precued grasping task in which we manipulated two critical parameters: the grip type (precision vs. side grip) and the force (high vs. low force) required to pull an object along a horizontal axis. A cue was presented 3 s before a GO signal and provided full, partial or no information about the two movement parameters. We measured beta power over the centroparietal areas during movement preparation and execution as well as during object hold. We explored the modulations of power in relation to the amount and type of prior information provided by the cue. We also investigated how beta power was affected by the grip and force parameters. We observed an increase in beta power around the cue onset followed by a decrease during movement preparation and execution. These modulations were followed by a transient power increase during object hold. This pattern of modulations did not differ between the 4 movement types (2 grips x2 forces). However, the amount and type of prior information provided by the cue had a significant effect on the beta power during the preparatory delay. We discuss how these results fit with current hypotheses on the functional role of beta oscillations.

For example, studies utilizing the stop signal task have reported slower response times to "GO" stimuli when the preceding trial involved the presentation of a "STOP" signal. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this behavioral after-effect are unclear. To address this, behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures were examined in 18 young adults (18-30 years) on "GO" trials following a previously "Successful Inhibition" trial (pSI), a previously "Failed Inhibition" trial (pFI), and a previous "GO" trial (pGO). Like previous research, slower response times were observed during both pSI and pFI trials (i.e., "GO" trials that were preceded by a successful and unsuccessful inhibition trial, respectively) compared to pGO trials (i.e., "GO" trials that were preceded by another "GO" trial). Interestingly, response time slowing was greater during pSI trials compared to pFI trials, suggesting executive control is influenced by both task set switching and persisting motor inhibition processes. Follow-up behavioral analyses indicated that these effects resulted from between-trial control adjustments rather than repetition priming effects. Analyses of inter-electrode coherence (IEC) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) indicated that both pSI and pFI trials showed greater phase synchrony during the inter-trial interval compared to pGO trials. Unlike the IEC findings, differential ITC was present within the beta and alpha frequency bands in line with the observed behavior (pSI > pFI > pGO), suggestive of more consistent phase synchrony involving motor inhibition processes during the ITI at a regional level. These findings suggest that between-trial control adjustments involved with task-set switching and motor inhibition processes influence subsequent performance, providing new insights into the dynamic nature of executive control.

The paper presents the detection of human mental states based on some salient features of EEG signal. For this purpose seven emotional states have been specified such as relax, thought, memory related, motor action, pleasant, fear, and enjoying music. Several EEG signals have been collected for these states and analyzed using discrete wavelet transform. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract different significant features from the analyzed signal by computing the subband coefficients and applying statistical measures on them. Among various statistical measures maximum and minimum value, mean and standard deviation of wavelet coefficients in each subband are chosen which indicate the dispersion in different mental states and help to evaluate them. The analyzed results are compared with the spectrum analysis. It is found that wavelet analysis provides more effective way in the functioning of the brain to study of mental behavior in compare with Fourier analysis.	[Ahmed, Tazrin; Islam, Monira; Yusuf, Md.

In addition, the analysis of EEG/fMRI data provides a fundamental insight into the precise physiological meaning of both fMRI and EEG data. Routine application of EEG/fMRI for localization of epileptic sources is hampered by large artefacts in the EEG, caused by switching of scanner gradients and heartbeat effects. Residuals of the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts are similarly shaped as epileptic spikes, and may therefore cause false identification of spikes. In this study, new ideas and methods are presented to remove gradient artefacts and to reduce BCG artefacts of different shapes that mutually overlap in time. Gradient artefacts can be removed efficiently by subtracting an average artefact template when the EEG sampling frequency and EEG low-pass filtering are sufficient in relation to MR gradient switching (Goncalves et al., 2007). When this is not the case, the gradient artefacts repeat themselves at time intervals that depend on the remainder between the fMRI repetition time and the closest multiple of the EEG acquisition time. These repetitions are deterministic, but difficult to predict due to the limited precision by which these timings are known. Therefore, we propose to estimate gradient artefact repetitions using a clustering algorithm, combined with selective averaging. Clustering of the gradient artefacts yields cleaner EEG for data recorded during scanning of a 3 T scanner when using a sampling frequency of 2048 Hz. It even gives clean EEG when the EEG is sampled with only 256 Hz. Current BCG artefacts-reduction algorithms based on average template subtraction have the intrinsic limitation that they fail to deal properly with artefacts that overlap in time. To eliminate this constraint, the precise timings of artefact overlaps were modelled and represented in a sparse matrix. Next, the artefacts were disentangled with a least squares procedure. The relevance of this approach is illustrated by determining the BCG artefacts in a data set consisting of 29 healthy subjects recorded in a 1.5 T scanner and 15 patients with epilepsy recorded in a 3 T scanner. Analysis of the relationship between artefact amplitude, duration and heartbeat interval shows that in 22% (1.5 T data) to 30% (3 T data) of the cases BCG artefacts show an overlap. The BCG artefacts of the EEG/fMRI data recorded on the 1.5 T scanner show a small negative correlation between HBI and BCG amplitude. In conclusion, the proposed methodology provides a substantial improvement of the quality of the EEG signal without excessive computer power or additional hardware than standard EEG-compatible equipment.

However, traditional visual analysis of icEEG is often challenging. The typical simultaneous display of multiple electrode channels can prevent an in-depth understanding of the spatial-time course of brain activity. In recent decades, advances in the field of neuroimaging have provided powerful new tools for the analysis and display of signals in the brain. These methods can now be applied to icEEG to map electrical signal information onto a three-dimensional rendering of a patient's cortex and graphically observe the changes in voltage over time. This approach provides rapid visualization of seizures and normal activity propagating over the brain surface and can also illustrate subtle changes that might be missed by traditional icEEG analysis. In addition, the direct mapping of signal information onto accurate anatomical structures can assist in the precise targeting of sites for epilepsy surgery and help correlate electrical activity with behavior. Bringing icEEG data into a standardized anatomical space will also enable neuroimaging methods of statistical analysis to be applied. As new technologies lead to a dramatic increase in the rate of data acquisition, these novel visualization and analysis techniques will play an important role in processing the valuable information obtained through icEEG.

Previous studies focus on analyzing functional connectivity averaged over a certain time and frequency window which is generally not sufficient to address the time-varying evolution of the connectivity patterns. In this paper, we propose a framework to describe the dynamic properties of functional connectivity in the brain. The proposed approach is based on constructing time-varying connectivity graphs from multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) data, using subspace analysis to detect network-wide changes, identifying key event intervals and then extracting representative networks that describe the connectivity in each event interval. This framework is evaluated for EEG data, containing error-related negativity (ERN) component related to cognitive control. For each time interval, the statistically significant connectivity patterns are presented to illustrate the dynamic nature of functional connectivity.

Herein, we propose a novel theoretical framework, spatio-temporal Granger causality, which allows us to more reliably and precisely estimate the Granger causality from experimental datasets possessing time-varying properties caused by physiological oscillations. Within this framework, Granger causality is redefined as a global index measuring the directed information flow between two time series with time-varying properties. Both theoretical analyses and numerical examples demonstrate that Granger causality is a monotonically increasing function of the temporal resolution used in the estimation. This is consistent with the general principle of coarse graining, which causes information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale details in time and space. Our results confirm that the Granger causality at the finer spatio-temporal scales considerably outperforms the traditional approach in terms of an improved consistency between two resting-state scans of the same subject. To optimally estimate the Granger causality, the proposed theoretical framework is implemented through a combination of several approaches, such as dividing the optimal time window and estimating the parameters at the fine temporal and spatial scales. Taken together, our approach provides a novel and robust framework for estimating the Granger causality from fMRI, EEG, and other related data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Remark on the Most Informative EEG Signal Components In a Super-scalable Method for Functional State Classification Based on the Wavelet Decomposition	V CONGRESS OF THE RUSSIAN PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	5th Congress of the Russian-Psychological-Society (RPS)	FEB 14-18, 2012	Moscow, RUSSIA	Russian Psychol Soc		Functional state; Stress; Calm wakefulness; Automated classification; electroencephalogram; Wavelet decomposition; CDF wavelets; Frequency range; Frequency localization		Technologies for automated real-time classification of functional states are essential for supervision over operators of critical infrastructure, stress resistance evaluation, functional studies of sportsmen. They also open new horizons for automated educational applications and applications for phobia therapy, especially supported by virtual reality technologies, as they allow the automated adaptation of tasks in real time. In 2012 a novel approach for the functional state automated classification based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data was introduced by ED. Livshitz et al. The approach efficiently utilizes CDF 9/7 wavelet decomposition instead of classical Fourier analysis and provides a promising classification reliability. In this paper connections between a set of estimators that were identified as the most informative for this approach and expert knowledge used in EEG data analysis and manual functional state classification are studied. The formalization of these connections is based on a fact that in spite of substantial differences between CDF wavelets and standard trigonometric functions used in Fourier analysis wavelet-based estimators have a good localization in frequency domain.

We use exogenous frequency tagging to induce steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) while subjects perform a face-car discrimination task, the difficulty of which varies on a trial-to-trial basis by varying the noise (phase coherence) in the image. We simultaneously analyze amplitude modulations of the SSVEP and endogenous alpha activity as a function of task difficulty. SSVEP modulation can be viewed as a neural marker of attention toward/away from the primary task, while modulation of post-stimulus alpha is closely related to cortical information processing. We find that as the task becomes more difficult, the amplitude of SSVEP decreases significantly, approximately 250-450 ms post-stimulus. Significant changes in endogenous alpha amplitude follow SSVEP modulation, occurring at approximately 400-700 ms post-stimulus and, unlike the SSVEP, the alpha amplitude is increasingly suppressed as the task becomes less difficult. Our results demonstrate simultaneous measurement of endogenous and exogenous oscillations that are modulated by task difficulty, and that the specific timing of these modulations likely reflects underlying information processing flow during perceptual decision-making.

J	Bang, JW; Choi, JS; Park, KR				Bang, Jae Won; Choi, Jong-Suk; Park, Kang Ryoung			Noise Reduction in Brainwaves by Using Both EEG Signals and Frontal Viewing Camera Images	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; BCI; LDA; SVM	ARTIFACT REMOVAL; GAZE-TRACKING; COMPUTER; CLASSIFICATION; ERROR; P300	Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used in various applications, including human-computer interfaces, diagnosis of brain diseases, and measurement of cognitive status. However, EEG signals can be contaminated with noise caused by user's head movements. Therefore, we propose a new method that combines an EEG acquisition device and a frontal viewing camera to isolate and exclude the sections of EEG data containing these noises. This method is novel in the following three ways. First, we compare the accuracies of detecting head movements based on the features of EEG signals in the frequency and time domains and on the motion features of images captured by the frontal viewing camera. Second, the features of EEG signals in the frequency domain and the motion features captured by the frontal viewing camera are selected as optimal ones. The dimension reduction of the features and feature selection are performed using linear discriminant analysis. Third, the combined features are used as inputs to support vector machine (SVM), which improves the accuracy in detecting head movements. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect head movements with an average error rate of approximately 3.22%, which is smaller than that of other methods.

In the present study we investigated the interaction of EEG rhythms during the experience of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). For this purpose we analyzed data obtained from patients suffering from persistent AVHs, focusing on the mode that the phase of theta oscillations modulate the amplitude of the broad gamma EEG oscillations. Our results indicate increased phase coupling between theta and gamma rhythms observed in the left frontotemporal cortices during AVHs, under eyes closed condition. The average differences of theta-gamma coupling between hallucinatory and resting stages in the left temporal area were found to be statistically significant. These results suggest that a theta-gamma interaction may be involved in the production and experience of AVHs in patients suffering from schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The 512-second long EEG data (recorded with 64 electrodes) are first decomposed into 64 components by independent component analysis (ICA) for each participant. Then, the spatial maps showing dipolar brain activity are selected in terms of the residual dipole variance through a single dipole model in brain imaging, and clustered into a pre-defined number (estimated by the minimum description length) of clusters. Subsequently, the temporal courses of the EEG theta and alpha oscillations of each component for each cluster are produced and correlated with the temporal courses of tonal and rhythmic features of the music. Using this approach, we found that the extracted temporal courses of the theta and alpha oscillations along central and occipital area of scalp in two of the selected clusters significantly correlated with the musical features representing progressions in the rhythmic content of the stimulus. We suggest that this demonstrates that with the proposed approach, we have managed to discover what kinds of brain responses were elicited when a participant was listening continuously to the long piece of naturalistic music.

Non-identical smoothing operators for estimating time-frequency interdependence in electrophysiological recordings	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Coherence; Time-frequency analysis; Electroencephalography; Functional connectivity; Neural synchronization	NEURAL SYNCHRONY; COHERENCE; SIGNALS; TRANSFORM	Synchronization of neural activity from distant parts of the brain is crucial for the coordination of cognitive activities. Because neural synchronization varies both in time and frequency, time-frequency (T-F) coherence is commonly employed to assess interdependences in electrophysiological recordings. T-F coherence entails smoothing the cross and power spectra to ensure statistical consistency of the estimate, which reduces its T-F resolution. This trade-off has been described in detail when the cross and power spectra are smoothed using identical smoothing operators, which may yield spurious coherent frequencies. In this article, we examine the use of non-identical smoothing operators for the estimation of T-F interdependence, i.e., phase synchronization is characterized by phase locking between signals captured by the cross spectrum and we may hence improve the trade-off by selectively smoothing the auto spectra. We first show that the frequency marginal density of the present estimate is bound within [0,1] when using non-identical smoothing operators. An analytic calculation of the bias and variance of present estimators is performed and compared with the bias and variance of standard T-F coherence using Monte Carlo simulations. We then test the use of non-identical smoothing operators on simulated data, whose T-F properties are known through construction. Finally, we analyze empirical data from eyes-closed surface electroencephalography recorded in human subjects to investigate alpha-band synchronization. These analyses show that selectively smoothing the auto spectra reduces the bias of the estimator and may improve the detection of T-F interdependence in electrophysiological data at high temporal resolution.

Methods: Multichannel EEG responses evoked by median nerve stimulation were recorded from six healthy participants. We investigated the directional connectivity of the evoked responses by assessing the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) among five neuronal nodes (brainstem, thalamus and three in the primary sensorimotor cortex), which had been identified by using the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm. We analyzed directional connectivity separately in the low (1-200 Hz, LF) and high (450-750 Hz, HF) frequency ranges. Results: LF forward connectivity showed peaks at 16, 20, 30 and 50 ms post-stimulus. An estimate of the strength of connectivity was modulated by feedback involving cortical and subcortical nodes. In HF, forward connectivity showed peaks at 20, 30 and 50 ms, with no apparent feedback-related strength changes. Conclusions: In this first non-invasive study in humans, we documented directional connectivity across subcortical and cortical somatosensory pathway, discriminating transmission properties within LF and HF ranges. Significance: The combined use of FSS and PDC in a simple protocol such as median nerve stimulation sheds light on how high and low frequency components of the somatosensory evoked response are functionally interrelated in sustaining somatosensory perception in healthy individuals. Thus, these components may potentially be explored as biomarkers of pathological conditions. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim was to determine the possibility that this weakness in top-down control is reflected in changes in the cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (CFPAC) in the electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded from 50 healthy volunteers with their eyes closed before risk-taking propensity was assessed by behavioural measures, the domain-specific risk-taking (DOSPERT) scale and the Barrett impulsiveness scale (BIS). Correlation analyses between the CFPACs and the behavioural measures were performed. Results: The CFPACs were negatively correlated with the risk-taking DOSPERT and BIS scores in frontal (Fp2) and centro-parietal (C3, C4 and P4) regions. By contrast, the CFPACs were positively correlated with the risk-taking DOSPERT and BIS scores in the right hemisphere (T8 and P8). Conclusions: We suggest that frequent risk-taking behaviour is closely associated with the reduced interference of the cortical control network on the reward-oriented system. The CFPAC, which reflects the degree of interactions among functional systems, provides information about an individual's risk-taking propensity. Significance: The CFPAC may be a useful neurophysiological indicator of an individual's tendency towards risk-taking behaviours, which thus potentially contributes to evaluating the severity of the psychiatric diseases exhibiting abnormal risk-taking behaviours.

Nineteen sets of simulated EEG data were compared using the set of prediction filter coefficients. This method shows that we can precisely identify similar patterns between two simulated data set of subjects who are thinking of the same thought in a given time. Our approach shows that we can find the exact frequency component from the data which we attribute to thinking the same things. This result suggest that the methods used in this simulation may be applicable in the analysis of actual EEG data when two people are trying to communicate with each other or having the same thoughts.

For instance, the NAcc not only responds to appetitive and aversive information, but it also signals novelty, contextual deviance, and action monitoring. However, because most studies have investigated only one specific type of salience independently, it remains unclear how the NAcc concurrently differentiates between different forms of salience. To investigate this issue, we used intracranial electroencephalography in human epilepsy patients together with a previously established visual oddball paradigm. Here, three different oddball categories (novel, neutral, and target images) were infrequently presented among a standard scene image, and subjects responded to the target via button press. This task allowed us to differentiate "item novelty" (new vs neutral oddballs) from "contextual deviance" (neutral oddballs vs standard images) and "targetness" (target vs neutral oddballs). Time-frequency analysis revealed a dissociation between item novelty and contextual deviance on the basis of decreases in either theta (4-8 Hz) or beta power (20-30 Hz). Targetness, on the other hand, was signaled by positive deflections in the stimulus-locked local field potentials, which, importantly, correlated with subjects' reaction times. These findings indicate that, in an ongoing stream of information, the NAcc differentiates between types of salience by distinct neural mechanisms to guide goal-directed behavior.

Much less is known about how TMS-evoked responses depend on task-irrelevant steady perceptual input. Here, we examined ongoing alpha activity and the mean amplitude of EEG potentials in response to occipitally applied TMS as a function of task-irrelevant visual backgrounds. Responses to TMS were robustly modulated by photographs of natural scenes and man-made environments. These effects began as early as during the N100 and continued for several hundred milliseconds after the stimulation. There was also a more general effect of background along with other stimuli, such as blank backgrounds, sinusoidal gratings and moving dot-patterns. This effect was observable from ongoing alpha activity as well. Based on these results we conclude that different types of steady perceptual input modulate visual cortex reactivity and/or connectivity and it is possible to measure these modulations by combining TMS with electroencephalography.

Comparing parametric and nonparametric methods for detecting phase synchronization in EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Phase synchronization; Autoregressive modeling; EEG	VOLUME-CONDUCTION; DYNAMICS; MODEL; ARTIFACTS; INDEX	Detecting significant periods of phase synchronization in EEG recordings is a non-trivial task that is made especially difficult when considering the effects of volume conduction and common sources. In addition, EEG signals are often confounded by non-neural signals, such as artifacts arising from muscle activity or external electrical devices. A variety of phase synchronization analysis methods have been developed with each offering a different approach for dealing with these confounds. We investigate the use of a parametric estimation of the time-frequency transform as a means of improving the detection capability for a range of phase analysis methods. We argue that such an approach offers numerous benefits over using standard nonparametric approaches. We then demonstrate the utility of our technique using both simulated and actual EEG data by showing that the derived phase synchronization estimates are more robust to noise and volume conduction effects.

Neural mass modeling of power-line magnetic fields effects on brain activity	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural mass models; power-line magnetic fields; electroencephalogram (EEG); synaptic plasticity; brain stimulation	ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; BIOPHYSICAL MODEL; RESTING EEG; DYNAMICS; EXPOSURE; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS	Neural mass models are an appropriate framework to study brain activity, combining a high degree of biological realism while being mathematically tractable. These models have been used, with a certain success, to simulate brain electric (electroencephalography, EEG) and metabolic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) activity. However, concrete applications of neural mass models have remained limited to date. Motivated by experimental results obtained in humans, we propose in this paper a neural mass model designed to study the interaction between power-line magnetic fields (MFs) (60 Hz in North America) and brain activity. The model includes pyramidal cells; dendrite-projecting, slow GABAergic neurons; soma-projecting, fast GABAergic neurons; and glutamatergic interneurons. A simple phenomenological model of interaction between the induced electric field and neuron membranes is also considered, along with a model of post-synaptic calcium concentration and associated changes in synaptic weights Simulated EEG signals are produced in a simple protocol, both in the absence and presence of a 60 Hz MF. These results are discussed based on results obtained previously in humans. Notably, results highlight that (1) EEG alpha (812 Hz) power can be modulated by weak membrane depolarizations induced by the exposure; (2) the level of input noise has a significant impact on EEG power modulation; and (3) the threshold value in MF flux density resulting in a significant effect on the EEG depends on the type of neuronal populations modulated by the MF exposure. Results obtained from the model shed new light on the effects of power-line MFs on brain activity, and will provide guidance in future human experiments. This may represent a valuable contribution to international regulation agencies setting guidelines on MF values to which the general public and workers can be exposed.	[Modolo, J.; Thomas, A.

Left temporal alpha-band activity reflects single word intelligibility	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech intelligibility; degraded speech; noise-vocoding; alpha oscillations; left inferior temporal cortex		The electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of degraded speech perception have been explored in a number of recent studies. However, such investigations have often been inconclusive as to whether observed differences in brain responses between conditions result from different acoustic properties of more or less intelligible stimuli or whether they relate to cognitive processes implicated in comprehending challenging stimuli. In this study we used noise vocoding to spectrally degrade monosyllabic words in order to manipulate their intelligibility. We used spectral rotation to generate incomprehensible control conditions matched in terms of spectral detail. We recorded EEG from 14 volunteers who listened to a series of noise vocoded (NV) and noise-vocoded spectrally rotated (rNV) words, while they carried out a detection task. We specifically sought components of the EEG response that showed an interaction between spectral rotation and spectral degradation. This reflects those aspects of the brain electrical response that are related to the intelligibility of acoustically degraded monosyllabic words, while controlling for spectral detail. An interaction between spectral complexity and rotation was apparent in both evoked and induced activity. Analyses of event-related potentials showed an interaction effect for a P300-like component at several centro-parietal electrodes. Time frequency analysis of the EEG signal in the alpha-band revealed a monotonic increase in event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the NV but not the rNV stimuli in the alpha band at a left temporo-central electrode cluster from 420-560 ms reflecting a direct relationship between the strength of alpha-band ERD and intelligibility. By matching NV words with their incomprehensible rNV homologues, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of evoked and induced processes involved in degraded speech perception, largely uncontaminated by purely acoustic effects.

We therefore focused on resting electroencephalography (EEG) in order to reveal potential alternative measures of the patient's current state independent of rather complex abilities (e.g., language comprehension). Resting EEG was recorded in nine minimally conscious state (MCS) and eight vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) patients. Behavioral assessments were conducted using the Coma-Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). The signal was analyzed in the frequency domain and association between resting EEG and CRS-R score as well as clinical diagnosis were calculated using Pearson correlation and repeated-measures ANOVAs. The analyses revealed robust positive correlations between CRS-R score and ratios between frequencies above 8 Hz and frequencies below 8 Hz. Furthermore, the frequency of the spectral peak was also highly indicative of the patient's CRS-R score. Concerning differences between clinical diagnosis and healthy controls, it could be revealed that while VS/UWS patients showed higher delta and theta activity than controls, MCS did not differ from controls in this frequency range. Alpha activity, on the other hand, was strongly decreased in both patient groups as compared to controls. The strong relationship between various resting EEG parameters and CRS-R score provides significant clinical relevance. Not only is resting activity easily acquired at bedside, but furthermore, it does not depend on explicit cooperation of the patient. Especially in cases where behavioral assessment is difficult or ambiguous, spectral analysis of resting EEG can therefore complement clinical diagnosis.

However, it remains unclear what pattern is associated with the inhibition of a planned motor response. Therefore, we performed TMS-EEG recording during a go/stop task, in which participants were instructed to click a computer mouse with a right index finger when an indicator that was moving with a constant velocity reached a target (go trial) or to avoid the click when the indicator randomly stopped just before it reached the target (stop trial). Single-pulse TMS to the left (contralateral) or right (ipsilateral) motor cortex was applied 500 ms before or just at the target time. TEPs related to motor execution and inhibition were obtained by subtractions between averaged EEG waveforms with and without TMS. As a result, in TEPs induced by both contralateral and ipsilateral TMS, small oscillations were followed by a prominent negative deflection around the TMS site peaking at approximately 100 ms post-TMS (N100), and a less pronounced later positive component (LPC) over the broad areas that was centered at the midline-central site in both go and stop trials. However, compared to the pattern in go and stop trials with TMS at 500 ms before the target time, N100 and LPC were differently modulated in the go and stop trials with TMS just at the target time. The amplitudes of both N100 and LPC decreased in go trials, while the amplitude of LPC decreased and the latency of LPC was delayed in both go and stop trials. These results suggested that TMS-induced neuronal reactions in the motor cortex and subsequent their propagation to surrounding cortical areas might change functionally according to task demand when executing and inhibiting a motor response	[Yamanaka, Kentaro] Showa Womens Univ, Grad Sch Human Life Sci, Tokyo 1548533, Japan; [Kadota, Hiroshi; Nozaki, Daichi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Educ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kadota, Hiroshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst, Kochi, Japan		Yamanaka, K (corresponding author), Showa Womens Univ, Grad Sch Human Life Sci, Setagaya Ku, 1-7Taishido, Tokyo 1548533, Japan.	kentaro@swu.ac.jp		Nozaki, Daichi/0000-0002-1338-8337	JSPS [22500529, 22700590, 20670008, LS034]; Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka	JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka	This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C; #22500529) from JSPS and Showa Women's University to Kentaro Yamanaka, Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B; #22700590) from JSPS to Hiroshi Kadota, and Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (S; #20670008) from JSPS and the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (#LS034) from JSPS to Daichi Nozaki.		57	9	11	0	7	FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

But this gel may make patients uncomfortable because of possible skin allergies during long-term measurement. The measurement procedure is also tedious because pasting the electrodes to the patients scalp is time consuming. The required lead wires also constrain patient movements. This study uses conductive fabric as the capacitive electrode for EEG measurements. This paper provides the design considerations and the related theoretical analysis for this method. A long-term, null-input experiment was conducted to verify the stability of the proposed system. Experiments were conducted over the hair of patients to verify the feasibility of using the method during EEG monitoring. Various mental task experiments were also conducted. The changes in frequency domain analysis show that the proposed strategy discriminates between different mental tasks.

Using scalp-recorded EEG in healthy human participants, we demonstrate that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta phase and posterior gamma power is enhanced during the encoding of visual stimuli which participants later on remember versus items which participants subsequently forget ("subsequent memory effect," SME). Conventional wavelet analyses and source localizations revealed SMEs in spectral power of theta-, alpha-, and gamma-band. Successful compared to unsuccessful encoding was reflected in increased theta-band activity in right frontal cortex as well as increased gamma-band activity in parietal-occipital regions. Moreover, decreased alpha-band activity in prefrontal and occipital cortex was also related to successful encoding. Overall, these findings support the idea that during the formation of new memories frontal cortex regions interact with cortical representations in posterior areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

By looking at the intrinsic elements of the transform we develop a novel strategy for computationally efficient and accurate real-time analysis. Test signals, as well as analysis on EEG and ECG signals for detecting relevant features are presented in support of our methodology. Additional unique insight is shown in some of the intrinsic elements of the algorithm, including some known errors in the use of the popular cubic spline method. Discussions of the primary design considerations and trade-offs are described throughout, aiming at a rounded view of what a real-time HHT implementation involves.

On-off intermittency of thalamo-cortical neuronal network oscillations in the electroencephalogram of rodents with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy	DYNAMICS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN BIOMEDICAL PHOTONICS IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Dynamics and Fluctuations in Biomedical Photonics IX held at the SPIE Photonics West Conference	FEB 02-04, 2013	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Intermittency; neuronal network; wavelet analysis; spike-wave discharges; sleep spindles; EEG; absence epilepsy; pattern recognition	SLEEP SPINDLES; WAVE DISCHARGES	Spike-wave discharges are electroencephalographic hallmarks of absence epilepsy. Spike-wave discharges are known to originate from thalamo-cortical neuronal network that normally produces sleep spindle oscillations. Although both sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are considered as thalamo-cortical oscillations, functional relationship between them is still uncertain. The present study describes temporal dynamics of spike-wave discharges and sleep spindles as determined in long-time electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. We have proposed the wavelet-based method for the automatic detection of spike-wave discharges, sleep spindles (10-15Hz) and 5-9Hz oscillations in EEG. It was found that non-linear dynamics of spike-wave discharges and sleep spindles fits well to the law of 'on-off intermittency'. Intermittency in sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges implies that (1) temporal dynamics of these oscillations are deterministic in nature, and (2) it might be controlled by a system-level mechanism responsible for circadian modulation of neuronal network activity.

One window into the nature of the aberrant temporal dynamics in the cerebral cortex of PD patients can come from analysis of the patients electroencephalography (EEG). Rather than using spectral-based methods, we used data models based on delay differential equations (DDE) as non-linear time-domain classification tools to analyze EEG recordings from PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy and healthy individuals. Two sets of 50 1-s segments of 64-channel EEG activity were recorded from nine PD patients on and off medication and nine age matched controls. The 64 EEG channels were grouped into 10 clusters covering frontal, central, parietal, and occipital brain regions for analysis. DDE models were fitted to individual trials, and model coefficients and error were used as features for classification. The best models were selected using repeated random sub-sampling validation and classification performance was measured using the area under the ROC curve A'. In a companion paper, we show that DDEs can uncover hidden dynamical structure from short segments of simulated time series of known dynamical systems in high noise regimes. Using the same method for finding the best models, we found here that even short segments of EEG data in PD patients and controls contained dynamical structure, and moreover, that PD patients exhibited a greater dynamic range than controls. DDE model output on the means from one set of 50 trials provided nearly complete separation of PD patients off medication from controls: across brain regions, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves, A', varied from 0.95 to 1.0. For distinguishing PD patients on vs. off medication, classification performance A' ranged from 0.86 to 1.0 across brain regions. Moreover, the generalizability of the model to the second set of 50 trials was excellent, with A' ranging from 0.81 to 0.94 across brain regions for controls vs. PD off medication, and from 0.62 to 0.82 for PD on medication vs. off. Finally, model features significantly predicted individual patients' motor severity, as assessed with standard clinical rating scales.

EEG ANOMALIES IN ADULT ADHD SUBJECTS PERFORMING A WORKING MEMORY TASK	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; electroencephalography; event-related potential; event-related spectral changes or perturbations	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; AND/OR PDD-NOS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; FRENCH VERSION; ALPHA; LOAD	Functional imaging studies have revealed differential brain activation patterns in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) adult patients performing working memory (WM) tasks. The existence of alterations in WM-related cortical circuits during childhood may precede executive dysfunctions in this disorder in adults. To date, there is no study exploring the electrophysiological activation of WM-related neural networks in ADHD. To address this issue, we carried out an electroencephalographic (EEG) activation study associated with time frequency (TF) analysis in 15 adults with ADHD and 15 controls performing two visual N-back WM tasks, as well as oddball detection and passive fixation tasks. Frontal transient (phasic) theta event-related synchronization (ERS, 0-500 msec) was significantly reduced in ADHD as compared to control subjects. Such reduction was equally present in a task-independent manner. In contrast, the power of the later sustained (similar to 500-1200 msec) theta ERS for all tasks was comparable in ADHD and control groups. In active WM tasks, ADHD patients displayed lower alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD, similar to 200-900 msec) and higher subsequent alpha ERS (similar to 900-2400 msec) compared to controls. The time course of alpha ERD/ERS cycle was modified in ADHD patients compared to controls, suggesting that they are able to use late compensatory mechanisms in order to perform this WM task. These findings support the idea of an ADHD-related dysfunction of neural generators sub-serving attention directed to the incoming visual information. ADHD cases may successfully face WM needs depending on the preservation of sustained theta ERS and prolonged increase of alpha ERS at later post-stimulus time points. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Down-modulation of mu-activity through empathic top-down processes	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mu-suppression; Empathy; Perspective taking; Electroencephalograpy; Mirror neurons	EEG; SUPPRESSION; MOTOR; PAIN; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; OTHERS; ALPHA; PERCEPTION; IMITATION	Simulation theories argue that humans simulate motor processes of others to gain information about intentions and emotional states of others. Mu-suppression is a valid electrophysiological correlate of these processes. Mu-activity can be measured via electroencephalography (EEG) in the alpha-band (8-13Hz) above the sensorimotor cortex and is suppressed when actions are executed or observed. Based on a within-subject design, including 28 participants, it was tested whether the processes measured by mu-suppression could be modulated by empathic top-down-processes. Participants were asked to take the perspective of two actors, telling a story about a sad or neutral life event (video sequences). Afterwards, EEG was measured at central (C3, Cz, C4) and occipital (O1, Oz, O2) electrodes, while participants observed the actors drinking water (standardized video sequences, 8s duration). Fast fourier transformation showed stronger suppression of power in the alpha-range (relative to baseline) at central and occipital electrodes while the actor with the sad story was observed relative to the actor with the neutral story. Furthermore, measures of state empathy correlated positively with the difference of mu-suppression between executed and observed movements, an indicator of self-other discrimination. Thus, mirror neuron activity measured by mu-suppression is modulated by empathic processes.

In the early study of vigilance, blink frequency, the impedance of skin, body temperature and blood pressure and other physiological signals was used to estimate the vigilance. EEG signal can more directly reflect the brain's activity than other physiological signals, and EEG signal have a higher time resolution. In this paper, ERP component was used to analyze the alert state, according to this study, the use of ERP component analysis can reflect the subjects' alertness.

Application of SVM-RFE on EEG signals for detecting the most relevant scalp regions linked to affective valence processing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Affective valence; Brain oscillations; EEG; Feature extraction; Morlet wavelet; SVM-RFE	CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; STIMULI; EMOTION	In this work, event related potentials (ERPs) induced by visual stimuli categorized with different value of affective valence are studied. EEG signals are recorded during visualization of selected pictures belonging to International Affective Picture System (IAPS). A Morlet wavelet filter is used to transform the EEG input space to a topography-time-frequency feature space. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is applied for detecting scalp spectral dynamics of interest (SSDOIs) in this feature space, allowing to identify the most relevant time intervals, frequency bands and EEG channels. This feature selection method has proven to outperform the classical t-test in the discrimination of brain cortex regions involved in affective valence processing. Furthermore, the presented combination of feature extraction and selection techniques can be applied as an alternative in other different clinical applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A better understanding of cortical modifications after robot-assisted training could aid in refining rehabilitation therapy protocols for stroke patients. Modifications of cortical activity in healthy subjects were evaluated during voluntary active movement, passive robot-assisted motor movement, and motor imagery tasks performed under unimanual and bimanual protocols. Methods: Twenty-one channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded with a video EEG system in 8 subjects. The subjects performed robot-assisted tasks using the Bi-Manu Track robot-assisted arm trainer. The motor paradigm was executed during one-day experimental sessions under eleven unimanual and bimanual protocols of active, passive and imaged movements. The event-related-synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) approach to the EEG data was applied to investigate where movement-related decreases in alpha and beta power were localized. Results: Voluntary active unilateral hand movement was observed to significantly activate the contralateral side; however, bilateral activation was noted in all subjects on both the unilateral and bilateral active tasks, as well as desynchronization of alpha and beta brain oscillations during the passive robot-assisted motor tasks. During active-passive movement when the right hand drove the left one, there was predominant activation in the contralateral side. Conversely, when the left hand drove the right one, activation was bilateral, especially in the alpha range. Finally, significant contralateral EEG desynchronization was observed during the unilateral task and bilateral ERD during the bimanual task. Conclusions: This study suggests new perspectives for the assessment of patients with neurological disease. The findings may be relevant for defining a baseline for future studies investigating the neural correlates of behavioral changes after robot-assisted training in stroke patients.

We have addressed which brain regions are and the mechanisms involved in binocular rivalry using EEG and fMRI measurements of cortical activities during observations of competitive (rivalry) and cooperative (fusion) drifting vertical gratings. By applying an EEG-fMRI integrative method, we analyzed the time courses of multiple cortical sources of event-related potentials obtained under rivalry or fusion conditions. We detected significant cortical activities at bilateral MT+/V5 and the right prefrontal eye field in the rivalry condition; however, this may not reflect intrinsic alternation in binocular rivalry. Our findings suggest that novel integrative methods are necessary to investigate the distributed cortical network associated with binocular rivalry, through analysis of multiple cortical sources of event-related desynchronization and/or synchronization in certain frequency bands.

A new EEG biomarker of neurobehavioural impairment and sleepiness in sleep apnea patients and controls during extended wakefulness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Obstructive sleep apnea; Quantitative EEG; Neurobehavioural function; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Power spectral analysis; Sleep deprivation	SUSTAINED WAKEFULNESS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; PERFORMANCE; AGE; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCIES; POWER; TIME	Objective: To explore the use of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponent of the awake electroencephalogram (EEG) as a new alternative biomarker of neurobehavioural impairment and sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: Eight patients with moderate-severe OSA and nine non-OSA controls underwent a 40-h extended wakefulness challenge with resting awake EEG, neurobehavioural performance (driving simulator and psychomotor vigilance task) and subjective sleepiness recorded every 2-h. The DFA scaling exponent and power spectra of the EEG were calculated at each time point and their correlation with sleepiness and performance were quantified. Results: DFA scaling exponent and power spectra biomarkers significantly correlated with simultaneously tested performance and self-rated sleepiness across the testing period in OSA patients and controls. Baseline (8am) DFA scaling exponent but not power spectra were markers of impaired simulated driving after 24-h extended wakefulness in OSA (r = 0.738, p = 0.037). OSA patients had a higher scaling exponent and delta power during wakefulness than controls. Conclusions: The DFA scaling exponent of the awake EEG performed as well as conventional power spectra as a marker of impaired performance and sleepiness resulting from sleep loss. Significance: DFA may potentially identify patients at risk of neurobehavioural impairment and assess treatment effectiveness. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: Thirty-two patients were studied, subdivided in four categories based on IED frequency: groups A, B and C respectively with high, intermediate and low IED rate, and group D with no IED. Thirty minutes of slow-wave sleep EEG, low-pass filtered at 300 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz, were reviewed. IEDs and fast oscillations (gamma activity, 40-80 Hz; and ripples, >80 Hz) were marked. Each channel was classified as inside or outside the irritative zone and the SOZ. We calculated the number and rates of IEDs and fast oscillation, their co-occurrence, their frequency in the irritative zone and SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy to determine the SOZ in the overall population and separately for each group. Results: We analyzed 984 channels. Group A (high IED rate) showed the highest fast oscillation rate (gamma: 0.37 +/- 0.73; ripples: 0.17 +/- 0.26), followed by group B (gamma: 0.08 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.07 +/- 0.05), group C (gamma: 0.06 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.04 +/- 0.01), and finally group D, with very low values (gamma: 0.03 +/- 0; ripples: 0.03 +/- 0). IEDs co-occurred with gamma in 9.5% and with ripples in 3.2%; and gamma and ripples co-occurred with IEDs in 46.2% and 44.4%, respectively. The fast oscillations were more frequent inside than outside the irritative zone and the SOZ (p < 0.001). Compared to the IEDs, the fast oscillations were less sensitive (sensitivity: IEDs 78%, gamma 66% and ripples 48%) but more specific (specificity: IEDs 50%, gamma 76% and ripples 83%) and accurate (accuracy: IEDs 54%, gamma 74% and ripples 77%) in identifying the SOZ; the same results were reproduced for the different groups separately. Conclusions: This study confirms that fast oscillations can be recorded from the scalp EEG. Gamma activity and ripples are more frequent in patients with frequent IEDs and, in general, inside the irritative zone. However, compared to IEDs, gamma and ripples are less sensitive but more specific and accurate in identifying the SOZ, and this remains in patients with low fast oscillation rates. These findings suggest that IEDs and fast oscillations could share some common neuronal network, but gamma activity and ripples are a better biomarker of epileptogenicity (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Interictal epileptiform spikes were manually marked and their rate of occurrence compared between baseline and three 2 s periods spanning a 6 s viewing period. During successful, but not unsuccessful, encoding of the images there was a significant reduction in interictal epileptiform spike rate in the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. During the earliest encoding period (0-2000 ms after image presentation) in these trials there was a widespread decrease in the power of theta, alpha and beta band local field potential oscillations that coincided with emergent focal gamma frequency activity. Interictal epileptiform spike rate correlated with spectral band power changes and broadband (4-150 Hz) desynchronization, which predicted significant reduction in interictal epileptiform spike rate. Spike-triggered averaging of the field potential power spectrum detected a burst of low frequency synchronization 200 ms before the interictal epileptiform spikes that arose during this period of encoding. We conclude that interictal epileptiform spikes are modulated by the patterns of network oscillatory activity that accompany human memory offering a new mechanistic insight into the interplay of cognitive processing, local field potential dynamics and interictal epileptiform spike generation.

Recent findings suggest that alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are crucially involved in gating information between brain regions when allocating attention. The current study investigates whether aberrant modulation of alpha oscillations contributes to attention problems in ADHD patients. Methods: Magnetoencephalographic signals were recorded in adults with ADHD (n = 17) and healthy control subjects (n = 18) while they performed a visuospatial attention task. Cues directed attention to the left or right visual hemifield with an 80% validity with respect to the upcoming target. Results: Unlike the control group, subjects with ADHD showed a higher accuracy for invalidly cued right targets compared with invalidly cued left targets (p = .04). This coincided with an inability of the ADHD subjects to sustain the posterior hemispheric alpha lateralization in the period before the target for the left cue condition (p = .011). Furthermore, the control group showed a strong correlation between the degree of alpha lateralization and the magnitude of the cueing effect assessed in terms of accuracy (r(s) = .71, p = .001) and reaction times (r(s) = -.81, p < .001). These correlations were absent in the ADHD group. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that subjects with ADHD have a failure in sustaining hemispheric alpha lateralization when cued to the left, resulting in an attentional bias to the right visual hemifield. These findings suggest that aberrant modulations of alpha oscillations reflect attention problems in ADHD and might be related to the neurophysiological substrate of the disorder.

Indeed, beta band coherence is strongly related to motor act and sensitive stimuli. In this study we investigate the electrophysiological and cortical changes that occur when subjects are submitted to hand immobilization. We hypothesized that beta coherence oscillations act as a mechanism underlying inter-and intra-hemispheric changes. As a methodology for our study fifteen healthy individuals between the ages of 20 and 30 years were subjected to a right index finger task before and after hand immobilization while their brain activity pattern was recorded using quantitative electroencephalography. This analysis revealed that hand immobilization caused changes in frontal, central and parietal areas of the brain. The main findings showed a lower beta-2 band in frontal regions and greater cortical activity in central and parietal areas. In summary, the coherence increased in the frontal, central and parietal cortex, due to hand immobilization and it adjusted the brains functioning, which had been disrupted by the procedure. Moreover, the brain adaptation upon hand immobilization of the subjects involved inter-and intra-hemispheric changes.

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to analyze the capability of prediction of nociceptive responses based on the time-frequency representation (TFR) of EEG signal. Functions of spectral entropy, instantaneous power and instantaneous frequency were calculated in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure. Values of prediction probability of P-k above 0.75 and percentages of sensitivity and specificity above 70% and 65% respectively were achieved combining TFR functions with bispectral index (BIS) and with concentrations of propofol (Ce-Prop) and remifentanil (Ce-Remi).

J	Sato, N				Sato, Naoyuki			Fast entrainment of human electroencephalogram to a theta-band photic flicker during successful memory encoding	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						subsequent memory paradigm; SSVEP; EEG oscillations; object-place binding; transient dynamics; entrainment of rhythms; computer simulations	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; CHANNELS; MODEL	Theta band power (4-8 Hz) in the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is thought to be stronger during memory encoding for subsequently remembered items than for forgotten items. According to simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements, the memory-dependent EEG theta is associated with multiple regions of the brain. This suggests that the multiple regions cooperate with EEG theta synchronization during successful memory encoding. However, a question still remains: What kind of neural dynamic organizes such a memory-dependent global network? In this study, the modulation of the EEG theta entrainment property during successful encoding was hypothesized to lead to EEG theta synchronization among a distributed network. Then, a transient response of EEG theta to a theta-band photic flicker with a short duration was evaluated during memory encoding. In the results, flicker-induced EEG power increased and decreased with a time constant of several hundred milliseconds following the onset and the offset of the flicker, respectively. Importantly, the offset response of EEG power was found to be significantly decreased during successful encoding. Moreover, the offset response of the phase locking index was also found to associate with memory performance. According to computational simulations, the results are interpreted as a smaller time constant (i.e., faster response) of a driven harmonic oscillator rather than a change in the spontaneous oscillatory input. This suggests that the fast response of EEG theta forms a global EEG theta network among memory-related regions during successful encoding, and it contributes to a flexible formation of the network along the time course.

However, the incorporation of adaptive threshold determination procedure enhances the performance of proposed ES detector. Methods The detection procedure exploits the fact that the presence of instantaneous ES corresponds to the high instantaneous energy content at the high frequencies. In addition to the stochastic amplitude, sign and the location of appearance of triangular spikes in the synthetic EEG signal, its base-width is also considered to be variable for the nonstationary analysis. The five pairs of EEG signals, obtained from electrodes placed on the left and right frontal cortex of male adult WAG/Rij rats, are used for the testing of proposed adaptive scheme in the real-time environment, which is a genetic animal model of human epilepsy. Results The simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the choice of window function plays a significant role in the efficient detection of ESs. The computational complexity is found to be in trade-off relationship with the detection accuracy of algorithm. Conclusions It may be inferred that the real-time EEG signals (rat data) can be processed and analyzed using the proposed adaptive scheme for the ES detection, which supersedes the conventional techniques.

This approach, however, can omit a critical element of the neural response, i.e., the non-phase-locked ("induced") oscillatory activity. Recent investigations of the oscillatory characteristics of the auditory mismatch negativity (aMMN) identified a crucial role for theta phase locking and power. Oscillatory characteristics of the vMMN from 39 healthy young adults were investigated in order to establish whether theta phase locking plays a similar role in the vMMN response. We explored changes in phase locking, overall post-stimulus spectral power as well as non-phase-locked spectral power compared to baseline (-300 to 0 ms). These were calculated in the frequency range of 4-50 Hz and analysed using a non-parametric cluster based analysis. vMMN was found intermittently in a broad time interval 133584 ms post-stimulus and was associated with an early increase in theta phase locking (75-175 ms post-stimulus) that was not accompanied by an increase in theta power. Theta phase locking in the absence of an increase in theta power has been associated with the distribution and flow of information between spatially disparate neural locations. Additionally, in the 450-600 ms post-stimulus interval, deviant stimuli yielded a stronger decrease in non-phase-locked alpha power than standard stimuli, potentially reflecting a shift in attentional resources following the detection of change. The examination of oscillatory activity is crucial to the comprehensive analysis of a neural response to a stimulus, and when combined with evoked potentials (EPs) provide a more complete picture of neurocognitive processing.

During sleep, the functional brain network becomes more small-world-like. Here we test the hypothesis that the functional brain network during wakefulness becomes less optimal after sleep deprivation (SD). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded five times a day after a night of SD and after a night of normal sleep in eight young healthy subjects, both during eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state. Overall synchronization was determined with the synchronization likelihood (SL) and the phase lag index (PLI). From these coupling strength matrices the normalized clustering coefficient C (a measurement of local clustering) and path length L (a measurement of global integration) were computed. Both measures were normalized by dividing them by their corresponding C-s and L-s values of random control networks. SD reduced alpha band C/C-s and L/L-s and theta band C/C-s during eyes-closed resting state. In contrast, SD increased gamma-band C/C-s and L/L-s during eyes-open resting state. Functional relevance of these changes in network properties was suggested by their association with sleep deprivation-induced performance deficits on a sustained attention simple reaction time task. The findings indicate that SD results in a more random network of alpha-coupling and a more ordered network of gamma-coupling. The present study shows that SD induces frequency-specific changes in the functional network topology of the brain, supporting the idea that sleep plays a role in the maintenance of an optimal functional network.

Integration Operations during Irony Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ERP EVIDENCE; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; DISCOURSE; SENTENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL	The combined knowledge of word meanings and grammatical rules does not allow a listener to grasp the intended meaning of a speaker's utterance. Pragmatic inferences on the part of the listener are also required. The present work focuses on the processing of ironic utterances (imagine a slow day being described as "really productive'') because these clearly require the listener to go beyond the linguistic code. Such utterances are advantageous experimentally because they can serve as their own controls in the form of literal sentences (now imagine an active day being described as "really productive'') as we employ techniques from electrophysiology (EEG). Importantly, the results confirm previous ERP findings showing that irony processing elicits an enhancement of the P600 component (Regel et al., 2011). More original are the findings drawn from Time Frequency Analysis (TFA) and especially the increase of power in the gamma band in the 280-400 time-window, which points to an integration among different streams of information relatively early in the comprehension of an irony. This represents a departure from traditional accounts of language processing which generally view pragmatic inferences as late-arriving. We propose that these results indicate that unification operations between the linguistic code and contextual information play a critical role throughout the course of irony processing and earlier than previously thought.

Convincing evidence supporting those associations has been provided by studies using intracranial stimulation, pharmacological interventions and lesion studies. The emergence of novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) now allows to modulate brain oscillations directly. Particularly, tACS offers the unique opportunity to causally link brain oscillations of a specific frequency range to cognitive processes, because it uses sinusoidal currents that are bound to one frequency only. Using tACS allows to modulate brain oscillations and in turn to influence cognitive processes, thereby demonstrating the causal link between the two. Here, we review findings about the physiological mechanism of tACS and studies that have used tACS to modulate basic motor and sensory processes as well as higher cognitive processes like memory, ambiguous perception, and decision making.

Some patients suffering from severe neuromuscular diseases have difficulty controlling not only their bodies but also their eyes. Since these patients have difficulty gazing at specific visual stimuli or keeping their eyes open for a long time, they are unable to use the typical steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In this study, we introduce a new paradigm for SSVEP-based BCI, which can be potentially suitable for disabled individuals with impaired oculomotor function. Approach. The proposed electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI system allows users to express their binary intentions without needing to open their eyes. A pair of glasses with two light emitting diodes flickering at different frequencies was used to present visual stimuli to participants with their eyes closed, and we classified the recorded EEG patterns in the online experiments conducted with five healthy participants and one patient with severe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Main results. Through offline experiments performed with 11 participants, we confirmed that human SSVEP could be modulated by visual selective attention to a specific light stimulus penetrating through the eyelids. Furthermore, the recorded EEG patterns could be classified with accuracy high enough for use in a practical BCI system. After customizing the parameters of the proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm based on the offline analysis results, binary intentions of five healthy participants were classified in real time. The average information transfer rate of our online experiments reached 10.83 bits min(-1). A preliminary online experiment conducted with an ALS patient showed a classification accuracy of 80%. Significance. The results of our offline and online experiments demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm. It is expected that our 'eyes-closed' SSVEP-based BCI system can be potentially used for communication of disabled individuals with impaired oculomotor function.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer type of antiepileptic drug. A previous study reported that LEV might enhance mu rhythm and caused mu status in one subject. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of LEV on EEG frequency contents and ERD. Seventeen patients with epileptic foci outside the Rolandic area were recruited. The following studies were performed before and after chronically taking LEV. An electroencephalogram (EEG) with 10 minutes of resting state and 5 minutes covering 10 right thumb movements were recorded. Reaction time was evaluated with a simple visual reaction time test. EEG data were analyzed by S-transformation and relative band powers were calculated. The results showed that the relative powers of theta, alpha and beta band in frontal (F3 and F4) and occipital (01 and 02) leads and mu band in the centro-parietal (C3, C4, P3 and P4) leads were not changed by chronically taking LEV. No mu status was observed in any subject. However, the mean group ERD was enhanced at C3, Cz and P4 leads. Reaction time was similar before and after taking LEV. In conclusion, chronically taking LEV did not change the frequency contents of EEG and did not cause drowsiness, but enhanced ERD. The results suggest that chronically taking medication, such as LEV, is a plausible method to broaden the applicability of ERD-based brain-computer interfaces. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Locus of Subjective Control: Peculiarities of the Coherence of EEG Activity in the Resting State	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						coherence; EEG; locus of control (LC); internals; externals; Rotter's questionnaire	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; ALPHA	When studying the spatial organization of ongoing EEG, we calculated the coefficients of coherence, K-coh, in 60 healthy adults of both sexes characterized by different locus of subjective control, LC. The latter psychological trait was diagnosed using the Rotter questionnaire. Recording of EEG (21 leads; positions of the electrodes according to the 10-20 system) was performed in the resting state with the eyes closed; K-coh values were calculated for 20 lead pairs. Despite natural high interindividual variability, greater K-coh values for oscillations of all EEG frequency ranges and for the entire EEG spectrum (especially in fronto-central leads) were more frequently observed in the subgroup of subjects with internal LC (internals). Externals were characterized by greater numbers of relations with low K-coh values, while moderate and significant levels of coherence, especially for high-frequency EEG rhythms, were more typical of internals. The latter subjects more frequently and significantly differed from externals by greater K-coh values in lead pairs F3-C3, F4-C4, and Fp2-F4. In pairs O1-O2 and P4-O2, K-coh in internals were practically always smaller. The index of general internality demonstrated only positive correlations with the K-coh values for delta, beta, and gamma EEG oscillations.

Top-down influences on local networks: basic theory with experimental implications	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; population dynamics; neural mass models; top-down control; ECoG	FIELD-THEORY; ALPHA; PHASE; GAMMA; MODEL; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; CORTEX	The response of a population of cortical neurons to an external stimulus depends not only on the receptive field properties of the neurons, but also the level of arousal and attention or goal-oriented cognitive biases that guide information processing. These top-down effects on cortical neurons bias the output of the neurons and affect behavioral outcomes such as stimulus detection, discrimination, and response time. In any physiological study, neural dynamics are observed in a specific brain state; the background state partly determines neuronal excitability. Experimental studies in humans and animal models have also demonstrated that slow oscillations (typically in the alpha or theta bands) modulate the fast oscillations (gamma band) associated with local networks of neurons. Cross-frequency interaction is of interest as a mechanism for top-down or bottom up interactions between systems at different spatial scales. We develop a generic model of top-down influences on local networks appropriate for comparison with EEG. EEG provides excellent temporal resolution to investigate neuronal oscillations but is space-averaged on the cm scale. Thus, appropriate EEG models are developed in terms of population synaptic activity. We used the Wilson-Cowan population model to investigate fast (gamma band) oscillations generated by a local network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modified the Wilson-Cowan equations to make them more physiologically realistic by explicitly incorporating background state variables into the model. We found that the population response is strongly influenced by the background state. We apply the model to reproduce the modulation of gamma rhythms by theta rhythms as has been observed in animal models and human ECoG and EEG studies. The concept of a dynamic background state presented here using the Wilson-Cowan model can be readily applied to incorporate top-down modulation in more detailed models of specific cortical systems.

Brain oscillations in a random neural network	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Neural oscillations; Stochastic neural models; Random networks	SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; MUSHROOM BODIES; NEURONS; MODEL	It is well-known that rhythmic patterns of neural activity appear both in the normal and abnormal function of the brain. Apart from the standard bands of electric oscillations found in the electroencephalogram (EEG): from alpha (8-12 Hz) to delta waves (1-4 Hz), synchronized firing of neural populations characterize some complex cognitive functions such as memory, attention and consciousness. In the case of electrocardiogram (ECG) it is usually recognized that oscillations can be understood as the limit cycle of an underlying non-linear process in heart dynamics. However, the situation is not so clear for EEG and the origin and purpose of neural oscillations are still the subject of a heated debate. Our model is a version of the standard SIRS model from epidemiology in which susceptible, infected and recovered sites represent quiescent, firing and refractory neurons, respectively. Here we show that, in a SIRS random network epidemic model for neural activity, self-sustained oscillations appear in a restricted parameter region of the transition probabilities. This could explain the role of synchronized oscillations as a discriminant process for internal or external stimuli in brain dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Jane			A Joint Multimodal Group Analysis Framework for Modeling Corticomuscular Activity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Corticomuscular activity analysis; data fusion; EEG; EMG; group analysis; multimodal; Parkinson's disease	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; CORTEX; MUSCLE	Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple data sets such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides a useful tool for understanding human motor control systems. Two probably most popular methods are the pair-wise magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and simultaneously-recorded EMG signals, and partial least square (PLS). Unfortunately, MSC and PLS generally deal with only two types of data sets at the same time, while we may need to analyze more than two types of data sets. Moreover, it is not straightforward to extend MSC to the group level for combining results across subjects. Also, PLS can have the information mixing problem since only the variations in one data set are used to predict the other data set. To address these concerns, we propose a joint multimodal analysis framework for corticomuscular coupling analysis. The proposed framework models multiple data spaces simultaneously in a multidirectional fashion. Furthermore, to address the inter-subject variability concern in real-world medical applications, we extend the proposed framework from the individual subject level to the group level to obtain common corticomuscular coupling patterns across subjects. We apply the proposed framework to concurrent EEG, EMG and behavior data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results reveal several highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and their corresponding spatial activation patterns. In PD subjects, there are enhanced connections between occipital region and other regions, which is consistent with the previous medical finding. The proposed framework is a promising technique for performing multi-subject and multi-modal data analysis.	[Chen, Xun; Ward, Rabab Kreidieh; Wang, Z.

Methods: Sixteen participants (15 female and 1 male) were asked to passively listen to or actively identify speech and tone-sweeps in a two-force choice discrimination task while the electroencephalograph (EEG) was recorded from 32 channels. The stimuli were presented at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in which discrimination accuracy was high (i.e., 80-100%) and low SNRs producing discrimination performance at chance. EEG data were decomposed using independent component analysis and clustered across participants using principle component methods in EEGLAB. Results: ICA revealed left and right sensorimotor mu components for 14/16 and 13/16 participants respectively that were identified on the basis of scalp topography, spectral peaks, and localization to the precentral and postcentral gyri. Time-frequency analysis of left and right lateralized mu component clusters revealed significant (FDR<.05) suppression in the traditional beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) prior to, during, and following syllable discrimination trials. No significant differences from baseline were found for passive tasks. Tone conditions produced right mu beta suppression following stimulus onset only. For the left mu, significant differences in the magnitude of beta suppression were found for correct speech discrimination trials relative to chance trials following stimulus offset. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with constructivist, internal model theories proposing that early forward motor models generate predictions about likely phonemic units that are then synthesized with incoming sensory cues during active as opposed to passive processing. Future directions and possible translational value for clinical populations in which sensorimotor integration may play a functional role are discussed.

J	Olhede, SC; Ombao, H				Olhede, Sofia C.; Ombao, Hernando			Modeling and Estimation of Covariance of Replicated Modulated Cyclical Time Series	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Dual frequency coherence; Fourier transform; harmonizable process; Loeve spectrum; multi-taper estimates; replicated time series; spectral analysis	HARMONIZABLE PROCESSES; STATIONARY-PROCESSES; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; WAVELET RIDGE; COHERENCE; SIGNALS	This paper introduces the novel class of modulated cyclostationary processes, a class of nonstationary processes exhibiting frequency coupling, and proposes a method of their estimation from repeated trials. Cyclostationary processes also exhibit frequency correlation but have Loeve spectra whose support lies only on parallel lines in the dual-frequency plane. Such extremely sparse structure does not adequately represent many biological processes. Thus, we propose a model that, in the time domain, modulates the covariance of cyclostationary processes and consequently broadens their frequency support in the dual-frequency plane. The spectra and the cross-coherence of the proposed modulated cyclostationary process are first estimated using multitaper methods. A shrinkage procedure is then applied to each trial-specific estimate to reduce the estimation risk. Multiple trials of each series are observed. When combining information across trials, we carefully take into account the bias that may be introduced by phase misalignment and the fact that the Loeve spectra and cross-coherence across replicates may only be "similar"-but not necessarily identical. In a simulation study, we illustrate the performance of our estimation method on a model that realistically captures the features observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The application of the inference methods developed for the modulated cyclostationary model to EEG data also demonstrates that the proposed model captures statistically significant cross-frequency interactions, that ought to be further examined by neuroscientists.

Recent studies have shown that the functional and anatomical features of this network are organized in an efficient small-world manner that confers high efficiency of information processing at relatively low connection cost. However, it has been unclear how the architecture of functional brain networks is related to performance in working memory (WM) tasks and if these networks can be modified by WM training. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind training study enrolling 66 young adults. Half of the subjects practiced three WM tasks and were compared to an active control group practicing three tasks with low WM demand. High-density resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after training to analyze graphtheoretical functional network characteristics at an intracortical level. WM performance was uniquely correlated with power in the theta frequency, and theta power was increased by WM training. Moreover, the better a person's WM performance, the more their network exhibited small-world topology. WM training shifted network characteristics in the direction of high performers, showing increased small-worldness within a distributed frontoparietal network. Taken together, this is the first longitudinal study that provides evidence for the plasticity of the functional brain network underlying WM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ERD is supposed to reflect M1 activation, sending information to recruited muscles, while the process underlying ERS is interpreted either as active cortical inhibition or as processing of sensory inputs. Investigation of the process behind ERD/ERS in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) would be particularly relevant since their M1 remains effective despite decreased sensorimotor abilities. In this study, we recorded net joint torque and EEG in 6 participants with cervical SCI and 8 healthy participants who performed isometric elbow flexion at 3 force levels. Multifaceted EEG analysis was introduced to assess ERD/ERS according to their amplitude, frequency range and duration. The results revealed that net joint torque increased with the required force level for all participants and time to contraction inhibition was longer in the SCI group. At the cortical level, ERD/ERS frequency ranges increased with the required force level in all participants, indicating that the modulation of cortical activity with force level is preserved after SCI. However, ERS amplitude decreased only in SCI participants, which may be linked to delayed contraction inhibition. All in all, cortical modulation of frequency range and amplitude could reflect two different kinds of neural communication. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, these conclusions should be considered cautiously because EEG-recorded Gamma may be contaminated by noncephalic activity such as microsaccades. Moreover, EEG studies of Gamma cannot easily reveal its intracranial sources. Here we recorded MEG rather than EEG, assessed the sources of the M170 and Gamma oscillations using beamformer, and explored the sensitivity of these neural manifestations to global, featural and configural information in faces. The M170 was larger in response to faces and face components than in response to watches. Scrambling the configuration of the inner components of the face even if presented without the face contour reduced and delayed the M170. The amplitude of MEG Gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) was higher than baseline during an epoch between 230-570 ms from stimulus onset and was particularly sensitive to the configuration of the stimuli, regardless of their category. However, in the lower part of this frequency range (30-40 Hz) only physiognomic stimuli elevated the MEG above baseline. Both the M170 and Gamma were generated in a posterior-ventral network including the fusiform, inferior-occipital and lingual gyri, all in the right hemisphere. The generation of Gamma involved additional sources in the visual system, bilaterally. We suggest that the evoked M170 manifests a face-perception mechanism based on the global characteristics of face, whereas the induced Gamma oscillations are associated with the integration of visual input into a pre-existent coherent perceptual representation.

Linear SASI method is based on evaluation of the balance of powers in two EEG frequency bands in one channel selected higher and lower than the alpha band spectrum maximum. Nonlinear HFD method calculates fractal dimension directly in the time domain. The resting EEG signals of 17 depressive patients and 17 control subjects were used as a database for calculations. SASI values were positive for depressive and negative for control group (P < 0.05). SASI provided the true detection rate of 88% in the depressive and 82% in the control group. The calculated HFD values detected a small (3%) increase with depression (P < 0.05). HFD provided the true detection rate of 94% in the depressive group and 76% in the control group. The rate of correct indication in the both groups was 85% using SASI or HFD. Statistically significant variations were not revealed between hemispheres (P > 0.05). The results indicated that the linear EEG analysis method SASI and the nonlinear HFD method both demonstrated a good sensitivity for detection of characteristic features of depression in a single-channel EEG.

EEG during pedaling: Evidence for cortical control of locomotor tasks	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Pedaling; Brain activity	TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLE; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPINAL-CORD LESIONS; MOTOR IMAGERY; HUMAN WALKING; POSTSTROKE HEMIPARESIS; PATHWAY CONTRIBUTES; STRETCH REFLEXES; BRAIN ACTIVATION; HUMAN BIPEDALISM	Objective: This study characterized the brain electrical activity during pedaling, a locomotor-like task, in humans. We postulated that phasic brain activity would be associated with active pedaling, consistent with a cortical role in locomotor tasks. Methods: Sixty four channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 10 channels of electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded from 10 neurologically-intact volunteers while they performed active and passive (no effort) pedaling on a custom-designed stationary bicycle. Ensemble averaged waveforms, 2 dimensional topographic maps and amplitude of the beta (13-35 Hz) frequency band were analyzed and compared between active and passive trials. Results: The peak-to-peak amplitude (peak positive-peak negative) of the EEG waveform recorded at the Cz electrode was higher in the passive than the active trials (p < 0.01). beta-band oscillations in electrodes overlying the leg representation area of the cortex were significantly desynchronized during active compared to the passive pedaling (p < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between the average EEG waveform for active trials and the composite EMG (summated EMG from both limbs for each muscle) of the rectus femoris (r = -0.77, p < 0.01) the medial hamstrings (r = -0.85, p < 0.01) and the tibialis anterior (r = -0.70, p < 0.01) muscles. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that substantial sensorimotor processing occurs in the brain during pedaling in humans. Further, cortical activity seemed to be greatest during recruitment of the muscles critical for transitioning the legs from flexion to extension and vice versa. Significance: This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of EEG recording during pedaling, and owing to similarities between pedaling and bipedal walking, may provide valuable insight into brain activity during locomotion in humans.

Visual gamma oscillations: The effects of stimulus type, visual field coverage and stimulus motion on MEG and EEG recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Gamma oscillations; Visual system; MEG; EEG	ELECTROMYOGENIC ARTIFACTS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; GABA CONCENTRATION; FREQUENCY; CORTEX; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; DEPENDENCE; BOLD	Increases in the power of neural oscillations in the gamma (>40 Hz) band are a key signature of information processing in cortical neuronal networks. However, non-invasive detection of these very small oscillations is difficult due to the presence of potential artefacts (both muscular and ocular) in the same frequency band and requires highly optimised paradigms. Numerous studies have shown that the properties of visual gamma-band responses to simple pattern stimuli are highly tuned to the stimuli parameters used. The aim of this work was to compare gamma oscillation response properties across some of the more commonly used stimulus configurations. To do this, MEG and EEG recordings were made during the presentation of eight different stimulus types in a 2 x 2 x 2 design. For the first stimulus factor, "Type", the stimulus pattern was either an annulus grating or a square wave grating. For the second stimulus factor, "Field", stimuli were presented in either four visual field quadrants simultaneously or only in the lower left quadrant. Finally, for the "Move" factor, stimuli either drifted at 1.33 degrees s(-1) or were stationary. For MEG gamma band responses, the following main effects were observed, a) gamma-band power was increased for annular stimuli compared to square wave stimuli, b) gamma-band power was increased for full field stimuli compared to single quadrant stimuli and c) gamma-band power was larger for drifting compared to stationary stimuli and were of significantly higher frequency.

However, far less is known about the possible neurophysiological basis of such processing. To contribute to a better understanding of hand mental rotation processing, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) methods were applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from participants mentally rotating their hands. Time-frequency analyses revealed that alpha-band power suppression was larger over central-parietal regions. This is in accordance with motor imagery findings suggesting that the motor regions may be involved in processing or detection of kinaesthetic information. Furthermore, the presence of a significant negative correlation between reaction times (RTs) and alpha-band power suppression over central regions is illustrated. These findings are consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, which proposes the non-use of many brain regions irrelevant for the task performance as well as the more focused use of specific task-related regions in individuals with better performance. These results indicate that ERSP provides some independent insights into the mental rotation process and further confirms that parietal and motor cortices are involved in mental rotation.

A number of studies have tried to find ways to control cybersickness and some of them have demonstrated that presenting rest frames in VE might be one promising method to reduce cybersickness. This study investigates the effects of rest frames on cybersickness and the cybersickness-related brain activities. Participants (n=22) were exposed to a roller coaster simulator in a VE, both under a rest frame condition and a non-rest frame condition, in counter-balanced order while undergoing EEG recordings. Participants who experienced less cybersickness in the rest frame condition showed characteristic oscillations in different EEG frequency bands compared to those of in the non-rest frame condition. Based on the level of cybersickness and oscillatory EEG changes, we suggest that rest frames may reduce or delay the onset of cybersickness by alleviating users' attention or perception load.

In EEG-based systems, typical measurements for workload level assessment are band power estimates in several frequency bands. Mental fatigue, arising from growing time-on-task (TOT), can significantly affect the distribution of these band power features. However, the impact of mental fatigue on workload (WKL) assessment has not yet been evaluated. With this paper we intend to help fill in this lack of knowledge by analyzing the influence of WKL and TOT on EEG band power features, as well as their interaction and its impact on classification performance. Twenty participants underwent an experiment that modulated both their WKL (low/high) and time spent on the task (short/long). Statistical analyses were performed on the EEG signals, behavioral and subjective data. They revealed opposite changes in alpha power distribution between WKL and TOT conditions, as well as a decrease in WKL level discriminability with increasing TOT in both number of statistical differences in band power and classification performance. Implications for pBCI systems and experimental protocol design are discussed.

In this article, we focus on electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography findings in patients with schizophrenia. Auditory-P50, -N100, and -P300 findings, visual-P100, -N170, and -N400 findings, and neural oscillations in patients with schizophrenia are overviewed. Published results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have neurophysiological deficits from the very early phase of sensory processing (i.e. P50, P100, N100) to the relatively late phase (i.e. P300, N400) in both auditory and visual perception. Exploring the associations between neural substrates, including neurotransmitter systems, and neurophysiological findings, will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

These findings suggest that tACS is a promising neurotherapeutic for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses with aberrant underlying cortical dynamics such as schizophrenia. Due to the complexity of the network dynamics in brains of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, it is unlikely that the feedforward application of tACS without neuronal feedback will be sufficient to effectively control the pathological network dynamics. To our knowledge, no successful EEG-based feedback brain stimulation with tACS has been reported to date. We here present an EEG feedback-controlled tACS system that controls cortical state dynamics. We used occipitoparietal stimulation in the gamma frequency band (40 Hz) in response to the endogenous alpha frequency activity in the visual cortex. We found that EEG feedback-controlled 40 Hz tACS (FB tACS) was more effective at controlling the amplitude of alpha-band cortical oscillations than dose-matched randomly-administered 40 Hz tACS (RA tACS). Our novel system therefore represents an important step towards the development of individualized therapeutic brain stimulation that is based on feedback control.

Sleep can be analysed by studying the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during a night's sleep. Alternating between sleep-wake stages gives information related to the sleep quality and quantity since this alternating pattern is highly affected during sleep disorders. Spectral composition of EEG signals varies according to sleep stages, alternating phases of high energy associated to low frequency (deep sleep) with periods of low energy associated to high frequency (wake and light sleep). The analysis of sleep in humans is usually made on periods (epochs) of 30-s length according to the original Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep scoring manual. In this work, we propose a new phase space-based (mainly based on Poincare plot) algorithm for automatic classification of sleep-wake states in humans using EEG data gathered over relatively short-time periods. The effectiveness dour approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments involving EEG data from seven healthy adult female subjects and was tested on epoch lengths ranging from 3-s to 30-s. The performance of our phase space approach was compared to a 2-dimensional state space approach using the power spectral (PS) in two selected human-specific frequency bands. These powers were calculated by dividing integrated spectral amplitudes at selected human-specific frequency bands. The comparison demonstrated that the phase space approach gives better performance in the case of short as well as standard 30-s epoch lengths. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neuronal mechanisms that support the perception of multiple objects and underlie these attentional capacity limits have remained unclear. We investigated the role of neuronal oscillations in multiobject visual perception and in limiting the attentional capacity. To this end, we used parametric multiobject tracking tasks, MEG and EEG recordings, and data-driven source-space analyses to localize the neuronal substrates of task performance. Three lines of evidence suggested a mechanistic role for neuronal oscillations in multiobject attention. First, oscillation amplitudes preceding target events were distinct for subsequently detected and undetected targets and also predicted reaction times to the target events. Second, suppression of theta to low-beta (<20 Hz) and strengthening of high-beta to gamma (20-90 Hz) oscillations in frontoparietal and visual regions were correlated with attentional load. Third, the load-dependent strengthening of gamma (30-90 Hz) band oscillations in lateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and visual cortices predicted interindividual variability in attentional capacity. Aprogressive recruitment of gamma oscillations in sensory, attentional, and executive networks is thus directly correlated with multiobject attentional demands and, in particular, with the individual capability to consciously attend and perceive multiple visual objects concurrently. These data support the hypothesis that gamma oscillations contribute both to neuronal object representations and to attentional and executive processing.	[Rouhinen, Sateri; Panula, Jonatan; Palva, J.

They were then injected with a single dose of 4AP (45mg/kg, i.p.), and video-monitoring/electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed. Key Findings: 4AP induced convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures in 12 of 13 rats, along with generalized fascicular twitching, wet-dog shakes, and myoclonic jerks. On EEG, we observed in 7 (58.3%) of 12 animals long-lasting interictal spikes from the subiculum before the occurrence of the first seizure. Once seizures had started, interictal spikes occurred in all areas with no fixed site of origin. Most seizures (41/60, 68.3%) were characterized by a low-voltage fast-activity onset pattern and were convulsive (48/60, 80%). 4AP also induced highly rhythmic theta (611Hz) oscillations in CA3 and entorhinal cortex before seizure occurrence. Significance: Our study shows that systemic 4AP administration in vivo can enhance theta oscillations and induce slow interictal spikes and low-voltage fast-onset seizures similar to those reported in brain slices. We propose that these effects may reflect, at least in part, enhanced GABAA receptormediated inhibition as reported in in vitro studies.

Abnormal gamma oscillations (> 30 Hz) seen in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to result from developmental insults. This study investigated spontaneous gamma oscillations in schizophrenia patients having higher and lower number of MPAs. Forty drug naive/free schizophrenia patients and 20 matched healthy controls were assessed for MPAs on the Extended Waldrop Scale (EWS). All participants underwent an awake, resting 192-channel EEG recording. Spontaneous gamma spectral power and coherence were estimated in the low- (30-50 Hz) and high-gamma (51-70 and 71-100 Hz) bands. Significantly higher power was observed in high-MPA than healthy control group in low-gamma band over right frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Spectral power in the high-gamma band (71-100 Hz) was also significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than in the healthy control group over left frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Additionally, regional intra-hemispheric and interhemispheric coherence in the low-gamma band was significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than on the healthy control group. This study is the first to provide evidence of increased spontaneous gamma power and synchrony in schizophrenia patients having higher MPAs, supporting the idea that it may represent a distinct subgroup of schizophrenia with a neurodevelopmental basis.

We investigated the small-world functional networks in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia (FESPR) patients, and healthy controls. All participants underwent the electroencephalogram during a control task and a working memory (WM) task Small-world properties of the theta band were reduced in FESPR relative to controls during the WM task. Small-worldness of the UHR during the WM task exhibited intermediate value between that of controls and FESPR. These results imply that the suboptimal organization of the brain network may play a pivotal role in the schizophrenia pathophysiology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, OJ; Cash, SS				Ahmed, Omar J.; Cash, Sydney S.			Finding synchrony in the desynchronized EEG: the history and interpretation of gamma rhythms	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						desynchronized EEG; gamma oscillations; synchrony; history of gamma rhythms		Neocortical gamma (30-80 Hz) rhythms correlate with attention, movement and perception and are often disrupted in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Gamma primarily occurs during alert brain states characterized by the so-called "desynchronized" EEG. Is this because gamma rhythms are devoid of synchrony? In this review we take a historical approach to answering this question. Richard Caton and Adolf Beck were the first to report the rhythmic voltage fluctuations in the animal brain. They were limited by the poor amplification of their early galvanometers. Thus when they presented light or other stimuli, they observed a disappearance of the large resting oscillations. Several groups have since shown that visual stimuli lead to low amplitude gamma rhythms and that groups of neurons in the visual cortices fire together during individual gamma cycles. This synchronous firing can more strongly drive downstream neurons. We discuss how gamma-band synchrony can support ongoing communication between brain regions, and highlight an important fact: there is at least local neuronal synchrony during gamma rhythms. Thus, it is best to refer to the low amplitude, high frequency EEG as an "activated': not "desynchronized", EEG.

J	Kawaguchi, H; Kume, T; Kobayashi, T				Kawaguchi, Hirokazu; Kume, Takahiro; Kobayashi, Tetsuo			A Background EEG Removal Method Combining PCA with Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition for Event-Related Potential Measurements	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						event-related potential; principal component analysis; multivariate empirical mode decomposition; EEG	TO-NOISE RATIO; ALPHA-PHASE; COMPONENT; SYNCHRONIZATION	The event-related potential (ERP) is a neural response to an internal or external event, and can be obtained by averaging time-locked scalp potentials. The ERP measured in a single trial often has a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because of the relatively large background due to the rhythmic electroencephalogram (EEG) noise. This paper proposes a novel method to enhance ERPs by combining principal component analysis (PCA) with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (M-EMD). EMD is a data-driven time-frequency analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary signals, and M-EMD is its multivariate extension. In the proposed method, PCA reduces the data dimensions, while M-EMD removes the relatively large background EEGs. The performance of the method is evaluated with simulated and measured P300 ERP components obtained from a visual oddball experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the background EEGs and improve the SNR of P300s. (c) 2013 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Analyses of the eyes-closed EEG epochs showed that the resting-state EEG in FXS can be characterized by elevated relative theta power (4-8 Hz) and reduced relative upper-alpha power (10-12 Hz). Although preliminary, these findings suggest that the well-documented imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory cortical circuit activity in FXS can be revealed the level of oscillatory behavior at the scalp. A next step for future studies is linking the EEG resting-state indices to cognitive and behavioral measures. (C) Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Van der Molen, Melle J.

High frequency oscillations are biomarkers for epileptic tissue, but it is unknown whether they can reflect increasingly dysplastic tissue changes as well as epileptic disease activity. Methods High frequency oscillations (80-450Hz) were visually marked by two independent reviewers in all channels of intracranial implanted grid, strips, and depth electrodes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refractory epilepsy. Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b. Key Findings Patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 had significantly more seizures than those with type 1 (p<0.001). Rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly higher in patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 versus type 1 (p<0.001). In addition, it could be confirmed that rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly higher in presumed epileptogenic areas than outside (p<0.001). Significance Activity of high frequency oscillations mirrors the higher epileptogenicity of focal cortical dysplasia type 2 lesions compared to type 1 lesions. Therefore, rates of high frequency oscillations can reflect disease activity of a lesion. This has implications for the use of high frequency oscillations as biomarkers for epileptogenic areas, because a detailed analysis of their rates may be necessary to use high frequency oscillations as a predictive tool in epilepsy surgery.

In this study, we examined the degree of TGC during a visuo-spatial working memory task (2-back task) vs. a simple vigilance task in 13 young participants. During the working memory task, TGC increased in the frontal area at approximately 40 Hz. In addition, TGC was also significantly different at high-gamma frequency despite no differences in gamma power between the two tasks, and a correlation between TGC only during the working memory task and hit rate was observed. These results suggest that TGC reflects working memory processes and may be a useful bio-physiological marker of working memory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the one hand, iGBRs have been associated with neuronal activity reflecting the (re-) activation of cortical object representations. On the other hand, it was shown that miniature saccades (MSs) lead to high-frequency artifacts in the EEG that can mimic cortical iGBRs. We recorded EEG and eye movements simultaneously while participants were engaged in a combined repetition priming and object recognition experiment. MS rates were mainly modulated by object familiarity in a time window from 100 to 300 ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, artifact-corrected iGBRs were sensitive to object repetition and object familiarity in a prolonged time window. EEG source analyses revealed that stimulus repetitions modulated iGBRs in temporal and occipital cortex regions while familiarity was associated with activity in parieto-occipital regions. These results are in line with neuroimaging studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging or magnetoencephalography. We conclude that MSs reflect early mechanisms of visual perception while iGBRs mirror the activation of cortical networks representing a perceived object.

This work aims to characterize the differences of power in brain oscillations during the execution of a recognition memory task in MCI subjects in comparison with elderly controls. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded during a continuous recognition memory task performance. Oscillatory brain activity during the recognition phase of the task was analyzed by wavelet transform in the source space by means of minimum norm algorithm. Both groups obtained a 77% hit ratio. In comparison with healthy controls, MCI subjects showed increased theta (p<0.001), lower beta reduction (p<0.001) and decreased alpha and gamma power (p<0.002 and p<0.001 respectively) in frontal, temporal and parietal areas during early and late latencies. Our results point towards a dual pattern of activity (increase and decrease) which is indicative of MCI and specific to certain time windows, frequency bands and brain regions. These results could represent two neurophysiological sides of MCI. Characterizing these opposing processes may contribute to the understanding of the disorder. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Fourteen able-bodied users participated in 10 sessions, plus a follow-up session. Users were trained to control an EEG-based 4-class BCI with the mental tasks, word association, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, and motor imagery. Results: Eight users reached mean accuracies of 61-72% and managed to control all 4 classes above chance in single-sessions. Performance and brain patterns stayed stable over 10 weeks without training. Motor imagery showed the best performance and most distinct brain patterns. Participants' fear of incompetence decreased while the quality of their imagery and task ease increased over sessions. The evaluation of feedback differed between tasks and correlated with performance. Conclusion: Users can control a real-time 4-class BCI, driven by distinct mental tasks, with stable performance over months. However, general performance was rather low for effective BCI control in daily life. Possibilities for future optimizations to increase performance are discussed. Significance: The evaluation of alternatives to motor imagery, long-term BCI use, and psychological variables is important to improve usability for mental imagery-based BCIs.

Human Electrocortical Dynamics of Spatial Navigation in a Predefined Square Spiral	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon				Low frequency neural oscillations in animals have been shown to play an important role in spatial navigation. However, such studies in humans have remained largely unexplored. We recorded electroencephalogy (EEG) and full body movement as subjects (n=4) walked at two different speeds (slow and fast) in a 4mx4m square spiral track. We then projected subjects' moment-to-moment EEG onto their spatial paths, separately for each outward and inward traversal of the track. Analysis of the EEG dynamics over space showed that the Hilbert envelope (power) of delta/low theta (2-5 Hz) oscillations over midline posterior, parietal cortex (electrode Pz) was locked in space to the relative position of the subject along each arm of the square spiral. There was a change in the envelope from the first third to the last third of each path, irrespective of path size, orientation or direction. The degree of spatial locking was modulated by walking speed, being much greater for fast than for slow speeds. However, the envelope activity itself was not a simple consequence of speed variation within a condition, since projecting moment-to-moment speed on each path produced a very different pattern than did projecting delta/low theta power. These results serve as novel evidence of neural oscillations, as detectable by EEG, in modulating spatial navigation of freely moving humans in open space.

Objective: To determine the effects of prefrontal rTMS on sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in major depression. Methods: In this open-label pilot study, twelve male patients with relatively mild depression, who had been medication-resistant, underwent 10 daily rTMS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Polysomnographic (PSG) data were recorded over four nights: Adaptation, Baseline, Post-1 (after the fifth rTMS session), and Post-2 (after the tenth rTMS session). Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) band power analyses were performed to quantify delta and sigma band activities during Stages II-IV, and determine time courses of these activities between Baseline and Post-1 (first five sessions) and between Post-1 and Post-2 (last five sessions). Results: Post-hoc tests based on a three-way ANOVA model indicated significant delta power increase at F3 (t(11) = -2.762, P = 0.018) during the first five sessions; however, sigma power was unchanged. No significant band power changes were observed during the second half. Stages II-IV (percent total sleep time) increased significantly during the first half (t(12) = -2.43, P = 0.033). No other significant changes in sleep parameters or clinical correlations were observed. Conclusions: The first five sessions of high frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC increase slow-wave activity (SWA) at F3, possibly reflecting locally enhanced synaptic plasticity induced by rTMS. This increased activity was not observed during the last half, possibly due to a homeostatic regulation mechanism intrinsic to SWA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thalamo-cortical mechanisms underlying changes in amplitude and frequency of human alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Alpha oscillations; Thalamo-cortical system; Neural masses	EEG-ALPHA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; BAND POWER; RHYTHM; MODEL; DYNAMICS; ATTENTION	Although a large number of studies have been devoted to establishing correlations between changes in amplitude and frequency of EEG alpha oscillations and cognitive processes, it is currently unclear through which physiological mechanisms such changes are brought about. In this study we use a biophysical model of EEG generation to gain a fundamental understanding of the functional changes within the thalamo-cortical system that might underly such alpha responses. The main result of this study is that, although the physiology of the thalamo-cortical system is characterized by a large number of parameters, alpha responses effectively depend on only three variables. Physiologically, these variables determine the resonance properties of feedforward, cortico-thalamo-cortical, and intra-cortical circuits. By examining the effect of modulations of these resonances on the amplitude and frequency of EEG alpha oscillations, it is established that the model can reproduce the variety of experimentally observed alpha responses, as well as the experimental finding that changes in alpha amplitude are typically an order of magnitude larger than changes in alpha frequency. The modeling results are also in line with the fact that alpha responses often correlate linearly with indices characterizing cognitive processes. By investigating the effect of synaptic and intrinsic neuronal parameters, we find that alpha responses reflect changes in cortical activation, which is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha activity serves to selectively inhibit cortical regions during cognitive processing demands. As an example of how these analyses can be applied to specific experimental protocols, we reproduce benzodiazepine-induced alpha responses and clarify the putative underlying thalamo-cortical mechanisms. The findings reported in this study provide a fundamental physiological framework within which alpha responses observed in specific experimental protocols can be understood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, depends on a priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audio visual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudo words with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10% trial rejection. In a nearly time window, alpha oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution.

We aimed this study to identify the possible EEG markers for the onset and progression of cortical cholinergic neurodegeneration in rats. NB lesion was performed by ibotenic acid (IBO) microinfusion, and identified by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry. Sleep/wake states related EEG relative amplitude analysis was done using the Probability Density Estimate (PDE) routine supplied with MATLAB 6.5. Bilateral NB lesion transiently altered gross sleep/wake states topography 14 days following lesion. While control rats exhibited equivalent durations of Wake, NREM and REM, as determined by sensorimotor versus motor cortex EEG, bilateral NB lesion decreased Wake duration in both cortices, with NREM duration increased within sensorimotor cortex, and REM duration increased within motor cortex. Also, Wake, NREM and REM theta relative amplitude was lower in motor versus sensorimotor cortex in all groups of animals. In sensorimotor cortex bilateral NB lesion increased only REM theta relative amplitude from 1421 days following lesion, and returned to control value 28 days following lesion. In motor cortex both Wake and REM theta relative amplitude transiently increased 14 days following unilateral and bilateral NB lesion, and returned to control values 21 days after lesions. We demonstrated at functional level, for the first time, the topographically specific impact of NB cholinergic cortical afferent system dysregulation on sleep/wake states, REM and Wake EEG theta relative amplitude.

Here we investigated whether alpha-ERD could be functionally distinguished in 2 temporally and spatially segregated subcomponents as suggested by previous studies. In addition, we tested whether the degree of dependence of nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD magnitude on the prestimulus cc-power would have been larger than the degree of dependence on the poststimulus cc-power. Our findings confirmed the dissociation between a sensory-related alpha-ERD maximally distributed over contralateral central electrodes, and a task-related alpha-ERD (possibly affected by motor-related activity), maximally distributed at posterior parietal and occipital electrodes. The cortical sources of these activities were estimated to be located at the level of sensorimotor and bilateral occipital cortices, respectively. Importantly, the time course of the alpha-ERD revealed that functional segregation emerged only at late latencies (400 to 750 ms) whereas topographic similarity was observed at earlier latencies (250 to 350 ms). Furthermore, the nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD magnitude was significantly more dependent on prestimulus than poststimulus cc-power. Altogether these findings provide direct evidence that the nociceptive-induced alpha-ERD reflects the summation of sensory-related and task-related cortical processes, and that prestimulus fluctuations can remarkably influence the non-phase-locked nociceptive alpha-ERD. Perspective: Present results extend the functional understanding of cc-oscillation suppression during pain perception and demonstrate the influence of prestimulus variability on this cortical phenomenon. This work has the potential to guide pain clinicians in a more accurate interpretation on physiological and psychological modulations of alpha-oscillations.

Currently spindles are often classified into two classes: fast spindles, with a frequency of around 14 Hz, occurring in the centro-parietal region; and slow spindles, with a frequency of around 12 Hz, prevalent in the frontal region. Here we aim to establish whether the spindle generation process also exhibits spatial heterogeneity. Electroencephalographic recordings from 20 subjects were automatically scanned to detect spindles and the time occurrences of spindles were used for statistical analysis. Gamma distribution parameters were fit to each inter-spindle interval distribution, and a modified Wald-Wolfowitz lag-1 correlation test was applied. Results indicate that not all spindles are generated by the same statistical process, but this dissociation is not spindle-type specific. Although this dissociation is not topographically specific, a single generator for all spindle types appears unlikely.

Previous research has examined the role of sensorimotor and visual experiences in action mirroring during subsequent observation, but the contribution of somatosensory experiences to this effect has not been adequately examined. The current study tests whether prior somatosensoty stimulation experienced during action production modulates brain activity during observation of similar actions being performed by others. Specifically, changes in alpha- and beta-range oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during observation of reaching actions were examined in relation to the observer's own prior experience of somatosensory stimulation while carrying out similar actions. Analyses revealed that alpha power over central electrodes was significantly decreased during observation of an action expected to result in somatosensory stimulation. Conversely, beta power was increased when an observed action was expected to result in somatosensory stimulation. These results suggest that somatosensory experiences may uniquely contribute to the way in which we process other people's actions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The problem is much harder in neonatal EEG, where the background EEG contains spikes, waves, and rapid fluctuations in amplitude and frequency. Existing artifact detection methods are mostly limited to detect only a subset of artifacts such as ocular, muscle or power line artifacts. Few methods integrate different modules, each for detection of one specific category of artifact. Furthermore, most of the reference approaches are implemented and tested on adult EEG recordings. Direct application of those methods on neonatal EEG causes performance deterioration, due to greater pattern variation and inherent complexity. A method for detection of a wide range of artifact categories in neonatal EEG is thus required. At the same time, the method should be specific enough to preserve the background EEG information. The current study describes a feature based classification approach to detect both repetitive (generated from ECG, EMG, pulse, respiration, etc.) and transient (generated from eye blinking, eye movement, patient movement, etc.) artifacts. It focuses on artifact detection within high energy burst patterns, instead of detecting artifacts within the complete background EEG with wide pattern variation. The objective is to find true burst patterns, which can later be used to identify the Burst-Suppression (BS) pattern, which is commonly observed during newborn seizure. Such selective artifact detection is proven to be more sensitive to artifacts and specific to bursts, compared to the existing artifact detection approaches applied on the complete background EEG. Several time domain, frequency domain, statistical features, and features generated by wavelet decomposition are analyzed to model the proposed bi-classification between burst and artifact segments. A feature selection method is also applied to select the feature subset producing highest classification accuracy. The suggested feature based classification method is executed using our recorded neonatal EEG dataset, consisting of burst and artifact segments. We obtain 78% sensitivity and 72% specificity as the accuracy measures. The accuracy obtained using the proposed method is found to be about 20% higher than that of the reference approaches. Joint use of the proposed method with our previous work on burst detection outperforms reference methods on simultaneous burst and artifact detection. As the proposed method supports detection of a wide range of artifact patterns, it can be improved to incorporate the detection of artifacts within other seizure patterns and background EEG information as well.

The role of beta oscillations upon cognitive stimulation is least studied in comparison to other frequency bands. The study included 17 consecutive patients with MCI (mean age = 70.8 +/- 5.6 years) according to Petersen's criteria, and 17 age- and education-matched normal elderly controls (mean age = 68.5 +/- 5.5 years). The experiments used a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was recorded at 30 cortical locations. EEG-evoked power, inter-trial phase synchronization, and event-related beta responses filtered in 15-20 Hz were obtained in response to target and non-target stimuli for both groups of subjects. In healthy subjects, EEG-evoked beta power, inter-trial phase synchronization of beta responses and event-related filtered beta responses were significantly higher in responses to target than non-target stimuli (p < 0.05). In MCI patients, there were no differences in evoked beta power between target and non-target stimuli. Furthermore, upon presentation of visual oddball paradigm, occipital electrodes depict higher beta response in comparison to other electrode sites. The increased beta response upon presentation of target stimuli in healthy subjects implies that beta oscillations could shift the system to an attention state, and had important function in cognitive activity. This may, in future, open the way to consider beta activity as an important operator in brain cognitive processes. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, conventional ERD/ERS studies usually utilize fixed frequency band determined from one or few channels to filter whole-head EEG/MEG data, which may inevitably include task-unrelated signals and result in underestimation of reactive oscillatory activities in multichannel studies. In this study, we adopted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to extract beta-related oscillatory activities in performing self-paced right and left index-finger lifting tasks. The MEMD extracts common modes from all channels in same-index intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which allows the temporal-frequency features among different channels can be compared in each subband. The beta-band oscillatory activities were further bandpass filtered within trial-specific beta bands determined from sensorimotor-related channels (C3 and C4), and then rectified using amplitude modulation method to detect trial-by-trial beta rebound (BR) values in ERS time courses. The validity of the MEMD approach in BR values extraction has been demonstrated in multichannel EEG study which showed larger BR values than conventional ERS technique. The MEMD-based method enables the trial-by-trial extraction of sensorimotor oscillatory activities which might allow the exploration of subtle brain dynamics in future studies.

At the cellular level, benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors; they increase the efficacy of inhibition in neuronal networks by prolonging the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This mechanism of action predicts that benzodiazepines reduce the frequency of inhibition-driven network oscillations, consistent with observations from human and animal EEG. However, most of existing data are restricted to frequency bands below similar to 30 Hz. Recent data suggest that faster cortical network rhythms are critically involved in several behavioral and cognitive tasks. We therefore analyzed diazepam effects on a large range of cortical network oscillations in freely moving mice, including theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz) oscillations. We also investigated diazepam effects over the coupling between theta phase and the amplitude fast oscillations. We report that diazepam causes a global slowing of oscillatory activity in all frequency domains. Oscillation power was changed differently for each frequency domain, with characteristic differences between active wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Cross-frequency coupling strength, in contrast, was mostly unaffected by diazepam. Such state- and frequency-dependent actions of benzodiazepines on cortical network oscillations may be relevant for their specific cognitive effects. They also underline the strong interaction between local network oscillations and global brain states. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ripple classification helps to localize the seizure-onset zone in neocortical epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						High frequency oscillation; Epileptiform discharges; Neocortical epilepsy; Primary motor cortex; Primary visual cortex; Seizure onset zone	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HIGH GAMMA ACTIVITY; 80-200 HZ; MACROELECTRODES; CORTEX; BRAIN; EEG	Purpose: Fast ripples are reported to be highly localizing to the epileptogenic or seizure-onset zone (SOZ) but may not be readily found in neocortical epilepsy, whereas ripples are insufficiently localizing. Herein we classified interictal neocortical ripples by associated characteristics to identify a subtype that may help to localize the SOZ in neocortical epilepsy. We hypothesize that ripples associated with an interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) are more pathologic, since the IED is not a normal physiologic event. Methods: We studied 35 patients with epilepsy with neocortical epilepsy who underwent invasive electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation by stereotactic EEG (SEEG) or subdural grid electrodes. Interictal fast ripples and ripples were visually marked during slow-wave sleep lasting 1030min. Neocortical ripples were classified as type I when superimposed on epileptiform discharges such as paroxysmal fast, spike, or sharp wave, and as type II when independent of epileptiform discharges. Key Findings: In 21 patients with a defined SOZ, neocortical fast ripples were detected in the SOZ of only four patients. Type I ripples were detected in 14 cases almost exclusively in the SOZ or primary propagation area (PP) and marked the SOZ with higher specificity than interictal spikes. In contrast, type II ripples were not correlated with the SOZ. In 14 patients with two or more presumed SOZs or nonlocalizable onset pattern, type I but not type II ripples also occurred in the SOZs. We found the areas with only type II ripples outside of the SOZ (type II-O ripples) in SEEG that localized to the primary motor cortex and primary visual cortex. Significance: Neocortical fast ripples and type I ripples are specific markers of the SOZ, whereas type II ripples are not. Type I ripples are found more readily than fast ripples in human neocortical epilepsy. Type II-O ripples may represent spontaneous physiologic ripples in the human neocortex.

Individual Differences in White Matter Diffusion Affect Sleep Oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC FINGERPRINT; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; NIGHT SLEEP; HOMEOSTASIS; EEG; INCREASES; COHERENCE	The characteristic oscillations of the sleeping brain, spindles and slow waves, show trait-like, within-subject stability and a remarkable interindividual variability that correlates with functionally relevant measures such as memory performance and intelligence. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these interindividual differences are largely unknown. Spindles and slow waves are affected by the recent history of learning and neuronal activation, indicating sensitivity to changes in synaptic strength and thus to the connectivity of the neuronal network. Because the structural backbone of this network is formed by white matter tracts, we hypothesized that individual differences in spindles and slow waves depend on the white matter microstructure across a distributed network. We recorded both diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and whole-night, high-density electroencephalography and investigated whether individual differences in sleep spindle and slow wave parameters were associated with diffusion tensor imaging metrics; white matter fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were quantified using tract-based spatial statistics. Individuals with higher spindle power had higher axial diffusivity in the forceps minor, the anterior corpus callosum, fascicles in the temporal lobe, and the tracts within and surrounding the thalamus. Individuals with a steeper rising slope of the slow wave had higher axial diffusivity in the temporal fascicle and frontally located white matter tracts (forceps minor, anterior corpus callosum). These results indicate that the profiles of sleep oscillations reflect not only the dynamics of the neuronal network at the synaptic level, but also the localized microstructural properties of its structural backbone, the white matter tracts.

The melody of the immature brain	NEUROFORUM			German	Article						development; oscillations; primary sensory cortices; EEG; multisensory; prefrontal cortex	EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SPINDLE BURSTS; NEONATAL-RAT; OSCILLATIONS; PREMATURE; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; GAMMA; EEG	The periodicity of brain activity became obvious even after the first attempt to capture it, with Hans Berger noting in 1929 that the "electroencephalogram represents a continuous curve with continuous oscillations". This rhythmicity of neural activity, the 'melody' of the brain, has since gained interest as an energy-efficient strategy for the organisation and communication both within and between brain regions. While it is now known that these oscillations actively contribute to sensory perception and cognition in the adult brain, their function during development is still largely unknown. Recent experimental data revealed the ability of immature human and rodent brain to generate various patterns of electrical activity. Their properties and underlying mechanisms may vary among different brain areas. However, these early patterns of activity seem to facilitate the refinement of cortical maps involved in sensory perception as well as mnemonic and executive processing. Here we review recent studies, which characterize the early oscillatory activity and demonstrate its impact on brain development.

By combining behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, we investigated the mechanisms of the interaction and information integration between different spatial frequency bands. The observers performed a scene categorization task on hybrid images that were generated by combining the low spatial frequency (LSF) component of one image with the high spatial frequency (HSF) component of another image. The results showed that the recognition of the HSF component was interfered by the non-attended LSF component at semantic level. The strength of the semantic interference was modulated by the physical similarity between the LSF and HSF components. Analyses of the EEG data revealed an early anterior N1 component (122 ms from stimulus onset) that was related to the observed interaction of the semantic and physical information between the LSF and HSF components. These findings demonstrate that the semantic information from different spatial frequency bands can be integrated at early stage of the perceptual processing. This early integration is likely to occur at frontal areas in order to initiate top-down facilitation.

Oscillations in the gamma frequency band (approximate to 40Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are involved in the binding of spatially separated but temporally correlated neural events, which results in a unified perceptual experience. The extent of these interactions can be examined by means of a mathematical algorithm called coherence', which reflects the strength' of functional interactions between cortical areas. The present study was conducted to analyse EEG coherence in the gamma frequency band of the cat during alert wakefulness (AW), quiet wakefulness (QW), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cats were implanted with electrodes in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices to monitor EEG activity. Coherence values within the gamma frequency (30100Hz) from pairs of EEG recordings were analysed. A large increase in coherence occurred between all cortical regions in the 3045Hz frequency band during AW compared with the other behavioral states. As the animal transitioned from AW to QW and from QW to NREM sleep, coherence decreased to a moderate level. Remarkably, there was practically no EEG coherence in the entire gamma band spectrum (30100Hz) during REM sleep. We conclude that functional interactions between cortical areas are radically different during sleep compared with wakefulness. The virtual absence of gamma frequency coherence during REM sleep may underlie the unique cognitive processing that occurs during dreams, which is principally a REM sleep-related phenomenon.

Spontaneous EEG alpha oscillation interacts with positive and negative BOLD responses in the visual-auditory cortices and default-mode network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Single-trial; EEG-fMRI; Alpha; Negative BOLD; Default-mode network; Neuronal activity	FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; FMRI REVEALS; BRAIN; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; ROBUST; PHASE; DEACTIVATION; VARIABILITY; ACTIVATION	The human brain is continually, dynamically active and spontaneous fluctuations in this activity play a functional role in affecting both behavioural and neuronal responses. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs remain poorly understood. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a promising technique to study how spontaneous activity modulates the brain's response to stimulation, as temporal indices of ongoing cortical excitability can be integrated with spatially localised evoked responses. Here we demonstrate an interaction between the ongoing power of the electrophysiological alpha oscillation and the magnitude of both positive (PBR) and negative (NBR) fMRI responses to two contrasts of visual checkerboard reversal. Furthermore, the amplitude of pre-stimulus EEG alpha-power significantly modulated the amplitude and shape of subsequent PBR and NBR to the visual stimulus. A nonlinear reduction of visual PBR and an enhancement of auditory NBR and default-mode network NBR were observed in trials preceded by high alpha-power. These modulated areas formed a functionally connected network during a separate resting-state recording. Our findings suggest that the "baseline" state of the brain exhibits considerable trial-to-trial variability which arises from fluctuations in the balance of cortical inhibition/excitation that are represented by respective increases/decreases in the power of the EEG alpha oscillation. The consequence of this spontaneous electrophysiological variability is modulated amplitudes of both PBR and NBR to stimulation. Fluctuations in alpha-power may subserve a functional relationship in the visual-auditory network, acting as mediator for both short and long-range cortical inhibition, the strength of which is represented in part by NBR.

Spatio-temporal Regularization in Linear Distributed Source Reconstruction from EEG/MEG: A Critical Evaluation	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Source localization; Spatio-temporal regularization; sLORETA; EEG	EEG SOURCE ANALYSIS; FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; HEAD MODELS; INVERSE PROBLEM; HUMAN SKULL; CONDUCTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; SIMULATION; GEOMETRY; DIPOLE	The high temporal resolution of EEG/MEG data offers a way to improve source reconstruction estimates which provide insight into the spatio-temporal involvement of neuronal sources in the human brain. In this work, we investigated the performance of spatio-temporal regularization (STR) in a current density approach using a systematic comparison to simple ad hoc or post hoc filtering of the data or of the reconstructed current density, respectively. For the used STR approach we implemented a frequency-specific constraint to penalize solutions outside a narrow frequency band of interest. The widely used sLORETA algorithm was adapted for STR and generally used for source reconstruction. STR and filtering approaches were evaluated with respect to spatial localization error and spatial dispersion, as well as to correlation of original and reconstructed source time courses in single source and two source scenarios with fixed source locations and oscillating source waveforms. We used extensive computer simulations and tested all algorithms with different parameter settings (noise levels and regularization parameters) for EEG data. To verify our results, we also used data from MEG phantom measurements. For the investigated scenarios, we did not find any evidence that STR-based methods outperform purely spatial algorithms applied to temporally filtered data. Furthermore, the results show very clearly that the performance of STR depends very much on the choice of regularization parameters.

Electroencephalogram signatures of loss and recovery of consciousness from propofol	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; INDUCED ALPHA-RHYTHM; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; STATE INDEX; EEG CHANGES; SLEEP; MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; SEVOFLURANE	Unconsciousness is a fundamental component of general anesthesia (GA), but anesthesiologists have no reliable ways to be certain that a patient is unconscious. To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded high-density EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1 Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.

A Novel Method for Reducing the Effect of Tonic Muscle Activity on the Gamma Band of the Scalp EEG	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Gamma; Artefact; EMG; Motor	EMG CONTAMINATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MANIFESTATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ARTIFACTS; RANGE; ONSET	Neural oscillations in the gamma band are of increasing interest, but separating them from myogenic electrical activity has proved difficult. A novel algorithm has been developed to reduce the effect of tonic scalp and neck muscle activity on the gamma band of the EEG. This uses mathematical modelling to fit individual muscle spikes and then subtracts them from the data. The method was applied to the detection of motor associated gamma in two separate groups of eight subjects using different sampling rates. A reproducible increase in high gamma (65-85 Hz) magnitude occurred immediately after the motor action in the left central area (p = 0.02 and p = 0.0002 for the two cohorts with individually optimized algorithm parameters, compared to p = 0.03 and p = 0.16 before correction). Whilst the magnitude of this event-related gamma synchronisation was not reduced by the application of the EMG reduction algorithm, the baseline left central gamma magnitude was significantly reduced by an average of 23 % with a faster sampling rate (p < 0.05). In comparison, at left and right temporo-parietal locations the gamma amplitude was reduced by 60 and 54 % respectively (p < 0.05). The reduction of EMG contamination by fitting and subtraction of individual spikes shows promise as a method of improving the signal to noise ratio of high frequency neural oscillations in scalp EEG.

Deployment of large-diameter axons of long-range neurons could be a key factor in the preserved time management in growing brains. We discuss the consequences of such preserved network constellation in mental disease, drug discovery, and interventional therapies.

Real-Time Brain Oscillation Detection and Phase-Locked Stimulation Using Autoregressive Spectral Estimation and Time-Series Forward Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Autoregressive (AR) model; closed-loop stimulation; genetic algorithm; intracranial EEG(iEEG); neural oscillations; phase-locking; real time; theta rhythm	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSITIVE PHASE; MODEL ORDER; LOCKING; FREQUENCY; RESET	Neural oscillations are important features in a working central nervous system, facilitating efficient communication across large networks of neurons. They are implicated in a diverse range of processes such as synchronization and synaptic plasticity, and can be seen in a variety of cognitive processes. For example, hippocampal theta oscillations are thought to be a crucial component of memory encoding and retrieval. To better study the role of these oscillations in various cognitive processes, and to be able to build clinical applications around them, accurate and precise estimations of the instantaneous frequency and phase are required. Here, we present methodology based on autoregressive modeling to accomplish this in real time. This allows the targeting of stimulation to a specific phase of a detected oscillation. We first assess performance of the algorithm on two signals where the exact phase and frequency are known. Then, using intracranial EEG recorded from two patients performing a Sternberg memory task, we characterize our algorithm's phase-locking performance on physiologic theta oscillations: optimizing algorithm parameters on the first patient using a genetic algorithm, we carried out cross-validation procedures on subsequent trials and electrodes within the same patient, as well as on data recorded from the second patient.

The range of side effects of this substance include reductions of the -2 frequency band. Previous studies, however, have given no information as to which generator centers are responsible for this effect. The objective of this study therefore, is to identify the cortex area that may be responsible for this effect. Six participants were subcutaneously administered 0.7mg of scopolamine. EEG was recorded for 10minutes before to 20minutes after injection. Data preprocessing followed including filtering and artifact minimization. A statistical analysis was performed with sLORETA/eLORETA software for each subject over a time window from 3minutes before to 1720minutes after scopolamine injection. Results show, that in the BA7, the precuneus, on both hemispheres suffered a -2 activity decrease in absolute power. The identified brain cortex center is an important hub with high connectivity and centrality values within the neural network. It contributes to the control of movement and to space orientation. Therefore, an activity alteration in this area can possibly explain the antiemetic effect of scopolamine and open a window to understand the origin of motion sickness.

Cleaning MEG artifacts using external cues	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalogram (MEG); Artifacts; Line frequency; Heartbeat; Vibrations	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG	Using EEG, ECoG, MEG, and microelectrodes to record brain activity is prone to multiple artifacts. The main power line (mains line), video equipment, mechanical vibrations and activities outside the brain are the most common sources of artifacts. MEG amplitudes are low, and even small artifacts distort recordings. In this study, we show how these artifacts can be efficiently removed by recording external cues during MEG recordings. These external cues are subsequently used to register the precise times or spectra of the artifacts. The results indicate that these procedures preserve both the spectra and the time domain wave-shapes of the neuromagnetic signal, while successfully reducing the contribution of the artifacts to the target signals without reducing the rank of the data.

CLU C allele is assumed to confer risk for AD and the allele T may have a protective effect. We investigated the influence of the AD associated CLU genotype on a common neurophysiological trait of brain activity (resting-state alpha-rhythmactivity) in non-demented adults and elucidated whether this influence is modified over the course of aging. We examined quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) in a cohort of non-demented individuals (age range 20-80) divided into young (age range 20-50) and old (age range 51-80) cohorts and stratified by CLU polymorphism. To rule out the effect of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypeon EEG characteristics, only subjects without the ApoE epsilon 4 allele were included in the study. The homozygous presence of the AD risk variant CLU CC in non-demented subjects was associated with an increase of alpha3 absolute power. Moreover, the influence of CLU genotype on alpha3 was found to be higher in the subjects old erthan 50 years of age. The study also showed age-dependent alterations of alpha topographic distribution that occur independently of the CLU genotype. The increase of upper alpha power has been associated with hippocampal atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment (Moretti et al., 2012a). In our study, the CLUCC-dependent increase in upper alpha rhythm, particularly enhanced in elderly non-demented individuals, may imply that the genotype is related to preclinical dysregulation of hippocampal neurophysiology in aging and that this factor may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

An Electrophysiological Signature of Summed Similarity in Visual Working Memory	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						summed similarity; oscillations; recognition memory; EEG	RECOGNITION MEMORY; SYNTHETIC FACES; TEMPORAL-LOBE; RANDOM-WALK; OSCILLATIONS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; FMRI; REPRESENTATION; PATTERNS	Summed-similarity models of short-term item recognition posit that participants base their judgments of an item's prior occurrence on that item's summed similarity to the ensemble of items on the remembered list. We examined the neural predictions of these models in 3 short-term recognition memory experiments using electrocorticographic/depth electrode recordings and scalp electroencephalography. On each experimental trial, participants judged whether a test face had been among a small set of recently studied faces. Consistent with summed-similarity theory, participants' tendency to endorse a test item increased as a function of its summed similarity to the items on the just-studied list. To characterize this behavioral effect of summed similarity, we successfully fit a summed-similarity model to individual participant data from each experiment. Using the parameters determined from fitting the summed-similarity model to the behavioral data, we examined the relation between summed similarity and brain activity. We found that 4-9 Hz theta activity in the medial temporal lobe and 2-4 Hz delta activity recorded from frontal and parietal cortices increased with summed similarity. These findings demonstrate direct neural correlates of the similarity computations that form the foundation of several major cognitive theories of human recognition memory.

Task and Spatial Frequency Modulations of Object Processing: An EEG Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; GAMMA BAND RESPONSES; TIME-COURSE; BASIC-LEVEL; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; EFFECT SIZE; CATEGORIZATION; PERCEPTION; FACE; RECOGNITION	Visual object processing may follow a coarse-to-fine sequence imposed by fast processing of low spatial frequencies (LSF) and slow processing of high spatial frequencies (HSF). Objects can be categorized at varying levels of specificity: the superordinate (e.g. animal), the basic (e.g. dog), or the subordinate (e.g. Border Collie). We tested whether superordinate and more specific categorization depend on different spatial frequency ranges, and whether any such dependencies might be revealed by or influence signals recorded using EEG. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency (TF) analysis to examine the time course of object processing while participants performed either a grammatical gender-classification task (which generally forces basic-level categorization) or a living/non-living judgement (superordinate categorization) on everyday, real-life objects. Objects were filtered to contain only HSF or LSF. We found a greater positivity and greater negativity for HSF than for LSF pictures in the P1 and N1 respectively, but no effects of task on either component. A later, fronto-central negativity (N350) was more negative in the gender-classification task than the superordinate categorization task, which may indicate that this component relates to semantic or syntactic processing. We found no significant effects of task or spatial frequency on evoked or total gamma band responses. Our results demonstrate early differences in processing of HSF and LSF content that were not modulated by categorization task, with later responses reflecting such higher-level cognitive factors.

Frequency specific spatial interactions in human electrocorticography: V1 alpha oscillations reflect surround suppression	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electrocorticography; Alpha oscillation; Surround suppression; Broadband power; Population receptive field	INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; VISUAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SPIKING ACTIVITY; POWER INCREASES; EEG; MODULATION; BAND; PSYCHOPHYSICS	Electrical brain signals are often decomposed into frequency ranges that are implicated in different functions. Using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG, intracranial EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured frequency spectra and BOLD responses in primary visual cortex (V1) and intraparietal sulcus (WS). In V1 and IPS, 30-120 Hz (gamma, broadband) oscillations allowed population receptive field (pRF) reconstruction comparable to fMRI estimates. Lower frequencies, however, responded very differently in V1 and IPS. In V1, broadband activity extends down to 3 Hz. In the 4-7 Hz (theta) and 18-30 Hz (beta) ranges broadband activity increases power during stimulation within the pRF. However, V1 9-12 Hz (alpha) frequency oscillations showed a different time course. The broadband power here is exceeded by a frequency-specific power increase during stimulation of the area outside the pRF. As such, V1 alpha oscillations reflected surround suppression of the pRF, much like negative fMRI responses. They were consequently highly localized, depending on stimulus and pRF position, and independent between nearby electrodes. In IPS, all 3-25 Hz oscillations were strongest during baseline recording and correlated between nearby electrodes, consistent with large-scale disengagement. These findings demonstrate V1 alpha oscillations result from locally active functional processes and relate these alpha oscillations to negative fMRI signals. They highlight that similar oscillations in different areas reflect processes with different functional roles. However, both of these roles of alpha seem to reflect suppression of spiking activity.

Expected reward modulates encoding-related theta activity before an event	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Prestimulus activity; Memory encoding; Reward; Theta; Anticipation; Long-term memory	PREDICTS LATER RECOLLECTION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; MEMORY FORMATION; EPISODIC MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG	Oscillatory brain activity in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz) before the onset of an event has been shown to affect the likelihood of successfully encoding the event into memory. Recent work has also indicated that frontal theta activity might be modulated by reward, but it is not clear how reward expectancy, anticipatory theta activity, and memory formation might be related. Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the relationship between these factors. EEG was recorded from healthy adults while they memorized a series of words. Each word was preceded by a cue that indicated whether a high or low monetary reward would be earned if the word was successfully remembered in a later recognition test. Frontal theta power between the presentation of the reward cue and the onset of a word was predictive of later memory for the word, but only in the high reward condition. No theta differences were observed before word onset following low reward cues. The magnitude of prestimulus encoding-related theta activity in the high reward condition was correlated with the number of high reward words that were later confidently recognized. These findings provide strong evidence for a link between reward expectancy, theta activity, and memory encoding. Theta activity before event onset seems to be especially important for the encoding of motivationally significant stimuli. One possibility is that dopaminergic activity during reward anticipation mediates frontal theta activity related to memory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present project, monozygotic (N=51 pairs) and dizygotic (N=48 pairs) twins performed a visual oddball task with dense-array EEG. Using spatial PCA, two principal components each were retained for targets and standards; wavelets were used to obtain time-frequency maps of eigenvalue-weighted event-related oscillations for each individual. Distribution of inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) and single trial power (STP) over time indicated that the early principal component was primarily associated with ITC while the later component was associated with a mixture of ITC and STP. Spatial PCA on point-by-point broad sense heritability matrices revealed data-derived frequency bands similar to those well established in EEG literature. Biometric models of eigenvalue-weighted time-frequency data suggest a link between physiology of oscillatory brain activity and patterns of genetic influence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Participants were assessed from age 17 through 29 for lifetime externalizing (EXT) disorders. EEG comparisons from three topographic regions were examined for P3 amplitude and TF-PCs at delta and theta frequency ranges. Significant P3 amplitude reductions were found in those with EXT for both regional and site-Pz analyses, with stronger effects observed the greater the EXT comorbidity. Reductions were also observed in all eight TF-PCs extracted, with a delta component yielding frontal effects not apparent in the time domain. Overall, results suggest that these brain measures continue, at age 29, to provide effective indices of EXT that potentially tap a neural substrate related to behavioral disinhibition.

A Novel Flexible Model for the Extraction of Features from Brain Signals in the Time-Frequency Domain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article								Electrophysiological signals such as the EEG, MEG, or LFPs have been extensively studied over the last decades, and elaborate signal processing algorithms have been developed for their analysis. Many of these methods are based on time-frequency decomposition to account for the signals' spectral properties while maintaining their temporal dynamics. However, the data typically exhibit intra-and interindividual variability. Existing algorithms o.en do not take into account this variability, for instance by using fixed frequency bands This shortcoming has inspired us to develop a new robust and flexible method for time-frequency analysis and signal feature extraction using the novel smooth natural Gaussian extension (snaGe) model.. The model is nonlinear, and its parameters are interpretable. We propose an algorithm to derive initial parameters based on dynamic programming for nonlinear fitting and describe an iterative refinement scheme to robustly fit high-order models. We further present distance functions to be able to compare different instances of our model The method's functionality and robustness are demonstrated using simulated as well as real data The snaGe model is a general tool allowing for a wide range of applications in biomedical data analysis.

In the present EEG study the neural mechanisms of the classic selective exposure effect were examined by investigating oscillatory brain responses to consistent vs. inconsistent information. Twenty participants made an economic decision and subsequently were exposed to 45 consistent and 45 inconsistent images concerning their decision. EEG was recorded from 31 electrodes and differences between oscillatory brain responses towards consistent and inconsistent information were examined. The main result was an increase of induced theta power (5-8 Hz, 0-0.7 s) in the consistent compared to the inconsistent condition at right temporo-parietal electrodes, as well as a corresponding increase of evoked theta power at frontal electrodes. Since theta oscillations are often observed during memory formation, we conclude that decision-consistent information triggers memory formation, whereas decision-inconsistent information seems not to do so. This finding supports the classic motivational perspective of Leon Festinger on the selective exposure effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subjects were 19 volunteers. Real or sham electromagnetic field (EMF) exposures for 3h were performed before their usual sleep time on 3 consecutive days. They were exposed to real EMF on the second or third experimental day in a double-blind design. Sleepiness and sleep insufficiency were evaluated the next morning. Polysomnograms were recorded for analyses of the sleep variables and power spectra of electroencephalograms (EEG). No significant differences were observed between the two conditions in subjective feelings. Sleep parameters including sleep stage percentages and EEG power spectra did not differ significantly between real and sham exposures. We conclude that continuous wave EMF exposure for 3h from a W-CDMA-like system has no detectable effects on human sleep. Bioelectromagnetics 34:589-598, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The <1 Hz sleep slow oscillation hallmarks slow-wave sleep and is critical to memory consolidation. Here we show in sleeping humans that auditory stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up states profoundly enhances the slow oscillation rhythm, phase-coupled spindle activity, and, consequently, the consolidation of declarative memory. Stimulation out of phase with the ongoing slow oscillation rhythm remained ineffective. Closed-loop in-phase stimulation provides a straight-forward tool to enhance sleep rhythms and their functional efficacy.

A hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG of human subjects during visual stimulation. Signals were continuously recorded from scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Fast Fourier transform provides the phase, which is used to obtain directional phase information relating to cognitive tasks. Spatial patterns of EEG phase modulation were identified and classified with respect to stimulus. The obtained results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so as to support mechanisms of brain-computer interfacing.

In the most popular motor imagery (MI) BCI system, a significant number of target users (called "BCI-Illiterates") cannot modulate their neuronal signals sufficiently to use the BCI system. This causes performance variability among subjects and even among sessions within a subject. The mechanism of such BCI-Illiteracy and possible solutions still remain to be determined Gamma oscillation is known to be involved in various fundamental brain functions, and may play a role in MI. In this study, we investigated the association of gamma activity with MI performance among subjects. Ten simultaneous MEG/EEG experiments were conducted MI performance for each was estimated by EEG data, and the gamma activity associate with BCI performance was investigated with MEG data. Our results showed that gamma activity had a high positive correlation with MI performance in the prefrontal area. This trend was also found across sessions within one subject. In conclusion, gamma rhythm generated in the prefrontal area appear to play a critical role in BCI performance.

The EEG records neuronal membrane potential oscillations that depend on the morpho-functional characteristics of the membrane and of modifications by postsynaptic excitatory (PSEP) and inhibitory (PSIP) potentials. The quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures the absolute power (AP) of oscillations separated in frequencies, resulting from the interaction among subcortical-cortical-subcortical ensembles. The hypothesis is that neuronal networks function at a given frequency and that their APs are codes that, by becoming synchronized in diverse ensembles, generate behavior. Objective. To establish the spectral power of cortical oscillations under diverse study paradigms and in different populations. In particular, to identify the AP and topographical distribution of four cerebral frequency bands under resting wakefulness and activation, and to integrate results into a database to establish comparison standards. Material and methods. Undergraduate students, average age of 20.6 +/- 2.6 years, who participated voluntarily in the study. Recordings were made with a Nicolet EEG. We chose, in the first stage, closed eyes (CE) three samples of 12 s each. In the second stage, we chose pairs of 6 s samples, first with CE and then with OE. For their analysis, we applied the Welch periodogram and we plotted the average AP (AAP) and standard deviation (SD) of delta, theta, alpha, and beta per lead. Differences were compared through non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon and Dunnett T3); setting statistical significance at alpha = 0.05. Results. Average APs of each frequency band differ significantly in intensity and topographic distribution generating a profile of each rhythm. When opening the eyes, rhythms desynchronized significantly at different intensities in the diverse leads, except for beta in the left fronto-frontal lead. Discussion. Results indicate the existence of cortical ensembles that synchronize at a determined frequency and are modified by visual stimulation, indicating the effects of the subcortico-cortical circuits. The integrated database provides comparison standards to support diagnoses and treatments.

Electrophysiological changes in response to meditation were explored in 12 healthy volunteers who completed 8 weeks of a basic training course in autogenic meditation. Heart coherence, representing the degree of ordering in oscillation of heart rhythm intervals, increased significantly during meditation. Relative EEG alpha power and alpha lagged coherence also increased. A significant slowing of parietal peak alpha frequency was observed. Parietal peak alpha power increased with increasing heart coherence during meditation, but no such relationship was observed during baseline. Average alpha lagged coherence also increased with increasing heart coherence during meditation, but weak opposite relationship was observed at baseline. Relative alpha power increased with increasing heart coherence during both meditation and baseline periods. Heart coherence can be a cardiac marker for the meditative state and also may be a general marker for the meditative state since heart coherence is strongly correlated with EEG alpha activities. It is expected that increasing heart coherence and the accompanying EEG alpha activations, heart brain synchronicity, would help recover physiological synchrony following a period of homeostatic depletion.

Methods: EEG from eight cortical regions were recorded at rest during eyes open and eyes closed in 22 male ADHD subjects of combined type and 21 healthy male controls (age range 4-15 years). Univariate and interdependence measurements calculated from the frequency domain and from the reconstructed state spaces of EEG signals were computed, and their performance in discriminating ADHD from healthy subjects was analyzed. Results: Significant between-group differences in univariate measures were age-dependent. However, certain interdependence inter-hemispheric measures during eyes closed showed significant, age-independent between-groups differences. Among them, coherence in the beta band between inter-occipital regions and between left/occipital-right/central regions provided an overall accuracy classification rate of 74.4%. Even greater accuracy (86.7%) was obtained by an interdependence index of generalized synchronization between left/occipital-right/central regions and left/central-right/temporal regions. Conclusions: EEG beta coherence and especially the degree of generalized synchronization between a few inter-hemispheric regions during resting state with eyes closed allow a high accuracy classification rate of ADHD subjects. Significance: Changes in inter-hemispheric EEG functional brain connectivity at rest are useful for ADHD diagnosis in a broad age range. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Cortico-Muscular Coherence on artifact corrected EEG-EMG data recorded with a MRI scanner	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			TIME; POTENTIALS; REMOVAL; TREMOR; FMRI	Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides great potential for studying human brain activity with high temporal and spatial resolution. But, due to the MRI, the recorded signals are contaminated with artifacts. The correction of these artifacts is important to use these signals for further spectral analysis. The coherence can reveal the cortical representation of peripheral muscle signal in particular motor tasks, e. g. finger movements. The artifact correction of these signals was done by two different algorithms the Brain vision analyzer (BVA) and the Matlab FMRIB plug-in for EEGLAB. The Welch periodogram method was used for estimating the cortico-muscular coherence. Our analysis revealed coherence with a frequency of 5Hz in the contralateral side of the brain. The entropy is estimated for the calculated coherence to get the distribution of coherence in the scalp. The significance of the paper is to identify the optimal algorithm to rectify the MR artifacts and as a first step to use both these signals EEG and EMG in conjunction with MRI for further studies.

A Wearable UHF RFID-Based EEG System	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID (RFID)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)	APR 30-MAY 02, 2013	Orlando, FL	IEEE				The wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring systems are the cornerstone of noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and many medical applications, but state-of-the-art wearable systems are limited by weight, battery life and size. In this paper we present EEGWISP: am EEG monitoring system that is battery-free; is powered by a standard UHF RFID reader; and uses backscatter to transmit the data using a EPC Class 1 Gen2 protocol. Since EEGWISP does not need batteries it can be lightweight, miniature and maintenance free for users. We designed a low-power EEG acquisition circuit with 62.6 mu A current consumption. For validation, EEG signals were shown by distinct appearance of 8-12 Hz oscillations (alpha waves) when wearer's eyes are closed. EEGWISP can record EEG signals at 63 Hz sampling rate, at the distances up to 0.80 m and with 0.1 % data loss. With slight modifications, our system can be used for other biopotential signals such as ECG.

J	Pomper, U; Hofle, M; Hauck, M; Kathmann, N; Engel, AK; Senkowski, D				Pomper, Ulrich; Hoefle, Marion; Hauck, Michael; Kathmann, Norbert; Engel, Andreas K.; Senkowski, Daniel			Crossmodal bias of visual input on pain perception and pain-induced beta activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multisensory; EEG; Neural synchrony; Oscillations; Event-related potentials; Gamma-band	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; A-DELTA-FIBER; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; INVERSE EFFECTIVENESS; OBJECT RECOGNITION; EEG RESPONSES; C-FIBER; ENHANCEMENT; STIMULUS	In our environment, acute pain is often accompanied by input from other sensory modalities, like visual stimuli, which can facilitate pain processing. To date, it is not well understood how these inputs influence the perception and processing of pain. Previous studies on integrative processing between sensory modalities other than pain have shown that multisensory response gains are strongest when the constituent unimodal stimuli are minimally effective in evoking responses. This finding has been termed the principle of inverse effectiveness (IE). In this high-density electroencephalography study, we investigated the influence of Gabor patches of low and high contrast levels on the perception and processing of spatially and temporally aligned painful electrical stimuli of low and high intensities. Subjective pain ratings, event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory responses served as dependent measures. In line with the principle of IE, stronger crossmodal biasing effects of visual input on subjective pain ratings were found for low compared to high intensity painful stimuli. This effect was paralleled by stronger bimodal interactions in right-central ERPs (150-200 ms) for low compared to high intensity pain stimuli. Moreover, an enhanced suppression of medio-central beta-band activity (12-24 Hz, 200-400 ms) was found for low compared to high intensity pain stimuli. Our findings possibly reflect a facilitation of stimulus processing that serves to enhance response readiness of the sensorimotor system following painful stimulation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that multisensory processing between visual and painful stimuli follows the principle of IE and suggests a role for beta-band oscillations in the crossmodal modulation of pain.

Event-related oscillations might be used for detection of cognitive deficits. Our group's earlier results showed diminished delta visual and auditory target oscillatory responses in AD, and we investigated whether this prevails for MCI. Eighteen MCI subjects and 18 age-matched healthy elderly controls were investigated. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes of oscillatory responses for each subject's averaged oscillatory target responses in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands upon application of visual oddball paradigm were measured. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze four locations (frontal, central, parietal, occipital), at three coronal (left, midline, right) sites. Independent t tests were applied for post-hoc analyses. The oddball target delta response (0.5-3.0 Hz) was 26-32% lower in MCI than healthy controls over fronto-central-parietal regions [F(1.34) = 4.562, p = 0.04]. Without a group effect, theta oscillatory responses (4-7 Hz) showed significant differences in coronal electrodes indicating highest values over mid-electrode sites, and a anteriorposterior x coronal effect, being maximum at mid-central. Alpha frequency band analyses indicated no statistical differences. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of visual target delta oscillatory responses were lower in fronto-central-parietal regions in MCI than in healthy controls. This supports our earlier findings in AD, showing hypoactive delta fronto-central-parietal regions during cognitive tasks. These results indicate that event-related oscillations may detect early changes of brain dynamics in MCI, and deserves to be investigated as a candidate biomarker in further studies using multimodal techniques.

In this paper, the effect of presence and absence of gamma band on performance improvement is discussed since movement imaginations affect gamma frequency band as well. Methods: In this study we used data set 2a from BCI Competition IV. In this data set, 9 healthy subjects have performed left hand, right hand, foot and tongue movement imaginations. Time and frequency intervals are computed for each subject and then are classified using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a feature extractor. Finally, data is classified by LDA(1), RBF2 MLP3, SVM(4)and KNN5 methods. In all experiments, accuracy rate of classification is computed using 4 fold validation method. Results: It is seen that most of the time, combination of mu, beta and gamma bands would have better performance than just using combination of mu and beta bands or gamma band alone. In general, the improvement rate of the average classification accuracy is computed 2.91%. Discussion: In this study, it is shown that using combination of mu, beta and gamma frequency bands provides more information than only using combination of mu and beta in movement imagination separations.

Methods: To this end we developed a multistage signal processing methodology comprising blind source separation coupled with a neural network based feature extraction and classification method. Results: Changes in the amplitude and phase of brain sources estimates in the VLF band between rest and task were enhanced with increased task difficulty, but remained lower than those experienced in higher frequency bands. The slow wave variations were also significantly correlated with task performance measures, and hence with the level of task-directed attention. Conclusions: These findings suggest that besides their prominent sensitivity to external stimulation, VLFOs also contribute to the cortical ongoing background activity which may not be specifically related to task-specific attention and performance. Significance: Our work provides important insight into the association between VLF brain activity and conventional EEG frequency bands, and presents a novel framework for assessing neural activity during various mental conditions and psychiatric states.

To further understand the mechanisms of alpha rhythm power fluctuation, we performed simultaneous EEGs and functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings in human subjects during a resting state and explored the dynamic relationship between alpha power fluctuation and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of the brain. Based on the frequency characteristics of the alpha power time series (APTS) during 20-minute EEG recordings, we divided the APTS into two components: fast fluctuation (0.04-0.167 Hz) and slow fluctuation (0-0.04 Hz). Analysis of the correlation between the MRI signal and each component revealed that the slow fluctuation component of alpha power was positively correlated with BOLD signal changes in the brain stem and the medial part of the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, while the fast fluctuation component was correlated with the lateral part of the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, but not the brain stem. In summary, these data suggest that different subcortical structures contribute to slow and fast modulations of alpha spectra on brain EEG.

We exploited DL technique with input feature clusters to handle high dimensional features related to time - frequency events. The method was applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. For classification of target and non-target images, a deep belief net (DBN) classifier was based on the uncorrelated features, which was constructed from original correlated features using clustering method. The performance of the proposed DBN was tested for different combinations of hidden units and hidden layers on multiple subjects. The results of DBN were compared with cluster Linear Discriminant Analysis (cLDA) and Support vector machine (SVM) and DBN demonstrated better performance in all tested cases. There was an improvement of 10 - 25% for certain cases. We also demonstrated how DBN is used to characterize brain activities.

Similarities and Differences of Acute Nonconvulsive Seizures and Other Epileptic Activities following Penetrating and Ischemic Brain Injuries in Rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						EEG rat; MCAO; NCS; PBBI	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; PERIODIC EEG PATTERNS; TRANSHEMISPHERIC DIASCHISIS; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; GLYPROMATE ANALOG; CRITICALLY-ILL; DISCHARGES; MODEL; STROKE	The similarities and differences between acute nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) and other epileptic events, for example, periodic epileptiform discharges (PED) and intermittent rhythmic delta activities (IRDA), were characterized in rat models of penetrating and ischemic brain injuries. The NCS were spontaneously induced by either unilateral frontal penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), and were detected by continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring begun immediately after the injury and continued for 72 h or 24 h, respectively. Analysis of NCS profiles (incidence, frequency, duration, and time distribution) revealed a high NCS incidence in both injury models. The EEG waveform expressions of NCS and PED exhibited intrinsic variations that resembled human electrographic manifestations of post-traumatic and post-ischemic ictal and inter-ictal events, but these waveform variations were not distinguishable between the two types of brain injury. However, the NCS after pMCAO occurred more acutely and intensely (latency = 0.6 h, frequency = 25 episodes/rat) compared with the PBBI-induced NCS (latency = 24 h, frequency = 10 episodes/rat), such that the most salient features differentiating post-traumatic and post-ischemic NCS were the intensity and time distribution of the NCS profiles. After pMCAO, nearly 50% of the seizures occurred within the first 2 h of injury, whereas after PBBI, NCS occurred sporadically (0-5%/h) throughout the 72 h recording period. The PED were episodically associated with NCS. By contrast, the IRDA appeared to be independent of other epileptic events. This study provided comprehensive comparisons of post-traumatic and post-ischemic epileptic profiles. The identification of the similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of epileptic events may lead to differential strategies for post-traumatic and post-stroke seizure interventions.

We investigated whether the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with BD showed altered synchronization or network properties. Resting-state EEG was recorded in 57 BD type-I patients and 87 healthy control subjects. Functional connectivity between pairs of EEG channels was measured using synchronization likelihood (SL) for 5 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Graph-theoretic analysis was applied to SL over the electrode array to assess network properties. BD patients showed a decrease of mean synchronization in the alpha band, and the decreases were greatest in fronto-central and centro-parietal connections. In addition, the clustering coefficient and global efficiency were decreased in BD patients, whereas the characteristic path length increased. We also found that the normalized characteristic path length and small-worldness were significantly correlated with depression scores in BD patients. These results suggest that BD patients show impaired neural synchronization at rest and a disruption of resting-state functional connectivity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Whether this mechanism also involves coherent oscillations at delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) is not known. Rather, delta oscillations have been associated with slow-wave sleep. Here, we show coherent oscillations in the delta frequency band between parietal and frontal cortices during the decision-making component of a somatosensory discrimination task. Importantly, the magnitude of this delta-band coherence is modulated by the different decision alternatives. Furthermore, during control conditions not requiring decision making, delta-band coherences are typically much reduced. Our work indicates an important role for synchronous activity in the delta frequency band when large-scale, distant cortical networks coordinate their neural activity during decision making.

Low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta, <7 Hz) are dominant in children but become less prominent in the adult brain, where higher-frequency alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) dominate the mature brain rhythm. However, this assessment of developmental effects with EEG power mapping is restricted to the scalp level and blind to the information flow between brain regions, thus limiting insights about brain development. In contrast dynamic source synchronization provides a tool to study inter-regional directionality on the cortical and sub-cortical source level. In this study we investigated functional and directed connectivities (information flow) with renormalized partial directed coherence during resting state EEG (eyes open and eyes closed) recordings in 17 school-aged children and 17 young adults. First, we found higher spectral mean source power in children relative to adults, irrespective of the examined frequency band and resting state. We further found that coherence values were stronger in adults compared to children in all frequency bands. The directed within-group coherence analysis indicated information flow from frontal to parietal sources in children, while information flow from parietal to frontal was observed in adults. In addition, significant thalamocortical connectivity was unidirectional (i.e., outflow to cortical regions) in adults, but bidirectional in children. Group comparison confirmed the results of the single subject analyses for both functional and directed connectivities. Our results suggest that both functional and directed connectivities are sensitive to brain maturation as the distribution and directionality of functional connections differ between the developing and adult brains.

This information is readily accessible when subsequently encountered, and a neural correlate of this is an attenuation of the N400 event-related potential (ERP). We used ERPs and time-frequency (TF) analysis to investigate neural correlates of processing inferred information after a causal coherence inference had been generated during text comprehension. Participants read short texts, some of which promoted inference generation. After each text, they performed lexical decisions to target words that were unrelated or inference-related to the preceding text. Consistent with previous findings, inference-related words elicited an attenuated N400 relative to unrelated words. TF analyses revealed unique contributions to the N400 from activity occurring at 1-6 Hz (theta) and 0-2 Hz (delta), supporting the view that multiple, sequential processes underlie the N400.

Stochastic behavior of phase synchronization index and cross-frequency couplings in epileptogenic zones during interictal periods measured with scalp dEEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy localization; dEEG; phase synchronization; stochastic behavior of EEG; cross-frequency couplings		The stochastic behavior of the phase synchronization index (SI) and cross-frequency couplings on different days during a hospital stay of three epileptic patients was studied for non-invasive localization of the epileptogenic areas from high density, 256-channel, scalp EEG (dEEG) recordings. The study was performed with short-duration (0-180s), seizure-free, epileptiform-free, and spike-free interictal dEEG data on different days of three subjects. The seizure areas were localized with subdural recordings with an 8 x 8 macro-electrode grid array and strip electrodes. The study was performed in theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (7-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and low gamma (30-50 Hz) bands. A detrended fluctuation analysis was used to find the long range temporal correlations in the SI that reveals the stochastic behavior of the SI in a given time period. The phase synchronization was computed after taking Hilbert transform of the EEG data. Contour plots were constructed with 20s time-frames using a montage of the layout of 256 electrode positions. It was found that the stochastic behavior of the SI was higher in epileptogenic areas and in nearby areas on different days for each subject. The low gamma band was found to be the best to localize the epileptic sites. Also, a stable higher pattern of SI emerged after 60-120s in the epileptogenic areas. The cross-frequency couplings of SI in theta gamma, beta gamma, and alpha gamma bands were decreased and spatial patterns were fragmented in epileptogenic areas. Combinations of an increase in the stochastic behavior of the SI and decrease in cross-frequency couplings are potential markers to assist in localizing epileptogenic areas. These findings suggest that it is possible to localize the epileptogenic areas non-invasively from a short-duration (similar to 180s), seizure-free and spike-free interictal scalp dEEG recordings.

EEG correlates of time-varying BOLD functional connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN NETWORKS; FMRI SIGNALS; HEART-RATE; FLUCTUATIONS; SLEEP; CORTEX; ARCHITECTURE; WAKEFULNESS	Recent resting-state fMRI studies have shown that the apparent functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions may undergo changes on time-scales of seconds to minutes, the basis and importance of which are largely unknown. Here, we examine the electrophysiological correlates of within-scan FC variations during a condition of eyes-closed rest. A sliding window analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data was performed to examine whether temporal variations in coupling between three major networks (default mode; DMN, dorsal attention; DAN, and salience network; SN) are associated with temporal variations in mental state, as assessed from the amplitude of alpha and theta oscillations in the EEG. In our dataset, alpha power showed a significant inverse relationship with the strength of connectivity between DMN and DAN. In addition, alpha power covaried with the spatial extent of anticorrelation between DMN and DAN, with higher alpha power associated with larger anticorrelation extent. Results suggest an electrical signature of the time-varying FC between the DAN and DMN, potentially reflecting neural and state-dependent variations. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Lin, YF; Wu, W; Wu, CH; Liu, BL; Gao, XR				Lin, Yanfei; Wu, Wei; Wu, Chaohua; Liu, Baolin; Gao, Xiaorong			Extraction of mismatch negativity using a resampling-based spatial filtering method	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; AUDITORY FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN; MMN; POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION; DYNAMICS; DURATION	Objective. It is currently a challenge to extract the mismatch negativity (MMN) waveform on the basis of a small number of EEG trials, which are typically unbalanced between conditions. Approach. In order to address this issue, a method combining the techniques of resampling and spatial filtering is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the first step of the method, termed 'resampling difference', randomly samples the standard and deviant sweeps, and then subtracts standard sweeps from deviant sweeps. The second step of the method employs the spatial filters designed by a signal-to-noise ratio maximizer (SIM) to extract the MMN component. The SIM algorithm can maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for event-related potentials (ERPs) to improve extraction. Simulation data were used to evaluate the influence of three parameters (i.e. trial number, repeated-SIM times and sampling times) on the performance of the proposed method. Main results. Results demonstrated that it was feasible and reliable to extract the MMN waveform using the method. Finally, an oddball paradigm with auditory stimuli of different frequencies was employed to record a few trials (50 trials of deviant sweeps and 250 trials of standard sweeps) of EEG data from 11 adult subjects. Results showed that the method could effectively extract the MMN using the EEG data of each individual subject. Significance. The extracted MMN waveform has a significantly larger peak amplitude and shorter latencies in response to the more deviant stimuli than in response to the less deviant stimuli, which agreed with the MMN properties reported in previous literature using grand-averaged EEG data of multi-subjects.

Infomax independent component analysis decomposed the EEG into independent components (ICs), representing brain, muscle and artifact sources. ICs were clustered across participants based on their anatomical position and spectral patterns. Coherence was computed between clusters. We show that walking compared to standing decreases alpha (8-12Hz) band coherence between sensorimotor areas. Additionally lower gamma band (3036Hz) coherence between the premotor cortex and the sensory cortex is enhanced. Our results suggest different functionalities at alpha and gamma synchrony on sensorimotor processing during locomotion.

Compressing movement information via principal components analysis (PCA): Contrasting outcomes from the time and frequency domains	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Principal components analysis; Postural control; Time and frequency domain; Kinematics	INVERTED PENDULUM; EQUILIBRIUM; VARIABILITY; SYNERGIES; STIFFNESS; BALANCE; MODEL	PCA has become an increasingly used analysis technique in the movement domain to reveal patterns in data of various kinds (e.g., kinematics, kinetics, EEG, EMG) and to compress the dimension of the multivariate data set recorded. It appears that virtually all movement related PCA analyses have, however, been conducted in the time domain (PCA(t)). This standard approach can be biased when there are lead-lag (phase-related) properties to the multivariate time series data. Here we show through theoretical derivation and analysis of simulated and experimental postural kinematics data sets that PCA(t) and, PCA in the frequency domain (PCA(f)), can lead to contrasting determinations of the dimension of a data set, with the tendency of PCA(t) to overestimate the number of components. PCA(f) also provides the possibility of obtaining amplitude and phase-difference spectra for each principal component that are uniquely suitable to reveal control mechanisms of the system. The bias in the PCA(t) estimate of the number of components can have significant implications for the veracity of the interpretations drawn in regard to the dynamical degrees of freedom of the perceptual-motor system.

Similarly, the biological mechanisms contributing to the general factor of intelligence, or g, have been under scrutiny for decades. Individual alpha frequency (IAF), a trait-like parameter of the EEG, has been found to correlate with individual differences in cognitive performance and cognitive abilities. Informed by large-scale theories of neural organization emphasizing the general functional significance of oscillatory activity, the present study replicates and extends these findings by testing the hypothesis that IAF is related to intelligence at the level of g, rather than at the level of specific cognitive abilities. Structural equation modeling allowed us to statistically control for measurement error when estimating the association between IAF and intellectual functioning. In line with our hypothesis, we found a statistically reliable and substantial correlation between IAF and g (r = .40). The magnitude of this correlation did not differ significantly between younger and older adults, and captured all of the covariation between IAF and the cognitive abilities of reasoning, memory, and perceptual speed. The observed association between IAF and g provides a parsimonious explanation for the commonly observed diffuse pattern of correlations between IAF and cognitive performance. We conclude that IAF is a marker of global architectural and functional properties of the human brain. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, we explored predictors of treatment response and EEG correlates of clinical symptoms. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel design, 20 inpatients with OCD underwent 25 sessions of NFB or sham feedback (SFB). NFB aimed at reducing EEG activity in an independent component previously reported abnormal in this diagnosis. Resting-state EEG recorded before and after the treatment was analyzed to assess its posttreatment changes, relationships with clinical symptoms and treatment response. Results: Overall, clinical improvement in OCD patients was not accompanied by EEG change as assessed by standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography and normative independent component analysis. Pre- to posttreatment comparison of the trained component and frequency did not yield significant results; however, in the NFB group, the nominal values at the downtrained frequency were lower after treatment. The NFB group showed significantly higher percentage reduction of compulsions compared to the SFB group (p = 0.015). Pretreatment higher amount of delta (1-6 Hz) and low alpha oscillations as well as a lower amount of high beta activity predicted a worse treatment outcome. Source localization of these delta and high beta oscillations corresponded with previous EEG resting-state findings in OCD patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Independent component NFB in OCD proved useful in percentage improvement of compulsions. Based on our correlation analyses, we hypothesize that we targeted a network related to treatment resistance. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

ROBOT ASSISTED WALKING AFFECTS THE SYNCHRONY BETWEEN PREMOTOR AND SOMATOSENSORY AREAS	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article						EEG during walking; Coherence; brain oscillations; Neurorehabiltation; gait		We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 14 healthy volunteers during standing and active walking with a robotic gait orthosis. Infomax independent component analysis decomposed the EEG into independent components (ICs), representing brain, muscle and artifact sources. ICs were clustered across participants based on their anatomical position and spectral patterns. Coherence was computed between clusters. We show that walking compared to standing decreases alpha (8-12Hz) band coherence between sensorimotor areas. Additionally lower gamma band (30-36Hz) coherence between the premotor cortex and the sensory cortex is enhanced. Our results suggest different functionalities at alpha and gamma synchrony on sensorimotor processing during locomotion.

Respiratory cycle related EEG changes: Modified respiratory cycle segmentation	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Polysomnography; Respiratory cycle related EEG changes; Inspiratory/expiratory transition; Signal processing; Computer assisted; RCREC	INPUT IMPEDANCE; SLEEP; CHILDREN; INSPIRATION; EXPIRATION; TRANSITION	Respiratory cycle related EEG change (RCREC) is characterized by significant relative EEG power changes within different stages of respiration during sleep. RCREC has been demonstrated to predict sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and is hypothesized to represent microarousals. As such RCREC may provide a sensitive marker of respiratory arousals. A key step in quantification of RCREC is respiratory signal segmentation which is conventionally based on local maxima and minima of the nasal flow signal. We have investigated an alternative respiratory cycle segmentation method based on inspiratory/expiratory transitions. Sixty two healthy paediatric participants were recruited through staff of local universities in Bolivia. Subjects underwent attended polysomnography on a single night (Compumedics PS2 system). Studies were sleep staged according to standard criteria. C3/A2 EEG channel and time-locked nasal flow (thermistor) were used in RCREC quantification. Forty Seven subjects aged 7-17 (11.4 +/- 3) years (24M:23F) were found to have usable polysomnographs for the purpose of RCREC calculation. Respiratory cycles were segmented using both the conventional and novel (transition) methods and differences in RCREC derived from the two methods were compared in each frequency band. Significance of transition RCREC as measured by Fisher's F value through analysis of variance (ANOVA) was found to be significantly higher than the conventional RCREC in all frequency bands (P < 0.05) but beta. This increase in statistical significance of RCREC as demonstrated with the novel transition segmentation approach suggests better alignment of the respiratory cycle segments with the underlying physiology driving RCREC.

Methods: We recently determined the intracranial distribution of the K-complex in a study of 6 patients with epilepsy (Clin. Neurophysiol. 121 (2010) 1176). Here we use the simultaneously acquired scalp EEG data to evaluate the validity and reliability of different ESI techniques. MEG recordings were acquired in 3 of the 6 patients, and K-complexes were recorded with high density EEG and MEG in an additional subject without epilepsy. ESI forward models included finite element method and boundary element method (BEM) volume conductors; for MSI, single sphere and BEM models were assessed. Inverse models included equivalent current dipole mapping and distributed current source modeling algorithms. Results: ESI and MSI provided physiologically invalid source solutions in all subjects, incorrectly localizing K-complex generators to deep midline structures. ESI provided consistent localization results across subjects for individual and averaged K-complexes, indicating solutions were not influenced by random noise or choice of model parameters. MEG K-complexes were lower in amplitude relative to baseline than EEG K-complexes, with less consistent localization results even after signal averaging, likely due to MEG-specific signal cancellation and sensitivity to source orientation. Distributed source modeling did not resolve the known problem of excessively deep fitting of single dipole locations for extended cortical sources. Conclusions: Various noninvasive ESI and MSI techniques tested did not provide localization results for individual or averaged K-complexes that were physiologically meaningful or concordant with source locations indicated by intracranial recordings. Distributed source algorithms, though theoretically more appropriate for localizing extended cortical sources, showed the same propensity as dipole mapping to provide deep midline solutions for an extended superficial cortical source. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate modeling approaches for these large electrographic events. Significance: Existing noninvasive source localization techniques may not provide valid solutions for large extended cortical sources such as the human K-complex.

The relation between electroencephalogram asymmetry and attention biases to threat at baseline and under stress	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						EEG asymmetry; Attention bias; Speech task	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVATION; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ANGRY FACES; TIME-COURSE; ANXIETY; ADOLESCENTS; INFORMATION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry in the alpha frequency band has been implicated in emotion processing and broad approach-withdrawal motivation systems. Questions remain regarding the cognitive mechanisms that may help elucidate the observed links between EEG asymmetry and patterns of socioemotional functioning. The current study observed frontal EEG asymmetry patterns at rest and under social threat among young adults (N = 45, M = 21.1 years). Asymmetries were, in turn, associated with performance on an emotion-face dot-probe attention bias task. Attention biases to threat have been implicated as potential causal mechanisms in anxiety and social withdrawal. Frontal EEG asymmetry at baseline did not predict attention bias patterns to angry or happy faces. However, increases in right frontal alpha asymmetry from baseline to the stressful speech condition were associated with vigilance to angry faces and avoidance of happy faces. The findings may reflect individual differences in the pattern of response (approach or withdrawal) with the introduction of a mild stressor. Comparison analyses with frontal beta asymmetry and parietal alpha asymmetry did not find similar patterns. Thus, the data may reflect the unique role of frontal regions, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in cognitive control and threat detection, coupled with ruminative processes associated with alpha activity.

Top-Down Control in Contour Grouping	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GLOBAL SHAPES; INTEGRATION; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Human observers tend to group oriented line segments into full contours if they follow the Gestalt rule of 'good continuation'. It is commonly assumed that contour grouping emerges automatically in early visual cortex. In contrast, recent work in animal models suggests that contour grouping requires learning and thus involves top-down control from higher brain structures. Here we explore mechanisms of top-down control in perceptual grouping by investigating synchronicity within EEG oscillations. Human participants saw two micro-Gabor arrays in a random order, with the task to indicate whether the first (S1) or the second stimulus (S2) contained a contour of collinearly aligned elements. Contour compared to non-contour S1 produced a larger posterior post-stimulus beta power (15-21 Hz). Contour S2 was associated with a pre-stimulus decrease in posterior alpha power (11-12 Hz) and in fronto-posterior theta (4-5 Hz) phase couplings, but not with a post-stimulus increase in beta power. The results indicate that subjects used prior knowledge from S1 processing for S2 contour grouping. Expanding previous work on theta oscillations, we propose that long-range theta synchrony shapes neural responses to perceptual groupings regulating lateral inhibition in early visual cortex.

On High-Frequency Field Oscillations (> 100 Hz) and the Spectral Leakage of Spiking Activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; CORTEX; POWER; RAT; EEG; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; MECHANISMS; NEOCORTEX	Recent reports converge to the idea that high-frequency oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) represent multiunit activity. In particular, the amplitude of LFP activity above 100 Hz-commonly referred to as "high-gamma" or "epsilon" band-was found to correlate with firing rate. However, other studies suggest the existence of true LFP oscillations at this frequency range that are different from the well established ripple oscillations. Using multisite recordings of the hippocampus of freely moving rats, we show here that high-frequency LFP oscillations can represent either the spectral leakage of spiking activity or a genuine rhythm, depending on recording location. Both spike-leaked, spurious activity and true fast oscillations couple to theta phase; however, the two phenomena can be clearly distinguished by other key features, such as preferred coupling phase and spectral signatures. Our results argue against the idea that all high-frequency LFP activity stems from spike contamination and suggest avoiding defining brain rhythms solely based on frequency range.

Prestimulus alpha and beta determinants of ERP responses in the Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; ERP genesis; Alpha; Beta; Auditory Go/NoGo; Attention; Arousal	BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; TARGET DETECTION; EEG-DYNAMICS; PHASE-RESET; P300; ATTENTION; AMPLITUDE; MODULATIONS	The nature of the relationships between the level of immediately-prestimulus EEG activity and auditory ERP components remains unclear. Particularly, both inverse and direct relationships have been reported for the alpha band. Here we aim to clarify the pattern of prestimulus EEG contributions in alpha (8-13 Hz), and investigate those in beta (14-24 Hz), for five ERP components (P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) in an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo paradigm. Separate FFTs were applied to the prestimulus Cz data of each accepted trial. The alpha and beta bands were independently assessed. The mean prestimulus spectral band amplitude was computed and used to sort the trials at nine central sites, and the upper and lower sorted trial thirds were averaged to form ERPs for Go and NoGo responses. Prestimulus EEG level effects (High vs. Low) were examined in each component's latency and amplitude, and Go reaction time was also assessed. Prestimulus alpha directly modulated the amplitude of the positive components (P1, P2, P3), while prestimulus beta directly modulated the positivity of the exogenous component amplitudes (P1, N1, P2); each amplitude effect occurred independently of the Go/NoGo stimulus conditions. Prestimulus beta also inversely modulated Go N1 latency; no reaction time effects were found for either band. The pattern of findings is intriguing and the various modulations are discussed in relation to attention and arousal. Together, these results confirm the importance of the EEG brain state immediately prestimulus, and indicate the considerable influence that these states have on event-related response processing.

Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed a wide-spread network of multiple prefrontal and sub-cortical brain regions involved in the successful decrease of negative emotions. However, less is known about the temporal dynamics and the physiological mechanisms underlying these regulation processes. Synchronization of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands plays a key-role in the long-range interaction of different brain regions and oscillatory coupling in the theta frequency range was recently identified to play an important role in the interaction of prefrontal structures, the amygdala and the hippocampus in animal models. Accordingly, we investigated the role of prefrontal theta oscillations during the cognitive reappraisal of aversive pictures in humans. We hypothesized an increase in frontal theta oscillations during emotion regulation and a relationship between frontal theta power and the subjective success of emotion regulation. EEG from 30 healthy participants was recorded while they were asked to passively watch or reappraise the content of pictures with negative content. As expected, we found a significant increase in frequencies around 4 Hz at electrode Fz during the regulation condition 'decrease' compared to the 'maintain' condition (p = .006) as well as for the regulation condition 'increase' compared to the 'maintain' condition (p = .017). Additionally, the strength of theta power was positively correlated with the regulation success as reported by the participants (r = 0.463, p < .05). The estimation of possible generators of the theta oscillations was done using standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results suggested the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus as a possible generator. The results of the present study are in line with previous findings of fMRI studies suggesting the same regions as part of the regulation network and provide a first direct link between the imaging based knowledge of emotion regulation and a possible physiological mechanism.

Whereas typically observed at central scalp sites, there are diverging reports about the extent of the attenuation over the cortical mantle, its exact frequency range and the specificity of this phenomenon. We investigated the modulation of EEG oscillations in frequency-bands between 4 to 12 Hz at frontal, central, parietal and occipital sites during the execution of manual movements and during observation of similar actions from allocentric (i.e., facing the actor) and egocentric (i.e., seeing the actor from behind) viewpoints. Suppression was determined relative to observation of a non-biological movement. Action observation elicited greater suppression in the lower (8-10 Hz) compared to the higher mu range (10-12 Hz), and greater suppression in the entire range (4-12 Hz) at frontal and central sites compared to parietal and occipital sites. In addition, suppression tended to be greater during observation of a motor action from allocentric compared to egocentric viewpoints. During execution of movement, suppression of the EEG occurred primarily in the higher alpha range and was absent at occipital sites. In the theta range (4-8 Hz), the EEG amplitude was suppressed during action observation and execution. The results suggest a functional distinction between modulation of mu and alpha rhythms, and between the higher and lower ranges of the mu rhythms. The activity of the presumed human mirror-neuron system seems primarily evident in the lower mu range and in the theta range. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of Mobile Phone Radiation on EEG	2013 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS (ICACC 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	AUG 29-31, 2013	Kochi, INDIA	IEEE, Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, IEEE Comp Soc		EEG; Mobile phone radiation; Fractal dimension; Higuichi's Algorithm; F-test		The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a record of the oscillations of brain electric potentials. The EEG provides a convenient window on the mind, revealing synaptic action that strongly co-relate with brain state. Fractal dimension, the measure of signal complexity can be used to characterize the physiological conditions of the brain. As the EEG signal is non linear, non stationary and noisy, non linear methods will be suitable for the analysis. In this paper Higuichi's fractal dimension analysis is applied to find the fractal dimension of EEG. EEGs of 10 volunteers were recorded at rest and on exposure to radiofrequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones having different SAR values. Mobile phones were positioned first at the auricle and then next to Cz position. Fractal dimensions for all conditions are calculated and analyzed using F-test, In most of the cases, null hypothesis is rejected with 95% confidence. This statistical result shows that there are some changes in the FD while using mobile phone, which demonstrate transformation in the activities of brain due to radiation.	[Smitha, C.

Spectral turbulence measuring as feature extraction method from EEG on affective computing	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Affective computing; EEG classification; Emotion; Spectral turbulence; SVM-RFE	SIGNAL-AVERAGED ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULI; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECOGNITION	In biomedical and psychological applications dealing with EEG, a suitable selection of the most relevant electrodes is useful for lightening the data acquisition and facilitating the signal processing. Therefore, an efficient method for extracting and selecting features from EEG channels is desirable. Classification methods are more and more applied for obtaining important conclusions from diverse psychological processes, and specifically for emotional processing. In this work, an original and straightforward method, inspired by the spectral turbulence (ST) measure from electrocardiogram and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm, is proposed for classifying EEG signals. The goal of this study is to introduce the ST concept in applications of artificial intelligence related to cognitive processes and to determine the best EEG channels for distinguishing between two different experimental conditions. By means of this method, the left temporal region of the brain has revealed to be greatly involved in the affective valence processing elicited by visual stimuli. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied whether attentional control (AC), a temperamental construct related to emotional regulation, was associated with asymmetrical patterns of resting EEG activity at the frontal and parietal regions, reflected not only in the a frequency band (8-13 Hz) but also in higher bands beta 1 (13-20 Hz) and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). Self-reports of AC and trait anxiety, and resting EEG recordings, were obtained from 58 healthy participants. Correlational analysis showed that lower levels of self-reported AC were associated with less alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 powers in the left parietal cortex, while no significant relationships were found between the AC and EEG oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. The role of the left and right parietal lobes in the attentional processes is discussed.

Orchestrating neuronal networks: sustained after-effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation depend upon brain states	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; transcranial alternating current stimulation; tACS; alpha; brain state	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; ALPHA RHYTHMS; OSCILLATIONS; ENTRAINMENT; RESONANCE; RESPONSES	The interest in transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has significantly increased in the past decade. It has potential to modulate brain oscillations in a frequency specific manner, offering the possibility to demonstrate a causal nature of oscillation behavior relationships. TACS is a strong candidate as a tool for clinical applications, however, to fulfill this potential, certain parameters have yet to be evaluated. First, little is known about long-lasting after-effects of tACS with respect to the modulations of rhythmic brain activity. Second, the power of endogenous brain oscillations might play a crucial role in the efficacy of tACS. We hypothesize that the after-effects of tACS depend on the endogenous power of oscillations. To this end, we modulated the power of endogenous occipital alpha oscillations via tACS. In two experiments, participants either had their eyes open or closed to keep endogenous alpha power either low or high while they were stimulated for 20 min with their individual alpha frequency (IAF) and simultaneously performing a vigilance task. After-effects on IAF power were evaluated over a course of 30 min with a pre stimulation period serving as baseline. After-effects were strongly dependent on IAF power. Enhanced IAF power was observed for at least 30 min after tACS under conditions of low endogenous IAF power, whereas, IAF power could not be further enhanced by tACS under conditions of high IAF power. The current study demonstrates, for the first time, a long lasting effect after tACS on endogenous EEG power in the range of the stimulation frequency. Additionally, we present conclusive evidence that the power of the endogenous oscillations has a critical impact on tACS efficacy. Long lasting after-effects foster the role of tACS as a tool for non-invasive brain stimulation and demonstrate the potential for therapeutic application to reestablish the balance of altered brain oscillations.

Abnormal low-gamma activity, hypothesized to reflect impaired synchronization, has been evidenced in several brain disorders. Thus, understanding the relations between gamma oscillations, neuronal synchrony and behavior is a major research challenge. We used a brain-machine interface (BMI) to train monkeys to specifically increase low-gamma power in selected sites of motor cortex to move a cursor and obtain a reward. The monkeys learned to robustly generate oscillatory gamma waves, which were accompanied by a dramatic increase of spiking synchrony of highly precise spatiotemporal patterns. The findings link volitional control of LFP oscillations, neuronal synchrony, and the behavioral outcome. Subjects' ability to directly modulate specific patterns of neuronal synchrony provides a powerful approach for understanding neuronal processing in relation to behavior and for the use of BMIs in a clinical setting.

Here an overview on physiological and pathological EEG patterns during the interictal period is given with an emphasis on aspects relevant to seizure prediction. In particular, similarities in interictal patterns with ictal and preictal discharges are highlighted, including bursts of fast activity, repetitive spike patterns and subclinical electrographic ictal events. The manifestation of clinical seizures and its relation to these interictal discharges is discussed in terms of dynamical interactions of epileptic focus and network.

Phase-locking of epileptic spikes to ongoing delta oscillations in non-convulsive status epilepticus	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						absence status; delta oscillation; absence seizure; spike-wave discharge; phase-locking; thalamo-cortical system		The EEG of patients in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) often displays delta oscillations or generalized spike-wave discharges. In some patients, these delta oscillations coexist with intermittent epileptic spikes. In this study we verify the prediction of a computational model of the thalamo-cortical system that these spikes are phase-locked to the delta oscillations. We subsequently describe the physiological mechanism underlying this observation as suggested by the model. It is suggested that the spikes reflect inhibitory stochastic fluctuations in the input to thalamo-cortical relay neurons and phase-locking is a consequence of differential excitability of relay neurons over the delta cycle. Further analysis shows that the observed phase-locking can be regarded as a stochastic precursor of generalized spike-wave discharges. This study thus provides an explanation of intermittent spikes during delta oscillations in NCSE and might be generalized to other encephathologies in which delta activity can be observed.

A possibility of improving the quality of recognition by optimizing the choice of CWT parameters is discussed. An adaptive approach is proposed to identify sleep spindles (SS) and spike wave discharges (SWD) that assumes automatic selection of CWT-parameters reflecting the most informative features of the analyzed time-frequency structures. Advantages of the proposed technique over the standard wavelet-based approaches are considered.

In this investigation, ten subjects performed a computer-simulated air traffic control (ATC) task, while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. EEG data were decomposed into brain activity related independent components (ICs) using a group-level independent component analysis (gICA). Development of mental fatigue was examined at two different time windows by examining spectral powers from identified ICs and was evaluated against behavioral data. The present results suggest that, as the time on the task increases, significant changes in EEG spectral powers can be observed in identified ICs, which indicates the evolution of mental fatigue. Potential applications of such research include assessment of mental effectiveness of ATC operators who are involved in prolonged and demanding task assignments.

This paper reports on a preliminary uncontrolled study to assess the effects of an upper-alpha NF intervention on patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The NF effects on the EEG and cognitive performance were assessed. The EEG results showed that patients were able to modulate the upper-alpha rhythm in task-related EEG and during training, in both cases across the executions of the NF sessions, and pre and post within each session. The behavioral results showed the effectiveness of this intervention in a variety of cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, and executive functions.

Emerging knowledge about brain connectivity is leading to new insights into the pathophysiology of FOG and has suggested that electroencephalogram (EEG) may offer a novel technique for understanding and predicting FOG. In this study we have integrated spatial, spectral, and temporal features of the EEG signals utilizing wavelet coefficients as our input for the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. This approach allowed us to predict transition from walking to freezing with 87 % sensitivity and 73 % accuracy. This preliminary data affirms the functional breakdown between areas in the brain during FOG and suggests that EEG offers potential as a therapeutic strategy in advanced PD.	[Handojoseno, A. M.

Here we used a well characterized visual sequence learning task and high density-(hd-)EEG recording to determine whether also declarative learning leaves a post-task, local change in the resting state oscillatory activity in the areas involved in the learning process. Thus, we recorded hd-EEG in normal subjects before, during and after the acquisition of the order of a fixed spatial target sequence (VSEQ) and during the presentation of targets in random order (VRAN). We first determined the temporal evolution of spectral changes during VSEQ and compared it to VRAN. We found significant differences in the alpha and theta bands in three main scalp regions, a right occipito-parietal (ROP), an anterior-frontal (AFr), and a right frontal (RFr) area. The changes in frontal theta power during VSEQ were positively correlated with the learning rate. Further, post-learning EEG recordings during resting state revealed a significant increase in alpha power in ROP relative to a pre-learning baseline. We conclude that declarative learning is associated with alpha and theta changes in frontal and posterior regions that occur during the task, and with an increase of alpha power in the occipito-parietal region after the task. These post-task changes may represent a trace of learning and a hallmark of use-dependent plasticity.

HFOs are usually detected with intracranial EEG and detection is influenced by contact size. The size of commercially available intracerebral electrodes varies widely. This study assesses HFO detection rates from adjacent electrode contacts in human intracerebral recordings. Methods: Intracerebral recordings were collected from 11 patients undergoing stereoelectroencephalographic investigation using hybrid depth electrodes containing adjacent large (0.8 or 5 mm(2)) and small (0.2 or 0.3 mm(2)) contacts. HFOs were marked manually during 5-min tracings in 131 pairs of adjacent large and small contacts. HFO rates per minute and mean event durations were compared between adjacent contacts. Results: A minimal but statistically significant advantage in ripple detection was found in a subgroup of large contacts. Otherwise, HFO rates and mean event durations were not statistically different between groups. Conclusion: The size of clinical contacts within the studied range did not influence HFO detection in a clinically relevant manner. Larger contacts provide a minimal advantage for ripple detection. Significance: Our findings suggest that commercially available intracerebral electrodes with contacts between 0.2 and 5 mm(2) likely possess similar HFO detection abilities.

Gamma coherence is strongly related to cognitive processes and cortico-cortical communication. This paper aims at shedding light on the relationship between cortical gamma coherence within bipolar patients and a control group during a prosaccadic attention task. We hypothesized that gamma coherence oscillations act as a main neural mechanism underlying information processing which changes in bipolar patients. Method: Thirty-two (12 healthy controls and 20 bipolar patients) subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects performed a prosaccadic attention task while their brain activity pattern was recorded using quantitative electroencephalography (20 channels). Results: We observed that the maniac group presented lower saccade latency when compared to depression and control groups. The main finding was a greater gamma coherence for control group in the right hemisphere of both frontal and motor cortices caused by the execution of a prosaccadic attention task. Limitations: The findings need to be confirmed in larger samples and in bipolar patients before start the pharmacological treatment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a disrupted connection of the brain's entire functioning of maniac patients and represent a deregulation in cortical inhibitory mechanism. Thus, our results reinforce our hypothesis that greater gamma coherence in the right and left frontal cortices for the maniac group produces a "noise" during information processing and highlights that gamma coherence might be a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction during the manic state.

Cortical cross-frequency coupling predicts perceptual outcomes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Oscillations; Phase; Cross-frequency coupling; Vision; Sustained attention; EEG	OSCILLATORY NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS PREDICT; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; PHASE; MODULATION; POWER; MECHANISMS	Functional networks are comprised of neuronal ensembles bound through synchronization across multiple intrinsic oscillatory frequencies. Various coupled interactions between brain oscillators have been described (e.g., phase-amplitude coupling), but with little evidence that these interactions actually influence perceptual sensitivity. Here, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made during a sustained-attention task to demonstrate that cross-frequency coupling has significant consequences for perceptual outcomes (i.e., whether participants detect a near-threshold visual target). The data reveal that phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies are dependent on the phase of lower frequencies, such that higher frequencies alternate between periods when their phase is either strongly or weakly predictive of visual-target detection. Moreover, the specific higher frequencies and scalp topographies linked to visual-target detection also alternate as a function of lower-frequency phase. Cross-frequency coupling between lower (i.e., delta and theta) and higher frequencies (e.g., low- and high-beta) thus results in dramatic fluctuations of visual-target detection.

Resting-state networks show dynamic functional connectivity in awake humans and anesthetized macaques	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						functional connectivity; macaque; resting-state; dynamics; spontaneous activity; functional MRI (fMRI); nonstationary; fluctuations	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS; ONGOING ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUALLY GUIDED SACCADES; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; LOW-FREQUENCY; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; WANDERING MINDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Characterization of large-scale brain networks using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging is typically based on the assumption of network stationarity across the duration of scan. Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks (RSNs) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize RSN dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the oculomotor (OCM) network strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows (<60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the OCM network and did not emerge in average RSN analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that RSNs can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2154-2177, 2013.

Combining EEG sleep recordings and high-resolution structural brain imaging, here we demonstrate that the morphology of the human brain offers one explanatory factor of such inter-individual variability. Gray matter volume in interoceptive and exteroceptive cortices correlated with the expression of slower NREM sleep spindle frequencies, supporting their proposed role in sleep protection against conscious perception. Conversely, and consistent with an involvement in declarative memory processing, gray matter volume in bilateral hippocampus was associated with faster NREM sleep spindle frequencies. In contrast to spindles, gray matter volume in the homeostatic sleep-regulating center of the basal forebrain/hypothalamus, together with the medial prefrontal cortex, accounted for individual differences in NREM slow wave oscillations. Together, such findings indicate that the qualitative and quantitative expression of human sleep physiology is significantly related to anatomically specific differences in macroscopic brain structure.

Methods: We recorded 31-channel scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) from nine healthy subjects during brisk imagery tasks of left and right foot movements. EEG was analyzed with time-frequency maps and topographies, and the accuracy rate of classification between left and right foot movements was calculated. Results: Beta rebound at the end of imagination (increase of EEG beta rhythm amplitude) was identified from the two EEGs derived from the right-shift and left-shift bipolar pairs at the vertex. This process enabled discrimination between right or left foot imagery at a high accuracy rate (maximum 81.6% in single trial analysis). Conclusion: These data suggest that foot motor imagery has potential to elicit left-right differences in EEG, while BCI using the unilateral foot imagery can achieve high classification accuracy, similar to ordinary BCI, based on hand motor imagery. Significance: By combining conventional discrimination techniques, the left-right discrimination of unilateral foot motor imagery provides a novel BCI system that could control a foot neuroprosthesis or a robotic foot.

Patterns of cortical oscillations organize neural activity into whole-brain functional networks evident in the fMRI BOLD signal	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BOLD; electrophysiology; connectivity; oscillation; synchronization	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; REFLECTS; THETA; POWER	Recent findings from electrophysiology and multimodal neuroimaging have elucidated the relationship between patterns of cortical oscillations evident in EEG/MEG and the functional brain networks evident in the BOLD signal. Much of the existing literature emphasized how high-frequency cortical oscillations are thought to coordinate neural activity locally, while low-frequency oscillations play a role in coordinating activity between more distant brain regions. However, the assignment of different frequencies to different spatial scales is an oversimplification. A more informative approach is to explore the arrangements by which these low- and high-frequency oscillations work in concert, coordinating neural activity into whole-brain functional networks. When relating such networks to the BOLD signal, we must consider how the patterns of cortical oscillations change at the same speed as cognitive states, which often last less than a second. Consequently, the slower BOLD signal may often reflect the summed neural activity of several transient network configurations. This temporal mismatch can be circumvented if we use spatial maps to assess correspondence between oscillatory networks and BOLD networks.

A method capable of timely predicting the occurrence of seizures could significantly improve the quality of life for epilepsy patients and open new therapeutic approaches. Seizures are usually characterized by generalized spike wave discharges. With the advent of seizures, the variation of spike rate (SR) will have different manifestations. In this study, a seizure prediction approach based on spike rate is proposed and evaluated. Firstly, a low-pass filter is applied to remove the high frequency artifacts in electroencephalogram (EEG). Then, the morphology filter is used to detect spikes and compute SR, and SR is smoothed with an average filter. Finally, the performance of smoothed SR (SRm) in EEG during interictal, preictal, and ictal periods is analyzed and employed as an index for seizure prediction. Experiments with long-term intracranial EEGs of 21 patients show that the proposed seizure prediction approach achieves a sensitivity of 75.8% with an average false prediction rate of 0.09/h. The low computational complexity of the proposed approach enables its possibility of applications in an implantable device for epilepsy therapy.

Thus they can be used by people with severe motor disabilities or those whose limbs are occupied with other tasks. In BCI systems that recently showed greatest interest of researchers, electrical brain activity is measured on the scalp, thus basically they are noninvasive. Using the EEG measurements as the input to the BCI offers the advantages of low cost and high time resolution. However, due to small amplitude of the signal components, relatively high power of noise and poor spatial resolution, achieving large speed, accuracy and the number of targets is a challenge. At present, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI paradigm is believed to provide the most promising way of optimizing the BCI performance in that sense. A review of the SSVEP BCI projects is presented, including studies of biodiversity of human EEG response to visual excitation, as well as the design of techniques for visual stimulation, EEG signal acquisition and analysis for best BCI performance. The review is based both on the literature and results of own teamwork.

Design: In the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD, rhythmic brain activity in EEG recordings was monitored longitudinally and across vigilance states through the onset and progression of disease. Measurements and results: Mice with chronic electrode implants were recorded monthly over wake-sleep cycles (4 hours), beginning at 9-11 weeks (presymptomatic period) through 6-7 months (symptomatic period). Recording data revealed a unique beta rhythm (20-35 Hz), present only in R6/1 transgenic mice, which evolves in close parallel with the disease. In addition, there was an unusual relationship between this beta oscillation and vigilance states: while nearly absent during the active waking state, the beta oscillation appeared with drowsiness and during slow wave sleep (SWS) and, interestingly, strengthened rather than dissipating when the brain returned to an activated state during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Conclusions: In addition to providing a new in vivo biomarker and insight into Huntington's disease pathophysiology, this serendipitous observation opens a window onto the rarely explored neurophysiology of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit during SWS and REM sleep.

Not much is known about the modifiability of IAF by cognitive interventions. We report analyses of resting EEG from a large-scale training study in which healthy younger (2031 years, N=30) and older (6580 years, N=28) adults practiced 12 cognitive tasks for approximate to 100 1-h sessions. EEG was recorded before and after the cognitive training intervention. In both age groups, IAF (and, in a control analysis, alpha amplitude) did not change, despite large gains in cognitive performance. As within-session reliability and test-retest stability were high for both age groups, imprecise measurements cannot account for the findings. In sum, IAF is highly stable in healthy adults up to 80 years, not easily modifiable by cognitive interventions alone, and thus qualifies as a stable neurophysiological trait marker.

Enhanced Compressibility of EEG Signal in Alzheimer's Disease Patients	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; EEG; wireless sensors; ageing brain; compressive sensing; time-frequency analysis; wavelet transform	DYNAMICS	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be the most common and the fastest growing neurological disease in the world. Biomarker tools for early diagnosis and disease progression in AD remain key issues for clinical applications (patient's control and monitoring), sanitary systems (growth of prevalence of AD in the near future), and pharmaceutical companies (drug developments). Electroencephalogram (EEG) yields, in principle, a powerful and relatively cheap way for screening of dementia and AD in their early stages although not reaching the specificity prescribed for clinical use. Portable EEG systems based on wireless sensors can be used for unobtrusive long term monitoring provided they can solve technological problems (e. g., size and operational lifetime of batteries). Clinical applications require intensive recording of massive EEG data, raising the need for efficient, and flexible compression techniques. In this paper, this compression problem is viewed from a different perspective: is it possible to imagine a compressive sampling/sensing system that not only can reduce the throughput data but can also discriminate among brain states? If this is the case, it would be possible to distinguish among AD patients, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects and normal healthy elderly. Accordingly, this paper investigates the performance of EEG compression techniques to recover data with the quality required by clinical constraints when making an assessment of the patients' status simultaneously. A sparsity coefficient is shown to be a good marker of AD being able to differentiate AD EEG from both MCI and healthy controls. The research, carried out on an experimental database, also compare the thresholding wavelet approach to the emerging method of compressive sensing. The results show the relationships between the compression ratio and the entropic measures of EEG complexity, whose reduction is considered the hallmark of AD onset.

Hippocampal formation (HPC) is considered to be the main structure involved in the generation of this activity. Numerous data indicate that theta rhythm is involved in long-term potentiation, spatial learning, spatial navigation, verbal and spatial working memory, REM sleep, locomotor activities, and sensori-motor integration. Since the discovery of cholinergically-induced theta rhythm recorded from the hippocampal formation slices, central mechanisms underlying theta generation have been successfully studied in the in vitro conditions. Most of in vitro studies have been focused on the basic question regarding the similarities between cholinergically-induced theta oscillations and theta rhythm examined in the in vivo conditions. The results of these experiments have clearly demonstrated that the main properties of theta rhythm in both, in vitro and in vivo preparations are similar. The present review has one main objective: to characterize the basic mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythm in the hippocampal formation maintained in vitro.

The EEG provides a convenient window on the mind, revealing synaptic action that is moderately to strongly co-relate with brain state. Fractal dimension, measure of signal complexity can be used to characterize the physiological conditions of the brain. As the EEG signal is non linear, non stationary and noisy, non linear methods will be suitable for the analysis. In this paper Higuichi's fractal method is applied to find the fractal dimension. EEGs of 5 volunteers were recorded at rest and on exposure to radiofrequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones having different SAR values. Mobiles were positioned near the ears and then near the cz position. Fractal dimensions for all conditions are calculated using Higuich's FD estimation algorithm. The result shows that there are some changes in the FD while using mobile phone. The change in FD of the signal varies from person to person. The changes in FD show the variations in EEG signal while using mobile phone, which demonstrate transformation in the activities of brain due to radiation.	[Smitha, C.

We investigated pen-fixation brain activity for internal state-specific tagging. Human participants performed a task, in which a visual object was presented for identification in lateral visual field, to which they moved their eyes as soon as possible from a central fixation point. Next, a phrase appeared in the same location; the phrase could either be an easy or hard question about the object, answered by pressing one of two alternative response buttons, or it could be an instruction to simply press one of these two buttons. Depending on whether these messages were blocked or randomly mixed, one of two different internal states was induced: either the task was known in advance or it wasn't. Eye movements and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded simultaneously during task performance. Using eye-event-time-locked averaging and independent component analysis, saccade- and fixation-related components were identified. Coss-frequency phase-synchrony was observed between the alpha/betal ranges of fixation-related and beta2/gammal ranges of saccade-related activity 50 ms prior to fixation onset in the mixed-phrase condition only. We interpreted this result as evidence for internal state-specific tagging.

Altered Rolandic Gamma-Band Activation Associated with Motor Impairment and Ictal Network Desynchronization in Childhood Epilepsy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; EEG; POWER; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY; COHERENCE	Epilepsy is associated with an abnormal expression of neural oscillations and their synchronization across brain regions. Oscillatory brain activation and synchronization also play an important role in cognition, perception and motor control. Childhood epilepsy is associated with a variety of cognitive and motor deficits, but the relationship between altered functional brain responses in various frequency ranges and functional impairment in these children remains poorly understood. We investigated functional magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses from motor cortex in multiple functionally relevant frequency bands following median nerve stimulation in twelve children with epilepsy, including four children with motor impairments. We demonstrated that children with motor impairments exhibit an excessive gamma-band response from Rolandic cortex, and that the magnitude of this Rolandic gamma response is negatively associated with motor function. Abnormal responses from motor cortex were also associated with ictal desynchronization of oscillations within Rolandic cortex measured using intracranial EEG (iEEG). These results provide the evidence that ictal disruption of motor networks is associated with an altered functional response from motor cortex, which is in turn associated with motor impairment.

[Kilner, J.M., Kiebel, S.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Applications of random field theory to electrophysiology. Neurosci. Lett. 374, 174-178.] we described a fairly general analysis of induced responses-in electromagnetic brain signals-using the summary statistic approach and statistical parametric mapping This involves localising induced responses-in peristimulus time and frequency-by testing for effects in time-frequency images that summarise the response of each subject to each trial type. Conventionally, these time-frequency summaries are estimated using post-hoc averaging of epoched data. However, post-hoc averaging of this sort fails when the induced responses overlap or when there are multiple response components that have variable timing within each trial (for example stimulus and response components associated with different reaction times). In these situations, it is advantageous to estimate response components using a convolution model of the sort that is standard in the analysis of fMRI time series. In this paper, we describe one such approach, based upon ordinary least squares deconvolution of induced responses to input functions encoding the onset of different components within each trial. There are a number of fundamental advantages to this approach: for example: (i) one can disambiguate induced responses to stimulus onsets and variably timed responses: (ii) one can test for the modulation of induced responses-over peristimulus time and frequency-by parametric experimental factors and (iii) one can gracefully handle confounds-such as slow drifts in power-by including them in the model. In what follows, we consider optimal forms for convolution models of induced responses, in terms of impulse response basis function sets and illustrate the utility of deconvolution estimators using simulated and real MEG data.

The effects of respiratory CO2 fluctuations in the resting-state BOLD signal differ between eyes open and eyes closed	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						CO2 reactivity; BOLD response; Physiological noise	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; PERMUTATION TESTS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; FMRI; BRAIN; REACTIVITY; HUMANS; OSCILLATIONS	Resting fluctuations in arterial CO2 (a cerebral vasodilator) are believed to be an important source of low-frequency blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. In this study we focus on the two commonly used resting-states in functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, eyes open and eyes closed, and quantify the degree to which measured spontaneous fluctuations in the partial pressure of endtidal CO2 (PETCO2) relate to BOLD signal time series. A significantly longer latency of BOLD signal changes following PETCO2 fluctuations was found in the eyes closed condition compared to with eyes open, which may reveal different intrinsic vascular response delays in CO2 reactivity or an alteration in the net BOLD signal arising from PETCO2 fluctuations and altered neural activity with eyes closed. By allowing a spatially varying time delay for the compensation of this temporal difference, a more spatially consistent CO2 correlation map can be obtained. Finally, Granger-causality analysis demonstrated a "causal" relationship between PETCO2 and BOLD. The identified dominant PETCO2 -> BOLD directional coupling supports the notion that PETCO2 fluctuations are indeed a cause of resting BOLD variance in the majority of subjects.

This formation of new memory representations is likely to involve changes in neural networks as reflected by oscillatory brain activity. To explore this, we conducted time-frequency analyses of electro-encephalography (EEG) data recorded in a passive auditory oddball paradigm using Thai language tones. We compared native speakers of English (a non-tone language) and native speakers of Mandarin Chinese (a tone language), before and after a two-day laboratory training. Native English speakers showed a larger gamma-band power and stronger alpha-band synchrony across EEG channels than the native Chinese speakers, especially after training. This is compatible with the view that forming new speech categories on the basis of unfamiliar perceptual dimensions involves stronger gamma activity and more coherent activity in alpha-band networks than forming new categories on the basis of familiar dimensions.

Prestimulus EEG amplitude determinants of ERP responses in a habituation paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; ERP genesis; Prestimulus EEG; Single-trial event-related potentials; Habituation paradigm	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO/NOGO TASK; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ORIENTING REFLEX; VERTEX RESPONSE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; MODULATIONS; STIMULI	Evidence for the nature and extent of the prestimulus EEG contributions to ERP determination has been mounting, and we have recently mapped these within an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo task Here we examined if the pattern of relationships in the Go/NoGo would generalise to an auditory habituation paradigm. Count and No-task conditions were assessed, and we predicted broadly corresponding effects between Go and Count, and NoGo and No-task conditions. Single-trial data were obtained at the midline sites (Fz, Cz, Pz). Prestimulus EEG in each of the traditional bands was quantified using a sliding FFT window, and five ERP components were manually identified. The corresponding EEG and ERP data were then correlated across subjects, sites, and trials, separately for each ERP component measure (amplitude, latency), task condition (Count, No-task), and EEG band (delta, theta, alpha, beta). Despite the substantial paradigm and methodological differences, 10 of the 17 expected prestimulus EEG-ERP directional relationships (i.e., direct or inverse effects) were confirmed across the traditional bands and ERP components, and only one was in the opposite direction. Importantly, 18 additional relationships reached significance here; these occurred across the EEG bands, and ER? components. Together these findings confirm the significant contributions of prestimulus EEG to subsequent ER? responses. These appear to be at least partially independent of the paradigm and EEG methodology employed, suggesting that there is merit in mapping these contributions further. Our findings also indicate the improved sensitivity of the statistical approach used here in detecting such EEC-ER? relationships. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cross-frequency coupling during isoflurane anaesthesia as revealed by electroencephalographic harmonic wavelet bicoherence	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						electroencephalographic signals; isoflurane anaesthesia; wavelet bicoherence	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BURST PATTERNS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SLEEP; SLOW; DEPTH; PEAK	Fourier bicoherence has previously been applied to investigate phase coupling in the EEG in anaesthesia. However, there are significant theoretical limitations regarding its sensitivity in detecting transient episodes of inter-frequency coupling. Therefore, we used a recently developed wavelet bicoherence method to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in the EEG of patients under isoflurane anaesthesia; examining the relationship between the patterns of wavelet bicoherence and the isoflurane concentrations. We analysed a set of previously published EEG data, obtained from 29 patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia. Artifact-free, 1 min EEG segments at different isoflurane concentrations were extracted from each subject and the wavelet bicoherence calculated for all pairs of frequencies from 0.5 to 20 Hz. Isoflurane caused two peaks in the (613 Hz) and slow (1 Hz) regions of the bicoherence matrix diagonal. Higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted the peak to lower frequencies [11.3 (0.9) Hz at 0.3 to 7.1 (1.2) Hz at 1.5], as has been previously observed in the power spectra. Outside the diagonal, we also found a significant peak that was phase-coupled to the slow waves; higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted this peak to lower frequencies [10.8 (1.2) to 7.7 (0.7) Hz]. Isoflurane caused cross-frequency coupling between and slow waves. Increasing isoflurane concentration slowed the frequencies where the coupling had occurred. This phenomenon of coupling suggests that slow cortical oscillations organize the higher band activity, which is consistent with other studies in natural sleep.

Removing an intersubject variance component in a general linear model improves multiway factoring of event-related spectral perturbations in group EEG studies	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						time-frequency analysis; principal components; statistical power	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; GO/NOGO TASK; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION	Linear statistical models are used very effectively to assess task-related differences in EEG power spectral analyses. Mixed models, in particular, accommodate more than one variance component in a multisubject study, where many trials of each condition of interest are measured on each subject. Generally, intra- and intersubject variances are both important to determine correct standard errors for inference on functions of model parameters, but it is often assumed that intersubject variance is the most important consideration in a group study. In this article, we show that, under common assumptions, estimates of some functions of model parameters, including estimates of task-related differences, are properly tested relative to the intrasubject variance component only. A substantial gain in statistical power can arise from the proper separation of variance components when there is more than one source of variability. We first develop this result analytically, then show how it benefits a multiway factoring of spectral, spatial, and temporal components from EEG data acquired in a group of healthy subjects performing a well-studied response inhibition task.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid acceleration of research examining how N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists influence fundamental frequency bands in cortical and subcortical brain regions. Herein, we systematically review findings from in vivo studies with a focus on delta, theta, gamma and more recently identified high-frequency oscillations. We also discuss some of the current hypotheses that are considered to account for the actions of NMDAR antagonists on these frequency bands. The data emphasize a close relationship between altered oscillatory activity and NMDAR blockade, with both local and large-scale networks accounting for their effects. These findings may have fundamental implications for the psychotomimetic effects produced by NMDAR antagonists.

The Phase of Thalamic Alpha Activity Modulates Cortical Gamma-Band Activity: Evidence from Resting-State MEG Recordings	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; TRANSFER ENTROPY; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; FREQUENCY; HUMANS; RHYTHM; INHIBITION	Recent findings have implicated thalamic alpha oscillations in the phasic modulation of cortical activity. However, the precise relationship between thalamic alpha oscillations and neocortical activity remains unclear. Here we show in a large sample of healthy human participants (n = 45) using spatial filtering techniques and measures of phase amplitude coupling that the amplitude of gamma-band activity in posterior medial parietal cortex is modulated by the phase of thalamic alpha oscillations during eyes-closed resting-state recordings. In addition, our findings show that gamma-band activity in visual cortex was not modulated by thalamic alpha oscillations but coupled to the phase of strong cortical alpha activity. To overcome the limitations of electromagnetic source localization we estimated conduction delays using transfer entropy and found nonspurious information transfer from thalamus to cortex. The present findings provide novel evidence for magneto-encephalography-measured phase coupling between cortical gamma-band activity and thalamic alpha oscillations, which highlight the role of phasic inhibition in the coordination of cortical activity.

The pathological central network involved in orthostatic tremor is still unknown. In this study we analyzed 15 patients with simultaneous high-resolution electroencephalography and electromyography recording to assess corticomuscular coherence. In 1 patient we were able to simultaneously record the local field potential in the ventrolateral thalamus and electroencephalography. Dynamic imaging of coherent source analysis was used to find the sources in the brain that are coherent with the peripheral tremor signal. When standing, the network for the tremor frequency consisted of unilateral activation in the primary motor leg area, supplementary motor area, primary sensory cortex, two prefrontal/premotor sources, thalamus, and cerebellum for the whole 30-second segment recorded. The source coherence dynamics for the primary leg area and the thalamic source signals with the tibialis anterior muscle showed that they were highly coherent for the whole 30 seconds for the contralateral side but markedly decreased after 15 seconds for the ipsilateral side. The source signal and the recorded thalamus signal followed the same time frequency dynamics of coherence in 1 patient. The corticomuscular interaction in OT follows a consistent pattern with an initially bilateral pattern and then a segregated unilateral pattern after 15 seconds. This may add to the feeling of unsteadiness. It also makes the thalamus unlikely as the main source of orthostatic tremor.

We tested the hypothesis that numerous reported interactions of amyloid-beta with cell surface molecules result in altered excitation-inhibition balance in brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. We examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during movement, quiet waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cortical EEG power was higher in APdE9 mice than in WT mice over a broad frequency range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4 behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also increased but in a narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed augmented cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta gamma modulation were preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of theta-gamma modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early stage of amyloid pathology, cortical principal cells become hyperexcitable and via extensive cortico-thalamic connection drive thalamic cells. Minor hippocampal changes are most likely secondary to abnormal entorhinal input.

However, the current manual sleep scoring is time-consuming as it is a crude discretization in time and stages. This study changes Esbroeck and Westover's [1] latent sleep staging model into a global model. The proposed data-driven method trained a topic mixture model on 10 control subjects and was applied on 10 other control subjects, 10 iRBD patients and 10 Parkinson's patients. In that way 30 topic mixture diagrams were obtained from which features reflecting distinct sleep architectures between control subjects and patients were extracted. Two features calculated on basis of two latent sleep states classified subjects as "control" or "patient" by a simple clustering algorithm. The mean sleep staging accuracy compared to classical AASM scoring was 72.4% for control subjects and a clustering of the derived features resulted in a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 80 %. This study demonstrates that frequency analysis of sleep EEG can be used for data-driven global sleep classification and that topic features separates iRBD and Parkinson's patients from control subjects.

J	Cheyne, D; Ferrari, P				Cheyne, Douglas; Ferrari, Paul			MEG studies of motor cortex gamma oscillations: evidence for a gamma "fingerprint" in the brain?	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MEG; gamma oscillations; motor cortex; frequency tuning; basal ganglia	MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; BASAL GANGLIA; BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; POTENTIALS; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; ATTENTION	The human motor cortex exhibits transient bursts of high frequency gamma oscillations in the 60-90 Hz range during movement. It has been proposed that gamma oscillations generally reflect local intracortical activity. However, movement-evoked gamma is observed simultaneously in both cortical and subcortical (basal ganglia) structures and thus appears to reflect long-range cortical-subcortical interactions. Recent evidence suggests that gamma oscillations do not simply reflect sensory reafference, but have a facilitative role in movement initiation. Here we summarize contributions of MEG to our understanding of movement-evoked gamma oscillations, including evidence that transient gamma bursts during the performance of specific movements constitutes a stereotyped spectral and temporal pattern within individuals-a gamma "fingerprint"-that is highly stable over time. Although their functional significance remains to be fully understood, movement-evoked gamma oscillations may represent frequency specific tuning within cortical-subcortical networks that can be monitored non-invasively using MEG during a variety of motor tasks, and may provide important information regarding cortical dynamics of ongoing motor control.

J	Harmony, T				Harmony, Thalia			The functional significance of delta oscillations in cognitive processing	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG delta; attention; working memory; frontal lobes; inhibition; cognition	WORKING-MEMORY; INHIBITORY CONTROL; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; BRAIN; THETA; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Ample evidence suggests that electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory activity is linked to a broad variety of perceptual, sensorimotor, and cognitive operations. However, few studies have investigated the delta band (0.5-3.5 Hz) during different cognitive processes. The aim of this review is to present data and propose the hypothesis that sustained delta oscillations inhibit interferences that may affect the performance of mental tasks, possibly by modulating the activity of those networks that should be inactive to accomplish the task. It is clear that two functionally distinct and potentially competing brain networks can be broadly distinguished by their contrasting roles in attention to the external world vs. the internally directed mentation or concentration. During concentration, EEG delta (1-3.5 Hz) activity increases mainly in frontal leads in different tasks: mental calculation, semantic tasks, and the Sternberg paradigm. This last task is considered a working memory task, but in neural, as well as phenomenological, terms, working memory can be best understood as attention focused on an internal representation. In the Sternberg task, increases in power in the frequencies from 1 to 3.90 Hz in frontal regions are reported. In a Go/No-Go task, power increases at 1 Hz in both conditions were observed during 100-300 ms in central, parietal and temporal regions. However, in the No-Go condition, power increases were also observed in frontal regions, suggesting its participation in the inhibition of the motor response. Increases in delta power were also reported during semantic tasks in children. In conclusion, the results suggest that power increases of delta frequencies during mental tasks are associated with functional cortical deafferentation, or inhibition of the sensory afferences that interfere with internal concentration. These inhibitory oscillations would modulate the activity of those networks that should be inactive to accomplish the task.

However, although the behavioral studies of dogs are beginning to be common in the field of animal cognition, the neural events underlying cognition remain unknown. Here, we employed a non-invasive electroencephalography, with adhesive electrodes attached to the top of the skin, to measure brain activity of from 8 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) while they stayed still to observe photos of dog and human faces. Spontaneous oscillatory activity of the dogs, peaking in the sensors over the parieto-occipital cortex, was suppressed statistically significantly during visual task compared with resting activity at the frequency of 15-30 Hz. Moreover, a stimulus-induced low-frequency (similar to 2-6 Hz) suppression locked to the stimulus onset was evident at the frontal sensors, possibly reflecting a motor rhythm guiding the exploratory eye movements. The results suggest task-related reactivity of the macroscopic oscillatory activity in the dog brain. To our knowledge, the study is the first to reveal non-invasively measured reactivity of brain electrophysiological oscillations in healthy dogs, and it has been based purely on positive operant conditional training, without the need for movement restriction or medication.

Neural substrates of perceptual integration during bistable object perception	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						object perception; object attention; bistable perception	DRIVEN ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; FIGURE-GROUND SEGREGATION; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; GAMMA-BAND; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY	The way we perceive an object depends both on feedforward, bottom-up processing of its physical stimulus properties and on top-down factors such as attention, context, expectation, and task relevance. Here we compared neural activity elicited by varying perceptions of the same physical image-a bistable moving image in which perception spontaneously alternates between dissociated fragments and a single, unified object. A time-frequency analysis of EEG changes associated with the perceptual switch from object to fragment and vice versa revealed a greater decrease in alpha (8-12 Hz) accompanying the switch to object percept than to fragment percept. Recordings of event-related potentials elicited by irrelevant probes superimposed on the moving image revealed an enhanced positivity between 184 and 212 ms when the probes were contained within the boundaries of the perceived unitary object. The topography of the positivity (P2) in this latency range elicited by probes during object perception was distinct from the topography elicited by probes during fragment perception, suggesting that the neural processing of probes differed as a function of perceptual state. Two source localization algorithms estimated the neural generator of this object-related difference to lie in the lateral occipital cortex, a region long associated with object perception. These data suggest that perceived objects attract attention, incorporate visual elements occurring within their boundaries into unified object representations, and enhance the visual processing of elements occurring within their boundaries. Importantly, the perceived object in this case emerged	[Flevaris, Anastasia V.; Martinez, Antigona; Hillyard, Steven A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Martinez, Antigona] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Schizophrenia Res Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA		Flevaris, AV (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.	ani.flevaris@gmail.com	Martinez, Antigona/X-2317-2019	Martinez, Antigona/0000-0003-4806-5199	NIMH [1P50MH86385, T32MH020002-13]; NSF [BCS-1029084]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [P50MH086385, T32MH020002] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	This work was supported by an NIMH grant (1P50MH86385), an NSF grant (BCS-1029084), and an NIMH institutional training grant (T32MH020002-13).		157	16	16	1	12	ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC	ROCKVILLE	12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA	1534-7362			J VISION	J.

This information flow is captured in its simplest form via the concepts of synchronization and desynchronization and related metrics. More complex forms of information flow are transient synchronizations and multi-frequency behaviors with metrics related to cross-frequency coupling (CFC). It is supposed that CFC plays a crucial role in the organization of large-scale networks and functional integration across large distances. In this study, we describe different CFC measures and test their applicability in simulated and real electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained during resting state. For these purposes, we derive generic oscillator equations from full brain network models. We systematically model and simulate the various scenarios of CFC under the influence of noise to obtain biologically realistic oscillator dynamics. We find that (i) specific CFC-measures detect correctly in most cases the nature of CFC under noise conditions, (ii) bispectrum (BIS) and bicoherence (BIC) correctly detect the CFCs in simulated data, (iii) empirical resting state EEG show a prominent delta-alpha CFC as identified by specific CFC measures and the more classic BIS and BIC. This coupling was mostly asymmetric (directed) and generally higher in the eyes closed (EC) than in the eyes open (EO) condition. In conjunction, these two sets of measures provide a powerful toolbox to reveal the nature of couplings from experimental data and as such allow inference on the brain state dependent information processing. Methodological advantages of using CFC measures and theoretical significance of delta and alpha interactions during resting and other brain states are discussed.

Researchers still debate whether the down-states spontaneously occur or need an initial overshoot in fluctuating activity. Herein, we studied temporally-isolated SSO in healthy subjects in order to identify two distinct EEG markers defining a putative initial up-state: i) a significant positive deflection and ii) an associated FR increase, before the negative peak. We found a positive bump preceding the down-state, which is detectable already at the cortical SSO origin site, both during N2 and N3. This early positive deflection, concurrent with a broadband activation, is characterized by an increase of sigma activity (12-18 Hz) from N2 to N3, while an opposite trend was observed for sigma activity crowning the up-state following the negative peak. Also, we found: (i) FR activations during up-states up to high gamma frequencies; (ii) depressed sigma activity in after-spindle recovery phase; and (iii) tightly coordinated activities between distinct bands (12-36 Hz, similar to 70 Hz, similar to 85 Hz and 105-125 Hz). The correlation between different bands suggested a common mechanism for sigma and gamma, and the pre-down-state activation associated with the initial bump suggested an activity ignition for down-state, whose intensity is dependent on sleep stage. In conclusion, we hypothesize that FR accompanying SSO could mark i) sleep homeostatic processes, such as the regulation/stabilization of sleep, counterbalancing the detrimental effects of continuous inputs from peripheries, and ii) neural mechanisms favoring the storage of information acquired during wakefulness.

Research with application of a subset of the same tasks, but aimed to identify the EEG spectral power group differences has been carried out with 31 participants. Contrast distribution of statistically significant differences on frequency bands qualitatively coincides with ranging of the bands by estimates of efficiency of recognition with the trained classifier, except for a range theta. Alpha bands are most involved. Results of comparison of the general (group) and individual indicators correspond to ideas of more significant involvement of mechanisms of semantic memory in the solution of verbal tasks, and also point to possible differences in balance of internal and external attention at realization of verbal-logic and spatial-figurative activity.

Methods: Consecutive polygraphic video-EEG recordings were analyzed in nine pediatric patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis at the initial stage of the disease and during the intermediate period until motor recovery. EEG characteristics in waking and sleep stages as well as EEG correlates of abnormal movements are described. Results: In six of nine patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, the waking EEG showed preserved background activity and either focal or unilateral hemispheric slowing. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, a decrease in the expected slow waves and unilateral or diffuse theta-alpha band rhythms were also observed in six of nine children. They all had more favorable outcome than the three children with diffuse slowing. Clinically, unilateral abnormal movements contra-lateral to hemispheric or focal slowing were also indicative of milder severity when compared to generalized abnormal movements and diffuse slowing. Conclusions: In pediatric patients presenting behavioral disorders and abnormal movements, early EEG patterns may be suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Moreover early electro-clinical presentation contributes to outcome prediction. Significance: This case series demonstrates that early EEG patterns may be suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in pediatric patients with behavioral disorders and abnormal movements.

Environmental information is continuously passed to and integrated in cerebral cortex, where it is evaluated on the basis knowledge acquired from previous experiences. Most of the time, the environment around us is mundane. Occasionally, the situation is alarming warranting immediate attention or a special action to achieve a reward. We are aware of an imminent danger or possible award. Under such a situation, a strong electrical signal is generated. However, it takes time to integrate external stimuli with pre-acquired knowledge to perceive that an action is needed. So, there is a time lag between external stimuli to its perception (T-per) and perception to action (T-act). This time lag varies with age and physical condition. For example, an old person is slower than a young one, and someone intoxicated or drowsy will be slower than one physically fit and fresh. The purpose of this work is to define the Perception Delay such that it is reliable and stable. We took frequency features of EEG signals on slotted time over several probes, and integrate them to a feature vector. By unsupervised clustering, we could find the exact time when the signal behavior changes abruptly, indicating onslaught of the powerful signal. Through experiments we ensured confidence of our definition. In addition, we also measured perception delay after getting the subjects intoxicated and compared it when the subjects are normal.

Nevertheless, it is useful to try to understand the relationship between different levels while all the time respecting the autonomy of each. We report a program of research that uses the theoretical concepts of coordination dynamics and quantitative measurements of simple, well-defined experimental model systems to explicitly relate neural and behavioral levels of description in human beings. Our approach is both top-down and bottom-up and aims at ending up in the same place: top-down to derive behavioral patterns from neural fields, and bottom-up to generate neural field patterns from bidirectional coupling between astrocytes and neurons. Much progress can be made by recognizing that the two approaches-reductionism and emergentism-are complementary. A key to understanding is to couch the coordination of very different things-from molecules to thoughts-in the common language of coordination dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent data demonstrate that each active state of a sleep slow wave originates in a particular cortical location and propagate to involve other cortical areas. Preferential sites of origin of these waves are: the frontal cortex in adult humans, the associative cortex in cats and the somatosensory cortex in mice. In the site of origin of these slow waves any neuron can initiate a particular cycle, however there are neuronal groups with high likelihood of triggering a particular cycle. In epileptic patients, these neurons are mostly located in superficial layers, but in healthy experimental animals, populations of intrinsically bursting neurons with a high probability of triggering spontaneous active states have been found in deeper cortical layers.

However, performing such stop-and-restart movements smoothly is difficult at times. We investigated performance (response time) of stop-and-restart movements using a go/stop/re-go task and found consistent stop-and-restart difficulties after short (similar to 100 ms) stop-to-restart intervals (SRSI), and an increased probability of difficulties after longer (>200 ms) SRSIs, suggesting that two different mechanisms underlie stop-and-restart difficulties. Next, we investigated motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in a moving muscle induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during a go/stop/re-go task. In re-go trials with a short SRSI (100 ms), the MEP amplitude continued to decrease after the re-go-signal onset, indicating that stop-and-restart difficulties with short SRSIs might be associated with a neural mechanism in the human motor system, namely, stop-related suppression of corticomotor (CM) excitability. Finally, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during a go/stop/re-go task and performed a single-trial-based EEG power and phase time-frequency analysis. Alpha-band EEG phase locking to re-go-signal, which was only observed in re-go trials with long SRSI (250 ms), weakened in the delayed re-go response trials. These EEG phase dynamics indicate an association between stop-and-restart difficulties with long SRSIs and a neural mechanism in the human perception system, namely, decreased probability of EEG phase locking to visual stimuli. In contrast, smooth stop-and-restart human movement can be achieved in re-go trials with sufficient SRSI (150-200 ms), because release of stop-related suppression and simultaneous counter-activation of CM excitability may occur as a single task without second re-go-signal perception. These results suggest that skilled motor behavior is subject to various constraints in not only motor, but also perceptual (and attentional), systems.

We propose that non-neuronal brain cells-astrocytes-play an important role in brain dynamics and that oscillation-based models may provide a simple way to study such dynamics. The model is capable of replicating the main features (i.e. slow and alpha oscillations) observed in EEGs. In addition, this model suggests that astrocytes are integral to the generation of slow EEG (similar to 0.7 Hz) rhythms. By including astrocytes in the model we take a first step towards investigating the interaction of the brain and cardiovasular system which are primarily connected via astrocytes. The model also illustrates that rich nonlinear dynamics can arise from basic oscillatory "building blocks" and therefore complex systems may be modelled in an uncomplicated way.

After a max test and familiarization trial, nine trained male subjects (23 +/- 3 yr; maximal oxygen uptake = 62.1 +/- 5.3 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) performed three experimental trials in the heat (30 degrees C; relative humidity 43.7 +/- 5.6%). Each trial consisted of two exercise tasks separated by 1 h. The first was a 60-min constant-load trial, followed by a 30-min simulated time trial (TT1). The second comprised a 12-min simulated time trial (TT2). After TT1, active recovery (AR), passive rest (PR), or cold water immersion (CWI) was applied for 15 min. Electroencephalography was measured at baseline and during postexercise recovery. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was applied to accurately pinpoint and localize altered electrical neuronal activity. After CWI, PR and AR subjects completed TT2 in 761 +/- 42, 791 +/- 76, and 794 +/- 62 s, respectively. A prolonged intensive cycling performance in the heat decreased beta activity across the whole brain. Postexercise AR and PR elicited no significant electrocortical differences, whereas CWI induced significantly increased beta 3 activity in Brodmann areas (BA) 13 (posterior margin of insular cortex) and BA 40 (supramarginal gyrus). Self-paced prolonged exercise in the heat seems to decrease beta activity, hence representing decreased arousal. Postexercise CWI increased beta 3 activity at BA 13 and 40, brain areas involved in somatosensory information processing.

High gamma power in ECoG reflects cortical electrical stimulation effects on unit activity in layers V/VI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SPIKING ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DENSITY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEM	Objective. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been used extensively in experimental neuroscience to modulate neuronal or behavioral activity, which has led this technique to be considered in neurorehabilitation. Because the cortex and the surrounding anatomy have irregular geometries as well as inhomogeneous and anisotropic electrical properties, the mechanism by which CES has therapeutic effects is poorly understood. Therapeutic effects of CES can be improved by optimizing the stimulation parameters based on the effects of various stimulation parameters on target brain regions. Approach. In this study we have compared the effects of CES pulse polarity, frequency, and amplitude on unit activity recorded from rat primary motor cortex with the effects on the corresponding local field potentials (LFP), and electrocorticograms (ECoG). CES was applied at the surface of the cortex and the unit activity and LFPs were recorded using a penetrating electrode array, which was implanted below the stimulation site. ECoGs were recorded from the vicinity of the stimulation site. Main results. Time-frequency analysis of LFPs following CES showed correlation of gamma frequencies with unit activity response in all layers. More importantly, high gamma power of ECoG signals only correlated with the unit activity in lower layers (V-VI) following CES. Time-frequency correlations, which were found between LFPs, ECoGs and unit activity, were frequency-and amplitude-dependent. Significance. The signature of the neural activity observed in LFP and ECoG signals provides a better understanding of the effects of stimulation on network activity, representative of large numbers of neurons responding to stimulation. These results demonstrate that the neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications of CES targeting layered cortex can be further improved by using field potential recordings as surrogates to unit activity aimed at optimizing stimulation efficacy. Likewise, the signatures of unit activity observed as changes in high gamma power in ECoGs suggest that future cortical stimulation studies could rely on less invasive feedback schemes that incorporate surface stimulation with ECoG reporting of stimulation efficacy.

Neocortical pathological high-frequency oscillations are associated with frequency-dependent alterations in functional network topology	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pathological high-frequency oscillations; functional connectivity; network; graph theory; graph theoretical analysis; epilepsy; neural oscillations; neural synchrony; seizure; cross-frequency; intracranial EEG; phase synchronization	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; FAST RIPPLES; DYNAMICS; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; PHASE; EEG; HZ; CONNECTIVITY	Synchronization of neural oscillations is thought to integrate distributed neural populations into functional cell assemblies. Epilepsy is widely regarded as a disorder of neural synchrony. Knowledge is scant, however, regarding whether ictal changes in synchrony involving epileptogenic cortex are expressed similarly across various frequency ranges. Cortical regions involved in epileptic networks also exhibit pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs, >80 Hz), which are increasingly utilized as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. It is uncertain how pHFO amplitudes are related to epileptic network connectivity. By calculating phase-locking values among intracranial electrodes implanted in children with intractable epilepsy, we constructed ictal connectivity networks and performed graph theoretical analysis to characterize their network properties at distinct frequency bands. Ictal data from 17 children were analyzed with a hierarchical mixed-effects model adjusting for patient-level covariates. Epileptogenic cortex was defined in two ways: 1) a hypothesis-driven method using the visually defined seizure-onset zone and 2) a data-agnostic method using the high-frequency amplitude of each electrode. Epileptogenic cortex exhibited a logarithmic decrease in interregional functional connectivity at high frequencies (>30 Hz) during seizure initiation and propagation but not at termination. At slower frequencies, conversely, epileptogenic cortex expressed a relative increase in functional connectivity. Our findings suggest that pHFOs reflect epileptogenic network interactions, yielding theoretical support for their utility in the presurgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. The view that abnormal network synchronization plays a critical role in ictogenesis and seizure dynamics is supported by the observation that functional isolation of epileptogenic cortex at high frequencies is absent at seizure termination.

The sum of the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMF) can be used to reconstruct the original signal. However, if the signal is corrupted by wideband additive noise, several IMFs may contain mostly noise components. Hence, it is a challenging study to determine which IMFs have informative oscillations or information free noise components. In this study, hierarchical clustering based on instantaneous frequencies (IF) of the IMFs obtained by the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is used to denoise the signal. Mean value of Euclidean distance similarity matrix is used as the threshold to determine the noisy components. The proposed method is tested on EEG signals corrupted by white Gaussian noise to show the denoising performance of the proposed method.

The exact nature of associations of these electrophysiological measures with impulsive or risk-seeking personality traits is not completely clear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate event-related oscillatory activity during reward processing across a wide spectrum of frequencies, and its associations with impulsivity and sensation seeking in healthy subjects. Methods: During recording of a 32-channel EEG 22 healthy volunteers were characterized with the Barratt Impulsiveness and the Sensation Seeking Scale and performed a computerized two-choice gambling task comprising different feedback options with positive vs. negative valence (gain or loss) and high or low magnitude (5 vs. 25 points). Results: We observed greater increases of amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity and of activity in the theta, alpha and low-beta frequency range following loss feedback and, in contrast, greater increase of activity in the high-beta frequency range following gain feedback. Significant magnitude effects were observed for theta and delta oscillations, indicating greater amplitudes upon feedback concerning large stakes. The theta amplitude changes during loss were negatively correlated with motor impulsivity scores, whereas alpha and low-beta increase upon loss and high-beta increase upon gain were positively correlated with various dimensions of sensation seeking. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the processing of feedback information involves several distinct processes, which are subserved by oscillations of different frequencies and are associated with different personality traits.

Methods: A 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG, with a 600 Hz sampling rate, was used to examine PEA in 3 children with ESs. We analyzed MEG recordings of PFA by short-time Fourier transform and the aberrant area or high-power spectrum was superimposed onto reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance images as moving images. One ictal discharge was collected. One child and one adult with PFA due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were also examined for comparison. Results: All four PFAs in Patient 1 and five PFAs in Patient 3 were generated from one hemisphere. In Patient 2, four of seven PFAs were generated from one hemisphere and the remaining three were generated from both hemispheres. In Patient 3, one ictal MEG showed ictal discharges that were generated from the same area as the PEA, although the electroencephalogram showed no discharge. In Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, all 10 PFAs were generated from bilateral hemispheres simultaneously.

However, the neurophysiological state of the brain immediately following cardiac arrest has not been systematically investigated. In this study, we performed continuous electroencephalography in rats undergoing experimental cardiac arrest and analyzed changes in power density, coherence, directed connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling. We identified a transient surge of synchronous gamma oscillations that occurred within the first 30 s after cardiac arrest and preceded isoelectric electroencephalogram. Gamma oscillations during cardiac arrest were global and highly coherent; moreover, this frequency band exhibited a striking increase in anterior-posterior-directed connectivity and tight phase-coupling to both theta and alpha waves. High-frequency neurophysiological activity in the near-death state exceeded levels found during the conscious waking state. These data demonstrate that the mammalian brain can, albeit paradoxically, generate neural correlates of heightened conscious processing at near-death.

It is a well-established measure of communication between the primary motor cortex (M1) and corresponding muscles revealing information about the integrity of the pyramidal system. Although the slowing of brain and muscle dynamics during healthy aging has been evidenced, functional communication as determined by CMC has not been investigated so far. Since decline of motor functions at higher age is likely to be associated with CMC changes, the present study aims at shedding light on the functionality of the motor system from a functional interaction perspective. To this end, CMC was investigated in 27 healthy subjects aging between 22 and 77 years during isometric contraction of their right forearm. Neuromagnetic activity was measured using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). Muscle activity was measured by means of surface electromyography (EMG) of the right extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle. Additionally, MEG-EMG phase lags were calculated in order to estimate conducting time. The analysis revealed CMC and M1 power amplitudes to be increased with age accompanied by slowing of M1, EMG, and CMC. Frequency changes were particularly found in subjects aged above 40 years suggesting that at this middle age, neurophysiological changes occur, possibly reflecting an early neurophysiological marker of seniority. Since MEG-EMG phase lags did not vary with age, changes cannot be explained by alterations of nerve conduction. We argue that the M1 power amplitude increase and the shift towards lower frequencies might represent a neurophysiological marker of healthy aging which is possibly compensated by increased CMC amplitude.

PAIN			English	Article						EEG; Pain; Migraine; Imaging; Psychophysics	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; ALPHA; MIGRAINE; FREQUENCY; EXPERIENCE; SYMPTOM; CORTEX	Pain sometimes has a throbbing, pulsating quality, particularly when it is severe and disabling. We recently challenged the presumption that this throbbing quality is a sensory experience of arterial pulsations, but were unable to offer an alternative explanation for its rhythmic character. Here we report a case study of a woman with a history of daily headache consistent with the diagnosis of chronic migraine, but whose throbbing quality persisted long after the resolution of the headache. This chronic, daily, and persistent throbbing sensation, in the absence of headache pain, prompted closer examination for its neurophysiological correlate. By simultaneously recording the subjective report of the throbbing rhythm, arterial pulse, and high-density electroencephalogram, we found that the subjective throbbing rate (48 +/- 1.7 beats per minute) and heart rate (68 +/- 2 beats per minute) were distinct, in accord with our previous observations that the 2 are unrelated. On spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram, we found that the overall amount of activity in the alpha range (8 to 12 Hz), or alpha power, increased in association with greater throbbing intensity. In addition, we also found that the rhythmic oscillations of overall alpha power, the so-called modulations of alpha power, coincided with the timing of the throbbing rhythm, and that this synchrony, or coherence, was proportional to the subjective intensity of the throbbing quality.

J	Kawasaki, M; Yamaguchi, Y				Kawasaki, Masahiro; Yamaguchi, Yoko			Frontal theta and beta synchronizations for monetary reward increase visual working memory capacity	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motivation; visual working memory; frontal; theta; beta	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; EEG DYNAMICS; DOPAMINE; FMRI; ACTIVATION; TASK	Visual working memory (VWM) capacity is affected by motivational influences; however, little is known about how reward-related brain activities facilitate the VWM systems. To investigate the dynamic relationship between VWM- and reward-related brain activities, we conducted time-frequency analyses using electroencephalograph (EEG) data obtained during a monetary-incentive delayed-response task that required participants to memorize the position of colored disks. In case of a correct answer, participants received a monetary reward (0, 10 or 50 Japanese yen) announced at the beginning of each trial. Behavioral results showed that VWM capacity under high-reward condition significantly increased compared with that under low- or no-reward condition. EEG results showed that frontal theta (6 Hz) amplitudes enhanced during delay periods and positively correlated with VWM capacity, indicating involvement of theta local synchronizations in VWM. Moreover, frontal beta activities (24 Hz) were identified as reward-related activities, because delay-period amplitudes correlated with increases in VWM capacity between high-reward and no-reward conditions. Interestingly, cross-frequency couplings between frontal theta and beta phases were observed only under high-reward conditions. These findings suggest that the functional dynamic linking between VWM-related theta and reward-related beta activities on the frontal regions plays an integral role in facilitating increases in VWM capacity.

Previous research has focused on group effects, and has largely overlooked the potential problem of interindividual differences. Interindividual variance causes problems with the interpretation of group-level results. In this study we want to demonstrate the degree of consistency in the active oddball task across subjects, in order to answer the question of whether this task is able to reliably detect conscious target processing in unresponsive patients. We asked 18 subjects to count rare targets and to ignore frequent standards and rare distractors in an auditory active oddball task. Event-related-potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency data were analyzed with permutation-t-tests on a single subject level. We plotted the group-average ERPs and time-frequency data, and evaluated the numbers of subjects showing significant differences between targets and distractors in certain time-ranges. The distinction between targets/distractors and standards was found to be significant in the time-range of the P300 in all participants. In contrast, significant differences between targets and distractors in the time-range of the P3a/b were found in 8 subjects, only. By including effects in the N1 and in a late negative component there remained 2 subjects who did not show a distinction between targets and distractors in the ERP. While time-frequency data showed prominent effects for target/distractor vs. standard, significant differences between targets and distractors were found in 2 subjects, only. The results suggest that time-frequency-and ERP-analysis of the active oddball task may not be sensitive enough to detect voluntary brain activation in unresponsive patients. In addition, we found that time-frequency analysis was even less informative than ERPs about the subject's task performance. Despite suggesting the use of more sensitive paradigms and/or analysis techniques, the present results give further evidence that electroencephalographic research should rely more strongly on single-subject analysis because interpretations of group-effects may be misleading.

We used electroencephalography to study the neurobiology of perception of social risk, in subjects playing the role of proposers in an iterated ultimatum game in pairs. Based on statistical modeling, we used the previous behaviors of both players to separate high-risk [HR] offers from low-risk [LR] offers. The HR offers present higher rejection probability and higher entropy (variability of possible outcome) than the LR offers. Rejections of LR offers elicited both a stronger mediofrontal negativity and a higher prefrontal theta activity than rejections of HR offers. Moreover, prior to feedback, HR offers generated a drop in alpha activity in an extended network. Interestingly, trial-by-trial variation in alpha activity in the medial prefrontal, posterior temporal, and inferior pariental cortex was specifically modulated by risk and, together with theta activity in the prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, predicted the proposers subsequent behavior. Our results provide evidence that alpha and theta oscillations are sensitive to social risk and underlie a fine-tuning regulation of social decisions.

Increasing evidence, based on both intracranial recordings in humans and data obtained in animal models, suggests that synchronization of inhibition is required to initiate a focal seizure and that synchronization among principal cells decreases at seizure onset and gradually recovers during late ictal phases. These findings are here reviewed and are discussed in the context of focal ictogenesis.

Methods: During presurgical videoelectroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, 17 adult inpatients received LCM infusion (200 mg every 12 h for 23 days) followed by oral formulation with the same regimen. Before and after intravenous application of LCM, seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) recorded with continuous video-EEG monitoring were analyzed, and an assessment of adverse events (AEs) was performed daily. To evaluate the midterm tolerability and efficacy, follow-up visits were conducted 1 and 3 months after discharge from hospital. Key Findings: In the acute phase, intravenous initiation of LCM was well tolerated with few mild or moderate AEs (3 of 17, 17.6%). A significant reduction of seizure frequency in the treatment phase as compared to mean seizure frequency in the 2-day baseline phase was achieved (p < 0.05 for the first treatment day, and p < 0.005 for the second treatment day). On the first treatment day, 61.5% of the patients were seizure free, and 84.6% on the second treatment day. IED reduction after intravenous application of LCM was not significant. After 1 month, the 50% responder rate was 46.6% and after the 3-month period, 42.8%. Significance: Our data suggest that rapid intravenous initiation of de novo LCM is safe and may protect against seizures in a rapid and midterm time window.

Although dissociable neuroanatomies associated with individual cognitive component for deception have been identified by fMRI, practical application of fMRI in lie detection remains constrained by its limited accessibility and low affordability, compared with which, EEG has greater advantages. However, fewer theoretical studies have been reported from EEG community and hence leads to the lack of EEG based knowledge on deception. This study therefore aims to propose new methods to extend the current EEG researches in deception by carrying out EEG source localization method combined with connectivity analysis on EEG data collected from fifteen subjects, who participated in a deception paradigm inducing both instructed lying (IL) and instructed truth-telling (IT) conditions. The results show that: (1) significant ERS in upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) in cuneus is observed for IL compared with IT condition, (2) event related connectivity strength between neural substrates responsible for execution control in executing selectively retrieving, monitoring and scrutinizing memory information is observed increased in upper alpha band for IL compared with IT condition, (3) regional and global clustering coefficient derived in connectivity analysis have shown strong correlation to the response time, and (4) relative higher upper alpha band power founded during self-reflection period may indicate sustained alertness.

Region-specific slowing of alpha oscillations is associated with visual-perceptual abilities in children born very preterm	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						preterm; magnetoencephalography; neural oscillation; development; resting state; alpha-band; perception; cognition	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; DEVELOPMENTAL EQUATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; IMAGING APPROACH; FREQUENCY; EEG; MEG; NETWORKS	Children born very preterm (<= 32 weeks gestational age) without major intellectual or neurological impairments often express selective deficits in visual-perceptual abilities. The alterations in neurophysiological development underlying these problems, however, remain poorly understood. Recent research has indicated that spontaneous alpha oscillations are slowed in children born very preterm, and that atypical alpha-mediated functional network connectivity may underlie selective developmental difficulties in visual-perceptualability in this group. The present study provides the first source-resolved analysis of slowing of spontaneous alpha oscillations in very preterm children, indicating alterations in a distributed set of brain regions concentrated in areas of posterior parietal and inferior temporal regions associated with visual perception, as well as prefrontal cortical regions and thalamus. We also uniquely demonstrate that slowing of alpha oscillations is associated with selective difficulties in visual-perceptualability in very preterm children. These results indicate that region-specific slowing of alpha oscillations contribute to selective developmental difficulties prevalent in this population.

While occipital gamma-band oscillations can be pharmacologically modified in animal preparations, pharmacological modulation of stimulus-induced visual gamma oscillations has yet to be demonstrated in non-invasive human recordings. Here, in fifteen healthy humans volunteers, we probed the effects of the GABA(A) agonist and sedative propofol on stimulus-related gamma activity recorded with magnetoencephalography, using a simple visual grating stimulus designed to elicit gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex. During propofol sedation as compared to the normal awake state, a significant 60% increase in stimulus-induced gamma amplitude was seen together with a 94% enhancement of stimulus-induced alpha suppression and a simultaneous reduction in the amplitude of the pattern-onset evoked response. These data demonstrate, that propofol-induced sedation is accompanied by increased stimulus-induced gamma activity providing a potential window into mechanisms of gamma-oscillation generation in humans.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; CURRENT-DENSITY; PRIMATE RETINA; GANGLION-CELLS; CORTEX	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising tool for modulating brain oscillations, as well as a possible therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of conclusive evidence on whether tACS is able to effectively affect cortical activity continues to limit its application. The present study aims to address this issue by exploiting the well-known inhibitory alpha rhythm in the posterior parietal cortex during visual perception and attention orientation. Four groups of healthy volunteers were tested with a Gabor patch detection and discrimination task. All participants were tested at the baseline and selective frequencies of tACS, including Sham, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and 25 Hz. Stimulation at 6 Hz and 10 Hz over the occipito-parietal area impaired performance in the detection task compared to the baseline. The lack of a retinotopically organised effect and marginal frequency-specificity modulation in the detection task force us to be cautious about the effectiveness of tACS in modulating brain oscillations. Therefore, the present study does not provide significant evidence for tACS reliably inducing direct modulations of brain oscillations that can influence performance in a visual task.

We utilized a motor observation and imagination paradigm to gain new insights on preserved cognitive processing in DOC. Methods: EEG brain oscillations were analyzed in 10 VS/UWS (Vegetative State/Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome) patients and 7 MCS (Minimally Conscious State) patients and 21 controls during observation and imagination of a grasping movement and group statistics were conducted. Results: While control subjects showed a typical desynchronization at 8-15 Hz during observation of a movement, MCS patients presented an analogue response at 8-10 Hz, but exhibited a synchronization at 12-15 Hz. The VS group did not show a systematic response. Imagery-related activation was only sustained for 1500 ms even in control subjects, therefore, limiting conclusions regarding the ability to follow an instruction. Furthermore, a clinically diagnosed VS patient exhibited EEG responses indicative for MCS. Conclusion: Results indicate that MCS patients are still able to process an observed motor behavior on a basic sensory and perhaps even pre-motoric level, but seem not to be capable of " mirroring'' the movement like healthy participants. Significance: "Real-world'' tasks as presented here carry the potential to identify residual cognitive functioning in DOC patients and may ultimately help to lower misdiagnosis rates.

Recent research has underscored the importance of visuo-perceptual dysfunctions for cognitive deficits and pathophysiological processes in schizophrenia. In the current paper, we review evidence for the relevance of high frequency (beta/gamma) oscillations towards visuo-perceptual dysfunctions in schizophrenia. In the first part of the paper, we examine the relationship between beta/gamma band oscillations and visual processing during normal brain functioning. We then summarize EEG/MEG-studies which demonstrate reduced amplitude and synchrony of high-frequency activity during visual stimulation in schizophrenia. In the final part of the paper, we identify neurobiological correlates as well as offer perspectives for future research to stimulate further inquiry into the role of high-frequency oscillations in visual processing impairments in the disorder.

Conventional methods for assessing dynamic interactions include cross-correlation and coherence analysis. However, these methods do not reveal the direction of information flow, which is important for studying the highly directional neurological system. Granger causality (GC) analysis can characterize the directional influences between two systems. We tested GC analysis for its capability to capture directional interactions within both simulated and in vivo neural networks. The simulated networks consisted of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons; GC analysis was used to estimate the causal influences between two model networks. Our analysis successfully detected asymmetrical interactions between these networks (p < 10(-10), t-test). Next, we characterized the relationship between the "electrical synaptic strength" in the model networks and interactions estimated by GC analysis. We demonstrated the novel application of GC to monitor interactions between thalamic and cortical neurons following ischemia induced brain injury in a rat model of cardiac arrest (CA). We observed that during the post-CA acute period the GC interactions from the thalamus to the cortex were consistently higher than those from the cortex to the thalamus (1.983 +/- 0.278 times higher, p = 0.021). In addition, the dynamics of GC interactions between the thalamus and the cortex were frequency dependent. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GC to monitor the dynamics of thalamocortical interactions after a global nervous system injury such as CA-induced ischemia, and offers preferred alternative applications in characterizing other inter-regional interactions in an injured brain.

A classical model for TC oscillations states that reciprocal interaction between synaptically connected GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons and glutamatergic TC neurons generates oscillations through T-type channel-mediated low-threshold burst firings of neurons in the two nuclei. These oscillations are then transmitted from TC neurons to cortical neurons, contributing to the network of TC oscillations. Unexpectedly, however, we found that both WT and KO mice for Ca(V)3.1, the gene for T-type Ca2+ channels in TC neurons, exhibit typical waxing-and-waning sleep spindle waves at a similar occurrence and with similar amplitudes and episode durations during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Single-unit recording in parallel with electroencephalography in vivo confirmed a complete lack of burst firing in the mutant TC neurons. Of particular interest, the tonic spike frequency in TC neurons was significantly increased during spindle periods compared with nonspindle periods in both genotypes. In contrast, no significant change in burst firing frequency between spindle and nonspindle periods was noted in the WT mice. Furthermore, spindle-like oscillations were readily generated within intrathalamic circuits composed solely of TRN and TC neurons in vitro in both the KO mutant and WT mice. Our findings call into question the essential role of low-threshold burst firings in TC neurons and suggest that tonic firing is important for the generation and propagation of spindle oscillations in the TC circuit.

These results suggest the possibility of neurophysiological trait differences between subjects with high and low DEW To test this hypothesis we compared sleep characteristics and alpha reactivity to sounds in subjects with high and low DRF using polysomnographic recordings and electroencephalography (EEG). We acquired EEG from 21 channels in 36 healthy subjects while they were presented with a passive auditory oddball paradigm (frequent standard tones, rare deviant tones and very rare first names) during wakefulness and sleep (intensity, 50 dB above the subject's hearing level). Subjects were selected as High-recallers (HR, DRF = 4.42 +/- 0.25 SEM, dream recalls per week) and Low-recallers (LR, DRF = 0.25 +/- 0.02) using a questionnaire and an interview on sleep and dream habits. Despite the disturbing setup, the subjects' quality of sleep was generally preserved. First names induced a more sustained decrease in alpha activity in HR than in LR at Pz (1000-1200 ms) during wakefulness, but no group difference was found in REM sleep. The current dominant hypothesis proposes that alpha rhythms would be involved in the active inhibition of the brain regions not involved in the ongoing brain operation. According to this hypothesis, a more sustained alpha decrease in HR would reflect a longer release of inhibition, suggesting a deeper processing of complex sounds than in LR during wakefulness. A possibility to explain the absence of group difference during sleep is that increase in alpha power in HR may have resulted in awakenings. Our results support this hypothesis since HR experienced more intra sleep wakefulness than LR (30 4 vs. 14 4 min). As a whole our results support the hypothesis of neurophysiological trait differences in high and low-recallers.

However, neuropsychological studies in humans have emphasized the importance of parietal cortex for spatial navigation, and efforts to identify the electrophysiological signs of spatial navigation in humans have been stymied by the difficulty of recording during free exploration of complex environments. We resolved the recording problem and experimentally probed brain activity of human participants who were fully ambulant. On each of 2 d, electroencephalography was synchronized with head and body movement in 13 subjects freely navigating an extended virtual environment containing numerous unique objects. theta phase and amplitude recorded over parietal cortex were consistent when subjects walked through a particular spatial separation at widely separated times. This spatial displacement theta autocorrelation (STAcc) was quantified and found to be significant from 2 to 8 Hz within the environment. Similar autocorrelation analyses performed on an electrooculographic channel, used to measure eye movements, showed no significant spatial autocorrelations, ruling out eye movements as the source of STAcc. Strikingly, the strength of an individual's STAcc maps from day 1 significantly predicted object location recall success on day 2. theta was also significantly correlated with walking speed; however, this correlation appeared unrelated to STAcc and did not predict memory performance. This is the first demonstration of memory-related, spatial maps in humans generated during active spatial exploration.

In the present study, we obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of working-memory load, and investigated how these waveforms are modulated by illumination conditions. We hypothesized that illumination conditions may affect cognitive performance. We designed an EEG study to monitor and record participants' EEG during the Sternberg working memory task under four different illumination conditions. Illumination conditions were generated with a factorial design of two color-temperatures (3000 and 7100 K) by two illuminance levels (150 and 700 Ix). During a working memory task, we observed that high illuminance led to significantly lower frontal EEG theta activity than did low illuminance. These differences persisted despite no significant difference in task performance between illumination conditions. We found that the latency of an early event-related potential component, such as N1, was significantly modulated by the illumination condition. The fact that the illumination condition affects brain activity but not behavioral performance suggests that the lighting conditions used in the present study did not influence the performance stage of behavioral processing. Nevertheless, our findings provide objective evidence that illumination conditions modulate brain activity. Further studies are necessary to refine the optimal lighting parameters for facilitating working memory. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although slow oscillations have been shown to travel over space in terms of consistent phase advances, it is unknown how this phenomenon relates to neuronal activity in other frequency bands. We here present electrocorticographic data from three male and one female human subject and demonstrate that gamma power is phase locked to traveling alpha waves. Given that alpha activity has been proposed to coordinate neuronal processing reflected in the gamma band, we suggest that alpha waves are involved in coordinating neuronal processing in both space and time.

Recent studies have argued that the auditory system enhances the gain of a speech stream relative to competitors by entraining (or "phase-locking") to the rhythmic structure in its acoustic envelope, thus ensuring that syllables arrive during periods of high neuronal excitability. We hypothesized that such a mechanism could also suppress a competing speech stream by ensuring that syllables arrive during periods of low neuronal excitability. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG recorded from human adults while they attended to one of two competing, naturalistic speech streams. By calculating the cross-correlation between the EEG channels and the speech envelopes, we found evidence of entrainment to the attended speech's acoustic envelope as well as weaker yet significant entrainment to the unattended speech's envelope. An independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition of the data revealed sources in the posterior temporal cortices that displayed robust correlations to both the attended and unattended envelopes. Critically, in these components the signs of the correlations when attended were opposite those when unattended, consistent with the hypothesized entrainment-based suppressive mechanism.

However, it is not yet clear which neural mechanisms underpin this process. Several studies suggest that in comparison with item recognition temporal order coding activates prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Results of various studies tend to favour the hypothesis that the order of the stimuli is represented and encoded on several stages, from primacy and recency estimates to the exact position of the item in a sequence. Different brain regions play a different role in this process. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has a more general role in attention, while the premotor cortex is more involved in the process of information grouping. Parietal lobe and hippocampus also play a significant role in order processing as they enable the representation of distance. Moreover, order maintenance is associated with the existence of neural oscillators that operate at different frequencies. Electrophysiological studies revealed that theta and alpha oscillations play an important role in the maintenance of temporal order information. Those EEG oscillations are differentially associated with processes that support the maintenance of order information and item recognition. Various studies suggest a link between prefrontal areas and memory for temporal order, implying that EEG neural oscillations in the prefrontal cortex may play a role in the maintenance of information on temporal order.

We aim to analyze in all brain regions the occurrence and significance of this particular pattern. Methods: Twenty patients implanted in mesial temporal and neocortical areas were studied. One minute of slow-wave sleep was reviewed. The background was classified as continuous/semicontinuous, irregular, or sporadic based on the duration of the fast oscillations. Each channel was classified as inside/outside the seizure onset zone (SOZ) or a lesion. Results: The continuous/semicontinuous HFA occurred in 54 of the 790 channels analyzed, with a clearly higher prevalence in hippocampus and occipital lobe. No correlation was found with the SOZ or lesions. In the occipital lobe the continuous/semicontinuous HFA was present independently of whether eyes were open or closed. Conclusions: We describe what appears to be a new physiological High Frequency Activity, independent of epileptogenicity, present almost exclusively in the hippocampus and occipital cortex but independent of the alpha rhythm. Significance: The continuous HFA may be an intrinsic characteristic of specific brain regions, reflecting a particular type of physiological neuronal activity.

Common resting brain dynamics indicate a possible mechanism underlying zolpidem response in severe brain injury	ELIFE			English	Article							MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; EEG POWER; OSCILLATIONS; AROUSAL; COMA; DISORDERS; RECOVERY; ORIGIN; ALPHA; MOTOR	Zolpidem produces paradoxical recovery of speech, cognitive and motor functions in select subjects with severe brain injury but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In three diverse patients with known zolpidem responses we identify a distinctive pattern of EEG dynamics that suggests a mechanistic model. In the absence of zolpidem, all subjects show a strong low frequency oscillatory peak similar to 6-10 Hz in the EEG power spectrum most prominent over frontocentral regions and with high coherence (similar to 0.7-0.8) within and between hemispheres. Zolpidem administration sharply reduces EEG power and coherence at these low frequencies. The similar to 6-10 Hz activity is proposed to arise from intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons that are passively entrained across the cortex by locally-generated spontaneous activity. Activation by zolpidem is proposed to arise from a combination of initial direct drug effects on cortical, striatal, and thalamic populations and further activation of underactive brain regions induced by restoration of cognitively-mediated behaviors.

Extraversion and anteriro vs. posterior DMN activity during self-referential thoughts	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						extraversion; default mode network; EEG; alpha oscillations; independent component analysis	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; DOPAMINE DEPLETION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; NEGATIVE AFFECT; EEG ACTIVITY	Recent studies show that fronto-posterior electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power distribution is associated with personality. Specifically, extraversion is associated with an increase of spectral power in posterior cortical regions that overlap with the posterior default mode network (DMN) hub and a decrease of spectral power in anterior regions that overlap with the anterior DMN hub. Although there is evidence that dopaminergic neurotransmission may be involved, psychological processes that underlie these associations remain unclear. I hypothesize that these processes may have something to do with spontaneous self-referential thoughts. Specifically, I hypothesize that in extraverts self-referential thoughts may be associated with an increase of spectral power in the posterior DMN hub, whereas in introverts they may be associated with an increase of spectral power in the anterior DMN hub. After spontaneous EEG registration, participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire describing their thoughts during the registration. An item describing self-referential positive expectations (SRPE) was used to measure individual differences in the intensity of these processes. Source localization and independent component analyses were applied to EEG data to reveal oscillatory activity associated with the anterior and the posterior DMN hubs. Hierarchical regression analysis showed a significant interaction between extraversion scores and anterior vs. posterior DMN alpha activity in predicting individual differences in SRPE scores. In extraverts, high SRPE scores were associated with an increase of alpha power in the posterior DMN hub, whereas in introverts they were associated with an increase of alpha power in the anterior DMN hub. Results are discussed in terms of differential involvement of the two DMN hubs in self-related reward processes in extraverts and introverts.

For instance, slow wave activity characterized by sleep slow oscillation (SO) emerges normally during slow-wave sleep (SWS), in this mini-review we will first give a background leading up to the present day association between specific oscillations and their functional relevance for learning and memory consolidation. Following, some principles on oscillatory activity are summarized and finally results of studies employing slowly oscillating transcranial electric stimulation are given. We underscore that oscillatory transcranial electric stimulation presents a tool to study principles of cortical network function.

Altered temporal correlations in resting-state connectivity fluctuations in children with reading difficulties detected via MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dyslexia; MEG; Brain connectivity; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Scale-free dynamics; Self-organized criticality	COMPLETE ARTIFACT REMOVAL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; EEG; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; ALPHA	In this study we investigate systematic patterns of rapidly changing sensor-level interdependencies in resting MEG data obtained from 23 children experiencing reading difficulties (RD) and 27 non-impaired readers (NI). Three-minute MEG time series were band-passed and subjected to blind source separation (BSS) prior to estimating sensor interdependencies using the weighted phase synchronization measure (wPLI). Dynamic sensor-level network properties were then derived for two network metrics (global and local efficiency). The temporal decay of long-range temporal correlations in network metrics (LRTC) was quantified using the scaling exponent (SE) in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) plots. Having established the reliability of SE estimates as robust descriptors of network dynamics, we found that RD students displayed significantly reduced (a) overall sensor-level network organization across all frequency bands (global efficiency), and (b) temporal correlations between sensors covering the left temporoparietal region and the remaining sensors in the 33 band (local efficiency). Importantly, both groups displayed scale-free global network connectivity dynamics. The direct application of DFA to MEG signals failed to reveal significant group differences. Results are discussed in relation to prior evidence for disrupted temporoparietal functional circuits for reading in developmental reading disability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CPAP restores the link between cardiac autonomic activity and delta sleep across the night. Methods: Eight patients suffering from severe SAHS before and after 4 +/- 3 years of nasal CPAP treatment were matched with fourteen healthy controls. Sleep EEG and ECG were analysed to obtain spectral sleep and HRV components. Coherence analysis was applied between HFnu and delta power bands across the first three sleep cycles. Results: Sleep characteristics and spectral HRV components were similar between untreated patients, treated patients and controls, with the exception of decreased Rapid Eye Movement duration in untreated patients. Coherence and gain values between HFnu and delta EEG variability were decreased in untreated patients while gain values normalized in treated patients. In patients before and during long-term CPAP treatment, phase shift and delay between modifications in HFnu and delta EEG variability did not differ from controls but were not different from zero. In healthy men, changes in cardiac vagal activity appeared 9 +/- 7 minutes before modifications in delta sleep. Conclusions: Long-term nasal CPAP restored, in severe SAHS, the information between cardiovascular and sleep brainstem structures by increasing gain, but did not improve its tightness or time shift.

In this communication, we introduce a two-step procedure for automatically detecting and classifying FRs. In the first step, we detect all events of interest (EOIs) in the frequency band ranging from 250 Hz to 600 Hz. Then, based on wavelet transform, a local energy vs frequency analysis is performed to assign each EOIs to a specific class: FRs, interictal epileptic spikes (IESs), and artifact. The results obtained in the context of real depth-EEG signals (human and animal) show high performance in term of sensitivity and specificity.

In this study, we analyzed the neurophysiological bases of sentence reading through the EEG activity elicited during reading the same word embedded in differently constraining contexts: a) a low-constraining context; b) a high-constraining semantic compositional context; c) a high-constraining collocational context in which the item was in final position of a multi-word fixed-order expression. Cloze-probability of the two high-constraining contexts was equated. Before reading the target word we observed increased EEG gamma phase synchronization for the high-constraining compositional context and increased EEG theta synchronization for the collocational context (both compared to the low-constraining condition). After reading the target word we observed increased frontal positive EEG evoked activity (similar to 220 ms) for the high-constraining compositional context but an even earlier (similar to 120 ms) effect for the high-constraining collocational condition that was distributed over the scalp. A positive correlation was found only between the increased theta synchronization and the early EEG effect for the high-constraining collocational condition. Results indicate that long-range frontal-occipital interactions in the theta band indexing working memory operations - support early visual-orthographic analysis of an incoming stimulus (such as the expected word); gamma-phase synchronization better represents binding operations between feed-forward activation and matching feedback These data suggest that internal linguistic knowledge stored in long-term memory - if unambiguously pre-activated - supports the low-level perceptual processes involved in reading.

Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that the superior temporal sulcus (STS) plays an important role for this improvement. The spectrotemporal dynamics underlying audiovisual speech processing in the STS, and how these dynamics are affected by auditory noise, are not well understood. Using electroencephalography, we investigated how auditory noise affects audiovisual speech processing in event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity. Spoken syllables were presented in audiovisual (AV) and auditory only (A) trials at three different auditory noise levels (no, low, and high). Responses to A stimuli were subtracted from responses to AV stimuli, separately for each noise level, and these responses were subjected to the statistical analysis. Central ERPs differed between the no noise and the two noise conditions from 130 to 150 ms and 170 to 210 ms after auditory stimulus onset. Source localization using the local autoregressive average procedure revealed an involvement of the lateral temporal lobe, encompassing the superior and middle temporal gyrus. Neuronal activity in the beta-band (16 to 32 Hz) was suppressed at central channels around 100 to 400 ms after auditory stimulus onset in the averaged AV minus A signal over the three noise levels. This suppression was smaller in the high noise compared to the no noise and low noise condition, possibly reflecting disturbed recognition or altered processing of multisensory speech stimuli. Source analysis of the beta-band effect using linear beamforming demonstrated an involvement of the STS. Our study shows that auditory noise alters audiovisual speech processing in ERPs localized to lateral temporal lobe and provides evidence that beta-band activity in the STS plays a role for audiovisual speech processing under regular and noisy acoustic conditions.

A flat (isoelectric) EEG, which is usually recorded during very deep coma, is considered to be a turning point between a living brain and a deceased brain. Therefore the isoelectric EEG constitutes, together with evidence of irreversible structural brain damage, one of the criteria for the assessment of brain death. In this study we use EEG recordings for humans on the one hand, and on the other hand double simultaneous intracellular recordings in the cortex and hippocampus, combined with EEG, in cats. They serve to demonstrate that a novel brain phenomenon is observable in both humans and animals during coma that is deeper than the one reflected by the isoelectric EEG, and that this state is characterized by brain activity generated within the hippocampal formation. This new state was induced either by medication applied to postanoxic coma (in human) or by application of high doses of anesthesia (isoflurane in animals) leading to an EEG activity of quasi-rhythmic sharp waves which henceforth we propose to call n-complexes (Nu-complexes). Using simultaneous intracellular recordings in vivo in the cortex and hippocampus (especially in the CA3 region) we demonstrate that n-complexes arise in the hippocampus and are subsequently transmitted to the cortex. The genesis of a hippocampal n-complex depends upon another hippocampal activity, known as ripple activity, which is not overtly detectable at the cortical level. Based on our observations, we propose a scenario of how self-oscillations in hippocampal neurons can lead to a whole brain phenomenon during coma.

In this paper, we hypothesized PCA decomposition could be used to diminish the background activity and further improve the performance of connectivity analysis in event related experiments. The idea was tested using simulation, where we found that for the 306-channel Elekta Neuromag system, the first 4 PCs represent the dominant background activity, and the source connectivity pattern after preprocessing is consistent with the true connectivity pattern designed in the simulation. Improving signal to noise of the evoked responses by discarding the first few PCs demonstrates increased coherences at major physiological frequency bands when removing the first few PCs. Furthermore, the evoked information was maintained after PCA preprocessing. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that the first few PCs represent background activity, and PCA decomposition can be employed to remove it to expose the evoked activity for the channels under investigation. Therefore, PCA can be applied as a preprocessing approach to improve neuronal connectivity analysis for event related data.

Investigation into the Efficacy of Generating Synthetic Pathological Oscillations for Domain Adaptation	IX INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Seminar on Medical Information Processing and Analysis	NOV 11-14, 2013	Mexico City, MEXICO	Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Univ Panamericana, Univ Nacl Colombia		Machine Learning; Domain Adaptation; Synthetic Oscillations; Knowledge Discovery in Databases	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; EEG; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY	In our ongoing work to integrate Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) into neuroscience, we present a paper that facilitates overcoming the two challenges preventing this integration. Pathological oscillations found in the human brain are difficult to evaluate because 1) there is often no time to learn and train off of the same distribution in the fatally sick, and 2) sinusoidal signals found in the human brain are complex and transient in nature, requiring large data sets to work with which are costly and often very expensive or impossible to acquire. Overcoming these challenges in today's neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) requires insurmountable resources. For these reasons, optimizing KDD for pathological oscillations so machine learning systems can predict neuropathological states would be of immense value. Domain adaptation, which allows a way of predicting on a separate set of data than the training data, can theoretically overcome the first challenge. However, the challenge of acquiring large data sets that show whether domain adaptation is a good candidate to test in a live neuro ICU remains a challenge. To solve this conundrum, we present a methodology for generating synthesized neuropathological oscillations for domain adaptation.

We aimed to investigate how whole-night bedside light can affect sleep quality and brain activity. Patients and methods: Ten healthy sleepers underwent two polysomnography (PSG) sessions, one with the lights off and one with the lights on. PSG variables related to sleep quality were extracted and compared between lights-off and lights-on sleep. Spectral analysis was performed to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep epochs to reveal any light-induced differences in background brain rhythms. Results: Lights-on sleep was associated with increased stage 1 sleep (N1), decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS), and increased arousal index. Spectral analysis revealed that theta power (4-8 Hz) during REM sleep and slow oscillation (0.5-1 Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), and spindle (10-16 Hz) power during NREM sleep were decreased in lights-on sleep conditions. Conclusions: Sleeping with the light on not only causes shallow sleep and frequent arousals but also has a persistent effect on brain oscillations, especially those implicated in sleep depth and stability. Our study demonstrates additional hazardous effect of light pollution on health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A simultaneous EEG and Eye Tracking study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Post-call distraction; Preoccupation; Problem-solving; Driving; Hazard perception performance; Eye movements; Electroencephalography	CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; VISUAL INFORMATION; DRIVER BEHAVIOR; COGNITIVE LOAD; WORKLOAD; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; REAL; DISTRACTION; TELEPHONES	The aim of this current study was to test the hypothesis that contemplating a recent mobile telephone conversation has a detrimental effect on measures of attentional processing in a driving situation. In this within-subjects design, hazard perception performance was compared between high and no cognitive load conditions (with or without a puzzle to solve). We tested 17 participants, all of whom were required to be in possession of a DVLA approved driving license and had completed the hazard perception portion of the British driving test. A novel dual-task paradigm, which did not require subjects to process or produce verbal information during the primary task, was employed to increase participants' cognitive load. Participants were assessed on three categories of performance measures: behavioural, eye movements and cortical activity between both high and no cognitive load conditions whilst watching 20 clips from a hazard perception test. This study was run in a laboratory of the Psychology Research Wing at the University of Dundee. Behavioural findings from the hazard perception test indicate significantly increased reaction times to hazardous stimuli and significantly increased false alarm rates to non-hazardous stimuli in the high cognitive load condition (when contemplating a previous conversation). Analyses of eye movements indicated significant increases in blink frequencies, higher saccade peak velocities and a significant reduction in the spread of fixations along the horizontal axis. Results from EEG recordings showed a significant increase in frontal and a significant decrease in occipital theta activity within the high load condition. Findings were interpreted within the framework of Corbetta, Patel and Schulmann's (2008) networks model of attention control. Our findings suggest that preoccupation with a recent conversation negatively influences the modulatory effect of the central executive on both the stimulus as well as goal-driven networks of the brain.

In this study, we investigated whether the transition to seizure is associated with changes in brain dynamics detectable in the wideband EEG, and whether differences exist across underlying pathologies. Depth electrode ictal EEG recordings from 40 consecutive patients with pharmacoresistant lesional focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Predefined EEG sections were selected immediately before (immediate preictal), and 30 seconds before the earliest EEG sign suggestive of seizure activity (baseline). Spectral analysis, visual inspection and discrete wavelet transform were used to detect standard (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and high-frequency bands (ripples and fast ripples). At the group level, each EEG frequency band activity increased significantly from baseline to the immediate preictal section, mostly in a progressive manner and independently of any modification in the state of vigilance. Preictal increases in each frequency band activity were widespread, being observed in the seizure-onset zone and lesional tissue, as well as in remote regions. These changes occurred in all the investigated pathologies (mesial temporal atrophy/sclerosis, local/regional cortical atrophy, and malformations of cortical development), but were more pronounced in mesial temporal atrophy/sclerosis. Our findings indicate that a brain state change with distinctive features, in the form of unidirectional changes across the entire EEG bandwidth, occurs immediately prior to seizure onset. We postulate that these changes might reflect a facilitating state of the brain which enables a susceptible region to generate seizures.

We applied EEG source reconstruction via time-frequency linear constrained minimum variance beamforming to help elucidate the neural mechanisms involved in spatial conflict processing. Human subjects performed a Simon task, in which conflict was induced by incongruence between spatial location and response hand. We found an early (similar to 200 ms post-stimulus) conflict modulation in stimulus-contralateral parietal gamma (30-50 Hz), followed by a later alpha-band (8-12 Hz) conflict modulation, suggesting an early detection of spatial conflict and inhibition of spatial location processing. Inter-regional connectivity analyses assessed via cross-frequency coupling of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha, and gamma power revealed conflict-induced shifts in cortical network interactions: Congruent trials (relative to incongruent trials) had stronger coupling between frontal theta and stimulus-contrahemifield parietal alpha/gamma power, whereas incongruent trials had increased theta coupling between medial frontal and lateral frontal regions. These findings shed new light into the large-scale network dynamics of spatial conflict processing, and how those networks are shaped by oscillatory interactions.	[Cohen, Michael X.; Ridderinkhof, K.

Here we review recent developments in our understanding of how abnormally synchronized oscillatory activity within the corticobasal ganglia loop may play a key role in the pathophysiology of cognitive and motor phenotypes in Parkinson's disease. Recent findings Recent developments highlight the motor and non-motor roles of , and oscillations in the context of Parkinson's disease. They also emphasize the importance of oscillatory coupling between basal ganglia and cortex and draw attention to the importance of interactions between different frequency bands. Summary Oscillatory activities across multiple frequency bands and their cross-frequency interactions within spatially segregated loops of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical system may relate to distinct components of clinical impairment, both motor and non-motor. It is hoped that this characterization will lead to improved interventions like deep brain stimulation, tailored to specific components of clinical impairment and their associated spatial and spectral signatures.

Energy Efficient Cross-Layer Design for Wireless Body Area Monitoring Networks in Healthcare Applications	2013 IEEE 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR, AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS (PIMRC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	SEP 08-11, 2013	London, ENGLAND	IEEE		Wireless healthcare applications; EEG signals; Convex optimization; Cross-layer optimization		Growing number of patients with chronic diseases requiring constant monitoring has created a major impetus to developing scalable Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) for remote health applications. In this paper, to anatomize, control, and optimize the behavior of the wireless EEG monitoring system under the energy constraint, we develop an Energy-Rate-Distortion (E-R-D) analysis framework. This framework extends the traditional distortion analysis by including the energy consumption dimension. Using the E-R-D model, an Energy-Delay-Distortion cross-layer design that aims at minimizing the total energy consumption subject to data delay deadline and distortion threshold constraints is proposed. The source encoding and data transmission are the two dominant power-consuming operations in wireless EEG monitoring system. Therefore, in the proposed cross-layer design, the optimal encoding and transmission energy are computed to minimize the energy consumption in a delay constrained wireless BASN. This cross-layer framework is proposed, across Application-MAC-Physical layers, under a constraint that all successfully received packets must have their delay smaller than their corresponding delay deadline and with maximum distortion less than the application distortion threshold. In addition to that, for efficient use of the bandwidth, a variable bandwidth allocation scheme that assigns the time-frequency slots to the sensor nodes is proposed, which results in significant energy savings over the conventional constant bandwidth allocation scheme, as shown in the simulation results.

Studies using scalp EEG and intracranial electrical recordings have provided much of our current knowledge regarding the frequency and temporal specificity of these sensorimotor rhythms and their relationship to various movement parameters, however with limitations in identifying the underlying neural sources, and the variety of motor behaviors that can be studied, respectively. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, combined with spatial filtering source reconstruction methods, provide an ideal non-invasive method for the localization of sensorimotor rhythms and for describing their precise time course during a variety of motor tasks. This review describes the application of MEG to the study of oscillatory activity in the human sensorimotor cortex, including advances in localization techniques and recent contributions of MEG to our understanding of the functional role of these oscillations in both adult and developmental populations.

The EEG provides a convenient window on the mind, revealing synaptic action that strongly co-relate with brain state. Fractal dimension, measure of signal complexity can be used to characterize the physiological conditions of the brain. As the EEG signal is non linear, non stationary and noisy, non linear methods will be suitable for the analysis. In this paper various methods of fractal dimension analysis especially Higuichi's fractal method, Katz, and k-NN algorithms were applied to find the fractal dimension of EEG. The main attraction of fractal geometry sterns from its ability to describe the irregular shape of natural features as well as other complex objects that traditional Euclidean geometry fails to analyse.. EEGs of 5 volunteers were recorded at rest and on exposure to radiofrequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones having different SAR values. Mobiles were positioned near the ears and then near the cz position. Fractal dimensions for all conditions are calculated using three algorithms. The result shows that there are some changes in the FD while using mobile phone. The change in FD of the signal varies from person to person. The changes in FD show the variations in EEG signal while using mobile phone, which demonstrate transformation in the activities of brain due to radiation.	[Smitha, C.

Individual EEG differences in affective valence processing in women with low and high neuroticism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Affective valence; EEG; Individual differences; Neuroticism; Single-trial; SVM	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; VISUAL-STIMULI; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; EXTROVERSION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: In this study, individual differences in brain electrophysiology during positive and negative affective valence processing in women with different neuroticism scores are quantified. Methods: Twenty-six women scoring high and low on neuroticism participated on this experiment. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was applied on the EEG single trials elicited by high arousal pictures with negative and positive valence scores. Based on the accuracy values obtained from subject identification tasks, the most distinguishing EEG channels among participants were detected, pointing which scalp regions show more distinct patterns. Results: Significant differences were obtained, in the EEG heterogeneity between positive and negative valence stimuli, yielding higher accuracy in subject identification using negative pictures. Regarding the topographical analysis, significantly higher accuracy values were reached in occipital areas and in the right hemisphere (p < 0: 001). Conclusions: Mainly, individual differences in EEG can be located in parietooccipital regions. These differences are likely to be due to the different reactivity and coping strategies to unpleasant stimuli in individuals with high neuroticism. In addition, the right hemisphere shows a greater individual specificity. Significance: An SVM-based classifier asserts the individual specificity and its topographical differences in electrophysiological activity for women with high neuroticism compared to low neuroticism.

Spindle Power Is Not Affected after Spontaneous K-Complexes during Human NREM Sleep	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; EEG; FREQUENCY; MUSCLE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUNITRAZEPAM; AROUSAL	K-complexes and sleep spindles often grouped together characterize the second stage of NREM sleep and interest has been raised on a possible interaction of their underlying mechanisms. The reported inhibition of spindles power for about 15 seconds following evoked K-complexes has implications on their role in arousal. Our objective was to assess this inhibition following spontaneous K-complexes. We used time-frequency analysis of spontaneous K-complexes selected from whole-night EEG recordings of normal subjects. Our results show that spindles are most often observed at the positive phase following the peak of a spontaneous KC (70%). At latencies of 1-3 s following the peak of the K-complex, spindles almost disappear. Compared to long-term effects described for evoked KCs, sleep spindle power is not affected by spontaneous KCs for latencies of 5-15 s. Observation of the recurrence rate of sporadic spindles suggests that the reduction of power at 1-3 s most likely reflects a refractory period of spindles lasting for 1-2 s, rather than an effect of KCs. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying spontaneous KCs do not affect spindle power as in the case of evoked KCs.

J	Basar, E				Basar, Erol			A review of gamma oscillations in healthy subjects and in cognitive impairment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Gamma oscillations; Cognition; Bipolar disorders; Schizophrenia; Memory	AUDITORY HALLUCINATION SYMPTOMS; EVENT-RELATED COHERENCE; 40 HZ-EEG; BIPOLAR DISORDER; BAND RESPONSES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS	This review describes a wide range of functional correlates of gamma oscillations in whole-brain work, in neuroethology, sensory-cognitive dynamics, emotion, and cognitive impairment. This survey opens a new window towards understanding the brain's gamma activity. Gamma responses are selectively distributed in the whole brain, and do not reflect only a unique, specific function of the nervous system. Sensory responses from cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and reticular formations in animal and human brains, and also cognitive responses, were described by several authors. According to reviewed results, it becomes obvious that cognitive disorders, and medication which influence the transmitter release change entirely the understanding of the big picture in cognitive processes. Gamma activity is evoked or induced by different sensory stimuli or cognitive tasks. Thus, it is argued that gamma-band synchronization is an elementary and fundamental process in whole-brain operation. In conclusion, reasoning and suggestions for understanding gamma activity are highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is unclear whether these brain oscillations reflect developmental changes in the processing of affective information during adolescence. EEG data were collected from 51 adolescents and 18 undergraduates as they viewed a total of 90 pictures. In the range of fast wave activities, event-related synchronization (ERS) in the beta band varied with emotional valence, indicating that beta ERS is indicative of early bottom-up processing of visual emotional stimuli. Adolescents at the age of 12 years exhibited more positive beta ERS amplitudes over posterior brain regions for positive versus neutral pictures compared to adolescents at the ages 14years, 16 years and in young adults; however, no age-related differences were found for negative versus neutral pictures. In the range of slow wave activities, delta ERSs and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes exhibited affective modulation and decreased over anterior brain regions from between the age of 12 years and early adulthood. These slow wave activities (delta and LPPs) reflected top-down attention to the motivational relevance of the emotional stimuli. Taken together, these observations suggest that adolescents exhibit dissociable ERS patterns in the delta and beta bands during affective processing. Furthermore, adolescents undergo age-dependent changes in oscillatory brain reorganization. Our results should be useful to researchers interested in affective processing during adolescence.

However, little is still known about the neurophysiological correlates of perceptual integration in this condition. We have used a 3D structure-from-motion (SFM) integrative task to characterize the neuronal underpinnings of 3D perception in WS and to probe whether gamma oscillatory patterns reflect changed holistic perception. Coherent faces were parametrically modulated in 3D depth (three different depth levels) to vary levels of stimulus ambiguity. We have found that the electrophysiological (EEG/ERP) correlates of such holistic percepts were distinct across groups. Independent component analysis demonstrated the presence of a novel component with a late positivity around 200 ms that was absent in controls. Source localization analysis of ERP signals showed a posterior occipital shift in WS and reduced parietal dorsal stream sources. Interestingly, low gamma-band oscillations (20-40 Hz) induced by this 3D perceptual integration task were significantly stronger and sustained during the stimulus presentation in WS whereas high gamma-band oscillations (60-90 Hz) were reduced in this clinical model of impaired visual coherence, as compared to controls. These observations suggest that dorsal stream processing of 3D SFM stimuli has distinct neural correlates in WS and different cognitive strategies are employed by these patients to reach visual coherence. Importantly, we found evidence for the presence of different sub-bands (20-40 Hz/60-90 Hz) within the gamma range which can be dissociated concerning the respective role On the coherent percept formation, both in typical and atypical development.

Elevating Endogenous GABA Levels with GAT-1 Blockade Modulates Evoked but Not Induced Responses in Human Visual Cortex	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						gamma oscillations; alpha rhythm; GABA; tiagabine; evoked responses	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSE; UPTAKE INHIBITOR; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; TIAGABINE; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MANIFESTATION; STIMULATION; TRANSPORTER	The electroencephalographic/magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signal is generated primarily by the summation of the postsynaptic currents of cortical principal cells. At a microcircuit level, these glutamatergic principal cells are reciprocally connected to GABAergic interneurons. Here we investigated the relative sensitivity of visual evoked and induced responses to altered levels of endogenous GABAergic inhibition. To do this, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks the synaptic GABA transporter 1, and so increases endogenous GABA levels. In a single-blinded and placebo-controlled crossover study of 15 healthy participants, we administered either 15 mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head MEG, while participants viewed a visual grating stimulus, before, 1, 3 and 5 h post tiagabine ingestion. Using beamformer source localization, we reconstructed responses from early visual cortices. Our results showed no change in either stimulus-induced gamma-band amplitude increases or stimulus-induced alpha amplitude decreases. However, the same data showed a 45% reduction in the evoked response component at similar to 80 ms. These data demonstrate that, in early visual cortex the evoked response shows a greater sensitivity compared with induced oscillations to pharmacologically increased endogenous GABA levels. We suggest that previous studies correlating GABA concentrations as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy to gamma oscillation frequency may reflect underlying variations such as interneuron/inhibitory synapse density rather than functional synaptic GABA concentrations.

In turn, NREM is further divided into three stages denoted here by N1, N2, and N3. To assess the method, polysomnographic (PSG) records of 40 patients from our ISRUC-Sleep dataset, which was scored by an expert clinician in the central hospital of Coimbra, are used. To find the best combination of PSG signals for automatic sleep staging, six electroencephalographic (EEG), two electrooculographic (EOG), and one electromyographic (EMG) channels are analyzed. An extensive set of feature extraction techniques are applied, covering temporal, frequency and time-frequency domains. The maximum overlap wavelet transform (MODWT), a shift invariant transform, was used to extract the features in time-frequency domain. The extracted feature set is transformed and normalized to reduce the effect of extreme values of features. The most discriminative features are selected through a two-step method composed by a manual selection step based on features' histogram analysis followed by an automatic feature selector. The selected feature set is classified using support vector machines (SVMs). The system achieved the best performance by combining 6 channels (C3, C4, O1, left EOG (LOC), right EOG (ROC) and chin EMG (X1)) for sleep-wake detection, and 9 channels (C3, C4, O1, O2, F3, F4, LOC, ROC, X1) for multiclass sleep staging.

An intra-K-complex oscillation with independent and labile frequency and topography in NREM sleep	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						K-complex; NREM sleep; human EEG; theta; alpha	SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; SPINDLES; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; MUSCLE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN	NREM sleep is characterized by K-complexes (KCs), over the negative phase of which we identified brief activity in the theta range. We recorded high resolution EEG of whole-night sleep from seven healthy volunteers and visually identified 2nd and 3rd stage NREM spontaneous KCs. We identified three major categories: (1) KCs without intra-KC-activity (iKCa), (2) KCs with non-oscillatory iKCa, and (3) KCs with oscillatory iKCa. The latter group of KCs with intra-KC-oscillation (iKCo), was clustered according to the duration of the iKCo. iKCa was observed in most KCs (1150/1522, 75%). iKCos with 2, 3, and 4 waves were observed in 52% (789/1522) of KCs in respective rates of 49% (386/786), 44%, and 7%. Successive waves of iKCos showed on average a shift of their maximal amplitude in the anterio-posterior axis, while the average amplitude of the slow KC showed no spatial shift in time. The iKCo spatial shift was accompanied by transient increases in instantaneous frequency from the theta band toward the alpha band, followed by decreases to upper theta. The study shows that the KC is most often concurrently accompanied by an independent brief iKCo exhibiting topographical relocation of amplitude maxima with every consecutive peak and transient increases in frequency. The iKCo features are potentially reflecting arousing processes taking place during the KC.

Experimental Placebo Analgesia Changes Resting-State Alpha Oscillations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WIDESPREAD MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; LOW-BACK-PAIN; EEG-ALPHA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TONIC PAIN; ANTICIPATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; FIBROMYALGIA	The lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain could explain why we currently have only a few effective treatments. Understanding how pain relief is realised during placebo analgesia could help develop improved treatments for chronic pain. Here, we tested whether experimental placebo analgesia was associated with altered resting-state cortical activity in the alpha frequency band of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Alpha oscillations have been shown to be influenced by top-down processes, which are thought to underpin the placebo response. Seventy-three healthy volunteers, split into placebo or control groups, took part in a well-established experimental placebo procedure involving treatment with a sham analgesic cream. We recorded ongoing (resting) EEG activity before, during, and after the sham treatment. We show that resting alpha activity is modified by placebo analgesia. Post-treatment, alpha activity increased significantly in the placebo group only (p < 0.001). Source analysis suggested that this alpha activity might have been generated in medial components of the pain network, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and left insula. These changes are consistent with a cognitive state of pain expectancy, a key driver of the placebo analgesic response. The manipulation of alpha activity may therefore present an exciting avenue for the development of treatments that directly alter endogenous processes to better control pain.	[Huneke, Nathan T.

Je pense donc je fais: transcranial direct current stimulation modulates brain oscillations associated with motor imagery and movement observation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tDCS; EEG; mu rhythm; motor imagery; action observation; primary motor cortex	MU-RHYTHM; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; HOMEOSTATIC PLASTICITY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EEG EVIDENCE; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; SIMULATION; IMITATION; TRIAL	Motor system neural networks are activated during movement imagery, observation and execution, with a neural signature characterized by suppression of the Mu rhythm. In order to investigate the origin of this neurophysiological marker, we tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modifies Mu rhythm oscillations during tasks involving observation and imagery of biological and non-biological movements. We applied tDCS (anodal, cathodal, and sham) in 21 male participants (mean age 23.8 +/- 3.06), over the left M1 with a current of 2 mA for 20 min. Following this, we recorded the EEG at C3, C4, and Cz and surrounding C3 and C4 electrodes. Analyses of C3 and C4 showed significant effects for biological vs. non-biological movement (p = 0.005), and differential hemisphere effects according to the type of stimulation (p = 0.04) and type of movement (p = 0.02). Analyses of surrounding electrodes revealed significant interaction effects considering type of stimulation and imagery or observation of biological or non-biological movement (p = 0.03). The main findings of this study were (1) Mu desynchronization during biological movement of the hand region in the contralateral hemisphere after sham tDCS; (2) polarity-dependent modulation effects of tDCS on the Mu rhythm, i.e., anodal tDCS led to Mu synchronization while cathodal tDCS led to Mu desynchronization during movement observation and imagery (3) specific focal and opposite inter-hemispheric effects, i.e., contrary effects for the surrounding electrodes during imagery condition and also for inter-hemispheric electrodes (C3 vs. C4). These findings provide insights into the cortical oscillations during movement observation and imagery. Furthermore, it shows that tDCS can be highly focal when guided by a behavioral task.

Under hyperpolarizing influences such as anesthetic drugs, cortical neurons oscillate at similar to 1 Hz, which is measurable as slow waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG). We have administered propofol anesthesia to 16 subjects and found that, after they had lost behavioral responsiveness (response to standard sensory stimuli), each individual's EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) rose to saturation and then remained constant despite increasing drug concentrations. We then simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging and EEG data in 12 of these subjects during propofol administration and sensory stimulation. During the transition to SWA saturation, the thalamocortical system became isolated from sensory stimuli, whereas internal thalamocortical exchange persisted. Rather, an alternative and more fundamental cortical network (which includes the precuneus) responded to all sensory stimulation. We conclude that SWA saturation is a potential individualized indicator of perception loss that could prove useful for monitoring depth of anesthesia and studying altered states of consciousness.

These changes mimic motor activity during actual motion execution, albeit reduced in strength. Recent noninvasive (EEG/magnetoencephalography) and invasive studies (electrocorticography) have shown that during actual motion, beta power changes are accompanied by highly localized changes in the high gamma band (70-100 Hz). In this study, we investigate, using 27-channel EEG in combination with a generic head model and a cortical mapping algorithm, whether such high gamma changes are also present during motion observation. Subjects were presented with a 2.7-second video of a moving hand, contrasted with a video of moving scenery of equal length. Our results show nonlateralized beta band decrease in power in response to the moving hand versus the response to the moving scenery. We also find significant increase in high gamma power. However, unlike the beta band response, increases in this band are lateralized, with a preference for the hemisphere of the dominant hand.

Although NFB is being pioneered as a noninvasive tool for treating brain disorders, there is insufficient evidence on the mechanism of its impact on brain function. Furthermore, the dominant rhythm of the human brain is the alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz), yet its behavioral significance remains multifaceted and largely correlative. In this study with 34 healthy participants, we examined whether during the performance of an attentional task, the functional connectivity of distinct fMRI networks would be plastically altered after a 30-min session of voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm (n = 17) versus a sham-feedback condition (n = 17). We reveal that compared to sham-feedback, NFB induced an increase of connectivity within regions of the salience network involved in intrinsic alertness (dorsal anterior cingulate), which was detectable 30 min after termination of training. The increase in salience network (default-mode network) connectivity was negatively (positively) correlated with changes in 'on task' mind-wandering as well as resting state alpha rhythm. Crucially, we observed a causal dependence between alpha rhythm synchronization during NFB and its subsequent change at resting state, not exhibited by the SHAM group. Our findings provide neurobehavioral evidence for the brain's exquisite functional plasticity, and for a temporally direct impact of NFB on a key cognitive control network, suggesting a promising basis for its use to treat cognitive disorders under physiological conditions.

This study tested the relationship between cognitive empathy and motor activation during action observation through the sensorimotor system. EEG activity was recorded over the motor area while participants observed and then performed a task demonstrated by a model. Analyses revealed significant suppression in mu/alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) EEG bands, indicative of sensorimotor activity, during both observed and executed actions. Crucially, participants rating higher in perspective taking as a measure of trait cognitive empathy showed significantly less beta suppression when observing actions.

We start this review by showing that experimental studies in humans and monkeys have reached a consensus on the facts that sensorimotor beta power is low during movement, transiently increases after movement end (the "beta rebound") and tonically increases during object grasping. Recently, a new surge of studies exploiting more complex sensorimotor tasks including multiple events, such as instructed delay tasks, reveal novel characteristics of beta oscillatory activity. We therefore proceed by critically reviewing also this literature to understand whether modulations of beta oscillations in task epochs other than those during and after movement are consistent across studies, and whether they can be reconciled with a role for beta oscillations in sensorimotor transmission. We indeed find that there are additional processes that also strongly affect sensorimotor beta oscillations, such as visual cue anticipation and processing, fitting with the view that beta oscillations reflect heightened sensorimotor transmission beyond somatosensation. However, there are differences among studies, which may be interpreted more readily if we assume multiple processes, whose effects on the overall measured beta power overlap in time. We conclude that beta oscillations observed in sensorimotor cortex may serve large-scale communication between sensorimotor and other areas and the periphery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, network motifs have been identified as patterns of interconnections since they appear in a significantly higher number than in randomized networks, in a given ensemble of anatomical or functional connectivity graphs. The current approach for detecting and enumerating motifs in brain networks requires a predetermined motif repertoire and can operate only with motifs of small size (consisting of few nodes). There is a growing interest in methodologies for frequent graph-based pattern mining in large graph datasets that can facilitate adaptive design of motifs. The results presented in this paper are based on the graph-based Substructure pattern mining (gSpan) algorithm and introduce a manifold of ways to exploit it for data-driven motif extraction in connectomics research. Functional connectivity graphs from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during resting state and mental calculations are used to demonstrate our approach. Relying on either time-invariant or time-evolving graphs, characteristic motifs associated with various frequency bands were derived and compared. With a suitable manipulation, the gSpan discovers motifs which are specific to performing mental arithmetics. Finally, the subject-dependent temporal signatures of motifs' appearance revealed the transient nature of the evolving functional connectivity (math-related motifs "come and go").

EEG was recorded while 33 children worked on a task requiring either phonological or orthographic-morphological spelling strategies. L2 processing elicited more theta %ERS than L1 processing (particularly at bilateral frontal and right posterior parietal sites) which might suggest a stronger involvement of semantic encoding and retrieval of the less familiar L2. The highest level of theta %ERS was revealed for the orthographic-morphological strategy in L2 which might indicate a more intense way of lexical retrieval compared to the phonological strategy in L2 and the orthographic-morphological strategy in L1. Analyses moreover revealed that phonological processing (both in L1 and L2) was associated with comparatively strong left-hemispheric %ERD in the upper alpha frequency band. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Functional MRI signals exhibit similar fluctuations. The default mode network (DMN) is on average deactivated in cognitive tasks requiring externally oriented attention. Momentarily insufficient deactivation of DMN, however, is often accompanied by decreased efficiency in stimulus processing, leading to attentional lapses. These observations appear to suggest that visual alpha power and DMN activity may be positively correlated. To what extent such correlation is preserved in the resting state is unclear. We addressed this problem by recording simultaneous EEG-fMRI from healthy human participants under two resting-state conditions: eyes-closed and eyes-open. Short-time visual alpha power was extracted as time series, which was then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), and correlated with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. It was found that visual alpha power was positively correlated with DMN BOLD activity only when the eyes were open; no such correlation existed when the eyes were closed. Functionally, this could be interpreted as indicating that (1) under the eyes-open condition, strong DMN activity is associated with reduced visual cortical excitability, which serves to block external visual input from interfering with introspective mental processing mediated by DMN, while weak DMN activity is associated with increased visual cortical excitability, which helps to facilitate stimulus processing, and (2) under the eyes-closed condition, the lack of external visual input renders such a gating mechanism unnecessary.

Effects of weak transcranial alternating current stimulation on brain activity-a review of known mechanisms from animal studies	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); oscillations; animal models; slow wave; gamma; electroencephalogram (EEG); entrainment; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; WAVE-RIPPLE COMPLEXES; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; IN-VITRO; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY	Rhythmic neuronal activity is ubiquitous in the human brain. These rhythms originate from a variety of different network mechanisms, which give rise to a wide-ranging spectrum of oscillation frequencies. In the last few years an increasing number of clinical research studies have explored transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with weak current as a tool for affecting brain function. The premise of these interventions is that tACS will interact with ongoing brain oscillations. However, the exact mechanisms by which weak currents could affect neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are not well known and this, in turn, limits the rational optimization of human experiments. Here we review the available in vitro and in vivo animal studies that attempt to provide mechanistic explanations. The findings can be summarized into a few generic principles, such as periodic modulation of excitability, shifts in spike timing, modulation of firing rate, and shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. These effects result from weak but simultaneous polarization of a large number of neurons. Whether this can lead to an entrainment or a modulation of brain oscillations, or whether AC currents have no effect at all, depends entirely on the specific dynamic that gives rise to the different brain rhythms, as discussed here for slow wave oscillations (similar to 1 Hz) and gamma oscillations (similar to 30 Hz). We conclude with suggestions for further experiments to investigate the role of AC stimulation for other physiologically relevant brain rhythms.

Interestingly, oscillatory patterns are also observed in behaviour, such as in visual performance measures after the presentation of a brief sensory event in the visual or another modality. These oscillations in visual performance cycle at the typical frequencies of brain rhythms, suggesting that perception may be closely linked to brain oscillations. We here investigated this link for a prominent rhythm of the visual system (the alpha-rhythm, 8-12 Hz) by applying rhythmic visual stimulation at alpha-frequency (10.6 Hz), known to lead to a resonance response in visual areas, and testing its effects on subsequent visual target discrimination. Our data show that rhythmic visual stimulation at 10.6 Hz: 1) has specific behavioral consequences, relative to stimulation at control frequencies (3.9 Hz, 7.1 Hz, 14.2 Hz), and 2) leads to alpha-band oscillations in visual performance measures, that 3) correlate in precise frequency across individuals with resting alpha-rhythms recorded over parieto-occipital areas. The most parsimonious explanation for these three findings is entrainment (phase-locking) of ongoing perceptually relevant alpha-band brain oscillations by rhythmic sensory events. These findings are in line with occipital alpha-oscillations underlying periodicity in visual performance, and suggest that rhythmic stimulation at frequencies of intrinsic brain-rhythms can be used to reveal influences of these rhythms on task performance to study their functional roles.

Motivational incongruence refers to states of insufficient goal satisfaction and is tightly related to psychological problems and even psychopathology. In the present study, individual levels of motivational incongruence were assessed with the incongruence-questionnaire (INC) in a healthy sample. In addition, multi-channel resting-state EEG was measured. Individual variations of EEG synchronization and spectral power were related to individual levels of motivational incongruence. For significant correlations, the relation to intracerebral sources of electrical brain activity was investigated with sLORETA. The results indicate that, even in a healthy sample with rather low degrees of motivational incongruence, this insufficient goal satisfaction is related to consistent changes in resting state brain activity. Upper Alpha band attenuation seems to be most indicative of increased levels of motivational incongruence. This is reflected not only in significantly reduced functional connectivity, but also in changes regarding the level of brain activation, as indicated by significant effects in the spectral power and LORETA analyses. Results are related to research investigating the upper Alpha band and are discussed in the framework of Grawe's consistency theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study assessed event-related theta oscillations in medication-free, euthymic patients with bipolar disorder upon auditory oddball paradigm. Twenty-two DSM-IV euthymic bipolar I (n = 19) and II (n = 3) patients and twenty-two healthy subjects were included. Patients were euthymic for at least 6 months, and psychotropic-free for at least 2 weeks. EEG was recorded at 30 electrode sites. Auditory oddball paradigm and sensory stimuli were used. Event-related Oscillations were analyzed using adaptive filtering in two different theta frequency bands (4-6 Hz, 6-8 Hz). In healthy subjects, slow theta (4-6 Hz) responses were significantly higher than those of euthymic patients upon target, non-target and sensory stimuli (p < 0.05). Fast theta (6-8 Hz) responses of healthy subjects were significantly higher than those of euthymic patients upon target-only stimuli (p < 0.05). Reduced theta oscillations during auditory processing provide strong quantitative evidence of activation deficits in related networks in bipolar disorder.

Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Resting-State Alpha Oscillations Predict Human Timing-Error Dynamics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; AVALANCHE DYNAMICS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; NETWORKS; BRAIN; PRESTIMULUS; RHYTHMS; FLUCTUATIONS	Human behavior is imperfect. This is notably clear during repetitive tasks in which sequences of errors or deviations from perfect performance result. These errors are not random, but show patterned fluctuations with long-range temporal correlations that are well described using power-law spectra P(f) proportional to 1/f(beta), where beta is the power-law scaling exponent describing the decay in temporal correlations. The neural basis of temporal correlations in such behaviors is not known. Interestingly, long-range temporal correlations are a hallmark of amplitude fluctuations in resting-state neuronal oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the temporal dynamics in brain and behavior are related. Thirty-nine subjects' eyes-open rest EEG was measured. Next, subjects reproduced without feedback a 1 s interval by tapping with their right index finger. In line with previous reports, we found evidence for the presence of long-range temporal correlations both in the amplitude modulation of resting-state oscillations in multiple frequency bands and in the timing-error sequences. Frequency scaling exponents of finger tapping and amplitude modulation of oscillations exhibited large individual differences. Neuronal dynamics of resting-state alpha-band oscillations (9-13 Hz) recorded at precentral sites strongly predicted scaling exponents of tapping behavior. The results suggest that individual variation in resting-state brain dynamics offer a neural explanation for individual variation in the error dynamics of human behavior.	[Smit, Dirk J.

J	Zhang, C; Wang, H; Wang, H; Wu, MH				Zhang, Chi; Wang, Hong; Wang, Hong; Wu, Mian-Hong			EEG-based expert system using complexity measures and probability density function control in alpha sub-band	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Expert system; EEG; sample entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; PDF control	STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; OUTPUT PDFS; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; OSCILLATIONS; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; LEVEL; TASK	This paper presents a novel expert system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and demonstrates the process of knowledge acquisition and inference. As we known, the problem-solving mode of expert brains is: They judge the current situation (learn about the problem), and then generate operational decisions to solve problems. However, the experts have difficulty in explaining what they know and how they gain the knowledge. Their perfect performance may be difficult to replicate. The EEG signal may be one of the most predictive and reliable measurements to acquire the expert knowledge as it reflects directly human brain activity. It is supposed that EEG is a manifestation of the experts' thinking. By the analysis of EEG, we found the regularity of EEG features of the experts in a well-defined problem domain and used the features to reflect the learning and decision-making information of the expert brains to establish the EEG-based expert system. The knowledge base of the EEG-based expert system stores the features that reflect the learning and decision-making activities of the expert brains respectively. Based on the relationship between the two kinds of the EEG features, inference engine of the EEG-based expert system makes an inference to obtain the features that reflect the decisions of the experts. When we encounter the same problem, the brains make the same judgement (learning). After the EEG data acquisition, through the EEG-based expert system, we can get the expert decisions (operations). If we interpret the decisions into actual operations or control, we can solve the problem with the expert performance or control machines more intelligently. In this paper, game experiments have been designed. We used the solution to the operation problem of a game as the basis to establish the model of the EEG-based expert system. The inputs of the system are the collected EEG signals of the users. The outputs are the operations (decisions) of the experts. The results of the EEG analysis show that the activity appeared in the corresponding brain regions and the probability density function (PDF) of the EEG features is concentrated when the experts performed the task (playing the game). By using the sample entropy (SampEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm, the EEG features of the experts' learning activities and operating activities were extracted respectively. Then, with applying the probability density functions of the features to output PDF control, the mathematical model of the EEG-based expert system was established. In the EEG-based expert system, inference means controlling the feature vectors which reflect the users' learning information from the current situation to get the feature vectors which reflect the operating information of the experts. Finally, the expert system model has been tested on a simulated example and encouraging results have been obtained. The EEG-based expert system can forecast the operating features of the experts. The output of the EEG-based expert system is in accord with the expert mode and the operating curve represented by the physiological signal features can reflect the actual operating information.

Effects of nicotine on electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioural measures of visual working memory in non-smokers during a dual-task paradigm	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						EEG; N-Back; Distraction; Working memory; Nicotine; Non-smokers	N-BACK TASK; CIGARETTE SMOKERS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ACUTE SMOKING; TOBACCO; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; ALPHA	Research in smokers has shown that nicotine may have the ability to improve certain aspects of cognitive performance, including working memory and attention, processes which implicate frontal and frontal-parietal brain networks. There is limited research on the cognitive effects of nicotine and their associated neural underpinnings in non-smokers. This study examined the effects of acute nicotine on a working memory task alone or combined with a visual detection task (single- and dual-task conditions) using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and behavioural performance measures. Twenty non-smokers (13 females; 7 males) received nicotine gum (6 mg) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, repeated measures design. Spectral EEG, together with response speed and accuracy measures, were obtained while participants completed a series of N-Back tasks under single- and dual-task conditions. Nicotine failed to exert any significant effects on performance measures, however, EEG changes were observed, primarily in frontal recordings, which varied with memory load, task condition and hemisphere. These findings, discussed in relation to previous studies in smokers, support the notion that nicotine may modulate central executive systems and contribute to smoking behaviour.

BCI can be divided into three main components: signal acquisition, signal processing, and effector device. The signal acquisition component is generally divided into two categories: noninvasive and invasive. For noninvasive, this review focuses on electroencephalogram. For the invasive, the review includes electrocorticography, local field potentials, multiple-unit activity, and single-unit action potentials. Signal processing techniques reviewed are divided into time-frequency methods such as Fourier transform, autoregressive models, wavelets, and Kalman filter and spatiotemporal techniques such as Laplacian filter and common spatial patterns. Additionally, various signal feature classification algorithms are discussed such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and Bayesian classifiers. The article ends with a discussion of challenges facing BCI and concluding remarks on the future of the technology.

In the present work, we propose a method for classifying single-trial ERPs using a combination of the Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In particular, the LWT filters, the set of EEG channels and SVM parameters that maximize the classification accuracy are searched using PSO. We evaluate the method's performance through offline analyses on the datasets from the BCI Competitions II and III. The proposed method achieved in most cases a similar or higher classification accuracy than that achieved by other methods, and adapted wavelet basis functions and channel sets that match the time-frequency and spatial properties of the P300 ERP.

These are the Granger-Geweke Causality (GGC), the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC), the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and the Direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF). The robustness of the four Causality measures against two degradation factors is quantitatively evaluated. These are: the presence of realistic biological/electronic noise at various SNR levels, as recorded on a MagnetoEncephalography (MEG) machine, and the presence of a weak node in the brain network where the causality analysis is applied. The causality measures are evaluated in terms of the relative estimation error and the compromise between true and fictitious causal density in the brain network. Both parametric and non-parametric causality analysis is performed. It is illustrated that the non-parametric method is a promising alternative to the more commonly applied MVAR-model based causality analysis. It is also demonstrated that, in the presence of both tested degradation factors, the DTF method is the most robust in terms of low estimation error, while the PDC in terms of low fictitious causal density. The dDTF provides lower fictitious causal density and higher spectral selectivity as compared to DTF, at high enough SNR. The GGC exhibits the worst compromise of performance. An application of the causality measures to a set of MEG resting-state experimental data is accordingly presented. It is demonstrated that significant contrast between the Eyes-Closed and Eyes-Open rest condition in the alpha frequency band allows to detect significant causality between the occipital cortex and the thalamus.

Directional changes in connectivity among brain regions were assessed during two states, resting and working memory (WM). Our results demonstrated an increase in the strength of connectivity between frontal and parietal regions and a decrease in the strength of connectivity between the regions of the default mode network, during task engagement. Connectivity was prominent in the low frequency bands, theta and alpha. Furthermore, during the WM task, theta oscillations increased in the frontal lobe while a reduction was observed in the alpha band.

Given the huge variety of audiences, a game's capability of adapting to different user profiles-in particular to keep the player in flow-is crucial to make it ever more enjoyable and satisfying. We have performed a user experiment exploiting a four-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) tool similar to the ones that are soon likely to appear in the market for game control. We have performed a spectral characterization of the video-gaming experience, also in comparison with other tasks. Results show that the most informative frequency bands for discriminating among gaming conditions are around low beta. Simple signals from the peripheral nervous system add marginal information. Classification of three levels of user states is possible, with good accuracy, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A user-independent classification performs worse than a user-dependent approach (50.1% versus 66.4% rate). Personalized SVM training and validation time is reasonable (7-8 min). Thus, we argue that a personalized system could be implemented in a consumer context and research should aim at improving classifiers that can be trained online by end users.

Jennifer			Progressive sleep and electroencephalogram changes in mice carrying the Huntington's disease mutation	BRAIN			English	Article						EEG; R6; 2 mice; REM sleep theta; slow wave activity; gamma activity	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; MOVEMENT REM SLEEP; THETA OSCILLATIONS; OREXIN NEURONS; POWER SPECTRA; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; NOCTURNAL SLEEP; MOUSE MODEL	Sleep disturbances in Huntington's disease may be deleterious to the cognitive performance, affective behaviour, and general well-being of patients, but a comprehensive description of the progression of changes in sleep and electroencephalogram in Huntington's disease has never been conducted. Here we studied sleep and electroencephalogram disturbances in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (R6/2 mice). We implanted 10 R6/2 mice and five wild-type littermates with electromyography electrodes, frontofrontal and frontoparietal electroencephalogram electrodes and then recorded sleep/wake behaviour at presymptomatic, symptomatic and late stages of the disease. In addition to sleep-wake scoring, we performed a spectral analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram. We found that sleep and electroencephalogram were already significantly disrupted in R6/2 mice at 9 weeks of age (presymptomatic stage). By the time they were symptomatic, R6/2 mice were unable to maintain long periods of wakefulness and had an increased propensity for rapid eye movement sleep. In addition, the peak frequency of theta rhythm was shifted progressively from 7 Hz to 6 Hz during rapid eye movement sleep, whereas slow wave activity decreased gradually during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Finally, as the disease progressed, an abnormal electroencephalogram gamma activity (30-40 Hz) emerged in R6/2 mice irrespective of sleep states. This is reminiscent of the increased gamma power described in schizophrenic patients during sleep and events of psychosis. Gaining a better understanding of sleep and electroencephalogram changes in patients with Huntington's disease should be a priority, since it will enable clinicians to initiate appropriate investigations and to instigate treatments that could dramatically improve patients' quality of life.

We propose a novel method for the automatic detection of ictal HFOs in the ripple band (80-250Hz) based on CFAR matched sub-space filtering. This allows to track the early propagation of ictal HFOs, revealing initial and follow-up epileptic activity on the electrodes. We apply this methodology to two seizures from one patient suffering from focal epilepsy. The electrodes identified are in very good accordance with the visual HFO analysis by clinicians. Furthermore the electrodes with initial HFO activity are correlated well with the SOZ (conventional theta-activity).

Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation Modulates the Amplitude of EEG Synchrony Patterns	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; EXTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EYE-MOVEMENTS	Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation has been associated with numerous cognitive and behavioural effects, such as enhancement of visual memory in healthy individuals, improvement of visual deficits in stroke patients, as well as possibly improvement of motor function in Parkinson's disease; yet, the mechanism of action is unclear. Since Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric diseases are characterized by maladaptive dynamics of brain rhythms, we investigated whether noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation was associated with measurable changes in EEG oscillatory rhythms within theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-10 Hz), high alpha (10.5-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (31-50 Hz) bands. We recorded the EEG while simultaneously delivering noisy bilateral, bipolar stimulation at varying intensities of imperceptible currents - at 10, 26, 42, 58, 74 and 90% of sensory threshold - to ten neurologically healthy subjects. Using standard spectral analysis, we investigated the transient aftereffects of noisy stimulation on rhythms. Subsequently, using robust artifact rejection techniques and the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator regression and cross-validation, we assessed the combinations of channels and power spectral features within each EEG frequency band that were linearly related with stimulus intensity. We show that noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation predominantly leads to a mild suppression of gamma power in lateral regions immediately after stimulation, followed by delayed increase in beta and gamma power in frontal regions approximately 20-25 s after stimulation ceased. Ongoing changes in the power of each oscillatory band throughout frontal, central/parietal, occipital and bilateral electrodes predicted the intensity of galvanic vestibular stimulation in a stimulus-dependent manner, demonstrating linear effects of stimulation on brain rhythms. We propose that modulation of neural oscillations is a potential mechanism for the previously-described cognitive and motor effects of vestibular stimulation, and noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation may provide an additional non-invasive means for neuromodulation of functional brain networks.

A number of theories have linked such interactions to crucial features of neuronal function and cognition. In mammals, these interactions have mostly been reported in the neocortex and hippocampus, and it remains unexplored whether similar patterns of activity occur in the thalamus, and between the thalamus and neocortex. Here we use data recorded from patients undergoing thalamic deep-brain stimulation for epilepsy to demonstrate the existence and prevalence, across a range of frequencies, of both phaseamplitude (PAC) and amplitudeamplitude coupling (AAC) both within the thalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and between them. These cross-frequency interactions may play an important role in local processing within the thalamus and neocortex, as well as information transfer between them.	[FitzGerald, Thomas H.

Prolonged sleep fragmentation of mice exacerbates febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Rodent; LPS; Stress; Inflammation; Fever	METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; IMMUNE INTERACTIONS; WAKE BEHAVIOR; DEPRIVATION; EEG; RAT; DISTURBANCES; POWER; TEMPERATURE	Background: Sleep disruption is a frequent occurrence in modern society. Whereas many studies have focused on the consequences of total sleep deprivation, few have investigated the condition of sleep disruption. New method: We disrupted sleep of mice during the light period for 9 consecutive days using an intermittently rotating disc. Results: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data demonstrated that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was severely fragmented and REM sleep was essentially abolished during the 12 h light period. During the dark period, when sleep was not disrupted, neither NREM sleep nor REM sleep times differed from control values. Analysis of the EEG revealed a trend for increased power in the peak frequency of the NREM EEG spectra during the dark period. The fragmentation protocol was not overly stressful as body weights and water consumption remained unchanged, and plasma corticosterone did not differ between mice subjected to 3 or 9 days of sleep disruption and home cage controls. However, mice subjected to 9 days of sleep disruption by this method responded to lipopolysaccharide with an exacerbated febrile response. Comparison with existing methods: Existing methods to disrupt sleep of laboratory rodents often subject the animal to excessive locomotion, vibration, or sudden movements. This method does not suffer from any of these confounds. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that prolonged sleep disruption of mice exacerbates febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide. This device provides a method to determine mechanisms by which chronic insufficient sleep contributes to the etiology of many pathologies, particularly those with an inflammatory component.

Interhemispheric EEG coherence is reduced in auditory cortical regions in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory hallucinations; Schizophrenia; Interhemispheric connectivity; Auditory cortex; EEG coherence	PLANUM TEMPORALE; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; HESCHLS GYRUS; GENETIC RISK; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; SYMPTOMS; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; SYNCHRONY	Central auditory processing has been reported to be impaired in schizophrenia patients who experience auditory hallucinations, and interhemispheric transfer in auditory circuits may be compromised. In this study, we used EEG spectral coherence to examine interhemispheric connectivity between cortical areas known to be important in the processing of auditory information. Coherence was compared across three subject groups: schizophrenia patients with a recent history of auditory hallucinations (AR), schizophrenia patients who did not experience auditory hallucinations (nonAH), and healthy controls (HC). Subjects listened to pure tone and word stimuli while EEG was recorded continuously. Upper alpha and upper beta band coherence was calculated from six pairs of electrodes located over homologous auditory areas in the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant between-group differences were found on four electrode pairs (C3-C4, C5-C6, Ft7-Ft8 and Cp5-Cp6) in the upper alpha band. Relative to both the HC and nonAH groups, coherence was lower in the AH patients, consistent with the hypothesis that interhemispheric connectivity is reduced in these patients.

Investigation of Features of EEG Changes at Psychomotor Disturbanses Associated with Microsleep	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						microsleep with open eyes; EEG spectrum; PGO-waves; transmission of visual information	REM-SLEEP; BETA-ACTIVITY; POWER; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; WAVES; NREM	We tested our earlier suggested hypothesis that one of mechanisms for failures of performance of behavioural tasks during microsleep is a spontaneous generation of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves that suppress transmission of visual information from the retina via lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual cortical areas and the striatum, and therefore significantly impair visual perception and attention. Experiments were done during the nighttime. Monotonic testing during performance of the two-alternative psychomotor test invoked participants into a state defined as a microsleep with open eyes. For each participant we made a comparative analysis of intensity of EEG spectrum during state of microsleep with open eyes when failure in test performance occurred and during accurate performance in waking state. Following trends in changes of EEG spectrum were found: increase in intensity of low alpha-range, and decrease in intensity of high alpha- and beta-ranges Changes in theta-, low beta- and gamma-ranges were differently directed. Taking into account the known from the literature data these changes specify decrease in activation of primary visual cortical areas. Revealed data could support our hypothesis concerning mechanism of visual-motor disturbances during microsleep with open eyes.	[Tkachenko, O. N.; Lavrova, T. P.; Dorokhov, V. B.; Dementienko, V.

SLEEP			English	Article						Polysomnography; obstructive sleep apnea; computer-assisted signal processing; respiratory cycle-related EEG changes; RCREC; earplugs; snoring; sound	POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; EEG CHANGES; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; SLOW-WAVE; PREDICT SLEEPINESS; HEARING-AIDS; QUANTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES	Study Objectives: Respiratory cycle-related electroencephalographic (EEG) changes (RCREC), especially in delta and sigma frequencies, are thought to reflect subtle, breath-to-breath inspiratory microarousals that are exacerbated in association with increased work of breathing in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We wondered whether snoring sounds could create these microarousals, and investigated whether earplugs, anticipated to alter snoring perception, might affect RCREC. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: An accredited, academic sleep laboratory. Patients: Adults (n = 400) referred for suspected OSA. Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to use earplugs or not during a night of diagnostic polysomnography. Results: Two hundred three of the participants were randomized to use earplugs. Earplug use was associated with lower RCREC in delta EEG frequencies (0.5-4.5 Hz), although not in other frequencies, after controlling for potential confounds (P = 0.048). This effect of earplug use was larger among men in comparison with women (interaction term P = 0.046), and possibly among nonobese subjects in comparison with obese subjects (P = 0.081). However, the effect of earplug use on delta RCREC did not differ significantly based on apnea severity or snoring prominence as rated by sleep technologists (P > 0.10 for each). Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial is the first study to show that perception of snoring sounds, as modulated by earplugs, can influence the cortical EEG during sleep. However, the small magnitude of effect, lack of effect on RCREC in EEG frequencies other than delta, and absence of effect modulation by apnea severity or snoring prominence suggest that perception of snoring is not the main explanation for RCREC.

It could underperform when it is exposed to an input whose frequency band is too broad that many interfering frequency components are contained. These drawbacks are closely related to the nature of CSP filters which are based on completely spatial weighting. That is, CSP has no control on the temporal space of brain signals. This work is one attempt to extend CSP by eliminating the undesirable temporal components through spectral filtering. The proposed method in this work retains the simplicity of CSP but derives a number of complex spatial and spectral integrated filters by applying multiple time lags and a regularization term. These filters are data-driven and channel-specific. Their ability to narrow the frequency band of signals so as to enhance feature extraction is demonstrated using a public available dataset, where 4.7% higher mean classification accuracy is achieved.

Physiological responses to low atmospheric pressure stunning and the implications for welfare	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; low atmospheric pressure; poultry; welfare; stunning	BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; BROILERS; HALOTHANE; FREQUENCY; HENS	In low atmospheric pressure stunning (LAPS), poultry are rendered unconscious before slaughter by gradually reducing oxygen tension in the atmosphere to achieve a progressive anoxia. The effects of LAPS are not instantaneous, so there are legitimate welfare concerns around the experience of birds before loss of consciousness. Using self-contained telemetry logging units, high-quality continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings were obtained from 28 broiler chickens during exposure to LAPS in a commercial poultry processing plant. Application of LAPS was associated with changes in the EEG pattern in the form of increases in total power, decreases in mean frequency, and in particular, increases in slow-wave (delta) activity, indicating a gradual loss of consciousness. Increased delta wave activity was seen within 10 s of LAPS onset and consistently thereafter, peaking at 30 s into LAPS at which point the EEG signal shared characteristics with that of birds in a surgical plane of anesthesia. During LAPS, heart rate consistently decreased, with more pronounced bradycardia and arrhythmia observed after 30 s. No heart rate increases were observed in the period when the birds were potentially conscious. After an initial quiescent period, brief body movements (presumed to be ataxia/loss of posture) were seen on average at 39 s into the LAPS process. Later (after 120 s on average), artifacts related to clonic (wing flapping) and tonic (muscle spasms) convulsions were observed in the EKG recordings. Based on EEG analysis and body movement responses, a conservative estimate of time to loss of consciousness is approximately 40 s. The lack of behavioral responses indicating aversion or escape and absence of heart rate elevation in the conscious period strongly suggest that birds do not find LAPS induction distressing. Collectively, the results suggest that LAPS is a humane approach that has the potential to improve the welfare of poultry at slaughter by gradually inducing unconsciousness without distress, eliminating live shackling and ensuring every bird is adequately stunned before exansguination.

We used 13 male homozygous Scn1a-N1417H mutant rats (F344/NSlc-Scn1a(Kyo811)) and 10 wild-type control rats. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were induced in all mutant rats, and HFOs with frequencies ranging from 200 to 400 Hz were found to precede spikes during the clonic phases of these seizures in the ictal EEGs. The proportion of all spikes in each seizure that were associated with HFOs increased with age. In time-frequency spectra of the EEG data, the HFOs had a mean peak frequency of 301.1 +/- 65.4 Hz (range: 156.3-468.8 Hz) and a mean peak power of 24.6 +/- 3.8 dB (range: 11.4-33.4 dB); the peak power increased with age. Regarding the wild-type rats, a brief seizure without unmistakable HFOs was exceptionally induced in only one rat. The generation mechanism of febrile seizures is still an unanswered question. The detection of HFOs from the ictal EEGs of hyperthermia-induced seizures may provide a cue to answering this open question, although in this research we were unable to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the generation of HFOs depended on the mutation.

Stimulation must affect differently brain networks in sleep versus wake, but these differences have yet to be quantified. We recorded cortical activity in stage 2 (SII) sleep and wake using EEG while a tone was intermittently played. Zero-lag correlation measured input to pairs of sensors in the network; cross-correlation and phase-lag index measured pairwise corticocortical connectivity. Our analysis revealed that under baseline conditions, the cortical network, in particular the central regions of the frontoparietal cortex, interact at a characteristic latency of 50ms, but only during wake, not sleep. Nonsalient auditory stimulation causes far greater perturbation of connectivity from baseline in sleep than wake, both in the response to common input and corticocortical connectivity. The findings have key implications for sensory processing.

Self-focused emotion regulation (ER) strategies have been linked to the development and persistence of anxiety and depression. A vast array of research has provided valuable knowledge about the neural correlates of the use of specific self-focused ER strategies; however, the resting neural correlates of cognitive ER styles, which reflect an individual's disposition to engage in different forms of ER in order to manage distress, are largely unknown. In this study, associations between theoretically negative ER style (self-focused or not) and the complexity (fractal dimension, FD) of the resting EEG at frontal, central, parietal, and occipital regions were investigated in 58 healthy volunteers. The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used as the self-report measure of ER style. Results showed that a diminished FD over the scalp significantly correlated with self-focused ER style scores, even after controlling for negative affect, which has been also considered to influence the use of ER strategies. The lower the EEG FD, the higher were the self-focused ER style scores. Correlational analyses of specific self-focused ER strategies showed that self-blaming and rumination were negatively associated with diminished FD of the EEG, but catastrophizing and blaming others were not. No significant correlations were found for ER strategies more focused on situation or others. Results are discussed within the self-organized criticality theory of brain dynamics: The diminished FD of the EEG may reflect a disposition to engage in self-focused ER strategies as people prone to ruminate and self-blame show a less complex resting EEG activity, which may make it more difficult for them to exit their negative emotional state.

We monitored resting-state activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) both before and after a verbal recognition task. We show a strong positive correlation between accuracy in verbal recognition and pre-task resting-state alpha power at posterior sites. We further characterized this effect by examining resting-state post-task activity. We found marked alterations in resting-state alpha power when comparing pre- and post-task periods, with more pronounced alterations in participants that attained higher task accuracy.

The whole study is based upon experiments showing that biological neural networks may operate in the vicinity of the critical point and that the balance between excitation and inhibition in the human brain is important for the transfer of information. This paper is devoted to the study of EEG power spectrum which can be described best by a power function with 1/f(lambda) distribution and colored noise corresponding to the critical point in the EEG signal has the value of lambda = 1 (purple noise). The slow accumulation of energy and its quick release is a universal property of the 1/f distribution. The physiological mechanism causing energy dissipation in the brain seems to depend on the number and strength of the connections between clusters of neurons. With ageing, the number of connections between the neurons decreases. Learning ability and intellectual performance also decrease. Therefore, age-related changes in the lambda coefficient can be anticipated. We found that absolute values of lambda coefficients decrease significantly with increasing age. Deviations from this rule are related to age-dependent slowing of the dominant frequency in the alpha band. Age-dependent change in the parameter and colored noise may be indicative of age-related changes in the self-organization of brain activity. Results obtained include (i) the age-dependent decrease of the absolute values of the average lambda coefficient with the regression coefficient 0.005 1/year, (ii) distribution of lambda value changes related to EEG frequency bands and to localization of electrodes on the scalp, and (iii) relation of age-dependent changes of colored noise and EEG energy in separate frequency bands.

However, whether differences exist according to the type of epilepsy is largely unknown. We performed a comparative assessment of the impact of removing HFO-generating tissue on surgical outcome between temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). We also assessed the relationship between the extent of surgical resection and surgical outcome. Methods We studied 30 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 21 with TLE and 9 with ETLE. Two thirds of the patients were included in a previous report and for these, clinical and imaging data were updated and follow-up was extended. All patients underwent iEEG investigations (500Hz high-pass filter and 2,000Hz sampling rate), surgical resection, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HFOs (ripples, 80250Hz; fast ripples, >250Hz) were identified visually on a 510min interictal iEEG sample. HFO rates inside versus outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), in resected versus nonresected tissue, and their association with surgical outcome (ILAE classification) were assessed in the entire cohort, and in the TLE and ETLE subgroups. We also tested the correlation of resected brain hippocampal and amygdala volumes (as measured on postoperative MRIs) with surgical outcome. Key Findings HFO rates were significantly higher inside the SOZ than outside in the entire cohort and TLE subgroup, but not in the ETLE subgroup. In all groups, HFO rates did not differ significantly between resected and nonresected tissue. Surgical outcome was better when higher HFO rates were included in the surgical resection in the entire cohort and TLE subgroup, but not in the ETLE subgroup. Resected brain hippocampal and amygdala volumes were not correlated with surgical outcome. Significance In TLE, removal of HFO-generating areas may lead to improved surgical outcome. Less consistent findings emerge from ETLE, but these may be related to sample size limitations of this study. Size of resection, a factor that was ignored and that could have affected results of earlier studies did not influence results.

The MI features used are measures of phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) between frequency sub-bands. We used complex wavelet transforms to extract six spectral sub-bands within the 3-60 Hz range from LFP and EEG signals. Using the method of canonical correlation, we show that weighted combinations of the MI features in LFP or EEG signals correlate significantly with individual and composite scores on a scale for parkinsonian disability.

They are a hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are grouped by the sleep slow oscillation. Spindles are not a unitary phenomenon but are differentiated by oscillatory frequency and topography. Yet, it is still a matter of debate whether these differences relate to different generating mechanisms. As corticothalamic networks are known to be involved in the generation of spindles and the slow oscillation, with Ca2+ and Na+ conductances playing crucial roles, we employed the actions of carbamazepine and flunarizine to reduce the efficacy of Na+ and Ca2+ channels, respectively, for probing in healthy human subjects mechanisms of corticothalamocortical excitability. Design: For each pharmacologic substance a within-design study was conducted on 2 experimental nights in young, healthy adults. Measurements and Results: Results indicate differential effects for slow frontocortical (approximately 10 Hz) and fast centroparietal (approximately 14 Hz) spindles. Carbamazepine enhanced slow frontal spindle activity conjointly with an increment in slow oscillation power (approximately 0.75 Hz) during deep NREM sleep. In contrast, fast centroparietal spindle activity (approximately 14 Hz) was decreased by carbamazepine. Flunarizine also decreased fast-spindle electroencephalogram power, but affected neither slow frontal spindle nor slow oscillation frequency bands. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a differential pharmacologic response of the two types of sleep spindles and underscore a close linkage of the generating mechanisms underlying the sleep slow oscillation and the slow frontal sleep spindles for the signal transmission processes manipulated in the current study.

Treatment for all these problems requires accurate analysis of the sleep stages and patterns in the polysomno graphic signals collected in overnight recording over several months. However, manual sleep staging is a repetitive and time-consuming process as marking one typical eight hours overnight polysomnographic recording can take up to two hours to complete. Due to increased processing capabilities, it is now possible to automate this process and assist the sleep expert. A large number of algorithms have been proposed during the last few decades. This review article presents an overview of the existing automatic sleep staging methods, discusses the different challenges and proposes future prospects for new research opportunities.

It has been hypothesized that this effect is not limited to the stimulated region but involves subcortical and distant cortical areas. Methods: We applied single pulse TMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) of healthy subjects to interfere the cortical oscillatory activity recorded by simultaneous EEG and calculated the cortico-cortical coherence and power in the alpha and beta band. To study the structural substrate of the functional connectivity we performed diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy analysis (FA). To capture the pathways involved we applied probabilistic tractography to reconstruct the entire network. Results: Suprathreshold TMS of M1 induced a consistent enhancement of interhemispheric cortico-cortical alpha band coherence that lasted ca. 175 ms. after the pulse has been applied. The changes were confined to the interhemispheric central EEG electrodes (i.e. C3-C4). There were no consistent changes in the beta band. Power analysis revealed a longer lasting increase in the beta band after TMS pulses. A cluster in the contralateral thalamus showed a linear relationship between regional FA and TMS induced change in alpha band coherence. Probabilistic tractography presents the transcallosal and the contralateral thalamocortical pathways as essential for the observed oscillatory synchronisation. Conclusion: TMS induces an enhancement of oscillatory interaction between corresponding central regions of both hemispheres in the alpha band. The contralateral thalamus, transcallosal fibres and the contralateral thalamocortical pathways may constitute critical brain structures mediating the TMS induced change in oscillatory coupling.

A better understanding of this collective activity is integral to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In contrast to reductionist analyses, which focus solely on small-scale characteristics of ictogenesis, here we follow a systems-level approach, which combines both small-scale and larger-scale analyses. Peri-ictal dynamics of epileptic networks are assessed by studying correlation within and between different spatial scales of intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (iEEG) of a heterogeneous group of patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Epileptiform activity as recorded by a single iEEG electrode is determined objectively by the signal derivative and then subjected to a multivariate analysis of correlation between all iEEG channels. We find that during seizure, synchrony increases on the smallest and largest spatial scales probed by iEEG. In addition, a dynamic reorganization of spatial correlation is observed on intermediate scales, which persists after seizure termination. It is proposed that this reorganization may indicate a balancing mechanism that decreases high local correlation. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that during epileptic seizures hypercorrelated and therefore functionally segregated brain areas are re-integrated into more collective brain dynamics. In addition, except for a special sub-group, a highly significant association is found between the location of ictal iEEG activity and the location of areas of relative decrease of localised EEG correlation. The latter could serve as a clinically important quantitative marker of the seizure onset zone (SOZ).

Methods: Eyes-closed resting-state EEGs of 36 MA abusers and 36 age-matched healthy subjects were recorded using a 32-channel system. The EEGs (1-60 Hz), after removing artifacts, were decomposed into the conventional EEG bands. Using visibility graph similarity (VGS) and coherence methods, the VGS and coherence matrices in each EEG band were constructed. Then the Small-World Network properties, clustering coefficient (C), mean path length (L) and C/L, of the VGS and coherence matrices, were computed in all EEG bands. Then using the Mann-Whitney test and an artificial neural network the differences of C, L and C/L between the two groups were evaluated. Results: The MA abusers showed higher C, lower L and higher C/L at the gamma band (p-value <0.005). An accuracy of 82.8% in discriminating the two groups was obtained by the classifier. Conclusions: The topology of the functional brain connectivity is disrupted in MA abusers, as depicted by deviation from Small-Worldness in the gamma band. Significance: This is the first but quasi-experimental study showing disrupted topology of the functional brain networks in MA abusers. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

It is starting to be used in presurgical examination to better plan surgical resection and to improve outcome of epilepsy surgery. Development of new techniques of unsupervised HFOs detection is required to further investigate the role of HFO in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to increase the yield of presurgical examination. In this study we applied an envelope distribution modelling technique on experimental and human invasive data to detect HFOs. Application to experimental microelectrode recordings demonstrated satisfactory results with sensitivity 89.9% and false positive rate 2.1 per minute. Application of this algorithm to human invasive recordings achieved sensitivity 80%. High numbers of false positive detections required utilization of post-processing steps to eliminate the majority of them. This study shows that envelope distribution modelling represents a promising approach to detect HFOs in intracranial recordings. Advantages of this approach are quick adjustments to changes in background activity and resistance to signal non-stationarities. However, successful application to clinical practice requires development of secondary processing steps that will decrease the rate of false positive detections.

One of the main obstacles is the poor predictive validity of our preclinical animal models. In the present study the effects of the gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat was evaluated in preclinical in vivo electrophysiological models. Recently disclosed Phase III findings on semagacestat indicated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on this drug showed significantly worsened cognitive function compared to those treated with placebo. Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonists, and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of semagacestat in this assay. Field potentials were recorded across the hippocampal formation with NeuroNexus multi-site silicon probes in urethane anesthetized male C57BL/6 mice; hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Sub-chronic administration of semagacestat twice daily over 12 days at a dose known to reduce beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) level [100 mg/kg, p.o. (per oral)] diminished power of elicited hippocampal theta oscillation. Acute, subcutaneous administration of semagacestat (100 mg/kg) produced a similar effect on hippocampal activity. We propose that the disruptive effect of semagacestat on hippocampal function could be one of the contributing mechanisms to its worsening of cognition in patients with AD. As it has been expected, both acute and sub-chronic administrations of semagacestat significantly decreased A beta 40 and A beta 42 levels but the current findings do not reveal the mode of action of semagacestat in disrupting hippocampal oscillation.

Prestimulus delta and theta determinants of ERP responses in the Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP; ERP genesis; Delta; Theta; Auditory Go/NoGo; Cognitive processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VERTEX RESPONSE; P300; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY	Ongoing low-frequency EEG activity has long been associated with ERP components and their cognitive processing interpretations, yet few studies have directly investigated the prestimulus low-frequency EEG-ERP relationships, particularly within the auditory domain. The present study assessed the delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) bands individually, and their prestimulus influence on five subsequent components (P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3) within an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm. At the nine central sites, accepted trials were sorted according to their ascending vertex prestimulus spectral band amplitude, and ERPs were derived from the upper and lower sorted thirds. The within-subjects analyses included amplitudes and latencies for both Go and NoGo responses, and Go response speed. Only component amplitudes showed effects of high/low prestimulus EEG level. Delta globally modulated the five components - all amplitudes were more positive with high prestimulus delta, regardless of stimulus condition. Theta did not influence P1, but inversely modulated P2 and P3 regionally, and produced stimulus-specific effects in N1, N2, and P3. Low prestimulus theta produced greater NoGo N2 and Go P3, and reduced NoGo P3 responses, each of these suggesting appropriately enhanced cognitive processing. Taken together, these effect patterns differentially implicate prestimulus delta and theta band activity in the determination of ERP component amplitudes and the cognitive processing associated with them.

Exercise and DHA prevent the negative effects of hypoxia on EEG and nerve conduction velocity. High Alt Med Biol 14:360-366, 2013.It is known that hypoxia has a negative effect on nervous system functions, but exercise and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) have positive effect. In this study, it was investigated whether exercise and/or DHA can prevent the effects of hypoxia on EEG and nerve conduction velocity (NCV). 35 adult Wistar albino male rats were divided into five groups (n=7): control (C), hypoxia (H), hypoxia and exercise (HE), hypoxia and DHA (HD), and hypoxia and exercise and DHA (HED) groups. During the 28-day hypoxia exposure, the HE and HED groups of rats were exercised (0% incline, 30m/min speed, 20min/day, 5 days a week). In addition, DHA (36mg/kg/day) was given by oral gavage to rats in the HD and HED groups. While EEG records were taken before and after the experimental period, NCV records were taken after the experimental period from anesthetized rats. Data were analyzed by paired t-test, one-way ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey test. In this study, it was shown that exposure to hypoxia decreased theta activity and NCV, but exercise and DHA reduced the delta activity, while theta, alpha, beta activities, and NCV were increased. These results have shown that the effects of hypoxia exposure on EEG and NCV can be prevented by exercise and/or DHA.

A multimodal perspective on the composition of cortical oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor cortex; magnetoencephalography; local field potential; oscillation; gamma-aminobutyric acid; beta rhythm; mu rhythm; BOLD FMRI	MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; GABA CONCENTRATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; FMRI; MEG; BOLD; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS	An expanding corpus of research details the relationship between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures and neuronal network oscillations. Typically, integrated electroencephalography and fMRI, or parallel magnetoencephalography (MEG) and fMRI are used to draw inference about the consanguinity of BOLD and electrical measurements. However, there is a relative dearth of information about the relationship between E/MEG and the focal networks from which these signals emanate. Consequently, the genesis and composition of E/MEG oscillations requires further clarification. Here we aim to contribute to understanding through a series of parallel measurements of primary motor cortex (M1) oscillations, using human MEG and in vitro rodent local field potentials. We compare spontaneous activity in the similar to 10 Hz mu and 15-30 Hz beta frequency ranges and compare MEG signals with independent and integrated layers III and V (LIII/LV) from in vitro recordings. We explore the mechanisms of oscillatory generation, using specific pharmacological modulation with the GABA-A alpha-1 subunit modulator zolpidem. Finally, to determine the contribution of cortico-cortical connectivity, we recorded in vitro M1, during an incision to sever lateral connections between M1 and S1 cortices. We demonstrate that frequency distribution of MEG signals appear have closer statistically similarity with signals from integrated rather than independent LIII/LV laminae. GABAergic modulation in both modalities elicited comparable changes in the power of the beta band. Finally, cortico-cortical connectivity in sensorimotor cortex (SMC) appears to directly influence the power of the mu rhythm in LIII. These findings suggest that the MEG signal is an amalgam of outputs from LIII and LV, that multiple frequencies can arise from the same cortical area and that in vitro and MEG M1 oscillations are driven by comparable mechanisms. Finally, cortico-cortical connectivity is reflected in the power of the SMC mu rhythm.

EEGs were recorded from 10 healthy adults during the Sternberg tasks in which memory items were presented simultaneously and successively. EEG power and suppression time (ST) in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) were computed for the memory maintenance and retrieval phases. The alpha activity differed according to the presentation mode during the maintenance phase but not during the retrieval phase. Results indicated that parietal alpha power recorded during the maintenance phase did not reflect the memory load alone. In contrast, ST during the retrieval phase increased with the memory load for both presentation modes, indicating a serial memory scanning process, regardless of the presentation mode. These results indicate that there was a dynamic transition in the memory process from the maintenance phase, which was sensitive to external factors, toward the retrieval phase, during which the process converged on the sequential scanning process, the Sternberg task essentially required.

J	Shearkhani, O; Takehara-Nishiuchi, K				Shearkhani, Omid; Takehara-Nishiuchi, Kaori			Coupling of prefrontal gamma amplitude and theta phase is strengthened in trace eyeblink conditioning	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						EEG; Entorhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Medial prefrontal cortex; Cross-frequency coupling; Associative memory	CORTICOPONTINE SYSTEM; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCES HIPPOCAMPAL; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; LEARNING RATE; MEMORY; ACQUISITION; CONTINGENT; LESIONS; ORGANIZATION	Trace eyeblink conditioning requires animals to associate a neutral stimulus (CS) and an aversive periorbital shock (US) that occurred moment later. Acquisition in this conditioning depends on several forebrain regions including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal, and entorhinal cortices in addition to the cerebellum. Activities of single and population neurons in these regions show several patterns of change with the conditioning. For example, the power and synchronization of theta oscillations are correlated with the rate of acquisition. Yet, little is known about how neuronal oscillations at other frequency bands change with the conditioning. The present study examined changes in gamma oscillations, which are typically associated with spiking activity of individual cells. We found that after CS offset the power of gamma oscillations at 35-45 Hz fluctuated at about 7 Hz. This rhythmic fluctuation of gamma power was observed in all three regions and locked to local theta oscillations at 4-8 Hz. Furthermore, over the course of 10 days of acquisition sessions, the coupling of gamma power and theta phase became stronger in the medial prefrontal cortex while it did not change in the hippocampus or lateral entorhinal cortex. Neither theta nor gamma power in any of the regions significantly changed across sessions, rejecting a possibility that the observed increase in prefrontal theta-gamma coupling was secondary to an increase in theta or gamma power. The theta-gamma coupling between different regions did not significantly change across sessions. These results suggest that prefrontal gamma oscillations become more effectively coordinated with concurrent theta oscillations in trace eyeblink conditioning. This may result in a stronger impact of prefrontal neuronal firing responses to the CS on the processing in down-stream regions, such as the lateral entorhinal cortex and/or pontine nuclei.

Methods: We analyzed stereo-EEG (SEEG) recordings from 20 patients with medically intractable partial seizures (10 temporal/10 extratemporal). Independently using simple visual assessment and automated detection of HFO, we identified the depth electrode contacts with maximum occurrences of ripples (R) and fast ripples (FR). The SOZ was determined by independent visual identification in standard SEEG recordings, and the congruence of results from visual versus automated HFO detection was compared. Results: Automated detection of HFO correctly identified the SOZ in 14 (R)/10 (FR) out of 20 subjects; a simple visual assessment of SEEG recordings in the appropriate frequency ranges correctly identified the SOZ in 13 (R)/9 (FR) subjects. Conclusions: Simple visual assessment of SEEG traces and standard automated detection of HFO seem to contribute comparably to the identification of the SOZ in patients with focal epilepsies. When using macroelectrodes in neocortical extratemporal epilepsies, the SOZ might be better determined by the ripple range. Significance: Standard automated detection of HFO enables the evaluation of HFO characteristics in whole data.

Transcranial Electrical Stimulation Accelerates Human Sleep Homeostasis	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							MECHANISMS; TDCS	The sleeping brain exhibits characteristic slow-wave activity which decays over the course of the night. This decay is thought to result from homeostatic synaptic downscaling. Transcranial electrical stimulation can entrain slow-wave oscillations (SWO) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG). A computational model of the underlying mechanism predicts that firing rates are predominantly increased during stimulation. Assuming that synaptic homeostasis is driven by average firing rates, we expected an acceleration of synaptic downscaling during stimulation, which is compensated by a reduced drive after stimulation. We show that 25 minutes of transcranial electrical stimulation, as predicted, reduced the decay of SWO in the remainder of the night. Anatomically accurate simulations of the field intensities on human cortex precisely matched the effect size in different EEG electrodes. Together these results suggest a mechanistic link between electrical stimulation and accelerated synaptic homeostasis in human sleep.

This study proposed a therapy from complementary and alternative medicine to treat mental disorder by through interactions of five senses between therapist and patient. In this method sounding a certain six voices play an important role in healing and recovery. By applying chaos theory, we investigated time series of six vocal sounds consisted of six syllables that have been used in the therapy. On the basis of the reconstructed phase space trajectory for the subject's voices, we found chaos features in the six vocal sounds with correlation dimension of D2=3.02 +/- 0.8. Further, we studied the effect of spoken six voices on human status. A measure from RQA, diagonal length Lmax, was computed for the records of start and end of voices during consecutively spoken the voices lasting 1min long. The mean value of Lmax increased from 6.4 to 7.9, giving nearly 20% increase in the end of voice in relate to start. Wilcoxon test showed the significant changes in Lmax with p =0.019. Our results implied that the six vocal sounds induce a decrease of divergence in pulsation waves, leading to a formation of order out of chaos in human body. The proposed five sense therapy is a noninvasive intervention that can be used to reduce anxiety levels and improvement of mental health. First, we studied effects of speaking using scalp- EEG measurement. Chaos analysis of EEG showed a largely enhanced largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) during the speaking. In addition, EEG power spectrum showed an increase over most frequencies. Second, we performed case studies on mental disorder using the therapy. Running power spectrum of EEG of patients indicated decreasing power at end of treatment, implying five senses therapy induced relaxed and lowered energy in central neural system. The results agreed with patient's reports that there were considerable decline in anxiety and improvements in mood.

This study aimed to identify the factors that influence BTH in patients with mTLE in order to minimize the significant factor(s) prior to performing a FDG-PET brain scan. Forty patients with uni-lateral mTLE who underwent F-18-FDG PET scan for presurgical epilepsy workup were included. Bilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism of the anterior and medial parts of the temporal lobe was identified by a semiquantitative visual scale. Lateralization of TLE was identified by either intracranial EEG (22/40 cases) and/or improvement of seizure 2 years after temporal lobectomy (37/40 cases). The factors analyzed included basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, occupation, years of education, and handedness), history related to seizure (age at epilepsy onset and epilepsy duration, history of febrile seizure and head injury, frequency of seizurewith impaired cognition in the last 3 months, presence of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure, automatism side, presence of postictal confusion, and side of MRI temporal abnormality), information during video-EEG monitoring (clinical lateralization, interictal scalp EEG lateralization (interictal epileptiform discharge), and ictal scalp EEG lateralization), and information during the FDG-PET study (duration from the last seizure (<= 2 days or >2 days), last seizure type, and the presence of slow waves or sharp waves during the FDG uptake period). Significant factors related to BTH were analyzed using multivariate analysis. Only the <= 2-day duration from the last seizure to the PET scan shows a significant effect (p = 0.021) on BTH finding with 15 times greater incidence compared to a duration >2 days. Bilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism, which causes conflict in lateralizing the epileptogenic zone in temporal lobe epilepsy, can be avoided by performing PET scan more than 2 days after the last seizure.

We performed follow-up recordings of spontaneous brain oscillations with whole-head MEG in 16 patients with first-ever stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory, affecting upper limb motor function, 1-7 days (T-0), 1 month (T-1), and 3 months (T-2) after stroke, with concomitant clinical examination. Clinical test results improved significantly from T-0 to T-1 or T-2. During recovery (at T-1 and T-2), the strength of temporo-parietal similar to 10-Hz oscillations in the affected hemisphere (AH) was increased as compared with the unaffected hemisphere. Abnormal low-frequency magnetic activity (ALFMA) at similar to 1 Hz in the AH was detected in the perilesional cortex in seven patients at T-0. In four of these, ALFMA persisted at T-2. In patients with ALFMA, the lesion size was significantly larger than in the rest of the patients, and worse clinical outcome was observed in patients with persisting ALFMA. Our results indicate that temporo-parietal similar to 10-Hz oscillations are enhanced in the AH during recovery from stroke. Moreover, stroke causes ALFMA, which seems to persist in patients with worse clinical outcome.

However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function.

Besides a crucial role of oscillatory activity in the emergence of other neurological and psychiatric diseases, recent evidence indicates a key role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This review summarizes the current knowledge on pathological alterations of oscillatory brain activity in association with liver dysfunction and HE in the context of spontaneous brain activity, motor symptoms, sensory processing, and attention. The existing literature demonstrates a prominent slowing of the frequency of oscillatory activity as shown for spontaneous brain activity at rest, with respect to deficits of motor behavior and motor symptoms, and in the context of visual attention processes. The observed slowing extends across different subsystems of the brain and has been confirmed across different frequency bands, providing evidence for ubiquitous changes of oscillatory activity in HE. For example, the frequency of cortico-muscular coherence in HE patients appears at the frequency of the mini-asterixis (<= 12 Hz), while cirrhotics without overt signs of HE show coherence similar to healthy subjects, i.e. at 13-30 Hz. Interestingly, the so-called critical flicker frequency (CFF) as a measure of the processing of an oscillating visual stimulus has emerged as a useful tool to quantify HE disease severity, correlating with behavioral and neurophysiological alterations. Moreover, the CFF reliably distinguishes patients with manifest HE from cirrhotics without any signs of HE and healthy controls using a cut-off frequency of 39 Hz. In conclusion, oscillatory activity is globally slowed in HE in close association with HE symptoms and disease severity. Although the underlying causal mechanisms are not yet understood, these results indicate that pathological changes of oscillatory activity play an important role in the pathophysiology of HE.

Typically, in the human motor system, such cortical modulations are inferred through changes in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs). However, it is now possible to directly evaluate tDCS-induced changes at the cortical level by recording the transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials (TEPs) using electroencephalography (EEG). The present study investigated the modulation induced by the tDCS on the motor system. The study evaluates changes in the MEPs, in the amplitude and distribution of the TEPs, in resting state oscillatory brain activity and in behavioral performance in a simple manual response task. Both the short- and long-term tDCS effects were investigated by evaluating their time course at similar to 0 and 30 min after tDCS. Anodal tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (M1) induced an enhancement of corticospinal excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation produced a reduction. These changes in excitability were indexed by changes in MEP amplitude. More interestingly, tDCS modulated the cortical reactivity, which is the neuronal activity evoked by TMS, in a polarity-dependent and site-specific manner. Cortical reactivity increased after anodal stimulation over the left Ml, whereas it decreased with cathodal stimulation. These effects were partially present also at long term evaluation. No polarity-specific effect was found either on behavioral measures or on oscillatory brain activity. The latter showed a general increase in the power density of low frequency oscillations (theta and alpha) at both stimulation polarities. Our results suggest that tDCS is able to modulate motor cortical reactivity in a polarity-specific manner, inducing a complex pattern of direct and indirect cortical activations or inhibitions of the motor system-related network, which might be related to changes in synaptic efficacy of the motor cortex.

Intra- and Inter-Frequency Brain Network Structure in Health and Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; NEURAL MASS MODEL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ABNORMALITIES; ORGANIZATION; EEG; DYSFUNCTION	Empirical studies over the past two decades have provided support for the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by altered connectivity patterns in functional brain networks. These alterations have been proposed as genetically mediated diagnostic biomarkers and are thought to underlie altered cognitive functions such as working memory. However, the nature of this dysconnectivity remains far from understood. In this study, we perform an extensive analysis of functional connectivity patterns extracted from MEG data in 14 subjects with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls during a 2-back working memory task. We investigate uni-, bi- and multivariate properties of sensor time series by computing wavelet entropy of and correlation between time series, and by constructing binary networks of functional connectivity both within and between classical frequency bands (gamma, beta, alpha, and theta). Networks are based on the mutual information between wavelet time series, and estimated for each trial window separately, enabling us to consider both network topology and network dynamics. We observed significant decreases in time series entropy and significant increases in functional connectivity in the schizophrenia group in comparison to the healthy controls and identified an inverse relationship between these measures across both subjects and sensors that varied over frequency bands and was more pronounced in controls than in patients. The topological organization of connectivity was altered in schizophrenia specifically in high frequency c and b band networks as well as in the gamma-beta cross-frequency networks. Network topology varied over trials to a greater extent in patients than in controls, suggesting disease-associated alterations in dynamic network properties of brain function. Our results identify signatures of aberrant neurophysiological behavior in schizophrenia across uni-, bi- and multivariate scales and lay the groundwork for further clinical studies that might lead to the discovery of new intermediate phenotypes.

Methods to activate C-fibres selectively have been proposed, but are unreliable or difficult to implement. Here, we propose an approach combining a new laser stimulator to generate constant-temperature heat pulses with an adaptive paradigm to maintain stimulus temperature above the threshold of C-fibres but below that of A delta-fibres, and examine whether this approach can be used to record reliable C-fibre laser-evoked brain potentials. Brief CO2 laser stimuli were delivered to the hand and foot dorsum of 10 healthy subjects. The stimuli were generated using a closed-loop control of laser power by an online monitoring of target skin temperature. The adaptive algorithm, using reaction times to distinguish between late detections indicating selective activation of unmyelinated C-fibres and early detections indicating co-activation of myelinated A delta-fibres, allowed increasing the likelihood of selectively activating C-fibres. Reliable individual-level electroencephalogram (EEG) responses were identified, both in the time domain (hand: N2: 704 +/- 179 ms, P2: 984 +/- 149 ms; foot: N2: 1314 +/- 171 ms, P2: 1716 +/- 171 ms) and the time-frequency (TF) domain. Using a control dataset in which no stimuli were delivered, a Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis showed that the magnitude of the phase-locked EEG response corresponding to the N2-P2, objectively quantified in the TF domain, discriminated between absence vs presence of C-fibre responses with a high sensitivity (hand: 85%, foot: 80%) and specificity (hand: 90%, foot: 75%). This approach could thus be particularly useful for the diagnostic workup of small-fibre neuropathies and neuropathic pain.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most important signals in PSGs but recording and analysis of this signal presents a number of technical challenges, especially at home. Instead, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are much easier to record and may offer an attractive alternative for home sleep monitoring. The heart rate variability (HRV) signal proves suitable for automatic sleep staging. Thirty PSGs from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database were used. Three feature sets were extracted from 5- and 0.5-min HRV segments: time-domain features, nonlinear-dynamics features and time-frequency features. The latter was achieved by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. Normalized energies in important frequency bands of HRV signals were computed using time-frequency methods. ANOVA and t-test were used for statistical evaluations. Automatic sleep staging was based on HRV signal features. The ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni was used for individual feature assessment. Most features were beneficial for sleep staging. A t-test was used to compare the means of extracted features in 5- and 0.5-min HRV segments. The results showed that the extracted features means were statistically similar for a small number of features. A separability measure showed that time-frequency features, especially EMD features, had larger separation than others. There was not a sizable difference in separability of linear features between 5-and 0.5-min HRV segments but separability of nonlinear features, especially EMD features, decreased in 0.5-min HRV segments. HRV signal features were classified by linear discriminant (LD) and quadratic discriminant (QD) methods. Classification results based on features from 5-min segments surpassed those obtained from 0.5-min segments. The best result was obtained from features using 5-min HRV segments classified by the LD classifier. A combination of linear/nonlinear features from HRV signals is effective in automatic sleep staging. Moreover, time-frequency features are more informative than others. In addition, a separability measure and classification results showed that HRV signal features, especially nonlinear features, extracted from 5-min segments are more discriminative than those from 0.5-min segments in automatic sleep staging.

The objective is to study and evaluate the information flow activity at different frequencies in the primary motor cortex. We employed Granger causality for capturing the future state of the propagation path and direction between recording electrode sites on the cerebral cortex. A grid covered the right motor cortex completely due to its size (approx. 8 cm x 8 cm) but grid area extends to the surrounding cortex areas. During the experiment, a subject was asked to imagine performing two activities: movement of the left small finger and/or movement of the tongue. The time series of the electrical brain activity was recorded during these trials using an 8 x 8 (0.016-300 Hz band with) ECoG platinum electrode grid, which was placed on the contralateral (right) motor cortex. For detection of information flow activity and communication frequencies among the electrodes, we have proposed a method based on following steps: (i) calculation of analytical time series such as amplitude and phase difference acquired from Hilbert transformation, (ii) selection of frequency having highest interdependence for the electrode pairs for the concerned time series over a sliding window in which we assumed time series were stationary, (iii) calculation of Granger causality values for each pair with selected frequency. The information flow (causal influence) activity and communication frequencies between the electrodes in grid were determined and shown successfully. It is supposed that information flow activity and communication frequencies between the electrodes in the grid are approximately the same for the same pattern. The successful employment of Granger causality and Hilbert transformation for the detection of the propagation path and direction of each component of ECoG among different subcortex areas were capable of determining the information flow (causal influence) activity and communication frequencies between the populations of neurons successfully.

A point process approach to identifying and tracking transitions in neural spiking dynamics in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's patients	CHAOS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; REFRACTORY PERIOD; WORKING-MEMORY; POWER SPECTRUM; PHASE-LOCKING; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SYNCHRONY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEPENDENCE	Understanding the role of rhythmic dynamics in normal and diseased brain function is an important area of research in neural electrophysiology. Identifying and tracking changes in rhythms associated with spike trains present an additional challenge, because standard approaches for continuous-valued neural recordings-such as local field potential, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography data-require assumptions that do not typically hold for point process data. Additionally, subtle changes in the history dependent structure of a spike train have been shown to lead to robust changes in rhythmic firing patterns. Here, we propose a point process modeling framework to characterize the rhythmic spiking dynamics in spike trains, test for statistically significant changes to those dynamics, and track the temporal evolution of such changes. We first construct a two-state point process model incorporating spiking history and develop a likelihood ratio test to detect changes in the firing structure. We then apply adaptive state-space filters and smoothers to track these changes through time. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study as well as with experimental data recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's patients performing an arm movement task. Our analyses show that during the arm movement task, neurons underwent a complex pattern of modulation of spiking intensity characterized initially by a release of inhibitory control at 20-40 ms after a spike, followed by a decrease in excitatory influence at 40-60 ms after a spike.

EEG upper/low alpha frequency power ratio relates to temporo-parietal brain atrophy and memory performances in mild cognitive impairment	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; brain rhythms; cortical atrophy; MRI; MCI-diagnosis	ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; THETA OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; VASCULAR DAMAGE; FIELD-STRENGTH; DISEASE; PRECUNEUS; STATE; MRI	Objective: Temporo-parietal cortex thinning is associated to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD). The increase of EEG upper/low alpha power ratio has been associated with AD-converter MCI subjects. We investigated the association of alpha3/alpha2 ratio with patterns of cortical thickness in MCI. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and high resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Alpha3/alpha2 power ratio as well as cortical thickness was computed for each subject. Three MCI groups were detected according to increasing tertile values of upper/low alpha power ratio. Difference of cortical thickness among the groups was estimated. Pearson's r was used to assess the topography of the correlation between cortical thinning and memory impairment. Results: High upper/low alpha power ratio group had total cortical gray matter volume reduction of 471 mm(2) than low upper/low alpha power ratio group (p < 0.001). Upper/low alpha group showed a similar but less marked pattern (160 mm(2)) of cortical thinning when compared to middle upper/low alpha power ratio group (p < 0.001). Moreover, high upper/low alpha group had wider cortical thinning than other groups, mapped to the Supramarginal and Precuneus bilaterally. Finally, in high upper/low alpha group temporo-parietal cortical thickness was correlated to memory performance. No significant cortical thickness differences was found between middle and low alpha3/alpha2 power ratio groups. Conclusion: High EEG upper/low alpha power ratio was associated with temporo-parietal cortical thinning and memory impairment in MCI subjects. The combination of EEG upper/low alpha ratio and cortical thickness measure could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for progression to AD dementia and may be of value in clinical context.

However, neurophysiological changes in a specific illumination state and their cognitive interpretation still remain unclear. Thereby, in the present study, the effect of different illumination conditions on the same cognitive performance was evaluated particularly by EEG wavelet analyses. During a sustained attention task, we observed that the higher illumination condition yielded significantly lower parietal tonic electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha activity before the presentation of the probe digit and longer reaction times, than that of the other illumination conditions. Although previous studies suggest that lower prestimulus EEG alpha activity is related to higher performance in an upcoming task, the reduced prestimulus alpha activity under higher illumination was associated with delayed reaction times in the present study. Presumably, the higher background illumination condition seems to be too bright for normal attentional processing and distracted participants' attention during a sustained attention task. Such a bottom up effect by stimulus salience seemed to overwhelm a prestimulus top-down effect reflected in prestimulus alpha power during the bright background condition. This finding might imply a dynamic competition between prestimulus top-down and poststimulus bottom up processes. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the illumination condition substantially modulates our attentional processing. Further refinement of the illumination parameters and subsequent exploration of cognitive-modulation are necessary to facilitate our cognitive performance. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Intrinsic variability in the human response to pain is assembled from multiple, dynamic brain processes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; EEG-fMRI; Single-trial; Functional connectivity; Default-mode network; Alpha power	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; FMRI; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; DEACTIVATION	The stimulus-evoked response is the principle measure used to elucidate the timing and spatial location of human brain activity. Brain and behavioural responses to pain are influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors and display considerable, natural trial-by-trial variability. However, because the neuronal sources of this variability are poorly understood the functional information it contains is under-exploited for understanding the relationship between brain function and behaviour. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI during rest and noxious thermal stimulation to characterise the relationship between natural fluctuations in behavioural pain-ratings, the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain network responses and intrinsic connectivity. We demonstrate that fMRI response variability in the pain network is: dependent upon its resting-state functional connectivity; modulated by behaviour; and correlated with EEG evoked-potential amplitude. The pre-stimulus default-mode network (DMN) fMRI signal predicts the subsequent magnitude of pain ratings, evoked-potentials and pain network BOLD responses. Additionally, the power of the ongoing EEG alpha oscillation, an index of cortical excitability, modulates the DMN fMRI response to pain. The complex interaction between alpha-power, DMN activity and both the behavioural report of pain and the brain's response to pain demonstrates the neurobiological significance of trial-by-trial variability. Furthermore, we show that multiple, interconnected factors contribute to both the brain's response to stimulation and the psychophysiological emergence of the subjective experience of pain.

Developmental dyslexia, a difficulty in acquiring efficient reading skills linked to difficulties with phonology (the sound structure of language), has been associated with behavioural entrainment deficits. It has been proposed that the phonological 'deficit' that characterises dyslexia across languages is related to impaired auditory entrainment to speech at lower frequencies via neuroelectric oscillations (<10 Hz, 'temporal sampling theory'). Impaired entrainment to temporal modulations at lower frequencies would affect the recovery of the prosodic and syllabic structure of speech. Here we investigated event-related oscillatory EEG activity and contingent negative variation (CNV) to auditory rhythmic tone streams delivered at frequencies within the delta band (2 Hz, 1.5 Hz), relevant to sampling stressed syllables in speech. Given prior behavioural entrainment findings at these rates, we predicted functionally atypical entrainment of delta oscillations in dyslexia. Participants performed a rhythmic expectancy task, detecting occasional white noise targets interspersed with tones occurring regularly at rates of 2 Hz or 1.5 Hz. Both groups showed significant entrainment of delta oscillations to the rhythmic stimulus stream, however the strength of inter-trial delta phase coherence (ITC, 'phase locking') and the CNV were both significantly weaker in dyslexics, suggestive of weaker entrainment and less preparatory brain activity. Both ITC strength and CNV amplitude were significantly related to individual differences in language processing and reading. Additionally, the instantaneous phase of prestimulus delta oscillation predicted behavioural responding (response time) for control participants only.

The main theories regarding alpha function posit either sensory processing or attention allocation as the main processes governing its modulation. Closing and opening eyes, a well-known manipulation of the alpha rhythm, could be regarded as attention allocation from inward to outward focus though during light is also accompanied by visual change. To disentangle the effects of attention allocation and sensory visual input on alpha modulation, 14 healthy subjects were asked to open and close their eyes during conditions of light and of complete darkness while simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI were acquired. Thus, during complete darkness the eyes-open condition is not related to visual input but only to attention allocation, allowing direct examination of its role in alpha modulation. A data-driven ridge regression classifier was applied to the EEG data in order to ascertain the contribution of the alpha rhythm to eyes-open/eyes-closed inference in both lighting conditions. Classifier results revealed significant alpha contribution during both light and dark conditions, suggesting that alpha rhythm modulation is closely linked to the change in the direction of attention regardless of the presence of visual sensory input. Furthermore, fMRI activation maps derived from an alpha modulation time-course during the complete darkness condition exhibited a right frontal cortical network associated with attention allocation. These findings support the importance of top-down processes such as attention allocation to alpha rhythm modulation, possibly as a prerequisite to its known bottom-up processing of sensory input.

Therapeutic advances rely on characterising interactions in this circuit. However, recording electrophysiological responses over the entire circuit is impractical. Dynamic causal modelling offers large-scale models of predictive value based on a limited or partial sampling of complex networks. Using dynamic causal modelling, we determined the network changes underlying the pathological excess of beta oscillations that characterise the Parkinsonian state. We modelled data from five patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation of more than one target. We found that connections to and from the subthalamic nucleus were strengthened and promoted beta synchrony, in the untreated compared to the treated Parkinsonian state. Dynamic causal modelling was able to replicate the effects of lesioning this nucleus and may provide a new means of directing the search for therapeutic targets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To calculate the instantaneous frequency of IMEs, an algorithm was developed using the Generalized Zero Crossing method. From the resulting frequencies, two different novel features were generated: the median instantaneous frequencies and the number of instantaneous frequency changes during a 30 s segment for seven IMEs. The sleep stage classification for the daytime sleep of 20 healthy babies was determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. The results were evaluated using the cross-validation method to achieve an approximately 90% accuracy and with new examinee data to achieve 80% average accuracy of classification. The obtained results were higher than the human experts' agreement and were statistically significant, which positioned the method, based on the proposed features, as an efficient procedure for automatic sleep stage classification. The uniqueness of this study arises from newly proposed features of the time-frequency domain, which bind characteristics of the sleep signals to the oscillation modes of brain activity, reflecting the physical characteristics of sleep, and thus have the potential to highlight the congruency of twin pairs with potential implications for the genetic determination of sleep.

A fast and reliable single-trial ERP detection method can be used to develop a BCI system with both high speed and high accuracy. However, most of single-trial ERP detection methods are developed for offline EEG analysis and thus have a high computational complexity and need manual operations. Therefore, they are not applicable to practical BCI systems, which require a low-complexity and automatic ERP detection method. This work presents a joint spatial-time-frequency filter that combines common spatial patterns (CSP) and wavelet filtering (WF) for improving the signal-to-noise (SNR) of visual evoked potentials (VEP), which can lead to a single-trial ERP-based BCI.

With the help of Hill's criteria, we have discussed how to establish causality in the context of the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. The strengths of EEG include the ability to determine the temporal relationship between cerebral activities and clinical events; thus, scalp video-EEG is necessary in the evaluation of the majority of surgical candidates. The presence of associated ictal discharges can confirm the epileptic nature of a particular spell and whether an observed neuroimaging abnormality is causally associated with the epileptic seizure. Conversely, one should be aware that scalp EEG has a limited spatial resolution and sometimes exhibits propagated epileptiform discharges more predominantly than in situ discharges generated at the seizure-onset zone. Intraoperative or extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) is utilized when noninvasive presurgical evaluation, including anatomical and functional neuroimaging, fails to determine the margin between the presumed epileptogenic zone and eloquent cortex. Retrospective as well as prospective studies have reported that complete resection of the seizure-onset zone on ECoG was associated with a better seizure outcome, but not all patients became seizure-free following such resective surgery. Some retrospective studies suggested that resection of sites showing high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at >80 Hz on interictal or ictal ECoG was associated with a better seizure outcome. Others reported that functionally-important areas may generate HFOs of a physiological nature during rest as well as sensorimotor and cognitive tasks. Resection of sites showing task-related augmentation of HFOs has been reported to indeed result in functional loss following surgery. Thus, some but not all sites showing interictal HFOs are causally associated with seizure generation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that some task-related HFOs can be transiently suppressed by the prior occurrence of interictal spikes. The significance of interictal HFOs should be assessed by taking into account the eloquent cortex, seizure-onset zone, and cortical lesions. Video-EEG and ECoG generally provide useful but still limited information to establish causality in presurgical evaluation. A comprehensive assessment of data derived from multiple modalities is ultimately required for successful management. (C) 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The ECoG data from 3 patients with epilepsy are analyzed in this study. A recently developed algorithm in graph theory, visibility graph (VG), is applied in this research. The approach is based on the key discovery that high-frequency oscillation takes place during epileptic seizure, making it a marker of epilepsy. Therefore, the nonlinear property of the high-frequency signal may be more noticeable. Hence, a complexity measure, called graph index complexity (GIC), is computed using the VG of the patients' high-frequency ECoG subband. After comparison and statistical analysis, the nonlinear feature is proved to be effective in detection and location of the epilepsy. Two different traditional complexities, sample entropy and Lempel-Ziv, were also calculated to make a comparison and prove that GIC provides better identification.

While there is a long and distinguished history of studying rhythms in nerve cells and neuronal networks in healthy organisms, the association and analysis of rhythms to diseases are more recent developments. Indeed, it is now thought that certain aspects of diseases of the nervous system, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and sleep disorders, are associated with transitions or disruptions of neurological rhythms. This focus issue brings together articles presenting modeling, computational, analytical, and experimental perspectives about rhythms and dynamic transitions between them that are associated to various diseases.

The ECG unit pattern concept was introduced to represent the standard RR interval, and our method extracted certain features from the unit patterns to classify by a primitive classifier. The proposed method was tested on two classification experiments by using ECG records in Physiobank databases and the results were compared to those from several previous studies. In the first experiment, an off-line classification was performed with unit patterns selected from long ECG segments. The method was also used to detect CHF by real-time ECG waveform analysis. In addition to demonstrating the success of the proposed method, the results showed that some unit patterns in a long ECG segment from a heart patient were more suggestive of disease than the others. These results indicate that the proposed approach merits additional research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The analysis focused on the assessment of referral patterns, healthcare utilization, time intervals and patient flow to determine surgical candidacy in children with MRE. The purpose of this systems analysis study was to identify rate limiting steps that may lead to delayed surgical candidacy decision and surgery. Methods: Prolonged video electroencephalography (vEEG) is the common entry point into the process for all potential epilepsy surgery candidates. Therefore, a single centre retrospective chart review of children and adolescents referred to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) for vEEG monitoring at the primary referral centre for paediatric epilepsy surgery in the province. Basic demographic and referral data were abstracted for all screened cases. Included cases were: (1) age <19 years old at time of first EMU admission, (2) date of EMU admission between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2006 and (3) referral for elective vEEG and/or overnight with vEEG greater than 8 h duration. Data were collected on number of seizure conferences, surgical candidacy, surgical outcomes (seizure free and seizure reduction), resource utilization, and recorded time stamps for each event to estimate system delays. Results: During the two-year period, 463 patients were referred to the EMU of whom 349 received prolonged vEEG (>8 h). Forty five percent (n = 160) of patients came to seizure conference for discussion of their data, of whom 40% (64/160) were considered surgical candidates. Time from first seizure to EMU referral was approximately 4.6 years. Time from referral to admission and admission to first seizure conference were approximately 103 days and 71 days, respectively. From initial EMU referral to surgery ranged from 1.6 to 1.1 years depending on whether the patient required invasive monitoring with intracranial EEG. Overall, 95% of surgical patients had a reduction in seizure frequency, 74% were seizure free after one year post-surgery. Significance: Referral rates for surgical assessment are low relative to the estimated number of children living with MRE in Ontario, less than 2%. Hence, only a limited number of children with this disorder in the province of Ontario who could benefit from epilepsy surgery are being assessed for surgical candidacy. The majority of Ontario children with MRE are not being provided the potential opportunity to be seizure free and live without functional limitations following surgical intervention. These data document the critical need for health system redesign in Ontario, the goal of which should be to provide more consistent and just access to evidence-based medical and surgical care for those citizens of the province who suffer from epilepsy.

Automated diagnosis of epileptic electroencephalogram using independent component analysis and discrete wavelet transform for different electroencephalogram durations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; independent component analysis; epilepsy; ictal; interictal; discrete wavelet transform; classifier	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY; FREQUENCY	Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain depicted by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram signals can be used to study the characteristics of epileptic seizures. In this study, we propose a method for the automated classification of electroencephalogram into normal, interictal and ictal classes using 6, 12, 18 and 23.6 s of data. We employed discrete wavelet transform to decompose electroencephalogram signals into frequency sub-bands. These discrete wavelet transform coefficients were then subjected to independent component analysis for reducing the data dimension. The independent component analysis features were then fed to six classifiers, namely, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, fuzzy, Gaussian mixture model and support vector machine to select the best classifier. We observed that the support vector machine classifier with radial basis function kernel function gave the best results with an average accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 97% for 23.6 s of electroencephalogram data. Our results show that as the duration of the data increases, the classification accuracy increases. This proposed technique can be used as an automatic seizure monitoring software to aid the doctors in providing timely quality care for the patients suffering from epilepsy.	[Acharya, U.

A BCI system designed for multiple users without the need of extensive training sessions could be a viable solution for the system's implementation outside research centers. The present work explores the design of an independent-subject BCI. In order to accomplish this, Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers were designed with the data of a sample of 30 healthy volunteers as a whole group and separated by gender. Three different methods were employed to compute power spectrum features from the volunteer's electroencephalographic recordings. The results show that it is possible to design an independent-subject BCI for the classification of right or left hand motor imagery with respect of a reference interval with classification accuracies above 70%. The female gender could benefit more from a subject-independent classifier, than the male gender.

Ictal high frequency oscillations distinguish two types of seizure territories in humans	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; seizure localization; human microelectrode recordings; high frequency oscillations	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FAST RIPPLES; FOCAL EPILEPSY; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPUS; ONSET; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS	High frequency oscillations have been proposed as a clinically useful biomarker of seizure generating sites. We used a unique set of human microelectrode array recordings (four patients, 10 seizures), in which propagating seizure wavefronts could be readily identified, to investigate the basis of ictal high frequency activity at the cortical (subdural) surface. Sustained, repetitive transient increases in high gamma (80-150 Hz) amplitude, phase-locked to the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm, correlated with strong multi-unit firing bursts synchronized across the core territory of the seizure. These repetitive high frequency oscillations were seen in recordings from subdural electrodes adjacent to the microelectrode array several seconds after seizure onset, following ictal wavefront passage. Conversely, microelectrode recordings demonstrating only low-level, heterogeneous neural firing correlated with a lack of high frequency oscillations in adjacent subdural recording sites, despite the presence of a strong low-frequency signature. Previously, we reported that this pattern indicates a failure of the seizure to invade the area, because of a feedforward inhibitory veto mechanism. Because multi-unit firing rate and high gamma amplitude are closely related, high frequency oscillations can be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish the core seizure territory from the surrounding penumbra. We developed an efficient measure to detect delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations based on cross-frequency coupling between high gamma amplitude and the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm. When applied to the broader subdural recording, this measure consistently predicted the timing or failure of ictal invasion, and revealed a surprisingly small and slowly spreading seizure core surrounded by a far larger penumbral territory. Our findings thus establish an underlying neural mechanism for delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations, and provide a practical, efficient method for using them to identify the small ictal core regions. Our observations suggest that it may be possible to reduce substantially the extent of cortical resections in epilepsy surgery procedures without compromising seizure control.

In these two models, the basal ganglia data stream is envisaged as a random temporal combination of independent simple patterns issued from its probability distribution of interval interspikes or its spectrum of frequencies respectively. More recently, non-linear analyses have been introduced in the modelization of motor circuitry activities, and they have provided evidences that complex temporal organizations exist in basal ganglia neuronal activities. Regarding movement disorders, these complex temporal organizations in the basal ganglia data stream differ between conditions (i.e., parkinsonism, dyskinesia, healthy control) and are responsive to treatments (i.e., I-DOPA, deep brain stimulation). A body of evidence has reported that basal ganglia neuronal entropy (a marker for complexity/irregularity in time series) is higher in hypokinetic state. In line with these findings, an entropy-based model has been recently formulated to introduce basal ganglia entropy as a marker for the alteration of motor processing and a factor of motor inhibition. Importantly, non-linear features have also been identified as a marker of condition and/or treatment effects in brain global signals (EEG), muscular activities (EMG), or kinetic of motor symptoms (tremor, gait) of patients with movement disorders. It is therefore warranted that the non-linear dynamics of motor circuitry will contribute to a better understanding of the neuronal dysfunctions underlying the spectrum of parkinsonian motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and hypokinesia.

Sleep Slow-Wave Activity Regulates Cerebral Glycolytic Metabolism	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						delta power; electroencephalogram; glycolysis; insomnia; optogenetic	PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; BRAIN; WAKE; RAT; LACTATE; DEPRIVATION; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; INCREASES; SPINDLES	Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) onset is characterized by a reduction in cerebral metabolism and an increase in slow waves, 14-Hz oscillations between relatively depolarized and hyperpolarized states in the cerebral cortex. The metabolic consequences of slow-wave activity (SWA) at the cellular level remain uncertain. We sought to determine whether SWA modulates the rate of glycolysis within the cerebral cortex. The real-time measurement of lactate concentration in the mouse cerebral cortex demonstrates that it increases during enforced wakefulness. In spontaneous sleep/wake cycles, lactate concentration builds during wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep and declines during NREMS. The rate at which lactate concentration declines during NREMS is proportional to the magnitude of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at frequencies of 10 Hz. The induction of 1-Hz oscillations, but not 10-Hz oscillations, in the electroencephalogram by optogenetic stimulation of cortical pyramidal cells during wakefulness triggers a decline in lactate concentration. We conclude that cerebral SWA promotes a decline in the rate of glycolysis in the cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate a cellular energetic function for sleep SWA, which may contribute to its restorative effects on brain function.

During seizures, the direct involvement of central autonomic control centers cause specific changes in heart rate and respiration. The pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunctions that are observed in the interictal period is more difficult to explain. These alterations are most likely due to changes in the epileptic network and/or to a lesser extent due to direct interictal spike activity disturbing central autonomic centers. The aim of our study is to investigate whether ictal and interictal respiratory changes do occur in temporal lobe and absence epilepsy in children. We hypothesize that the interictal autonomic changes are due to changes in the neuronal network, by studying epilepsy patients with normal interictal background EEG. Methods: Ictal and interictal single-lead ECG signals were extracted from 24 h video-EEG recordings in 10 children with refractory temporal lobe seizures, in 10 children with absence seizures with occasional interictal discharges and 10 control subjects. RR interval time series were calculated and respiration parameters were derived from the ECG signal. ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signals were computed and time and frequency domain parameters were extracted to characterize the respiratory function. Results: In the ictal registrations we observed bradypnea in 10 out of the 12 recorded seizures from the temporal lobe. In absence seizures, we observed a variable ictal effect on respiratory rate. In the analysis of the interictal data, the most remarkable finding was the higher power in the low frequency band and lower power in the high frequency band of the EDR signals in patients with absence seizures compared to control subjects, indicating a shift of respiratory rate to the lower frequencies. Conclusion: In conclusion we found a uniform pattern in ictal respiratory changes in temporal lobe seizures, due to direct involvement of central respiratory centers. In absence epilepsy, we found a disturbed respiratory control in between seizures. These changes were not present in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The observed interictal changes in respiration in absence epilepsy are most likely due to epileptogenetic changes in the thalamocortical network, involved in absence epilepsy and could not be explained by interictal spike activity.

Berger related the EEG with cognition; we are attempting to identify which rhythms and circuits participate in habituation, a learning that decreases responses to meaningless stimuli which, changed the absolute power (AP) of EEG oscillations. Objective. To characterize habituation, analyzing the AP of four rhythms in lateral regions of both hemispheres (BH), proposing that their diminution, desynchronization (D), means activation whereas their increase, synchronization (S), means inhibition. Material and methods. qEEG analysis in 83 college students, in waking state with closed eyes, and photostimulated (RPh). The used UAMI/Yanez software identifies RPh signals and takes 2-s samples before (Pre) and during RPh; the Welch periodogram integrates the AP of the four rhythms. We calculated the average AP (AAP) in Pre and RPh per frequency in bipolar lateral leads per hemisphere. AAP differences mere evaluated with the Wilcoxon tests correcting with Bonferroni for repeated samples. Applying the linear regression model, we plotted the AAP distribution slopes during Pre and RPh. Results. We established the differences of the AP of the four rhythms within each hemisphere and between both hemispheres (BH). During PRE, AAP of delta and theta increased whereas alpha and beta decreased. RPh increased the AAP (p = 0.01) of the four rhythms in fronto-frontal (FF) leads; the increase in delta persisted in fronto-temporal (FT) and temporo-occipital (TO), whereas beta's increase persisted in all leads. The AAP of a decreased with the first RPh (D) increasing with the following ones; its slope starts with desynchronization and ends with synchronization. Theta followed a D/S pattern in temporal leads. Beta followed and ascending (S) slope in all leads. Conclusions. Habituation results from the D/S of a in all cortical regions, of theta in temporal, of delta in frontal regions and beta in all regions. Synchronization reflects hyperpolarization of neuronal membranes, decreasing their activity.

Infant Brain Responses to Object Weight: Exploring Goal-Directed Actions and Self-Experience	INFANCY			English	Article							MOTOR ACTIVATION; EEG; SYSTEM; ALPHA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; OTHERS; BAND	Recent work has suggested the value of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures in the study of infants' processing of human action. Studies in this area have investigated desynchronization of the sensorimotor mu rhythm during action execution and action observation in infancy. Untested but critical to theory is whether the mu rhythm shows a differential response to actions which share similar goals but have different motor requirements or sensory outcomes. By varying the invisible property of object weight, we controlled for the abstract goal (reach, grasp, and lift the object), while allowing other aspects of the action to vary. The mu response during 14-month-old infants' own executed actions showed a differential hemispheric response between acting on heavier and lighter objects. EEG responses also showed sensitivity to expected object weight when infants simply observed an experimenter reach for objects that the infants' prior experience indicated were heavier vs. lighter. Crucially, this neural reactivity was predictiveduring the observation of the other reaching toward the object, before lifting occurred. This suggests that infants' own self-experience with a particular object's weight influences their processing of others' actions on the object, with implications for developmental social-cognitive neuroscience.

Frontal midline theta and N200 amplitude reflect complementary information about expectancy and outcome evaluation	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Fontal midline theta; Reward prediction error; Feedback ERN	REWARD PREDICTION; MEDIOFRONTAL NEGATIVITIES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ERROR SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; FEEDBACK; CORTEX; DYNAMICS; EEG; ADAPTATION	Feedback ERN (fERN) and frontal midline theta have both been proposed to index a dopamine-like reinforcement learning signal in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We investigated these proposals by comparing fERN amplitude and theta power with respect to their sensitivities to outcome valence and probability in a previously collected EEG dataset. Bayesian model comparison revealed a dissociation between the two measures, with fERN amplitude mainly sensitive to valence and theta power mainly sensitive to probability. Further, fERN amplitude was highly correlated with the portion of theta power that is consistent in phase across trials (i.e., evoked theta power). These results suggest that although both measures provide valuable information about cognitive function of frontal midline cortex, fERN amplitude is specifically sensitive to dopamine reinforcement learning signals whereas theta power reflects the ACC response to unexpected events.

On the basis of vast amount of research in the last 30 years, we have developed a cybernetic theory of handwriting and calligraphy to account for the intricate interactions of several psychological dimensions involved in the dynamic act of graphic production. Central to this system of writing are the role of sensory, bio-, cognitive, and neurofeedback mechanisms for the initiation, guidance, and regulation of the writing motions vis-a-vis visual-geometric variations of Chinese characters. This experiment provided the first evidence of cortical excitation in EEG theta wave as a neural hub that integrates information coming from changes in the practitioner's body, emotions, and cognition. In addition, it has also confirmed neurofeedback as an essential component of the cybernetic theory of handwriting and calligraphy.

In contrast, controversy surrounds the existence and electrophysiological correlates of this activity in humans. Some argue that the human hippocampal theta occurs in short and phasic bursts. On the contrary, our earlier studies provide evidence that REM-dependent mesiotemporal RSA is continuous like in animals but instead of the theta it falls in the delta frequency range. Here we used a virtual navigation task in 24 epilepsy patients implanted with foramen ovale electrodes. EEG was analyzed for 1-Hz wide frequency bins up to 10 Hz according to four conditions: resting, non-learning route-following, acquisition and recall. We found progressively increasing spectral power in frequency bins up the 4 Hz across these conditions. No spectral power increase relative to resting was revealed within the traditional theta band and above in any of the navigation conditions. Thus the affected frequency bins were below the theta band and were similar to those characterizing REM sleep in our previous studies providing further indication that it is delta rather than theta that should be regarded as a human analog of the animal RSA.

These circuits are thought to independently control either reach and grip components (a functional dissociation), or planning and execution phases of grasping movements (a temporal dissociation). However, recent evidence of functional and temporal overlap between these circuits has undermined those models. Here, we test an alternative model that subsumes previous accounts: the dorsolateral and dorsomedial circuits operate at different hierarchical levels, resulting in functional and temporal dependencies between their computations. We asked human participants to grasp a visually presented object, manipulating movement complexity by varying object slant. We used concurrent single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe and record neurophysiological activity in the two circuits. Changes in alpha-band oscillations (8-12 Hz) characterized the effects of task manipulations and TMS interferences over aIPS and sPOS. Increasing the complexity of the grasping movement was accompanied by alpha-suppression over dorsomedial parietofrontal regions, including sPOS, during both planning and execution stages. TMS interference over either aIPS or sPOS disrupted this index of dorsomedial computations; early when aIPS was perturbed, later when sPOS was perturbed, indicating that the dorsomedial circuit is temporally dependent on aIPS. TMS over sPOS enhanced alpha-suppression in inferior parietal cortex, indicating that the dorsolateral circuit can compensate for a transient sPOS perturbation. These findings suggest that both circuits specify the same grasping parameters, with dorsomedial computations depending on dorsolateral contributions.	[Verhagen, Lennart; Medendorp, W.

Graph-theoretical analysis has been used extensively to study static brain networks but may be limited in the study of rapidly changing brain connectivity during induction of or recovery from general anesthesia. Here we introduce a novel method to study the temporal evolution of network modules in the brain. We recorded multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG) from 18 surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with either propofol (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Time series data were used to reconstruct networks; each electroencephalographic channel was defined as a node and correlated activity between the channels was defined as a link. We analyzed the frequency of subgraphs in the network with a defined number of links; subgraphs with a high probability of occurrence were deemed network "backbones." We analyzed the behavior of network backbones across consciousness, anesthetic induction, anesthetic maintenance, and two points of recovery. Constitutive, variable and state-specific backbones were identified across anesthetic state transitions. Brain networks derived from neurophysiologic data can be deconstructed into network backbones that change rapidly across states of consciousness. This technique enabled a granular description of network evolution over time. The concept of network backbones may facilitate graph-theoretical analysis of dynamically changing networks.

The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially naive to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.	[Friedrich, Elisabeth V.

Here we consider a less explored phenomenon; namely gamma frequency synchronisation of neurons in the basal ganglia. Gamma oscillations have been reported in a distributed network involving the basal ganglia, thalamus and motor cortex, and have been described in a wide range of diseases as well as during increased arousal and voluntary movement. In Parkinson's disease, gamma activity is promoted by dopaminergic therapy. These features suggest that its elevation may be involved in the production of movement and this hypothesis is supported by the correlation between the amplitude of gamma activity and limb kinematics.

It most often occurs in association with hearing loss. To elucidate the relation between simple and complex auditory phantom percepts a source localized electroencephalography (EEG) study is performed. The analyses showed in both simple and complex auditory phantoms an increase in theta-gamma activity and coupling within the auditory cortex that could be associated with the thalamocortical dysrhythmia model. Furthermore increased beta activity within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula is demonstrated, that might be related to auditory awareness, salience and its attribution to an external sound source. The difference between simple and complex auditory phantoms relies on differential alpha band activity within the auditory cortex and on beta activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and (para) hippocampal area. This could be related to memory based load dependency, while suppression within the primary visual cortex might be due the presence of a continuous auditory cortex activation inducing an inhibitory signal to the visual system. Complex auditory phantoms further activate the right inferior frontal area (right sided Broca homolog) and right superior temporal pole that might be associated with the musical content. In summary, this study showed for the first time that simple and complex auditory phantoms might share a common neural substrate but differ as complex auditory phantoms are associated with activation in brain areas related to music and language processing.

Lack of Systematic Topographic Difference between Attention and Reasoning Beta Correlates	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; GENERATION; NETWORK; VARIABILITY; AREAS	Based on previous evidence for individual-specific sets of cortical areas active during simple attention tasks, in this work we intended to perform within individual comparisons of task-induced beta oscillations between visual attention and a reasoning task. Since beta induced oscillations are not time-locked to task events and were first observed by Fourier transforms, in order to analyze the cortical topography of attention induced beta activity, we have previously computed corrected-latency averages based on spontaneous peaks of band-pass filtered epochs. We then used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) only to single out the significant portion of averaged data, above noise levels. In the present work ICA served as the main, exhaustive means for decomposing beta activity in both tasks, using 128-channel EEG data from 24 subjects. Given the previous observed similarity between tasks by visual inspection and by simple descriptive statistics, we now intended another approach: to quantify how much each ICA component obtained in one task could be explained by a linear combination of the topographic patterns from the other task in each individual. Our hypothesis was that the major psychological difference between tasks would not be reflected as important topographic differences within individuals. Results confirmed the high topographic similarity between attention and reasoning beta correlates in that few components in each individual were not satisfactorily explained by the complementary task, and if those could be considered "task-specific", their scalp distribution and estimated cortical sources were not common across subjects. These findings, along with those from fMRI studies preserving individual data and conventional neuropsychological and neurosurgical observations, are discussed in support of a new functional localization hypothesis: individuals use largely different sets of cortical association areas to perform a given task, but those individual sets do not change importantly across tasks that differ in major psychological processes.

Electrophysiological responses to emotional prosody perception in cochlear implant users	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Emotional prosody; Cochlear implants; ERP; P200; Gamma band power	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PHASE-LOCKING; ERP EVIDENCE; COMPONENT; MODULATION; STIMULI; PITCH; LATERALIZATION	The present electroencephalographic (EEG) study investigated the ability of cochlear implant (CI) users to recognize emotional prosody. Two CI speech-processing strategies were compared: the ACE (Advance Combination Encoder) and the newly developed MP3000. Semantically neutral sentences spoken in three different emotional prosodies (neutral, angry, happy) were presented to 20 post-lingually deafened CI users and age-matched normal-hearing controls. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to study the N100 and the P200 responses. In addition, event-related spectral power modulations were calculated to study the brain activity corresponding to the recognition of prosody in earlier (0-400) as well as later (600-1200) part of the stimuli where the prosodic features differed maximally. CI users with MP3000 strategy showed a higher proportion of correctly recognized prosodic information compared to the ACE strategy users. Our ERP results demonstrated that emotional prosody elicited significant N100 and P200 peaks. Furthermore, the P200 amplitude in response to happy prosodic information was significantly more positive for the MP3000 strategy compared to the ACE strategy. On spectral power analysis, two typical gamma activities were observed in the MP3000 users only: (1) an early gamma activity in the 100-250 ms time window reflecting bottom-up attention regulation; and (2) a late gamma activity between 900 and 1100 ms post-stimulus onset, probably reflecting top-down cognitive control. Our study suggests that the MP3000 strategy is better than ACE in regard to happy prosody perception. Furthermore, we show that EEG is a useful tool that, in combination with behavioral analysis, can reveal differences between two CI processing strategies for coding of prosody-specific features of language.

A relevant property of spectral measures is the alpha peak, which corresponds to the dominant alpha rhythm. Here we studied the spatial distribution of MEG resting state alpha peak frequency and amplitude values in a sample of 27 MCI patients and 24 age-matched healthy controls. Power spectra were reconstructed in source space with linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer. Then, 88 Regions of Interest (ROIs) were defined and an alpha peak per ROI and subject was identified. Statistical analyses were performed at every ROI, accounting for age, sex and educational level. Peak frequency was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in MCIs in many posterior ROIs. The average peak frequency over all ROIs was 9.68 +/- 0.71 Hz for controls and 9.05 +/- 0.90 Hz for MCIs and the average normalized amplitude was (2.57 +/- 0.59).10(-2) for controls and (2.70 +/- 0.49).10(-2) for MCIs. Age and gender were also found to play a role in the alpha peak, since its frequency was higher in females than in males in posterior ROIs and correlated negatively with age in frontal ROIs. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of peak parameters with hippocampal volume, which is a commonly used marker of early structural AD-related damage. Peak frequency was positively correlated with hippocampal volume in many posterior ROIs. Overall, these findings indicate a pathological alpha slowing in MCI.

Abnormal NMDAR signaling presumably contributes to cognitive deficits which substantially contribute to functional disability in schizophrenia. Establishing a mouse genetic model will help investigate molecular mechanisms of hypoglutmatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia. Here, we examined the responses of Sp4 hypomorphic mice to NMDAR antagonists in electroencephalography and various behavioral paradigms. Sp4 hypomorphic mice, previously reported to have reduced NMDAR1 expression and LTP deficit in hippocampal CA1, displayed increased sensitivity and prolonged responses to NMDAR antagonists. Molecular studies demonstrated reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in both cortex and hippocampus, consistent with abnormal gamma oscillations in Sp4 hypomorphic mice. On the other hand, human SP4 gene was reported to be deleted in schizophrenia. Several human genetic studies suggested the association of SP4 gene with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, elucidation of the Sp4 molecular pathway in Sp4 hypomorphic mice may provide novel insights to our understanding of abnormal NMDAR signaling in schizophrenia.

This paper applies newer methods of control systems modeling for assessing system stability in health and disease. Control systems can be characterized as open or closed systems with feedback loops. Feedback produces oscillatory activity, and the complexity of naturally occurring oscillatory patterns reflects the multiplicity of feedback mechanisms, such that many mechanisms operate simultaneously to control the system. Unstable systems, often associated with poor health, are characterized by absence of oscillation, random noise, or a very simple pattern of oscillation. This modeling approach can be applied to a diverse range of phenomena, including cardiovascular and brain activity, mood and thermal regulation, and social system stability. External system stressors such as disease, psychological stress, injury, or interpersonal conflict may perturb a system, yet simultaneously stimulate oscillatory processes and exercise control mechanisms. Resonance can occur in systems with negative feedback loops, causing high-amplitude oscillations at a single frequency. Resonance effects can be used to strengthen modulatory oscillations, but may obscure other information and control mechanisms, and weaken system stability. Positive as well as negative feedback loops are important for system function and stability. Examples are presented of oscillatory processes in heart rate variability, and regulation of autonomic, thermal, pancreatic and central nervous system processes, as well as in social/organizational systems such as marriages and business organizations. Resonance in negative feedback loops can help stimulate oscillations and exercise control reflexes, but also can deprive the system of important information. Empirical hypotheses derived from this approach are presented, including that moderate stress may enhance health and functioning.

J	Sokoliuk, R; VanRullen, R				Sokoliuk, Rodika; VanRullen, Rufin			The Flickering Wheel Illusion: When alpha Rhythms Make a Static Wheel Flicker	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OCCIPITAL CORTEX; MOTION ILLUSION; ILLUSORY MOTION; STEADY-STATE; EYE POSITION; ACCOMMODATION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION	alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) greatly influence brain activity, yet we generally do not experience them consciously: the world does not appear to oscillate. Dedicated strategies must exist in the brain to prevent these oscillations from disrupting normal processing. Could suitable stimuli fool these strategies and lead to the conscious experience of our own brain oscillations? We describe and explore a novel illusion in which the center of a static wheel stimulus (with 30-40 spokes) is experienced as flickering when viewed in the visual periphery. The key feature of this illusion is that the stimulus fluctuations are experienced as a regular and consistent flicker, which our human observers estimated at similar to 9 Hz during a psychophysical matching task. Correspondingly, the occipital alpha rhythm of the EEG was the only oscillation that showed a time course compatible with the reported illusion: when alpha amplitude was strong, the probability of reporting illusory flicker increased. The peak oscillatory frequency for these flicker-induced modulations was significantly correlated, on a subject-by-subject basis, with the individual alpha frequency measured during rest, in the absence of visual stimulation. Finally, although the effect is strongest during eye movements, we showed that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not necessary to perceive the illusion: the flicker can also be perceived on the afterimage of the wheel, yet by definition this afterimage is stationary on the retina. We conclude that this new flickering illusion is a unique way to experience the alpha rhythms that constantly occur in the brain but normally remain unnoticed.

The Role of Delta-Modulated High Frequency Oscillations in Seizure State Classification	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			EPILEPSY; PHASE; BRAIN; HZ	High frequency oscillations (HFOs), which collectively refer to ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (>200 Hz), have been implicated as key players in epileptogenesis. However, their presence alone is not in and of itself indicative of a pathological brain state. Rather, spatial origins as well as coexistence with other neural rhythms are essential components in defining pathological HFOs. This study investigates how the phase of the delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz) modulates the amplitude of HFOs during a seizure episode. Seven seizures recorded from three patients presenting with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were obtained via intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from a 64-electrode grid. Delta modulation of the HFO rhythms was found to emerge at seizure onset and termination regardless of the dynamics present within the seizure episode itself. Moreover, the differences between delta modulating the ripple or fast ripple may be due to the sleep stage of the patient when the seizures were being recorded. Further studies exploring how this modulation changes in space across the grid may also highlight additional properties of this phenomenon. Its temporal pattern suggests that it is a potential iEEG-based biomarker for seizure state classification.

It remains unclear whether oscillations may play a similar role in the insect brain. We describe a novel "whole brain" readout for Drosophila melanogaster using a simple multichannel recording preparation to study electrical activity across the brain of flies exposed to different sensory stimuli. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from >2,000 registered recording sites across the fly brain in >200 wild-type and transgenic animals to uncover specific LFP frequency bands that correlate with: 1) brain region; 2) sensory modality (olfactory, visual, or mechanosensory); and 3) activity in specific neural circuits. We found endogenous and stimulus-specific oscillations throughout the fly brain. Central (higher-order) brain regions exhibited sensory modality-specific increases in power within narrow frequency bands. Conversely, in sensory brain regions such as the optic or antennal lobes, LFP coherence, rather than power, best defined sensory responses across modalities. By transiently activating specific circuits via expression of TrpA1, we found that several circuits in the fly brain modulate LFP power and coherence across brain regions and frequency domains. However, activation of a neuromodulatory octopaminergic circuit specifically increased neuronal coherence in the optic lobes during visual stimulation while decreasing coherence in central brain regions. Our multichannel recording and brain registration approach provides an effective way to track activity simultaneously across the fly brain in vivo, allowing investigation of functional roles for oscillations in processing sensory stimuli and modulating behavior.

Enhancement of Gamma Oscillations Indicates Preferential Processing of Native over Foreign Phonemic Contrasts in Infants	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PHONETIC PERCEPTION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; AMERICAN INFANTS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD	Young infants discriminate phonetically relevant speech contrasts in a universal manner, that is, similarly across languages. This ability fades by 12 months of age as the brain builds language-specific phonemic maps and increasingly responds preferentially to the infant's native language. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie the development of infant preference for native over non-native phonemes remain unclear. Since gamma-band power is known to signal infants' preference for native language rhythm, we hypothesized that it might also indicate preference for native phonemes. Using high-density electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) recordings and source-localization techniques to identify and locate the ERP generators, we examined changes in brain oscillations while 6-month-old human infants from monolingual English settings listened to English and Spanish syllable contrasts. Neural dynamics were investigated via single-trial analysis of the temporal-spectral composition of brain responses at source level. Increases in 4-6 Hz (theta) power and in phase synchronization at 2-4 Hz (delta/theta) were found to characterize infants' evoked responses to discrimination of native/non-native syllable contrasts mostly in the left auditory source. However, selective enhancement of induced gamma oscillations in the area of anterior cingulate cortex was seen only during native contrast discrimination. These results suggest that gamma oscillations support syllable discrimination in the earliest stages of language acquisition, particularly during the period in which infants begin to develop preferential processing for linguistically relevant phonemic features in their environment. Our results also suggest that by 6 months of age, infants already treat native phonemic contrasts differently from non-native, implying that perceptual specialization and establishment of enduring phonemic memory representations have been initiated.

RHYTHMIC THETA AND DELTA ACTIVITY OF CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONAL NETWORKS IN GENETICALLY OR PHARMACOLOGICALLY INDUCED N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION UNDER URETHANE ANESTHESIA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						schizophrenia; medial prefrontal cortex; theta oscillation; EEG; rat; mouse	NMDA AGONIST (TETRAZOL-5-YL)GLYCINE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIAL SEPTUM; DRUG DISCOVERY; AMPA-RECEPTOR; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MODEL; RAT; OSCILLATION; PHENCYCLIDINE	N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists mimic several symptoms of schizophrenia in healthy subjects, and are used in preclinical disease models. In the present study, the impact of pharmacologically and genetically induced NMDAR hypofunction was assessed in rats and mice, including the NMDAR hypomorphic (Grin1) mice, with respect to neuronal network oscillations. Field potentials were recorded from the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (CA1) in rats, as well as spontaneous and elicited hippocampal theta oscillations in response to brainstem stimulation in Grin1 and wild-type (WT) mice under anesthesia. Effects of the alpha-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor positive allosteric modulator LY451395 were tested in Grin1 mice and in WT mice following an MK-801 challenge. Recordings from the mPFC and CA1 in rats revealed regular delta and theta oscillations, respectively, which were disrupted by MK-801. In WT mice, MK-801 reduced both spontaneous and elicited hippocampal theta power. Age-matched Grin1 mice showed abnormal hippocampal field potentials, resembling activity seen after administration of MK-801 in WT mice, but also epileptiform discharges. Administration of MK-801 achieved high levels of NMDAR occupancy (84-98%) in both rats and mice, which is comparable to the approximately 90-95% reduction of NMDAR expression in the Grin1 mouse. Impaired elicited CA1 theta oscillation in WT mice following MK-801, or Grin1 mice was significantly improved by LY451395. These findings demonstrate similar, although not identical, changes in network activity following reduction in functioning NMDARs induced by acute pharmacological or genetic manipulations, indicating that these novel neurophysiological models could be used in evaluating drug candidates targeting glutamate neurotransmission.

On each trial of the task, two study Gabors were briefly presented in succession. A green or red disc preceding each Gabor signified whether that Gabor should be remembered or ignored, respectively. With cue-stimulus intervals of 300, 600, or 900 msec presented in separate sessions, we found that the onset of posterior, prestimulus alpha oscillations varied with the length of the interval. Although stimulus onset time was entirely predictable, the longer the cue-stimulus interval, the earlier the increase in prestimulus alpha power. However, the alpha-band modulation was not simply locked to the cue offset. The temporal envelopes of posterior alpha-band modulation were strikingly similar for both cued attending and cued ignoring and differed only in magnitude. This similarity suggests that cued attending includes suppression of task-irrelevant, spatial processing. Supporting the view that alpha-band oscillations represent inhibition, our graded measure of recall revealed that, when the stimulus to be ignored appears second in the sequence, peristimulus alpha power predicted the degree to which that irrelevant stimulus distorted subsequent recall of the stimulus that was to be remembered. These results demonstrate that timely deployment of attention-related alpha-band oscillations can aid STM by filtering out task-irrelevant information.

Similar ISFs are salient also in blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signals as well as in psychophysical time series. Functional consequences of ISFs are not fully understood. Here, they were investigated along with dynamical implications of ISFs in large-scale simulations of cortical network activity. For this purpose, a biophysically detailed hierarchical attractor network model displaying bistability and operating in an oscillatory regime was used. ISFs were imposed as slow fluctuations in either the amplitude or frequency of fast synaptic noise. We found that both mechanisms produced an ISF component in the synthetic local field potentials (LFPs) and modulated the power of 1-40 Hz oscillations. Crucially, in a simulated threshold-stimulus detection task (TSDT), these ISFs were strongly correlated with stimulus detection probabilities and latencies. The results thus show that several phenomena observed in many empirical studies emerge concurrently in the model dynamics, which yields mechanistic insight into how infra-slow excitability fluctuations in large-scale neuronal networks may modulate fast oscillations and perceptual processing. The model also makes several novel predictions that can be experimentally tested in future studies. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Both structures have been related to working memory (WM) processes. The aim of this study was to compare behavioral performances and EEG power spectra during a visuospatial working memory task (VSWMT) of toddlers with a history of PVL and healthy toddlers. Methodology/Principal Findings: A prospective, comparative study of WM was conducted in toddlers with a history of PVL and healthy toddlers. The task responses and the EEG narrow-band power spectra during a VSWMT were compared in both groups. The EEG absolute power was analyzed during the following three conditions: baseline, attention and WM retention. The number of correct responses was higher in the healthy group (20.5 +/- 5.0) compared to the PVL group (16.1 +/- 3.9) (p = 0.04). The healthy group had absolute power EEG increases (p <= 0.05) during WM compared to the attention condition in the bilateral frontal and right temporal, parietal and occipital regions in frequencies ranging from 1.17 to 2.34 Hz and in the right temporal, parietal and occipital regions in frequencies ranging from 14.06 to 15.23 Hz. In contrast, the PVL group had absolute power increases (p <= 0.05) in the bilateral fronto-parietal, left central and occipital regions in frequencies that ranged from 1.17 to 3.52 Hz and in the bilateral frontal and right temporal regions in frequencies ranging from 9.37 to 19.14 Hz. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that PVL toddlers have visuospatial WM deficits and a very different pattern of absolute power increases compared to a healthy group of toddlers, with greater absolute power in the low frequency range and widespread neuronal networks in the WM retention phase.

Ketamine, propofol, and the EEG: a neural field analysis of HCN1-mediated interactions	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ketamine; propofol; EEG; HCN1; neural field theory; drug interaction; anesthesia; infra-additivity	BISPECTRAL INDEX; ANESTHESIA; INDUCTION; SYNERGY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INCREASES; FREQUENCY; HYPNOSIS; SEDATION; MODELS	Ketamine and propofol are two well-known, powerful anesthetic agents, yet at first sight this appears to be their only commonality. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic agent, whose main mechanism of action is considered to be N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism; whereas propofol is a general anesthetic agent, which is assumed to primarily potentiate currents gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, several experimental observations suggest a closer relationship. First, the effect of ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is markedly changed in the presence of propofol: on its own ketamine increases theta (4-8 Hz) and decreases alpha (8-13 Hz) oscillations, whereas ketamine induces a significant shift to beta band frequencies (13-30 Hz) in the presence of propofol. Second, both ketamine and propofol cause inhibition of the inward pacemaker current I-h, by binding to the corresponding hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) subunit. The resulting effect is a hyperpolarization of the neuron's resting membrane potential. Third, the ability of both ketamine and propofol to induce hypnosis is reduced in HCN1-knockout mice. Here we show that one can theoretically understand the observed spectral changes of the EEG based on HCN1-mediated hyperpolarizations alone, without involving the supposed main mechanisms of action of these drugs through NMDA and GABA(A), respectively. On the basis of our successful EEG model we conclude that ketamine and propofol should be antagonistic to each other in their interaction at HCN1 subunits. Such a prediction is in accord with the results of clinical experiment in which it is found that ketamine and propofol interact in an infra-additive manner with respect to the endpoints of hypnosis and immobility.

Improvisational psychodynamic music therapy (MT) utilizes verbal and musical reflection on emotions and images arising from clinical improvisation. Music listening is shifting frontal alpha asymmetries (FAA) in depression, and increases frontal midline theta (FMT). In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 79 depressed clients (with comorbid anxiety), we compared standard care (SC) versus MT added to SC at intake and after 3 months. We found that MT significantly reduced depression and anxiety symptoms. The purpose of this study is to test whether or not MT has an impact on anterior fronto-temporal resting state alpha and theta oscillations. Correlations between anterior EEG, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A), power spectral analysis (topography, means, asymmetry) and normative EEG database comparisons were explored. After 3 month of MT, lasting changes in resting EEG were observed, i.e., significant absolute power increases at left fronto-temporal alpha, but most distinct for theta (also at left fronto-central and right temporoparietal leads). MT differed to SC at F7-F8 (z scored FAA, p < .03) and T3-T4 (theta, p < .005) asymmetry scores, pointing towards decreased relative left-sided brain activity after MT; pre/post increased FMT and decreased HADS-A scores (r = .42, p < .05) indicate reduced anxiety after MT. Verbal reflection and improvising on emotions in MT may induce neural reorganization in fronto-temporal areas. Alpha and theta changes in fronto-temporal and temporoparietal areas indicate MT action and treatment effects on cortical activity in depression, suggesting an impact of MT on anxiety reduction.

Dalton; Bramlett, Helen M.; Sick, Thomas			EEGgui: a program used to detect electroencephalogram anomalies after traumatic brain injury	SOURCE CODE FOR BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article								Background: Identifying and quantifying pathological changes in brain electrical activity is important for investigations of brain injury and neurological disease. An example is the development of epilepsy, a secondary consequence of traumatic brain injury. While certain epileptiform events can be identified visually from electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) records, quantification of these pathological events has proved to be more difficult. In this study we developed MATLAB-based software that would assist detection of pathological brain electrical activity following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and present our MATLAB code used for the analysis of the ECoG. Methods: Software was developed using MATLAB(T) and features of the open access EEGLAB. EEGgui is a graphical user interface in the MATLAB programming platform that allows scientists who are not proficient in computer programming to perform a number of elaborate analyses on ECoG signals. The different analyses include Power Spectral Density (PSD), Short Time Fourier analysis and Spectral Entropy (SE). ECoG records used for demonstration of this software were derived from rats that had undergone traumatic brain injury one year earlier. Results: The software provided in this report provides a graphical user interface for displaying ECoG activity and calculating normalized power density using fast fourier transform of the major brain wave frequencies (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta1, Beta2 and Gamma). The software further detects events in which power density for these frequency bands exceeds normal ECoG by more than 4 standard deviations. We found that epileptic events could be identified and distinguished from a variety of ECoG phenomena associated with normal changes in behavior. We further found that analysis of spectral entropy was less effective in distinguishing epileptic from normal changes in ECoG activity. Conclusion: The software presented here was a successful modification of EEGLAB in the Matlab environment that allows detection of epileptiform ECoG signals in animals after TBI. The code allows import of large EEG or ECoG data records as standard text files and uses fast fourier transform as a basis for detection of abnormal events. The software can also be used to monitor injury-induced changes in spectral entropy if required. We hope that the software will be useful for other investigators in the field of traumatic brain injury and will stimulate future advances of quantitative analysis of brain electrical activity after neurological injury or disease.

Broad band time-varying estimation of event-related synchronization for user-independent configuration of a brain switch	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			EEG; MOVEMENT; RHYTHMS	Inter-user variability of brain activity patterns makes it necessary to obtain a user-specific configuration for optimal performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Setting up or adjusting a BCI requires a certain amount of data for the computation of spatial filters, selection of suitable features (e.g., frequency bands), and classifier training. Taking advantage of the spatial and spectral characteristics of the post-imagery beta event-related synchronization (ERS, power increase), we propose to use a user-independent configuration encompassing a single Laplacian filter, a broad frequency band (19 to 26 Hz), and a novel feature corresponding to the timevarying estimation of the beta ERS. In an offline analysis, we compare i) the use of this novel feature with the traditional logarithmic band power, and ii) the application of a broad frequency band with a user-specific band. After a 10 x 10 crossvalidation we found a reduction of the classification accuracy for detection of post-movement beta ERS (4%, 16 participants, p < 0.05) and post-imagery beta ERS (3%, 9 participants, p > 0.05), when using a general configuration instead of user-specific parameters. This performance reduction was only significant for motor execution. Our results demonstrate that the user-independent configuration proposed here leads to a classification accuracy of post-imagery beta ERS that is not significantly different from the performance achieved when the logarithmic band power of a user-specific frequency band is used.

Poststimulus undershoots in cerebral blood flow and BOLD fMRI responses are modulated by poststimulus neuronal activity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; event-related synchronization; rebound; alpha power; neurovascular-coupling	CALIBRATED FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEGATIVE BOLD; MOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNAL; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS	fMRI is the foremost technique for noninvasive measurement of human brain function. However, its utility is limited by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response. Though the primary peak of the hemodynamic response is modulated by neuronal activity, the origin of the typically negative poststimulus signal is poorly understood and its amplitude assumed to covary with the primary response. We use simultaneous recordings of EEG with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) fMRI during unilateral median nerve stimulation to show that the poststimulus fMRI signal is neuronally modulated. We observe high spatial agreement between concurrent BOLD and CBF responses to median nerve stimulation, with primary signal increases in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and primary signal decreases in ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. During the poststimulus period, the amplitude and directionality (positive/negative) of the BOLD signal in both contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex depends on the poststimulus synchrony of 8-13 Hz EEG neuronal activity, which is often considered to reflect cortical inhibition, along with concordant changes in CBF and metabolism. Therefore we present conclusive evidence that the fMRI time course represents a hemodynamic signature of at least two distinct temporal phases of neuronal activity, substantially improving understanding of the origin of the BOLD response and increasing the potential measurements of brain function provided by fMRI. We suggest that the poststimulus EEG and fMRI responses may be required for the resetting of the entire sensory network to enable a return to resting-state activity levels.

Asymmetric sleep in apneic human patients. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 304: R232-R237, 2013. First published November 28, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00302.2011.-Unilateral sleep in marine mammals has been considered to be a defense against airway obstruction, as a sentinel for pod maintenance, and as a thermoregulatory mechanism. Birds also show asymmetric sleep, probably to avoid predation. The variable function of asymmetric sleep suggests a general capability for independence between brain hemispheres. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea share similar problems with diving mammals, but their eventual sleep asymmetry has received little attention. The present report shows that human sleep apnea patients also present temporary interhemispheric variations in dominance during sleep, with significant differences when comparing periods of open and closed airways. The magnitude of squared coherence, an index of interhemispheric EEG interdependence in phase and amplitude, rises in the delta EEG range during apneic episodes, while the phase lag index, a measure of linear and nonlinear interhemispheric phase synchrony, drops to zero. The L index, which measures generalized nonlinear EEG interhemispheric synchronization, increases during apneic events. Thus, the three indexes show significant and congruent changes in interhemispheric symmetry depending on the state of the airways. In conclusion, when confronted with a respiratory challenge, sleeping humans undergo small, but significant, breathing-related oscillations in interhemispheric dominance, similar to those observed in marine mammals. The evidence points to a relationship between cetacean unihemispheric sleep and their respiratory challenges.

These slow waves of natural sleep are currently considered to be exclusively generated by intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms within neocortical territories, although a role for the thalamus in this key physiological rhythm has been suggested but never demonstrated. Combining neuronal ensemble recordings, microdialysis, and optogenetics, here we show that the block of the thalamic output to the neocortex markedly (up to 50%) decreases the frequency of slow waves recorded during non-REM sleep in freely moving, naturally sleeping-waking rats. A smaller volume of thalamic inactivation than during sleep is required for observing similar effects on EEG slow waves recorded during anesthesia, a condition in which both bursts and single action potentials of thalamocortical neurons are almost exclusively dependent on T-type calcium channels. Thalamic inactivation more strongly reduces spindles than slow waves during both anesthesia and natural sleep. Moreover, selective excitation of thalamocortical neurons strongly entrains EEG slow waves in a narrow frequency band (0.75-1.5 Hz) only when thalamic T-type calcium channels are functionally active. These results demonstrate that the thalamus finely tunes the frequency of slow waves during non-REM sleep and anesthesia, and thus provide the first conclusive evidence that a dynamic interplay of the neocortical and thalamic oscillators of slow waves is required for the full expression of this key physiological EEG rhythm.

For example, cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) recorded by electrocorticography (ECoG) are associated with delayed cerebral ischemia after sub arachnoid hemorrhage and are an attractive target for novel therapeutic approaches. However, to better understand pathophysiologic relations and realize the potential of multimodal monitoring, a common platform for data collection and integration is needed. We have developed a multimodal system that integrates clinical, research, and imaging data into a single research and development (R&D) platform. Our system is adapted from the widely used BCI2000, a brain-computer interface tool which is written in the C++ language and supports over 20 data acquisition systems. It is optimized for real-time analysis of multimodal data using advanced time and frequency domain analyses and is extensible for research development using a combination of C++, MATLAB, and Python languages. Continuous streams of raw and processed data, including BP (blood pressure), ICP, PtiO2, CBF, ECoG, EEG, and patient video are stored in an open binary data format. Selected events identified in raw (e.g., ICP) or processed (e.g., CSD) measures are displayed graphically, can trigger alarms, or can be sent to researchers or clinicians via text message. For instance, algorithms for automated detection of CSD have been incorporated, and processed ECoG signals are projected onto three-dimensional (3D) brain models based on patient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) scans, allowing real-time correlation of pathoanatomy and cortical function. This platform will provide clinicians and researchers with an advanced tool to investigate pathophysiologic relationships and novel measures of cerebral status, as well as implement treatment algorithms based on such multimodal measures.

EEG precursors of detected and missed targets during free-viewing search	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						free viewing; EEG; target detection; saccade; eye movements; lapse of attention; discrimination; covariance difference; saccade-related potentials; ERP	FRONTAL EYE FIELD; VISUAL-SEARCH; TIME-COURSE; OCCIPITAL ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; SACCADES; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY	When scanning a scene, the target of our search may be in plain sight and yet remain unperceived. Conversely, at other times the target may be perceived in the periphery prior to fixation. There is ample behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to suggest that in some constrained visual-search tasks, targets are detected prior to fixational eye movements. However, limited human data are available during unconstrained search to determine the time course of detection, the brain areas involved, and the neural correlates of failures to detect a foveated target. Here, we recorded and analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during free-viewing visual search, varying the task difficulty to compare neural signatures for detected and unreported ("missed") targets. When carefully controlled to remove eye-movement-related potentials, saccade-locked EEG shows that: (a) "Easy" targets may be detected as early as 150 ms prior to foveation, as indicated by a premotor potential associated with a button response; (b) object-discriminating occipital activity emerges during the saccade to target; and (c) success and failures to detect a target are accompanied by a modulation in alpha-band power over fronto-central areas as well as altered saccade dynamics. Taken together, these data suggest that target detection during free viewing can begin prior to and continue during a saccade, with failure or success in reporting a target possibly resulting from inhibition or activation of fronto-central processing areas associated with saccade control.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) indices, such as occipital a, have been employed to explore the psychological state during the preparatory period in elite athletes. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in frontal midline theta (Fm theta) power during the aiming period between successful and unsuccessful basketball free throws. Fifteen skilled male basketball players were recruited and asked to perform free throws. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected 2 seconds prior to the initiation of the free throw and segmented into four 0.5-s epochs. The lower theta (theta 1, 4-6 Hz) and upper theta (theta 2, 6-8 Hz) power values was contrasted between the successful and unsuccessful throws. Two 2 x 4 x 6 (performance x time x electrode) ANOVAs with repeated measures were conducted separately for theta 1 and theta 2 power. The results indicate that theta 1 power at the Fz site and theta 2 power at the Fz and the F4 sites fluctuated significantly during the preparatory period for an unsuccessful throw when compared with a successful throw. Additionally, a higher Fm theta 2 power was observed at the beginning of the aiming period of a successful throw. This study suggests that a stable arousal and a relatively constant amount of attention to the task prior to motor execution may facilitate athletic performance.

The synaptic protein encoded by the gene Slc10A4 suppresses epileptiform activity and regulates sensitivity to cholinergic chemoconvulsants	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Synapse; Slc10A4; Vesicular transporter	PILOCARPINE MODEL; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VITRO; EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; MICE; EPILEPTOGENESIS; NEURONS; KAINATE	The expanding number of disease-causing dysfunctions of synaptic proteins illustrates the importance of investigating newly discovered proteins involved in neuronal transmission. The gene Slc10A4 encodes a recently described carrier protein present in pre-synaptic terminals of cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons. The biological significance of this recently described transporter protein is currently unknown. We here investigated whether absence of the Slc10a4 protein has any impact on function of the cholinergic system. We first investigated the sensitivity of Slc10a4 null mice to cholinergic stimulus in vitro. In contrast to wild type mice, gamma oscillations occurred spontaneously in hippocampal slices from Slc10a4 null mice. Furthermore, moderate treatment of Slc10a4 null slices with the cholinergic agonist carbachol induced epileptiform activity. In vivo, 3-channel EEG measurements in freely behaving mice revealed that Slc10a4 null mice had frequent epileptiform spike-activity before treatment, and developed epileptic seizures, detected by EEG and accompanied by observable behavioral components, more rapidly after injection of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. Similar results were obtained on non-operated mice, as evaluated by behavioral seizures and postmortem c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Importantly, Slc10a4 null mice and wild type control mice were equally sensitive to the glutamatergic chemoconvulsant kainic acid, demonstrating that absence of Slc10a4 led to a selective cholinergic hypersensitivity. In summary, we report that absence of the recently discovered synaptic vesicle protein Slc10a4 results in increased sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It has also been proposed that a faulty hMNS may underlie some of the deficits seen in the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In the present study we set out to investigate whether emotional facial expressions could modulate a putative EEG index of hMNS activation (mu suppression) and if so, would this differ according to the individual level of autistic traits [high versus low Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) score]. Participants were presented with 3s films of actors opening and closing their hands (classic hMNS mu-suppression protocol) while simultaneously wearing happy, angry, or neutral expressions. Mu-suppression was measured in the alpha and low beta bands. The low AQ group displayed greater low beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) to both angry and neutral expressions. The high AQ group displayed greater low beta ERD to angry than to happy expressions. There was also significantly more low beta ERD to happy faces for the low than for the high AQ group. In conclusion, an interesting interaction between AQ group and emotional expression revealed that hMNS activation can be modulated by emotional facial expressions and that this is differentiated according to individual differences in the level of autistic traits. The EEG index of hMNS activation (mu suppression) seems to be a sensitive measure of the variability in facial processing in typically developing individuals with high and low self-reported traits of autism.

RR signals were obtained from the ECG recorded during five Maintenance of Wakefulness (MWT) and Multiple Sleep Latency (MSLT) tests alternated throughout the day from patients suffering sleep disturbance. Two different end-points were considered: Study A, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) versus without daytime sleepiness (WDS); Study B, Pre-CPAP versus Post-CP AP (continuous positive airway pressure therapy) in EDS. Measures obtained from spectral analysis (PSD), time-frequency representation (TFR), auto-correntropy (ACORR) and auto-mutual-information function (AMIF) were applied to describe autonomic nervous system activity and RR regularity. Statistical differences between EDS and WDS groups were found in MSLT events. During MSLT, the parasympathetic activity and RR regularity in EDS were affected by CP AP therapy. Non-linear measures obtained from EDS in Post-CPAP differed from Pre-CPAP (p-value<0.05) and tended to be similar to WDS.

However, the question of movement event detection from brain activity, that is, decoding the time at which an event occurred (e. g. movement onset), has been addressed less often. Yet, this may be a topic of key importance, as a brain-machine interface (BMI) that controls a grasping prosthesis could be realized by detecting the time of grasp, together with an optional decoding of which type of grasp to apply. We, therefore, studied the detection of time of grasps from human ECoG recordings during a sequence of natural and continuous reach-to-grasp movements. Using signals recorded from the motor cortex, a detector based on regularized linear discriminant analysis was able to retrieve the time-point of grasp with high reliability and only few false detections. Best performance was achieved using a combination of signal components from time and frequency domains. Sensitivity, measured by the amount of correct detections, and specificity, represented by the amount of false detections, depended strongly on the imposed restrictions on temporal precision of detection and on the delay between event detection and the time the event occurred. Including neural data from after the event into the decoding analysis, slightly increased accuracy, however, reasonable performance could also be obtained when grasping events were detected 125 ms in advance. In summary, our results provide a good basis for using detection of grasping movements from ECoG to control a grasping prosthesis.

While cognitive deficit in epilepsy is a common observation, how spikes transiently influence brain oscillations, especially those essential for cognitive functions, remains obscure. Here we aimed to quantify the transient impacts of sporadic spikes on theta oscillations and investigate how such impacts may evolve during epileptogenesis. Longitudinal depth EEG data were recorded in the CA1 area of pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) rat models. Phase stability, a measure of synchrony, and theta power were estimated around spikes as well as in the protracted spike-free periods (FP) at least 1 h after spike bursts. We found that the change in theta power did not correlate with the change in phase stability. More importantly, the impact of spikes on theta rhythm was highly time-dependent. While theta power decreased abruptly after spikes both in the latent and chronic stages, changes of theta phase stability demonstrated opposite trends in the latent and chronic stages, potentially due to the substantial reorganization of neural circuits along epileptogenesis. During FP, theta phase stability was significantly higher than the baseline level before injections, indicating that hyper-synchrony remained even hours after the spike bursts. We concluded that spikes have transient negative effects on theta rhythm, however, impacts are different during latent and chronic stages, implying that its influence on cognitive processes may also change over time during epileptogenesis.

The stimulation duration may influence the anti-epileptic effect of LFS but is poorly studied. The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-epileptic effect of focal LFS with different stimulation duration on amygdaloid-kindling seizures in rats. We found 15 and 30 min but not 1 or 5 min LFS delivered immediately after the kindling stimulation slowed the progression of behavioral seizure stages and reduced mean afterdischarge duration (ADD) during kindling acquisition. In fully kindled animals, 15 and 30 min rather than 1 and 5 min LFS decreased the incidence of generalized seizures and the average seizure stage as well as shortened the cumulative generalized seizure duration (GSD). Meanwhile, EEG analysis showed 15 and 30 min LFS specifically lowered the power in delta band. However, if 15 min LFS delivered intermittently by 5 min interval, it had no suppressing effect on kindling rat. Thus, it is likely that consecutive 15 min is necessary for LFS to inhibit amygdaloid-kindling seizures in rats, indicating the stimulation duration may be a key fact affecting the clinical effect of LFS on epilepsy.

Many studies associated the gamma oscillations with oscillators around the 40 Hz frequency, yet recent studies have shown that gamma frequencies may be part of a broadband phenomenon ranging from 30 Hz up to 250 Hz. In this study we have examined the possibility that a simple model, based on available neurophysiological parameters, involving an increase in asynchronous (Poisson distributed) neural firing may be sufficient to generate the observed gamma power increases. Our simulation shows a roughly linear increase in gamma power as a function of the aggregated firing rate of the neural population, while the influence of the synchronization level within the neurons on the gamma power is limited. Our model supports the viewpoint that the broadband gamma response is mainly driven by the summed, asynchronous, activity of the neural population. We show that the time frequency spectrogram of the stimulus response can be reconstructed by combining two different phenomena the broadband gamma power increase due to local processing and the more spatially distributed event related desynchronization (ERD). Our model thus raises the possibility that the broadband gamma response is closely linked to the aggregate population firing rate of the recorded neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study aimed to extend this work by exploring reward motivation in an RSVP task using complex satellite imagery. We found that reward motivation significantly influenced neural activity both in the preparatory period and in response to target images. Pre-stimulus alpha activity and, to a lesser degree, P3 and CNV amplitude were found to be significantly predictive of reward condition on single trials. Target-locked P3 amplitude was modulated both by reward condition and by variation in target detectability inherent to our task. We further quantified this exogenous influence, showing that P3 differences reflected single-trial variation in P3 amplitude for different targets. These findings provide theoretical insight into the neural indices of reward in an RSVP task, and have important applications in the field of satellite imagery analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and high-income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low-income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region-selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low-income families.

However, the magnitude of how ultradian REM and NREM sleep and its EEG correlates impact onto dream recall remains fairly unknown. In this review, we address three questions: 1. Is there an ultradian NREM-REM sleep modulation in successful dream recall, which is gated by the circadian clock? 2. What are the key electrophysiological correlates that account for dream recall during NREM and REM sleep and 3. Are there age-related changes in the ultradian and circadian regulation in dream recall and its electrophysiological correlates? Knowledge on the specific frequency and topography NREM and REM sleep differences prior to dream recall may pinpoint to the cerebral correlates that account for this cognitive process, and hint to their possible physiological meaning.

Here, we investigated electroencephalographic responses to words, pseudo-words and complex sounds, in conditions where phonological and lexical categorizations were behaviorally successful (categorized stimuli) or unsuccessful (uncategorized stimuli). Data showed a greater decrease in low-beta power at left-hemisphere temporal electrodes for categorized non-lexical sounds (complex sounds and pseudo-words) than for categorized lexical sounds (words), consistent with the signature of a failure in lexical access. Similar differences between lexical and non-lexical sounds were observed for uncategorized stimuli, although these stimuli did not yield evoked potentials or theta activity. The results of the present study suggest that behaviorally uncategorized stimuli were processed at the lexical level, and provide evidence of the neural bases of the results observed in previous behavioral studies investigating auditory perception in the absence of stimulus awareness.

EEG theta and Mu oscillations during perception of human and robot actions	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						EEG; action perception; social robotics; mirror neuron system; mu rhythm; theta rhythm	MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PREMOTOR CORTEX; UNCANNY VALLEY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTION; RECOGNITION; IMITATION; MOVEMENT; MEMORY	The perception of others' actions supports important skills such as communication, intention understanding, and empathy. Are mechanisms of action processing in the human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans, and as such, can be used in experiments to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG as participants viewed actions performed by three agents. In the Human condition, the agent had biological appearance and motion. The other two conditions featured a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical appearance and motion. We explored whether sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) activity exhibited selectivity for biological entities, in particular for whether the visual appearance and/or the motion of the observed agent was biological. Sensorimotor mu suppression has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and the human mirror neuron system, MNS), and frontal theta to semantic and memory-related aspects. For all three agents, action observation induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations, with no difference between agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of MNS activity, does not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer. Studies combining robotics and neuroscience such as this one can allow us to explore neural basis of action processing on the one hand, and inform the design of social robots on the other.

First published January 9, 2013; doi:10.1152/jn.00409.2012.-Hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations coordinate the timing of multiple inputs to hippocampal neurons and have been linked to information processing and the dynamics of encoding and retrieval. One major influence on hippocampal rhythmicity is from cholinergic afferents. In both humans and rodents, aging is linked to impairments in hippocampus-dependent function along with degradation of cholinergic function. Cholinomimetics can reverse some age-related memory impairments and modulate oscillations in the hippocampus. Therefore, one would expect corresponding changes in these oscillations and possible rescue with the cholinomimetic physostigmine. Hippocampal activity was recorded while animals explored a familiar or a novel maze configuration. Reexposure to a familiar situation resulted in minimal aging effects or changes in theta or gamma oscillations. In contrast, exploration of a novel maze configuration increased theta power; this was greater in adult than old animals, although the deficit was reversed with physostigmine. In contrast to the theta results, the effects of novelty, age, and/or physostigmine on gamma were relatively weak. Unrelated to the behavioral situation were an age-related decrease in the degree of theta-gamma coupling and the fact that physostigmine lowered the frequency of theta in both adult and old animals. The results indicate that age-related changes in gamma and theta modulation of gamma, while reflecting aging changes in hippocampal circuitry, seem less related to aging changes in information processing. In contrast, the data support a role for theta and the cholinergic system in encoding and that hippocampal aging is related to impaired encoding of new information.

Hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proved to be more effective in mental control by combining another channel of physiologic control signals. Among those studies, little attention has been paid to the combined use of a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and P300 potential, both providing the fastest and the most reliable EEG based BCIs. In this paper, a novel hybrid BCI speller is developed to elicit P300 potential and SSVEP blocking (SSVEP-B) distinctly and simultaneously with the same target stimulus. Approach. Twelve subjects were involved in the study and every one performed offline spelling twice in succession with two different speller paradigms for comparison: hybrid speller and control P300-speller. Feature analysis was adopted from the view of time domain, frequency domain and spatial distribution; the performances were evaluated by character accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Main results. Signal analysis of the hybrid paradigm shows that SSVEPs are an evident EEG component during the nontarget phase but are dismissed and replaced by P300 potentials after target stimuli. The absence of an SSVEP, called SSVEP-B, mostly appearing in channel Oz, presents a sharp distinction between target responses and nontarget responses. The r(2) value of SSVEP-B in channel Oz is comparable to that of P300 in channel Cz. Compared with the control P300-speller, the hybrid speller achieves significantly higher accuracy and ITR with combined features. Significance. The results indicate that the combination of P300 with an SSVEP-B improves target discrimination greatly; the proposed hybrid paradigm is superior to the control paradigm in spelling performance. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.

Dynamic changes of ICA-derived EEG functional connectivity in the resting state	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						EEG; alpha rhythm; independent component analysis (ICA); resting-state network (RSN); functional connectivity; default mode network (DMN); dorsal attention network; multi-dimensional scaling (MDS); standardized low-resolution tomography analysis (sLORETA)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VOLUME CONDUCTION; BLIND SEPARATION; LOW-FREQUENCY; MU-RHYTHMS; EYES-OPEN	An emerging issue in neuroscience is how to identify baseline state(s) and accompanying networks termed resting state networks (RSNs). Although independent component analysis (ICA) in fMRI studies has elucidated synchronous spatiotemporal patterns during cognitive tasks, less is known about the changes in EEG functional connectivity between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) states, two traditionally used baseline indices. Here we investigated healthy subjects (n = 27) in EC and EO employing a four-step analytic approach to the EEG: (1) group ICA to extract independent components (ICs), (2) standardized low-resolution tomography analysis (sLORETA) for cortical source localization of IC network nodes, followed by (3) graph theory for functional connectivity estimation of epochwise IC band-power, and (4) circumscribing IC similarity measures via hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Our proof-of-concept results on alpha-band power demonstrate five statistically clustered groups with frontal, central, parietal, occipitotemporal, and occipital sources. Importantly, during EO compared with EC, graph analyses revealed two salient functional networks with frontoparietal connectivity: a more medial network with nodes in the mPFC/precuneus which overlaps with the default-mode network (DMN), and a more lateralized network comprising the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, coinciding with the dorsal attention network (DAN). Furthermore, a separate MDS analysis of ICs supported the emergence of a pattern of increased proximity (shared information) between frontal and parietal clusters specifically for the EO state. We propose that the disclosed component groups and their source-derived EEG functional connectivity maps may be a valuable method for elucidating direct neuronal (electrophysiological) RSNs in healthy people and those suffering from brain disorders.

Graph theory has recently been applied to study the structure-function relationship of networks, where dynamical similarity of different nodes has been turned into a "static" functional connection. However, the capability of the brain to adapt, learn and process external stimuli requires a constant dynamical functional rewiring between circuitries and cell assemblies. Hence, we must capture the changes of network functional connectivity over time. Multi-electrode array data present a unique challenge within this framework. We study the dynamics of gamma oscillations in acute slices of the somatosensory cortex from juvenile mice recorded by planar multi-electrode arrays. Bursts of gamma oscillatory activity lasting a few hundred milliseconds could be initiated only by brief trains of electrical stimulations applied at the deepest cortical layers and simultaneously delivered at multiple locations. Local field potentials were used to study the spatio-temporal properties and the instantaneous synchronization profile of the gamma oscillatory activity, combined with current source density (CSD) analysis. Pair-wise differences in the oscillation phase were used to determine the presence of instantaneous synchronization between the different sites of the circuitry during the oscillatory period. Despite variation in the duration of the oscillatory response over successive trials, they showed a constant average power, suggesting that the rate of expenditure of energy during the gamma bursts is consistent across repeated stimulations. Within each gamma burst, the functional connectivity map reflected the columnar organization of the neocortex. Over successive trials, an apparently random rearrangement of the functional connectivity was observed, with a more stable columnar than horizontal organization.

The visual criteria and univariate methods of analyzing IEEG recordings have not always produced clarity on the SOZs for resection and ultimate seizure freedom for patients. Here, to contribute to improving the localization of the SOZs and to understanding the mechanism of seizure propagation over the brain, we applied spectral interdependency methods to IEEG time series recorded from patients during seizures. We found that the high-frequency (>80 Hz) Granger causality (GC) occurs before the onset of any visible ictal activity and causal relationships involve the recording electrodes where clinically identifiable seizures later develop. These results suggest that high-frequency oscillatory network activities precede and underlie epileptic seizures, and that GC spectral measures derived from IEEG can assist in precise delineation of seizure onset times and SOZs.

EEG amplitude spectra before near threshold visual presentations differentially predict detection/omission and short-long reaction time outcomes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Delta; Theta; Beta; Spectral; Top-down; Pre-stimulus; Omissions; Simple-reaction-time	NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; LUMINANCE; LATENCIES; GRATINGS; CELLS	Performance in simple stimulus detection manifests as both probability of detection and speed of signaling detected stimuli. These two dimensions of performance across trials were examined with respect to brain states just prior to stimulus delivery, using near threshold stimuli targeting the magnocellular or the parvocellular visual streams in an attempt to isolate differential perceptual preparation. The EEG amplitude of 12 university students was analyzed in spectral bands from 2 to 50 Hz at 9 bilateral channel pairs in a window covering -450 ms to +50 ms relative to stimulus onset. A hierarchical statistical procedure was applied to control false positive results. EEG power in the 2, 4, 8 and 10 Hz bands was found significantly lower at the F7-F8 channel pair both before detected compared to omitted stimuli and before the fastest compared to slowest reaction time quartiles, with no stimulus type effect. In addition, the 22 and 24 Hz band activity was lower prior to better performance frontally (F3-F4, F7-F8) in reaction time but not in detection, while it was larger centro-parietally (CP1-CP2, P3-P4) in detection but not in reaction times. Spectral analysis thus shows stimulus detection and response speed to depend partly on common and partly on distinct pre-stimulus brain states. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This effect was investigated by recording and analyzing ERPs as well as induced gamma oscillations. The race modulation occurred post the stage of structural processing revealed by N170. Larger P2 component and induced gamma activity for own-race than other-race faces could be associated with more elaborate processing on the basis of configural computation due to more experience that we have for own-race faces.

While there is a body of work on drowsiness detection using EEG signals in neuroscience and engineering, there exist unanswered questions pertaining to the best mechanisms to use for detecting drowsiness. Targeting a range of practical safety-awareness applications, this study adopts a machine learning based approach to build support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to distinguish between awake and drowsy states. While broadband alpha, beta, delta, and theta waves are often used as features in the existing work, lack of widely agreed precise definitions of such broadband signals and difficulty in accounting for interpersonal variability has led to poor classification performance as demonstrated in this study. Furthermore, the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness and deeper sleep stages is a complex multifaceted process. The richness of this process calls for inclusion of sub-band features for more accurate drowsiness detection. To shed light on the effectiveness of sub-banding, we quantitatively compare the performances of a large set of SVM classifiers trained upon a varying number of 1Hz subband features. More importantly, we identify a compact set of neuroscientifcally motivated EEG features and demonstrate that the resulting classifier not only outperforms traditional broadband based classifiers but also is on a par with or superior than the best sub-band classifiers found by thorough search in a large space of 1Hz subband features.

Here we review evidence for an active system consolidation occurring during sleep. At the beginning of this process is sleep's ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in hippocampal networks. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of specific memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in extrahippocampal regions. We propose that reactivations during sleep are a general mechanism underlying the abstraction of temporally stable invariants from a flow of input that is solely structured in time, thus representing a basic mechanism of memory formation.

Clinical semiology, neuroimaging, and scalp electroencephalogram provide an approximation of this area, whereas intracranial recording may permit a more precise localization and investigation of a selected cortical area. Intraoperative electrocorticography delineates the irritative zone, and subdural electrode implantation also permits cortical stimulation of eloquent areas. Intraoperative electrocorticography rarely captures spontaneous seizures and may be influenced by the effect of anesthetic drugs, and the correlation between complete resection of the irritative zone and postsurgical seizure outcome is unclear. Extraoperative monitoring is often superior to intraoperative electrocorticography but may also be associated with more risk of adverse events. Further development of ultrahigh-density electrode arrays is providing novel insights into the role of microseizures and high-frequency oscillations on ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.

DBS has been applied in patients with Parkinson ' s disease, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (among others), and more recently in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease to improve memory functions. Current DBS approaches are based on the concept that high-frequency stimulation inhibits or excites specific brain regions. However, because DBS entails the application of repetitive electrical stimuli, it primarily exerts an effect on extracellular field-potential oscillations similar to those recorded with electroencephalography. Here, we suggest a new perspective on how DBS may ameliorate memory dysfunction: it may enhance normal electrophysiological patterns underlying long-term memory processes within the medial temporal lobe.

Quantitative analyses were performed on iEEG segments from four patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Interelectrode synchrony was measured using WPC before, during and after seizure activity. The WPC profiles of HFOs were able to elucidate the seizure from non-seizure state in all four patients and for all seizures studied (n=10). HFO synchrony was consistently transient and of weak to moderate strength during non-seizure activity, while weak to very strong coherence, of prolonged duration, was observed during seizures. Several studies have suggested that HFOs may have a significant role in the process of epileptogenesis and seizure genesis. As epileptic seizures result from disturbances in the regular electrical activity present in given areas of the brain, studying the interactions between fast brain waves, recorded simultaneously and from many different brain regions, may provide more information of which brain areas are interacting during ictal and interictal activity.

Theta rhythm is the best synchronized electroencephalographic activity that can be recorded from the mammalian brain. Hippocampal formation is considered to be the main structure involved in the generation of this activity. Although detailed studies of the physiology and pharmacology of theta-band oscillations have been carried out since the early 1950s, the first demonstration of atropine-sensitive theta rhythm, recorded in completely deafferented hippocampal slices of a rat, was performed in the second half of the 1980s. Since the discovery of cholinergically induced in vitro theta rhythm recorded from hippocampal formation slices, the central mechanisms underlying theta generation have been successfully studied in in vitro conditions. Most of these experiments were focused on the basic question regarding the similarities between the cholinergically induced theta activity and theta rhythm examined in vivo. The results of numerous in vitro experiments strongly suggest that cholinergically induced theta rhythm recorded in hippocampal slices is a useful analogue of theta observed in intact animals, and could be helpful in searching for the mechanisms of oscillations and synchrony in the central nervous system neuronal networks. The objective of the present review is to discuss the main results of experiments concerning theta oscillations recorded in in vitro conditions. It is our intent to provide, on the basis of these results, the characteristics of essential mechanisms underlying the generation of atropine-sensitive in vitro theta.

Hippocampal and Neocortical Oscillatory Contributions to Visuospatial Binding and Comparison	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; theta; rhythm; hippocampus; short-term memory	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-THETA; VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FMRI; ACTIVATIONS; MAINTENANCE; PARIETAL	Over 50 years of research has revealed a critical role for the hippocampus in the formation of long-term declarative memories. More recent evidence has specified the functions of the hippocampus as the binding and comparison of memory representations that may be used under shorter, as well as longer, delays (Olsen, Moses, Riggs, & Ryan, 2012). Hippocampal neural oscillations (e.g., theta rhythm) have been studied extensively in animals; however, the oscillations that underlie binding, comparison, and their relationship to memory performance remain to be fully explored in humans. Here magnetoencephalography was used to examine theta oscillations within the hippocampus and cortex to address this critical gap in the literature. The task consisted of (a) an encoding phase in which participants had to integrate the relative spatial positions among 3 sequentially presented objects, (b) a delay phase, and (c) a test phase in which all study objects were presented simultaneously in novel locations, and participants had to indicate whether the relative positions had changed. Theta power in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) increased across encoding and delay periods during which binding and maintenance processes dominate, while comparison of spatial relations at test was associated with greater theta power in right lateral PFC and intraparietal sulcus for manipulated versus intact trials. Critically, relational memory was positively related to hippocampal theta power increases across the encoding period. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of hippocampal theta in the incremental formation and retention of relations across space and time.

Spontaneous and electrically modulated spatiotemporal dynamics of the neocortical slow oscillation and associated local fast activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Anesthesia; Gamma; Memory consolidation; Oscillatory coupling; Slow wave sleep; Urethane	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZATION; HZ; MECHANISMS; RHYTHMS; STATE; EEG	The neocortical slow oscillation (SO; similar to 1 Hz) of non-REM sleep and anesthesia reflects synchronized network activity composed of alternating active and silent (ON/OFF) phases at the local network and cellular level. The SO itself shows self-organized spatiotemporal dynamics as it appears to originate at unique foci on each cycle and then propagates across the cortical surface. During sleep, this rhythm is relevant for neuroplastic processes mediating memory consolidation especially since its enhancement by slow, rhythmic electrical fields improves subsequent recall. However, the neurobiological mechanism by which spontaneous or enhanced SO activity might operate on memory traces is unknown. Here we show a series of original results, using cycle to cycle tracking across multiple neocortical sites in urethane anesthetized rats: The spontaneous spatiotemporal dynamics of the SO are complex, showing interfering propagation patterns in the anterior-to-posterior plane. These patterns compete for expression and tend to alternate following phase resets that take place during the silent OFF phase of the SO. Applying sinusoidal electrical field stimulation to the anterior pole of the cerebral cortex progressively entrained local field, gamma, and multi-unit activity at all sites, while disrupting the coordination of endogenous SO activity. Field stimulation also biased propagation in the anterior-to-posterior direction and more notably, enhanced the long-range gamma synchrony between cortical regions. These results are the first to show that changes to slow wave dynamics cause enhancements in high frequency cortico-cortical communication and provide mechanistic clues into how the SO is relevant for sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

Recently, brain-switches based on the beta rebound following motor imagery of a single limb effector have been investigated as basic BCIs due to their good performance with limited electrodes, and brief training session requirements. Here, a BCI is proposed which expands the methodology of brain-switches to design an interface composed of multiple brain-controlled buttons. The algorithm is designed as a system paced interface which can recognise 2 intentional-control tasks and a no-control state based on the activity during and following motor imagery in only 3 electroencephalogram channels. An online experiment was performed over 6 subjects to validate the algorithm, and the results show that a working BCI can be trained from a single calibration session and that the post motor imagery features are both informative and robust over multiple sessions.

Relationships between electroencephalographic spectral peaks across frequency bands	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; spectra; peaks; mean-field model; neural field theory; harmonic frequencies	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN DYNAMICS; ALPHA RHYTHMS; MODEL; EEG; NETWORKS; STATES; PARAMETERS	The degree to which electroencephalographic spectral peaks are independent, and the relationships between their frequencies have been debated. A novel fitting method was used to determine peak parameters in the range 2-35 Hz from a large sample of eyes-closed spectra, and their interrelationships were investigated. Findings werecompared with a mean-field model of thalamocortical activity, which predicts near-harmonic relationships between peaks. The subject set consisted of 1424 healthy subjects from the Brain Resource International Database. Peaks in the theta range occurred on average near half the alpha peak frequency, while peaks in the beta range tended to occur near twice and three times the alpha peak frequency on an individual-subject basis. Moreover, for the majority of subjects, alpha peak frequencies were significantly positively correlated with frequencies of peaks in the theta and low and high beta ranges. Such a harmonic progression agrees semiquantitatively with theoretical predictions from the mean-field model. These findings indicate a common or analogous source for different rhythms, and help to define appropriate individual frequency bands for peak identification.	[van Albada, S.

Though recent results have seemed to justify the merits of such methods, little has been done to investigate the applicability of such measures to children. For our work, we used the approximate entropy (ApEn), a measure previously shown to correlate with changes in conscious state when applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG), and sought to confirm whether previously reported trends in adult ApEn values across wake and sleep were present in children. Besides validating the prior findings that ApEn decreases from wake to sleep (including wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep) in adults, we found that previously reported ApEn decreases across vigilance states in adults were also present in children (ApEn trends for both age groups: wake > REM sleep > non-REM sleep). When comparing ApEn values between age groups, adults had significantly larger ApEn values than children during wakefulness. After the application of an 8 Hz high-pass filter to the EEG signal, ApEn values were recalculated. The number of electrodes with significant vigilance state effects dropped from all 109 electrodes with the original 1 Hz filter to 1 electrode with the 8 Hz filter. The number of electrodes with significant age effects dropped from 10 to 4. Our results support the notion that ApEn can reliably distinguish between vigilance states, with low-frequency sleep-related oscillations implicated as the driver of changes between vigilance states. We suggest that the observed differences between adult and child ApEn values during wake may reflect differences in connectivity between age groups, a factor which may be important in the use of EEG to measure consciousness.

SWDs are concomitant with a complete or partial impairment of consciousness, notably expressed by an interruption of ongoing behaviour together with a lack of conscious perception of external stimuli. It is largely considered that the paroxysmal synchronizations during the epileptic episode transiently render the thalamocortical system incapable of transmitting primary sensory information to the cortex. Here, we examined in young patients and in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established genetic model of absence epilepsy, how sensory inputs are processed in the related cortical areas during SWDs. In epileptic patients, visual event-related potentials (ERPs) were still present in the occipital EEG when the stimuli were delivered during seizures, with a significant increase in amplitude compared to interictal periods and a decrease in latency compared to that measured from non-epileptic subjects. Using simultaneous in vivo EEG and intracellular recordings from the primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS and non-epileptic rats, we found that ERPs and firing responses of related pyramidal neurons to whisker deflection were not significantly modified during SWDs. However, the intracellular subthreshold synaptic responses in somatosensory cortical neurons during seizures had larger amplitude compared to quiescent situations. These convergent findings from human patients and a rodent genetic model show the persistence of cortical responses to sensory stimulations during SWDs, indicating that the brain can still process external stimuli during absence seizures. They also demonstrate that the disruption of conscious perception during absences is not due to an obliteration of information transfer in the thalamocortical system. The possible mechanisms rendering the cortical operation ineffective for conscious perception are discussed, but their definite elucidation will require further investigations.

However, the neurological bases of these outcomes are not well established. Our study was designed to observe whether electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency, as a candidate biological marker, demonstrates significant changes in response to alterations of specific light parameters. Methods: Thirty-two healthy subjects performed cognitive tasks under four different polychromatic light conditions: a combination of two different levels of color temperature (2766K vs. 5918K) and brightness (300 lux vs. 600 lux). Spectrum analyses were performed on alpha frequency. Results: Subjects reported that they felt more pleasant in bright conditions and more relaxed in warm color temperature conditions. Our findings indicate that alpha power increases in warm, low-light and cool, high-light conditions, and there is a significant interaction between color temperature and brightness. Conclusion: EEGs might serve as a useful biological marker for further research related to the effects of polychromatic light on cognitive function.

Neurophysiological signals as potential translatable biomarkers for modulation of metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Polysomnography; Quantitative electroencephalography; mGluR5; Rat; Anxiety	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; SLEEP; RAT; EEG; ANTAGONIST; BEHAVIOR; C-11-ABP688; PREGABALIN; COGNITION	The Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is widely distributed in the brain with dense expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. These receptors have been implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Fragile X syndrome, addiction, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's disease and neuropathic pain. The present study evaluated the effects of the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) 4-difluoromethoxy-3-(pyridine-2-ylethynyl)phenyl)5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-6(7H)-yl methanone (GRN-529) and methyl (3aR,4S,7aR)-4-hydroxy-4-[(3-methylphenyl)ethynyl]octahydro-1H-indole-1-carboxylate (AFQ056) on polysomnographic (PSG) and quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures in freely moving rats. Furthermore, the anxiolytic profile of GRN-529 was characterized in anesthetized rats by measuring stimulation-induced hippocampal theta oscillation. The present findings demonstrate that inhibition of mGluR5 via its allosteric site profoundly modulates high-level neuronal network activities as indicated by changes in sleep-wake activity and power distribution of qEEG. Both GRN-529 and AFQ056 reduced the total time spent in rapid-eye movement with AFQ056 producing a significant increase in wakefulness at the highest dose tested. Additionally, qEEG revealed significant compound-induced increases in delta power concomitant with more subtle decreases in theta and alpha band power. Receptor occupancy (RO) studies revealed that GRN-529 and AFQ056 at all doses resulted in over 45% mGluR5 occupancy. Furthermore, GRN-529 dose-dependently decreased elicited hippocampal theta frequency, consistent with previous findings using clinically active anxiolytic compounds. The described changes in neurophysiological signals identified in freely moving rats may be considered suitable translational biomarkers for the clinical evaluation of mGluR5 NAMs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, many readers still view e-books as less readable than print books. The present study thus used combined EEG and eyetracking measures in order to test whether reading from digital media requires higher cognitive effort than reading conventional books. Young and elderly adults read short texts on three different reading devices: a paper page, an e-reader and a tablet computer and answered comprehension questions about them while their eye movements and EEG were recorded. The results of a debriefing questionnaire replicated previous findings in that participants overwhelmingly chose the paper page over the two electronic devices as their preferred reading medium. Online measures, by contrast, showed shorter mean fixation durations and lower EEG theta band voltage density - known to covary with memory encoding and retrieval - for the older adults when reading from a tablet computer in comparison to the other two devices. Young adults showed comparable fixation durations and theta activity for all three devices. Comprehension accuracy did not differ across the three media for either group. We argue that these results can be explained in terms of the better text discriminability (higher contrast) produced by the backlit display of the tablet computer. Contrast sensitivity decreases with age and degraded contrast conditions lead to longer reading times, thus supporting the conclusion that older readers may benefit particularly from the enhanced contrast of the tablet. Our findings thus indicate that people's subjective evaluation of digital reading media must be dissociated from the cognitive and neural effort expended in online information processing while reading from such devices.

Acupoint magnetic stimulation is an equivalent external stimulus for brain, which can be used as an important technical method to study the regulation mechanism of complex nervous system. It is of great significance to research the effect of acupoint magnetic stimulation on the structure and characteristics of brain functional network. Magnetic stimulation was applied to Neiguan (PC6) and the acquired EEG data were analyzed using dual-channel nonlinear method of mutual information in time domain. The corresponding brain functional networks before, during and after a magnetic stimulation were constructed and the characteristic parameters were studied based on the complex network theory. Results show that the average degree, average clustering coefficient and global efficiency of the brain functional network were increased under magnetic stimulation frequency of 3 Hz, while the average path length was reduced. The small world attribution of the corresponding functional network was enhanced, which made the information transfer among brain regions more efficiently. The brain functional networks under acupoint magnetic stimulation is studied for the first time as far as we know, which provides a new idea and approach to investigate the effect and regulation mechanism of transcutaneous acupoint magnetic stimulation to the complex nervous system.

Oscillatory alpha-band suppression mechanisms during the rapid attentional shifts required to perform an anti-saccade task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vision; Oscillations; Attention; Cueing; EEG; Electrophysiology; High-density electrical mapping	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; TIME-COURSE; INHIBITION; PHASE; DISCRIMINATION; MODULATION; DEPLOYMENT	Neuroimaging has demonstrated anatomical overlap between covert and overt attention systems, although behavioral and electrophysiological studies have suggested that the two systems do not rely on entirely identical circuits or mechanisms. In a parallel line of research, topographically-specific modulations of alpha-band power (similar to 8-14 Hz) have been consistently correlated with anticipatory states during tasks requiring covert attention shifts. These tasks, however, typically employ cue-target-interval paradigms where attentional processes are examined across relatively protracted periods of time and not at the rapid timescales implicated during overt attention tasks. The anti-saccade task, where one must first covertly attend for a peripheral target, before executing a rapid overt attention shift (i.e. a saccade) to the opposite side of space, is particularly well-suited for examining the rapid dynamics of overt attentional deployments. Here, we asked whether alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms would also be associated With these very rapid overt shifts, potentially representing a common neural mechanism across overt and covert attention systems. High-density electroencephalography in conjunction with infra-red eye-tracking was recorded while participants engaged in both pro- and anti-saccade task blocks. Alpha power, time-locked to saccade onset, showed three distinct phases of significantly lateralized topographic shifts, all occurring within a period of less than 1 s, closely reflecting the temporal dynamics of anti-saccade performance. Only two such phases were observed during the pro-saccade task These data point to substantially more rapid temporal dynamics of alpha-band suppressive mechanisms than previously established, and implicate oscillatory alpha-band activity as a common mechanism across both overt and covert attentional deployments.

J Appl Physiol 114: 896-904, 2013. First published February 7, 2013; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00942.2012.-Oscillatory activity in the sensorimotor cortex is coherent with 15-35 Hz band (beta-band) muscle activity during tonic isometric voluntary contractions. In human subjects with higher corticomuscular coherence, prominent grouped discharge associated with a significant silent period was observed in electromyographic (EMG) signals. We examined the potential effects of beta-band corticomuscular coupling on new ballistic movement as assessed by reaction time (RT). First, we quantified the coherence between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals over the sensorimotor cortex and rectified EMG signals from the tibialis anterior muscle during tonic isometric voluntary dorsiflexion at 30% of maximal effort in 15 healthy subjects. Subjects were divided into 2 groups [i.e., those with significant EEG-EMG coherence (COH+, n = 8) and those with no significant coherence (COH-, n = 7)]. Next, subjects performed ballistic contractions from a preliminary state of sustained contractions in reaction to auditory signals. RT was defined as the interval between the signal and the response onset measured by force. There were no intersubject differences in RT between COH+ and COH-. However, when the trials performed by COH+ subjects were divided into 2 groups depending on whether clear grouped discharge in the beta-band was observed in the EMG (GD+ or GD-) just prior to the reaction, RT was significantly longer in the GD+ than in the GD- trials. We found that the magnitude of EEG-EMG coherence just before the reaction was significantly greater in the GD+ than in the GD- trials. These results suggest that generation of a new movement is delayed when corticomuscular coupling is elevated.

Electroencephalography of response inhibition tasks: Functional networks and cognitive contributions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Response inhibition; Stop signal; Go/no-go; N200; N2; P300; P3	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MIDLINE THETA-RHYTHM; CUED-GO/NOGO TASK; GO-NOGO TASKS; ERP COMPONENTS; STIMULUS PROBABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY	Response inhibition paradigms, as for example stop signal and go/no-go tasks, are often used to study cognitive control processes. Because of the apparent demand to stop a motor reaction, the electrophysiological responses evoked by stop and no-go trials have sometimes likewise been interpreted as indicators of inhibitory processes. Recent research, however, suggests a richer conceptual background. Evidence denotes an association of a frontal-midline N200/theta oscillations with premotor cognitive processes such as conflict monitoring or response program updating, and an anterior P300/delta oscillations with response-related, evaluative processing stages, probably the evaluation of motor inhibition'. However, the data are still insufficient to unambiguously relate these electroencephalographic measures to specific inhibitory functions. Beta band activity only recently has become a focus of attention in this task context because of its association with the motor system and regions involved in inhibitory control. Its functional role in response inhibition tasks needs further exploration though. Hence, as things stand, any deduction of differences regarding actual inhibitory capabilities or loads between subject groups or conditions based on electroencephalographic measures has to be treated with caution.

As several studies have explored phase coherence in the epileptic brain, in relation to lower rhythms (< 80 Hz), we have applied WPC analysis to both slow and fast neuronal rhythms-in the 1400 Hz frequency range-to study their respective temporal and spatial coherence patterns. In analyzing the WPC profiles generated from all possible electrode pairings, two prominent patterns of phase coherence were observed in select electrode pairings on the implanted patient grids: during interictal activity, strong coherence was observed in the 8-11 Hz frequency range, while increased coherence was observed in activity > 80 Hz during seizure episodes. Furthermore, electrodes on the grid with elevated coherence in faster rhythms during seizures showed overlap with areas possessing elevated low-frequency coherence during interictal activity. As several studies have identified ictal fast activities as possible seizure biomarkers, the interictal coherence patterns observed here may also help in defining seizure-related regions of interest in the epileptic brain.

Recent findings Great strides are being achieved in the presurgical evaluation and planning for epilepsy surgery, including fundamental advances in imaging and neurophysiology. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrates that early surgery for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is superior to medical therapy. The enduring benefits of surgery continue to be demonstrated, particularly after TLE surgery. However, studies examining the long-term outcomes after extratemporal lobe epilepsy surgery are scarce. Surgery is generally associated with an improvement in depression, but mostly in those with good surgical outcome. Complications from invasive monitoring or after epilepsy surgery are generally temporary, or limited in their symptomatology. One area in need of prospective studies is the topic of antiepileptic drug withdrawal after epilepsy surgery (Who? When? How?). Despite its proven effectiveness, epilepsy surgery continues to be underutilized, but new tools for health professionals are emerging to guide appropriate surgical referrals. Summary Important contributions to the field of epilepsy surgery are discussed, in particular emerging imaging (fMRI) and neurophysiological (high-frequency oscillations) techniques. Epilepsy surgery is effective, well tolerated but still underutilized.

We propose that sleep's primary function is to allow individual neurons to perform prophylactic cellular maintenance. Just as muscle cells must rest after strenuous exercise to prevent long-term damage, brain cells must rest after intense synaptic activity. We suggest that periods of reduced synaptic input ('off periods' or 'down states') are necessary for such maintenance. This in turn requires a state of globally synchronized neuronal activity, reduced sensory input and behavioural immobility - the well-known manifestations of sleep.

How this anticipation is reflected in neural oscillatory activity and how it relates to activity within the autonomic nervous system is thus far unknown. Recently, we found that viewing needle pricks compared with Q-tip touches increases the pupil dilation response (PDR) and perceived unpleasantness of electrical stimuli. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to investigate whether anticipatory oscillatory activity predicts the unpleasantness of electrical stimuli and PDR while viewing a needle approaching a hand that is perceived as one's own. We presented video clips of needle pricks and Q-tip touches, and delivered spatiotemporally aligned painful and nonpainful intracutaneous electrical stimuli. The perceived unpleasantness of electrical stimuli and the PDR were enhanced when participants viewed needle pricks compared with Q-tip touches. Source reconstruction using linear beamforming revealed reduced alpha-band activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and fusiform gyrus before the onset of electrical stimuli when participants viewed needle pricks compared with Q-tip touches. Moreover, alpha-band activity in the PCC predicted PDR on a single trial level. The anticipatory reduction of alpha-band activity in the PCC may reflect a neural mechanism that serves to protect the body from forthcoming harm by facilitating the preparation of adequate defense responses.

An in vivo technique for investigating electrophysiological effects of centrally administered drugs on single neurons and network behaviour	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electrophysiology; ICV injections; EEG recording; Firing patterns; Cross correlation; Auto correlation; Waveform correlation	SUPPRESSES ABSENCE SEIZURES; GENETIC RAT MODEL; WAVE DISCHARGES; OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY; HISTOGRAMS; FEATURES; CAT; HZ	Single neuronal juxtacellular recording with simultaneous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) in whole-animal preparations in vivo has allowed the study of the behaviour of individual neurons in relation to whole brain activity. Data on single neuron firing, neural synchrony, network behaviour and their responses to pharmacological agents can be obtained with dual recordings. However, pharmacological effects on cellular and network activity during paired single-unit recordings have not been possible due to the difficulties in maintaining recordings of two cells for a prolonged period. Here, we describe a method of maintaining stable dual cell juxtacellular recordings from distinct brain regions, allowing the assessment of single unit activity before, during and after the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of drugs. Data collection using this technique allows correlation both between the two cells and with whole-brain EEG, and their responses to pharmacological interventions. This is particularly useful for the investigation of the effects of anti-epileptic drugs on animal models of epilepsy, where single unit activity of two cells from distinct regions can be correlated with each other and with whole-brain activity during pre-ictal, ictal and interictal states. We also describe standardised analytical methods of quantifying cell firing patterns, the rhythmicity of individual neurons and the synchronicity of firing between two neurons in ictal and interictal periods and their responses to drug exposure.

We used magnetoencephalography to measure task-related local functional connectivity, as manifested by coupling between the phase of alpha oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations, in the fusiform face area (FFA) of individuals diagnosed with ASD and typically developing individuals while they viewed neutral faces, emotional faces, and houses. We also measured task-related long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and the rest of the cortex during the same paradigm. In agreement with earlier studies, long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and three distant cortical regions was reduced in the ASD group. However, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis in the field, we found that local functional connectivity within the FFA was also reduced in individuals with ASD when viewing faces. Furthermore, the strength of long-range functional connectivity was directly correlated to the strength of local functional connectivity in both groups; thus, long-range and local connectivity were reduced proportionally in the ASD group. Finally, the magnitude of local functional connectivity correlated with ASD severity, and statistical classification using local and long-range functional connectivity data identified ASD diagnosis with 90% accuracy. These results suggest that failure to entrain neuronal assemblies fully both within and across cortical regions may be characteristic of ASD.

A Neocortical Delta Rhythm Facilitates Reciprocal Interlaminar Interactions via Nested Theta Rhythms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SLEEP SLOW WAVES; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; LOCAL SLEEP; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; STIMULATION; DEPRIVATION; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY	Delta oscillations (1-4 Hz) associate with deep sleep and are implicated in memory consolidation and replay of cortical responses elicited during wake states. A potent local generator has been characterized in thalamus, and local generators in neocortex have been suggested. Here we demonstrate that isolated rat neocortex generates delta rhythms in conditions mimicking the neuromodulatory state during deep sleep (low cholinergic and dopaminergic tone). The rhythm originated in an NMDA receptor-driven network of intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons in layer 5, activating a source of GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition. In contrast, regular spiking (RS) neurons in layer 5 generated theta-frequency outputs. In layer 2/3 principal cells, outputs from IB cells associated with IPSPs, whereas those from layer 5RS neurons related to nested bursts of theta-frequency EPSPs. Both interlaminar spike and field correlations revealed a sequence of events whereby sparse spiking in layer 2/3 was partially reflected back from layer 5 on each delta period. We suggest that these reciprocal, interlaminar interactions may represent a "Helmholtz machine"-like process to control synaptic rescaling during deep sleep.

Neurophysiological and behavioral responses to music therapy in vegetative and minimally conscious states	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; music therapy; disorders of consciousness; assessment; diagnosis; brain injury; vegetative state; minimally conscious state	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SENSORY MODALITY ASSESSMENT; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; REHABILITATION TECHNIQUE; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; DISORDERS; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Assessment of awareness for those with disorders of consciousness is a challenging undertaking, due to the complex presentation of the population. Debate surrounds whether behavioral assessments provide greatest accuracy in diagnosis compared to neuro-imaging methods, and despite developments in both, misdiagnosis rates remain high. Music therapy may be effective in the assessment and rehabilitation with this population due to effects of musical stimuli on arousal, attention, and emotion, irrespective of verbal or motor deficits. However, an evidence base is lacking as to which procedures are most effective. To address this, a neurophysiological and behavioral study was undertaken comparing electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability, respiration, and behavioral responses of 20 healthy subjects with 21 individuals in vegetative or minimally conscious states (VS or MCS). Subjects were presented with live preferred music and improvised music entrained to respiration (procedures typically used in music therapy), recordings of disliked music, white noise, and silence. ANOVA tests indicated a range of significant responses (p <= 0.05) across healthy subjects corresponding to arousal and attention in response to preferred music including concurrent increases in respiration rate with globally enhanced EEG power spectra responses (p = 0.05-0.0001) across frequency bandwidths. Whilst physiological responses were heterogeneous across patient cohorts, significant post hoc EEG amplitude increases for stimuli associated with preferred music were found for frontal midline theta in six VS and four MCS subjects, and frontal alpha in three VS and four MCS subjects (p = 0.05-0.0001). Furthermore, behavioral data showed a significantly increased blink rate for preferred music (p = 0.029) within the VS cohort. Two VS cases are presented with concurrent changes (p <= 0.05) across measures indicative of discriminatory responses to both music therapy procedures. A third MCS case study is presented highlighting how more sensitive selective attention may distinguish MCS from VS. The findings suggest that further investigation is warranted to explore the use of music therapy for prognostic indicators, and its potential to support neuroplasticity in rehabilitation programs.

We suggested that this NT170 latency effect may result from phase reset of an ongoing theta rhythm by a parahippocampal system for spatial navigation. Here we tested several predictions that follow from this proposal, namely, that the effect is observed only when the rewards are presented in a spatial environment, that it is sensitive to individual differences in spatial ability, that it is localizable to the right parahippocampal region, and that it is consistent with partial phase resetting of an ongoing theta rhythm. These results hold promise for integrating ERP measures of spatial navigation with extensive animal, human, and computational literatures on parahippocampal function. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Herein, we studied ictal cerebral blood flow changes, seizure electrical activities, and clinical signs employing simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings in a brain tumor patient with SMA seizures. Increased cerebral blood flow was observed from the SOZ in the ipsilateral SMA and spread to the ipsilateral premotor cortex, ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, and also the contralateral hemisphere. These propagation patterns were concordant with ictal ECoG seizure activities and clinical signs. Removal of the SOZ and surrounding areas, where the higher blood flow and higher frequency oscillations had been identified, achieved a good outcome for this patient. Our ictal NIRS-ECoG technique is robust and useful for detecting the SOZ and seizure propagations. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

The four groups of flickering buttons were set in the graphical user interface. Each group contained one large button in the center and eight small buttons around it, all of which flashed at a fixed frequency (e. g., 7.5 Hz) to evoke SSVEP. At the same time, the four large buttons of the four groups were intensified through shape and color changes in a random order to produce P300 potential. During the control state, the user focused on a desired group of buttons (target buttons) to evoke P300 potential and SSVEP, simultaneously. Discrimination between the control and idle states was based on the detection of both P300 and SSVEP on the same group of buttons. As an application, this method was used to produce a "go/stop" command in real-time wheelchair control. Several experiments were conducted, and data analysis results showed that combining P300 potential and SSVEP significantly improved the performance of the BCI system in terms of detection accuracy and response time.

A high density EEG study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Event-related desynchronization; Mu-rhythm; Sensori-motor response; Reading; Symbols; Scribbles	PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; NUMBERS; ALEXIA	Previous research has reported that the perception of written language symbols activates the cortical motor hand representation of the dominant hemisphere also found to be activated during the writing of these symbols. It has been suggested that such motor activation supports reading. Nevertheless, the precise circumstances leading to such activation are still unknown. For instance, several studies suggested that motor activation necessarily depends on specific sensory-motor experience with the stimuli. Some results, however, also indicated that untrained stimuli can elicit the response. Moreover, due to the methods used so far, little is known about the temporal course of the motor activity. Our study explored these open questions using high-density EEG. We measured central alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) as a marker of cortical motor activation during the observation of Roman letters (alphabet of participants' mother language), Chinese characters (not familiar to participants), and scribbles. Our results show that the cortical motor system is activated during the perception of all three stimuli in both hemispheres, with ERD stronger in the left (dominant) hemisphere. A significant difference of ERD time-course was observed in the left hemisphere between the observation of symbols (letters and characters) and scribbles. Scribbles elicited significantly faster resynchronization of central alpha than symbols. We suggest that ERD results are due to recognizing all stimuli as traces of hand gestures. Furthermore, differences in ERD found between symbols and scribbles might depend either on visuo-motor training, separating symbols from scribbles, or on stimuli specific features marking their status as either language symbols or scribbles.

To examine whether the cortical activities in DMN regions show significant difference between mild AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), electrophysiological responses were analyzed from 21 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 21 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients during an eyes closed, resting-state condition. The spectral power and functional connectivity of the DMN were estimated using a minimum norm estimate (MNE) combined with fast Fourier transform and imaginary coherence analysis. Our results indicated that source-based EEG maps of resting-state activity showed alterations of cortical spectral power in mild AD when compared to MCI. These alterations are characteristic of attenuated alpha or beta activities in the DMN, as are enhanced delta or theta activities in the medial temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. With regard to altered synchronization in AD, altered functional interconnections were observed as specific connectivity patterns of connection hubs in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal regions. Moreover, posterior theta and alpha power and altered connectivity in the medial temporal lobe correlated significantly with scores obtained on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In conclusion, EEG is a useful tool for investigating the DMN in the brain and differentiating early stage AD and MCI patients. This is a promising finding; however, further large-scale studies are needed.

Electrophysiological Correlations of Morphological Restructuring in Experimental Local Ischemia of Different Severity in the Rat Sensorimotor Cortex	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						neurodegeneration; ischemia; electroencephalogram; dendrites; hemispheric cortex	DEATH	Local cerebrovascular disorders were modeled by reversible photochemical clotting of hemispheric cortical vessels. Mild ischemia led to reversible edema in the surface layers of the cortex: cytotoxic edema of the neuropile, primarily of the distal dendrites. This status led to an increase in the lower delta rhythm frequency band power. After administration of systemic anesthetic, delta rhythm appeared sooner in the ischemic foci than in intact cortical areas. More severe ischemia led to the appearance of dark and pyknotic neurons and reduction of oscillation power in all EEG spectrum bands. Restructuring of primarily dendrites caused by local moderate ischemia of the surface cortical layers at the early stage of neurodegenerative processes stimulated the inhibitory recovery processes.

Highly interconnected brain regions (so-called 'hubs') seem to be important in these epileptic networks. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG recordings are recently discovered biomarkers that can identify the epileptogenic area and are thought to result from altered neuronal interactions. We studied whether the epileptogenic zone (identified by HFOs and seizure onset zone) is associated with pathological hubs. Bilateral depth electrode recordings from the hippocampus and amygdala were available from twelve patients suspected of temporal lobe epilepsy. HFOs, classified as ripples (80-250Hz) and fast ripples (250-500Hz), and epileptiform spikes were marked for all patients in a five-minute epoch of slow-wave sleep. For each channel, we computed hub-measures from a period without epileptiform spikes and found that the epileptogenic zone was associated with a decreased hub-value in the theta frequency band. The amount of HFOs, especially fast ripples, was negatively correlated with the hub-value per channel. Results from post-hoc analyses of other frequency bands, particularly the broad- and gamma frequency band, pointed in the same direction as the results for the theta frequency band. These findings suggest a pathological functional 'isolation' of the epileptogenic zone in the interictal state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Broadband neurophysiological abnormalities in the medial prefrontal region of the default-mode network in adults with ADHD	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						attention; stimulant; gamma; theta; magnetoencephalography; MEG; delta; ADD	FREQUENCY EEG OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; DEACTIVATION; SYNCHRONY; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER	Previous investigations of the default-mode network (DMN) in persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have shown reduced functional connectivity between the anterior and posterior aspects. This finding was originally demonstrated in adults with ADHD, then in youth with ADHD, and has been tentatively linked to ultra low frequency oscillations within the DMN. The current study evaluates the specificity of DMN abnormalities to neuronal oscillations in the ultra low frequency range, and examines the regional specificity of these DMN aberrations in medicated and unmedicated adults with, and those without ADHD. An individually matched sample of adults with and without ADHD completed 6-minute sessions of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants with ADHD were known responders to stimulant medications and completed two sessions (predrug/postdrug). MEG data were coregistered to the participant's MRI, corrected for head motion, fitted to a regional-level source model, and subjected to spectral analyses to extract neuronal population activity in regions of the DMN. The unmedicated adults with ADHD exhibited broadband deficits in medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), but not other DMN regions compared to adults without ADHD. Unmedicated patients also showed abnormal cross-frequency coupling in the gamma range between the MPFC and posterior cingulate areas, and disturbed balance within the DMN as activity in posterior regions was stronger than frontal regions at beta and lower frequencies, which dissipated at higher -frequencies. Administration of pharmacotherapy significantly increased prefrontal alpha activity (814 Hz) in adults with ADHD, and decreased the cross-frequency gamma coupling. These results indicate that neurophysiological aberrations in the DMN of patients with ADHD are not limited to ultra slow oscillations, and that they may be primarily attributable to abnormal broadband activity in the MPFC.

Response power, strength of entrainment and preferred phase of entrainment in the delta and theta frequency bands were compared between groups. The quality of stimulus representation was also measured using cross-correlation of the stimulus envelope with the neural response. The data showed a significant group difference in the preferred phase of entrainment in the delta band in response to the auditory and audio-visual stimulus streams. A different preferred phase has significant implications for the quality of speech information that is encoded neurally, as it implies enhanced neuronal processing (phase alignment) at less informative temporal points in the incoming signal. Consistent with this possibility, children, who showed a trend for larger peak r-values and significantly later lags in peak r-values compared to participants with dyslexia. Significant relationships between both peak r-values and peak lags were found with behavioral measures of reading. The data indicate that the auditory temporal reference frame for speech processing is atypical in developmental dyslexia, with low frequency (delta) oscillations entraining to a different and could underlie the cognitive impairments in phonological representation that are the behavioral hallmark of this developmental disorder across languages.

Methods: We analyzed data from 77 epileptic patients ranging 4-56 years in age. We determined the effects of seizure-onset zone, electrode location, and patient-age upon gamma-augmentation elicited by an auditory-naming task. Results: Gamma-augmentation was less frequently elicited within seizure-onset sites compared to other sites. Regardless of age, gamma-augmentation most often involved the 80-100 Hz frequency band. Gamma-augmentation initially involved bilateral superior-temporal regions, followed by left-side dominant involvement in the middle-temporal, medial-temporal, inferior-frontal, dorsolateral-premotor, and medial-frontal regions and concluded with bilateral inferior-Rolandic involvement. Compared to younger patients, those older than 10 years had a larger proportion of left dorsolateral-premotor and right inferior-frontal sites showing gamma-augmentation. The incidence of a post-operative language deficit requiring speech therapy was predicted by the number of resected sites with gamma-augmentation in the superior-temporal, inferior-frontal, dorsolateral-premotor, and inferior-Rolandic regions of the left hemisphere assumed to contain essential language function (r(2) = 0.59; p = 0.001; odds ratio = 6.04 [95% confidence-interval: 2.26-16.15]). Conclusions: Auditory-language-related gamma-augmentation can provide additional information useful to localize the primary language areas. Significance: These results derived from a large sample of patients support the utility of auditory-language-related gamma-augmentation in presurgical evaluation.

On the role of crossmodal prediction in audiovisual emotion perception	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-modal prediction; emotion; multisensory; EEG; audiovisual	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL PROCESSES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; VISUAL SPEECH; TIME-COURSE; INTEGRATION; BINDING; HUMANS	Humans rely on multiple sensory modalities to determine the emotional state of others. In fact, such multisensory perception may be one of the mechanisms explaining the ease and efficiency by which others' emotions are recognized. But how and when exactly do the different modalities interact? One aspect in multisensory perception that has received increasing interest in recent years is the concept of cross-modal prediction. In emotion perception, as in most other settings, visual information precedes the auditory information. Thereby, leading in visual information can facilitate subsequent auditory processing. While this mechanism has often been described in audiovisual speech perception, so far it has not been addressed in audiovisual emotion perception. Based on the current state of the art in (a) cross-modal prediction and (b) multisensory emotion perception research, we propose that it is essential to consider the former in order to fully understand the latter. Focusing on electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies, we provide a brief overview of the current research in both fields. In discussing these findings, we suggest that emotional visual information may allow more reliable predicting of auditory information compared to non-emotional visual information. In support of this hypothesis, we present a re-analysis of a previous data set that shows an inverse correlation between the N1 EEG response and the duration of visual emotional, but not non-emotional information. If the assumption that emotional content allows more reliable predicting can be corroborated in future studies, cross-modal prediction is a crucial factor in our understanding of multisensory emotion perception.

Effects of Suvorexant, an Orexin Receptor Antagonist, on Sleep Parameters as Measured by Polysomnography in Healthy Men	SLEEP			English	Article						Suvorexant; MK-4305; orexin; orexin receptor antagonist; insomnia; polysomnography; randomized trial	PRIMARY INSOMNIA; HYPOCRETINS OREXINS; EEG; PHARMACOLOGY; WAKEFULNESS; NARCOLEPSY; DISORDERS; SB-649868; PROMOTION; SCHEDULE	Study Objectives: Suvorexant (MK-4305) is an orexin receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of insomnia. This report describes the effects of nighttime administration of suvorexant on polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters in healthy young men. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover PSG study, followed by an additional 5th period to assess pharmacokinetics. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Healthy young men between 18 and 45 years of age (22 enrolled, 19 completed). Interventions: Periods 1-4: suvorexant (10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) or placebo 1 h before nighttime PSG recording. Period 5: suvorexant 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Measurements and Results: In Periods 1-4, overnight sleep parameters were recorded by PSG and next-morning residual effects were assessed by psychomotor performance tests and subjective assessments. Statistically significant sleep-promoting effects were observed with all doses of suvorexant compared to placebo. Suvorexant 50 mg and 100 mg significantly decreased latency to persistent sleep and wake after sleep onset time, and increased sleep efficiency. Suvorexant 10 mg significantly decreased wake after sleep onset time. There were no statistically significant effects of suvorexant on EEG frequency bands including delta (slow wave) activity based on power spectral analysis. Suvorexant was well tolerated. There was no evidence of next-day residual effects for suvorexant 10 mg. Suvorexant 50 mg statistically significantly reduced subjective alertness, and suvorexant 100 mg significantly increased reaction time and reduced subjective alertness. There were no statistically significant effects of any suvorexant dose on digit symbol substitution test performance. In Period 5, plasma samples of suvorexant were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The median T-max was 3 hours and apparent terminal t(1/2) was 9-13 hours. Conclusions: In healthy young men without sleep disorders, suvorexant promoted sleep with some evidence of residual effects at the highest doses.

Information related to neural networks has elucidated the nonlinear dynamical complexity in brain signals over a range of temporal scales. The recent advent of nonlinear analytic methods, which have served for the quantitative description of the brain signal complexity, has provided new insights into aberrant neural connectivity in many mental disorders. Although many studies have underpinned aberrant neural connectivity, findings related to complexity behavior are still inconsistent. This inconsistency might result from (i) heterogeneity in mental disorders, (ii) analytical issues, (iii) interference of typical development and aging. First, most mental disorders are heterogeneous in their clinical feature or intrinsic pathological mechanisms. Second, neurophysiologic output signals from complex brain connectivity might be characterized with multiple time scales or frequencies. Finally, age-related brain complexity changes must be considered when investigating pathological brain because typical brain complexity is not constant across generations. Future systematic studies addressing these issues will greatly expand our knowledge of neural connections and dynamics related to mental disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PAS-Induced Potentiation of Cortical-Evoked Activity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; long-term potentiation; neuroplasticity; paired associative stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK MODEL; PLASTICITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MECHANISMS	Neuroplasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are considered important mechanisms in learning and memory, and their disruption may be related to the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a brain stimulation paradigm that produces enhanced activity in the human motor cortex that may be related to LTP. In a group of 15 healthy participants, we report on the potentiation of cortical-evoked activity in the human DLPFC using the combination of PAS and electroencephalography. In contrast, a PAS control condition did not result in potentiation in another group of nine healthy participants. We also demonstrate that PAS-induced potentiation of cortical-evoked activity is characterized by anatomical specificity that is largely confined to the site of stimulation. Finally, we show that PAS results in potentiation of theta-and gamma-activity and theta-phase-gamma-amplitude coupling. These neurophysiological indices may be related to working memory, an important function of the DLPFC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of potentiation of cortical-evoked activity in the DLPFC. As this potentiation may be related to LTP, our findings provide a model through which neuroplasticity in health and disease states in the frontal cortex can be studied.

However, estimates on the number of photons eliciting conscious perception, based on signal detection theory, are systematically above these values after discounting by retinal losses. One possibility is that there is a trade-off between the limited motor resources available to living systems and the excellent reliability of the visual photoreceptors. On this view, the limits to sensory thresholds are not set by the individual reliability of the receptors within each sensory modality (as often assumed) but rather by the limited central processing and motor resources available to process the constant inflow of sensory information. To investigate this issue, we reproduced the classical experiment from Hetch aimed to determine the sensory threshold in human vision. We combined a careful physical control of the stimulus parameters with high temporal/spatial resolution recordings of EEG signals and behavioral variables over a relatively large sample of subjects (12). Contrarily to the idea that the limits to visual sensitivity are fully set by the statistical fluctuations in photon absorption on retinal photoreceptors we observed that the state of ongoing neural oscillations before any photon impinges the retina helps to determine if the responses of photoreceptors have access to central conscious processing. Our results suggest that motivational and attentional off-retinal mechanisms play a major role in reducing the QE efficiency of the human visual system when compared to the efficiency of isolated retinal photoreceptors. Yet, this mechanism might subserve adaptive behavior by enhancing the overall multisensory efficiency of the whole system composed by diverse reliable sensory modalities.

Information theoretic measures of network coordination in high-frequency scalp EEG reveal dynamic patterns associated with seizure termination	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epileptic seizure termination; High-frequency scalp EEG; Neuronal network coordination; Information theory	OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY; MARKER; ONSET; HZ	How a seizure terminates is still under-studied and, despite its clinical importance, remains an obscure phase of seizure evolution. Recent studies of seizure-related scalp EEGs at frequencies >100 Hz suggest that neural activity, in the form of oscillations and/or neuronal network interactions, may play an important role in preictal/ictal seizure evolution (Andrade-Valenca et al., 2011; Stamoulis et al., 2012). However, the role of high-frequency activity in seizure termination, is unknown, if it exists at all. Using information theoretic measures of network coordination, this study investigated ictal and immediate postictal neurodynamic interactions encoded in scalp EEGs from a relatively small sample of 8 patients with focal epilepsy and multiple seizures originating in temporal and/or frontal brain regions, at frequencies <= 100 Hz and >100 Hz, respectively. Despite some heterogeneity in the dynamics of these interactions, consistent patterns were also estimated. Specifically, in several seizures, linear or non-linear increase in high-frequency neuronal coordination during ictal intervals, coincided with a corresponding decrease in coordination at frequencies <100 Hz, suggesting a potential interference role of high-frequency activity, to disrupt abnormal ictal synchrony at lower frequencies. These changes in network synchrony started at least 20-30 s prior to seizure offset, depending on the seizure duration. Opposite patterns were estimated at frequencies <= 100 Hz in several seizures. These results raise the possibility that high-frequency interference may occur in the form of progressive network coordination during the ictal interval, which continues during the postictal interval. This may be one of several possible mechanisms that facilitate seizure termination. In fact, inhibition of pairwise interactions between EEGs by other signals in their spatial neighborhood, quantified by negative interaction information, was estimated at frequencies <= 100 Hz, at least in some seizures.

In this work we study how the aforementioned modular architecture changes with the progressive loss of vigilance occurring in the descent to deep sleep and we examine the relationship between the ensuing slow electroencephalographic rhythms and large-scale network modularity as measured with fMRI. Graph theoretical methods are used to analyze functional connectivity graphs obtained from fifty-five participants at wakefulness, light and deep sleep. Network modularity (a measure of functional segregation) was found to increase during deeper sleep stages but not in light sleep. By endowing functional networks with dynamical properties, we found a direct link between increased electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power (1-4 Hz) and a breakdown of inter-modular connectivity. Both EEG slowing and increased network modularity were found to quickly decrease during awakenings from deep sleep to wakefulness, in a highly coordinated fashion. Studying the modular structure itself by means of a permutation test, we revealed different module memberships when deep sleep was compared to wakefulness. Analysis of node roles in the modular structure revealed an increase in the number of locally well-connected nodes and a decrease in the number of globally well-connected hubs, which hinders interactions between separated functional modules. Our results reveal a well-defined sequence of changes in brain modular organization occurring during the descent to sleep and establish a close parallel between modularity alterations in large-scale functional networks (accessible through whole brain fMRI recordings) and the slowing of scalp oscillations (visible on EEG). The observed re-arrangement of connectivity might play an important role in the processes underlying loss of vigilance and sensory awareness during deep sleep. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The subjects were 12 children with DS. We retrospectively analyzed electro-clinical characteristics of AS. We analyzed a total of 102 ictal EEGs characterized by generalized spike-and-wave (GSW) and semiology of 78 video-taped AS. The mean age at the onset of AS and at the time of the study was 16.2 +/- 7.1 months and 40.3 +/- 22.1 months, respectively. Ictal EEG showed the focality of initial discharge in 49/102 (48%), a duration ranging from 2 to 180s (mean: 10.2 +/- 22.6 s; median: 4.0 s), frequency ranging from 2 to 4 Hz (median = 3.0 Hz), and irregular and disorganized GSW morphology in 66/102 (65%). AS manifested with eyelid-myoclonus and generalized myoclonus in 9/54 (17%) and 34/78(44%), respectively. In conclusion, AS in DS were characterized by an early-onset age, a high incidence of irregular and disorganized 3 Hz GSW morphology, and the frequent association of generalized myoclonic movement as well as the absence of automatism as compared to TAS. The results should be appreciated in the differential diagnosis of early-onset AS, the treatment of AS in DS and also a further clinical and genetic study for DS. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast with simple limb motor imagery, less work was reported about compound limb motor imagery which involves several parts of limbs. The goal of this study was to investigate the differences of the EEG patterns between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, and discuss the separability of multiple types of mental tasks. Methods: Ten subjects participated in the experiment involving three tasks of simple limb motor imagery (left hand, right hand, feet), three tasks of compound limb motor imagery (both hands, left hand combined with right foot, right hand combined with left foot) and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), power spectral entropy (PSE) and spatial distribution coefficient were adopted to analyze these seven EEG patterns. Then three algorithms of modified multi-class common spatial patterns (CSP) were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine (SVM). Results: The induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) affects more components within both alpha and beta bands resulting in more broad ERD bands at electrode positions C3, Cz and C4 during left/right hand combined with contralateral foot imagery, whose PSE values are significant higher than that of simple limb motor imagery. From the topographical distribution, simultaneous imagination of upper limb and contralateral lower limb certainly contributes to the activation of more areas on cerebral cortex. Classification result shows that multi-class stationary Tikhonov regularized CSP (Multi-sTRCSP) outperforms other two multi-class CSP methods, with the highest accuracy of 84% and mean accuracy of 70%. Conclusions: The work implies that there exist the separable differences between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, which can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

Single trial analysis of slow cortical potentials: a study on anticipation related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER COMMUNICATION; THOUGHT-TRANSLATION DEVICE; SELF-REGULATION; EEG; MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATIONS; HAND; CNV; ERP	Objective. Abundant literature suggests the use of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) in a wide spectrum of basic and applied neuroscience areas. Due to their low signal to noise ratio, these potentials are often studied using grand-average analysis, which conceals trial-to-trial information. Moreover, most of the single trial analysis methods in the literature are based on classical electroencephalogram (EEG) features ([1-30] Hz) and are likely to be unsuitable for SCPs that have different signal properties (such as having the signal's spectral content in the range [0.2-0.7] Hz). In this paper we provide insights into the selection of appropriate parameters for spectral and spatial filtering. Approach. We study anticipation related SCPs recorded using a web-browser application protocol and a full-band EEG (FbEEG) setup from 11 subjects on two different days. Main results. We first highlight the role of a bandpass with [0.1-1.0] Hz in comparison with common practices (e.g., either with full dc, just a lowpass, or with a minimal highpass cut-off around 0.05 Hz). Secondly, we suggest that a combination of spatial-smoothing filter and common average reference (CAR) is more suitable than the spatial filters often reported in the literature (e.g., re-referencing to an electrode, Laplacian or CAR alone). Thirdly, with the help of these preprocessing steps, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of linear classifiers across several days (AUC of 0.88 +/- 0.05 on average with a minimum of 0.81 +/- 0.03 and a maximum of 0.97 +/- 0.01). We also report the possibility of further improvements using a Bayesian fusion technique applied to electrode-specific classifiers. Significance. We believe the suggested spatial and spectral preprocessing methods are advantageous for grand-average and single trial analysis of SCPs obtained from EEG, MEG as well as for electrocorticogram. The use of these methods will impact basic neurophysiological studies as well as the use of SCPs in the design of neuroprosthetics.

The morphology of midcingulate cortex predicts frontal-midline theta neurofeedback success	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurofeedback success; brain structure; fm-theta enhancement; midcingulate cortex; cingulate bundle	GENDER-RELATED DIFFERENCES; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN-BRAIN; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EEG DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; ATTENTION	Humans differ in their ability to learn how to control their own brain activity by neurofeedback. However, neural mechanisms underlying these inter-individual differences, which may determine training success and associated cognitive enhancement, are not well-understood. Here, it is asked whether neurofeedback success of frontal-midline (fm) theta, an oscillation related to higher cognitive functions, could be predicted by the morphology of brain structures known to be critically involved in fm-theta generation. Nineteen young, right-handed participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging of T1-weighted brain images, and took part in an individualized, eight-session neurofeedback training in order to learn how to enhance activity in their fm-theta frequency band. Initial training success, measured at the second training session, was correlated with the final outcome measure. We found that the inferior, superior, and middle frontal cortices were not associated with training success. However, volume of the midcingulate cortex as well as volume and concentration of the underlying white matter structures act as predictor variables for the general responsiveness to training. These findings suggest a neuroanatomical foundation for the ability to learn to control one's own brain activity.

We examined the relative spectral power values for NREM and REM sleep separately in 19 individuals with nightmare disorder and 21 healthy controls, based on polysomnographic recordings of the second nights' laboratory sleep. Nightmare subjects compared to controls exhibited increased relative high alpha (10-14.5 Hz) and fronto-central increases in high delta (3-4 Hz) power during REM sleep, and a trend of increased fronto-central low alpha (7.75-9 Hz) power in NREM sleep. These differences were independent of the confounding effects of waking emotional distress. High REM alpha and low NREM alpha powers were strongly related in nightmare but not in control subjects. The topographical distribution and spectral components of REM alpha activity suggest that nightmare disordered subjects are characterized by wake-like electroencephalographic features during REM sleep.

Olfactory impairment is common and occurs early in AD patients, suggesting its potential role in the early diagnosis of AD. However, the functional connectivity of the olfactory system in AD has received little attention. Using local field potentials symmetrically recorded from the two olfactory bulbs in awake mice, we found that in AD model mice with robust amyloid-beta burden, the coherence between the two bulbs for spontaneous activities was significantly lower in all of the four frequency bands (theta, beta, low and high gamma: 2-12, 15-35, 35-65 and 65-100 Hz, respectively). Moreover, the coherence for odor-evoked activities was also lower, particularly in the beta band, when compared to their wild-type littermates. These results demonstrate that the inter-bulbar functional connectivity is impaired in AD mice, indicating a failure of brain activation in beta-related functions, which might be of importance in the diagnosis of AD.

Quantifying Limb Movements in Epileptic Seizures Through Color-Based Video Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Color-based; epilepsy; monitoring; movement quantification; seizure; video	NEONATAL SEIZURES; AUTOMATED DETECTION; RECORDINGS; MOTION; QUANTIFICATION; NONCONTACT; EXTRACTION	This paper proposes a color-based video analytic system for quantifying limb movements in epileptic seizure monitoring. The system utilizes colored pyjamas to facilitate limb segmentation and tracking. Thus, it is unobtrusive and requires no sensor/marker attached to patient's body. We employ Gaussian mixture models in background/foreground modeling and detect limbs through a coarse-to-fine paradigm with graph-cut-based segmentation. Next, we estimate limb parameters with domain knowledge guidance and extract displacement and oscillation features from movement trajectories for seizure detection/analysis. We report studies on sequences captured in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed system has achieved comparable performance to EEG-based systems in detecting motor seizures.

In vivo recordings of brain activity using organic transistors	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; OSCILLATIONS; REPRESENTATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; EPILEPSY; ECOG; EEG	In vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal circuits are necessary for diagnostic purposes and for brain-machine interfaces. Organic electronic devices constitute a promising candidate because of their mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. Here we demonstrate the engineering of an organic electrochemical transistor embedded in an ultrathin organic film designed to record electrophysiological signals on the surface of the brain. The device, tested in vivo on epileptiform discharges, displayed superior signal-to-noise ratio due to local amplification compared with surface electrodes. The organic transistor was able to record on the surface low-amplitude brain activities, which were poorly resolved with surface electrodes. This study introduces a new class of biocompatible, highly flexible devices for recording brain activity with superior signal-to-noise ratio that hold great promise for medical applications.

Canonical granger causality between regions of interest	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Connectivity; Causality; Local field potentials; Functional imaging	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; EEG; PROPAGATION; FREQUENCIES; POTENTIALS; SELECTION; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Estimating and modeling functional connectivity in the brain is a challenging problem with potential applications in the understanding of brain organization and various neurological and neuropsychological conditions. An important objective in connectivity analysis is to determine the connections between regions of interest in the brain. However, traditional functional connectivity analyses have frequently focused on modeling interactions between time series recordings at individual sensors, voxels, or vertices despite the fact that a single region of interest will often include multiple such recordings. In this paper, we present a novel measure of interaction between regions of interest rather than individual signals. The proposed measure, termed canonical Granger causality, combines ideas from canonical correlation and Granger causality analysis to yield a measure that reflects directed causality between two regions of interest. In particular, canonical Granger causality uses optimized linear combinations of signals from each region of interest to enable accurate causality measurements from substantially less data compared to alternative multivariate methods that have previously been proposed for this scenario. The optimized linear combinations are obtained using a variation of a technique developed for optimization on the Stiefel manifold. We demonstrate the advantages of canonical Granger causality in comparison to alternative causality measures for a range of different simulated datasets. We also apply the proposed measure to local field potential data recorded in a macaque brain during a visuomotor task. Results demonstrate that canonical Granger causality can be used to identify causal relationships between striate and prestriate cortexes in cases where standard Granger causality is unable to identify statistically significant interactions.

In this study we tested healthy preschool children between the ages of 5 and 6, and observed better response inhibition in 6-year-olds compared to 5-year-olds. Importantly, this age-related difference could not be explained by the N2 component from event-related potential, but was reflected in an increase in right frontal beta power from electroencephalogram. These results suggest that frontal beta power during the preschool period may reflect neural development of inhibitory control.

In this study we extended our earlier in vitro observations concerning the involvement of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in hippocampal theta production. Specifically, we investigated whether the hippocampal neuronal network is capable of generating theta oscillations in the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) in a brain slice preparation. To answer this question, the effect of different concentrations of NMDA (Experiment I) and the effect of interaction between NMDA and GAB(A/B) agonists and antagonists on field potentials recorded in the CA3c region of hippocampal formation (HPC) slice preparations (Experiment II) was examined. We demonstrated for the first time that apart from the epileptiform activity recorded in almost all series of Experiments I and II, only the perfusion of HPC slices with NMDA in doses of 30 and 50 mu M, as well as the perfusion of HPC slices with NMDA and GABA(B) agonist baclofen (50 mu M NMDA + 50 mu M BACL), resulted in the appearance of individual theta epochs. The best synchronized theta oscillations obtained after administration of 50 mu M NMDA + 50 mu M BACL resembled theta activity induced by a bath perfusion of 50 mu M carbachol. In light of the obtained results we conclude that besides the cholinergic and GABAergic input, NMDA glutamatergic drive is also important for the appearance of theta oscillations in HPC in vitro.

In order to investigate the relation between brain response and somatosensory stimulation, a hypothesis was set up that sub-threshold stimulus to cause significant postural balance by applying to tibialis anterior tendons would exist between thresholds of the fingers and the tibialis anterior tendons. The experiment was conducted with the somatosensory stimulus and brain wave analysis systems, five male adults were involved. The three kinds of somatosensory stimulation (200 Hz, 250 Hz and 300 Hz) were used, those stimulation was applied to the tibialis anterior tendon of the subjects, and their brain waves were measured at the same time. As a result, we can confirm that fingers were more sensitive to somatosensory stimuli than tibialis anterior tendons and the frequency of somatosensory stimuli and sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli have an inverse correlation. Also, sub-threshold stimulus may derive a significant response from the body.

Neonatal pain-related stress, functional cortical activity and visual-perceptual abilities in school-age children born at extremely low gestational age	PAIN			English	Article						Preterm; Magnetoencephalography; Neural oscillation; Neonatal pain; Cognitive outcome; Spontaneous brain activity; Visual perception; Prematurity; Spontaneous brain activity; Child development; Resting-state; Pain; Cognition; Perception; Development	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; PROCEDURAL PAIN; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY	Children born very prematurely (<= 32 weeks) often exhibit visual-perceptual difficulties at school-age, even in the absence of major neurological impairment. The alterations in functional brain activity that give rise to such problems, as well as the relationship between adverse neonatal experience and neurodevelopment, remain poorly understood. Repeated procedural pain-related stress during neonatal intensive care has been proposed to contribute to altered neurocognitive development in these children. Due to critical periods in the development of thalamocortical systems, the immature brain of infants born at extremely low gestational age (ELGA; <= 28 weeks) may have heightened vulnerability to neonatal pain. In a cohort of school-age children followed since birth we assessed relations between functional brain activity measured using magnetoencephalogragy (MEG), visual-perceptual abilities and cumulative neonatal pain. We demonstrated alterations in the spectral structure of spontaneous cortical oscillatory activity in ELGA children at school-age. Cumulative neonatal pain-related stress was associated with changes in background cortical rhythmicity in these children, and these alterations in spontaneous brain oscillations were negatively correlated with visual-perceptual abilities at school-age, and were not driven by potentially confounding neonatal variables. These findings provide the first evidence linking neonatal pain-related stress, the development of functional brain activity, and school-age cognitive outcome in these vulnerable children.

Methods: Using a within subject design and a strict subject selection procedure, we tested in High (Highs) and Low (Lows) hypnotically suggestible individuals whether hypnotic suggestions of sensory and affective hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia differentially affected subjective ratings of laser-induced pain and nociceptive-related brain activity in the time- and time-frequency domain. Results: Hypnotic modulation of pain intensity and unpleasantness affected subjective ratings of laser-induced pain only in Highs. Such modulation was more specific for unpleasantness manipulation and more evident for suggestions of hyperalgesia. Importantly, Highs and Lows showed increase and decrease of P2a and P2b wave amplitudes and gamma band power, respectively. Conclusions: Hypnotic suggestions exerted a top-down modulatory effect on both evoked and induced-cortical brain responses triggered by selective nociceptive laser inputs. Furthermore, correlation analyses indicated that gamma power modulation and suggestions of hyperalgesia may reflect the process of allocating control resources to salient and threatening sensory-affective dimensions of pain.

Methods: Repeat intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings were performed with 12 epilepsy patients, at >= 1 day intervals, using a passive odd-ball paradigm with steady-state tones. Time-frequency matching pursuit analysis was used to quantify changes in gamma-band power relative to pre-stimulus baseline. Test-retest reliability was estimated based on within-subject comparisons (paired t-test, McNemar's test) and correlations (Spearman rank correlations, intra-class correlations) across sessions, adjusting for within-session variability. Reliability estimates of gamma-band response robustness, spatial concordance, and reproducibility were compared with corresponding measurements from concurrent auditory evoked N1 responses. Results: All patients showed increases in gamma-band power, 50-120 ms post-stimulus onset, that were highly robust across recordings, comparable to the evoked N1 responses. Gamma-band responses occurred regardless of patients' performance on behavioral tests of auditory processing, medication changes, seizure focus, or duration of test-retest interval. Test-retest reproducibility was greatest for the timing of peak power changes in the high-gamma range (65-150 Hz). Reliability of low-gamma responses and evoked N1 responses improved at higher signal-to-noise levels. Conclusions: Early cortical auditory gamma-band responses are robust, spatially concordant, and reproducible over time. Significance: These test-retest ECoG results confirm the reliability of auditory gamma-band responses, supporting their utility as objective measures of cortical processing in clinical and research studies.

To provide a more direct link to emergent perceptual states we have used holistic EEG/ERP paradigms where the moment of perceptual "discovery'' of a global pattern was variable. Using a rapid visual presentation of short-lived Mooney objects we found an increase of gamma-band activity locked to perceptual events. Additional experiments using dynamic Mooney stimuli showed that gamma activity increases well before the report of an emergent holistic percept. To confirm these findings in a data driven manner we have further used a support vector machine classification approach to distinguish between perceptual vs. non perceptual states, based on time-frequency features. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were all above 95%. Modulations in the 30-75 Hz range were larger for perception states. Interestingly, phase synchrony was larger for perception states for high frequency bands. By focusing on global gestalt mechanisms instead of local processing we conclude that gamma-band activity and synchrony provide a signature of holistic perceptual states of variable onset, which are separable from sensory and motor processing.

Unfortunately, these theoretical advances remain largely ignored in affective neuroscience. To address this limitation the present paper proposes a novel research avenue aimed at using alpha to elucidate cortical inhibitory mechanisms involved in affective processes. The proposal is illustrated by developing inhibitory accounts of affective attention and affective tuning phenomena. The emergent predictions were tested using event-related perturbations from 73 students evaluating affective and nonaffective aspects of five types of emotional images. The results revealed that upper alpha power was increased by affective content in general and aversive stimuli in particular from 350 ms at posterior and from 575 ms at central sites. The evaluation task interacted with affective content only at a liberal statistical significance level in late posterior alpha. These results are generally in line with the proposed inhibitory accounts of affective attention and tuning, although the evidence is preliminary rather than conclusive. As confirmation of functional origins of alpha in affect remains beyond the scope of a single study, this paper aims to inspire further extrapolation of the inhibitory account of alpha within affective neuroscience.

The significance and manifestation in physiology and/or behaviour of many brain infra-slow oscillations (ISO) remain unknown. Examples of this phenomenon are two types of ISO observed in the brains of urethane-anaesthetised rats: infra-slow, rhythmic changes in the rate of action potential firing in a few nuclei of the subcortical visual system and a sleep-like cycle of activation/deactivation visible in the EEG signal. Because both of these rhythmic phenomena involve brain networks that can influence autonomic nervous system activity, we hypothesised that these two brain ISOs can be reflected by rhythmic changes of pupil size. Thus, in the present study, we used simultaneous pupillography and ECoG recording to verify the hypothesised existence of infra-slow oscillations in the pupil size of urethane-anaesthetised rats. The obtained results showed rhythmic changes in the size of the pupils and rhythmic eyeball movements in urethane-anaesthetised rats. The observed rhythms were characterised by two different dominant components in a range of infra-slow frequencies. First, the long component had a period of approximate to 29 minutes and was present in both the irises and the eyeball movements. Second, the short component had a period of approximate to 2 minutes and was observed only in the rhythmic constrictions and dilations of the pupils. Both ISOs were simultaneously present in both eyes, and they were synchronised between the left and right eye. The long ISO component was synchronised with the cyclic alternations of the brain state, as revealed by rhythmic changes in the pattern of the ECoG signal. Based on the obtained results, we propose a model of interference of ISO present in different brain systems involved in the control of pupil size.

Therefore, the quantification of such synchrony is a crucial topic in brain science research. Furthermore, these cerebral integration processes are likely to involve entire brain areas; therefore, the analysis of multiple couplings is of particular interest. Because phase values are circular variables, it is possible to use circular statistical methods for their examination. In particular, circular-circular correlation coefficients form a suitable measurement to estimate the extent of phase synchronization between different signals. As a multiple circular-circular correlation concept is still pending, two new multiple circular-circular correlation coefficients are presented in this article that can be used to quantify phase couplings between one dependent and an arbitrary number of predictor signals.

Distinction between added-energy and phase-resetting mechanisms in non-invasively detected somatosensory evoked responses	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			600 HZ; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS	Non-invasively recorded averaged event-related potentials (ERP) represent a convenient opportunity to investigate human brain perceptive and cognitive processes. Nevertheless, generative ERP mechanisms are still debated. Two previous approaches have been contested in the past: the added-energy model in which the response raises independently from the ongoing background activity, and the phase-reset model, based on stimulus-driven synchronization of oscillatory ongoing activity. Many criteria for the distinction of these two models have been proposed, but there is no definitive methodology to disentangle them, owing also to the limited information at the single trial level. Here, we propose a new approach combining low-noise EEG technology and multivariate decomposition techniques. We present theoretical analyses based on simulated data and identify in high-frequency somatosensory evoked responses an optimal target for the distinction between the two mechanisms.

Adaptive Laplacian filtering for sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BCI; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective. Sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are 8-30 Hz oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from the scalp over sensorimotor cortex that change with movement and/or movement imagery. Many brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have shown that people can learn to control SMR amplitudes and can use that control to move cursors and other objects in one, two or three dimensions. At the same time, if SMR-based BCIs are to be useful for people with neuromuscular disabilities, their accuracy and reliability must be improved substantially. These BCIs often use spatial filtering methods such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP) filter or common spatial pattern (CSP) filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG. Here, we test the hypothesis that a new filter design, called an 'adaptive Laplacian (ALAP) filter', can provide better performance for SMR-based BCIs. Approach. An ALAP filter employs a Gaussian kernel to construct a smooth spatial gradient of channel weights and then simultaneously seeks the optimal kernel radius of this spatial filter and the regularization parameter of linear ridge regression. This optimization is based on minimizing the leave-one-out cross-validation error through a gradient descent method and is computationally feasible. Main results. Using a variety of kinds of BCI data from a total of 22 individuals, we compare the performances of ALAP filter to CAR, small LAP, large LAP and CSP filters. With a large number of channels and limited data, ALAP performs significantly better than CSP, CAR, small LAP and large LAP both in classification accuracy and in mean-squared error. Using fewer channels restricted to motor areas, ALAP is still superior to CAR, small LAP and large LAP, but equally matched to CSP. Significance. Thus, ALAP may help to improve the accuracy and robustness of SMR-based BCIs.

In contrast, here we establish a beneficial effect for distractor presentation in humans for both patients with memory impairment due to bilateral hippocampal lesions and healthy adults with low memory performance. Recognition memory for images of place scenes, which had to be memorized for short delay periods was significantly improved with the presentation of a distractor face during the delay. Magnetoencephalography recordings of neural oscillations in the theta frequency range obtained in healthy adults suggest that this memory improvement results from the interruption of rehearsal by the distractor. Our results highlight circumstances where active memory rehearsal may paradoxically increase memory impairments and distraction alleviates these memory deficits in patients with hippocampal injury and healthy adults.

Popular separation techniques such as independent component analysis are not adequate for phase-locked signals, because such signals have strong mutual dependency. Aiming at unmixing this class of signals, we have recently introduced the independent phase analysis (IPA) algorithm, which can be used to separate synchronous sources. Here, we apply IPA to pseudo-real MEG data. The results show that this algorithm is able to separate phase-locked MEG sources in situations where the phase jitter (i.e., the deviation from the perfectly synchronized case) is moderate. This represents a significant step towards performing phase-based source separation on real data.

This work studied changes in the absolute power (AP) of EEG activity recorded in the prefrontal and parietal areas during the performance of the Tower of Hanoi task in children, adolescents, and young adults. Three groups of healthy male subjects such as G1, 11-13; G2, 18-20; and G3, 26-30, years of age were recorded at the F3, F4, P3, and P4 derivations under two conditions: basal and performance of the Towers of Hanoi task. The majority of subjects in G1 failed to complete the task in the allotted time (7 min), while those in G2 and G3 were able to resolve the task quickly and efficiently. During the Towers of Hanoi task, G1 showed an increase of AP in the delta band only in the frontal areas, with a decrease in the alpha1 and alpha2 sub-bands only at the parietal derivations, while G2 and G3 were characterized by an increase of AP in the delta band and a decreased AP in the alpha1 and alpha2 sub-bands in all derivations. These data demonstrate that during the performance of the Towers of Hanoi task, the prefrontal and parietal areas show a characteristic EEG pattern in relation to age. It is probable that the AP patterns obtained in G2 and G3 are associated with the functional changes at cortical levels that adolescents and early adults require to achieve an adequate and fast performance of the Towers of Hanoi task.

Using a comprehensive approach, subjects were asked to perform saccadic tasks, which included a saccadic eye movement to a peripheral target (prosaccadic), a movement to the opposite side (antisaccadic), or maintain the gaze fixed (no-go). In mixed trials, prosaccadic, antisaccadic and no-go tasks were indicated by a color square (S1) present for 1900-2500 ms (instructive period). S1 disappeared for 370 ms (gap) and a black dot at 8 deg at right or left indicated the beginning of the task. Reaction times, amplitude of eye movements and number of errors were greatest in antisaccadic tasks, suggesting a greater difficulty. The EEG showed a contingent negativity variation (CNV) that increased progressively along the instructive period and suddenly during the gap: higher in antisaccadic, followed by prosaccadic and no-go tasks. Principal component analysis (PCA) disentangled fronto-central and occipital CNV-related and fronto-central gap-related components. The instructive period was characterized by fronto-central and occipital beta desynchronization (ERD) higher in antisaccadic than in no-go and parieto-occipital alpha synchronization higher in no-go than in antisaccadic tasks. During the gap, parieto-occipital beta and alpha ERD were higher in antisaccadic compared to no-go. The gap was further characterized by a fronto-central increase of inter-trial coherence in theta: highest during antisaccadic, followed by prosaccadic and no-go tasks. This phase locking in theta was also accompanied by theta ERS, which was significantly higher in antisaccadic than in the other two tasks. In PCA of spectral power two main components had dynamics similar to those extracted from voltage data, suggesting cross-frequency coupling. These results suggest that the more difficult saccadic tasks are associated with top-down control mediated by frontal cortex, while simpler tasks rely more on bottom-up control mediated by posterior cortices.

Methods: We analyzed a group of 51 patients (158 seizures) with TLE who underwent IEEG. We analyzed the dominant frequency during the first 3 s after the onset of ictal activity. The cut-off value for distinguishing between fast and slow frequencies was 8 Hz. We defined three types of SOPs: (1) fast ictal activity (FIA) - frequency >= 8 Hz; (2) slow ictal activity (SIA) - frequency <8 Hz; and (3) attenuation of background activity (AT) - no clear-cut rhythmic activity during the first 3 s associated with changes of IEEG signal (increase of frequency, decrease of amplitude). We tried to find the relationship between different SOP types and surgery outcome, histopathological findings, and SOZ localization. Results: The most frequent SOP was FIA, which was present in 67% of patients. More patients with FIA were classified postoperatively as Engel I than those with SIA and AT (85% vs. 31% vs. 0) (P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the type of SOP, in the histopathological findings, or in the SOZ localization. Conclusion: In patients with refractory TLE, seizure onset frequencies >= 8 Hz during the first 3 s of ictal activity are associated with a better surgical outcome than frequencies <8 Hz. Significance: Our study suggests that very early seizure onset frequencies in IEEG in patients with TLE could be the independent predictive factor for their outcome, regardless of the localization and etiology.

Whether auditory stimuli evoke delta-brushes in the premature auditory cortex has not been reported. Here, responses to auditory stimuli were studied in 46 premature infants without neurologic risk aged 31 to 38 postmenstrual weeks (PMW) during routine EEG recording. Stimuli consisted of either low-volume technogenic "clicks'' near the background noise level of the neonatal care unit, or a human voice at conversational sound level. Stimuli were administrated pseudo-randomly during quiet and active sleep. In another protocol, the cortical response to a composite stimulus ("click'' and voice) was manually triggered during EEG hypoactive periods of quiet sleep. Cortical responses were analyzed by event detection, power frequency analysis and stimulus locked averaging. Before 34 PMW, both voice and "click'' stimuli evoked cortical responses with similar frequency-power topographic characteristics, namely a temporal negative slow-wave and rapid oscillations similar to spontaneous delta-brushes. Responses to composite stimuli also showed a maximal frequency-power increase in temporal areas before 35 PMW. From 34 PMW the topography of responses in quiet sleep was different for "click'' and voice stimuli: responses to "clicks'' became diffuse but responses to voice remained limited to temporal areas. After the age of 35 PMW auditory evoked delta-brushes progressively disappeared and were replaced by a low amplitude response in the same location. Our data show that auditory stimuli mimicking ambient sounds efficiently evoke delta-brushes in temporal areas in the premature infant before 35 PMW. Along with findings in other sensory modalities (visual and somatosensory), these findings suggest that sensory driven delta-brushes represent a ubiquitous feature of the human sensory cortex during fetal stages and provide a potential test of functional cortical maturation during fetal development.

In a combined repeated-measures and parallel-group sleep laboratory study (active waking versus sleep, passive waking versus sleep), we provide evidence that brief periods of daytime sleep (42.1 +/- 8.9min of non-rapid eye movement sleep) in healthy adolescents (16years old, all female), compared with equal periods of waking, promote the consolidation of declarative memory (word-pairs) in participants with high power in the electroencephalographic sleep spindle (sigma) frequency range. This observation supports the notion that sleep-specific brain activity when reaching a critical dose, beyond a mere reduction of interference, promotes synaptic plasticity in a hippocampal-neocortical network that underlies the consolidation of declarative memory.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intra-cranial electro-encephalography (iEEG) measure two technically unrelated but spatially and temporally complementary sets of functional descriptions of human brain activity. In order to allow fine-grained spatio-temporal human brain mapping at the population-level, an effective comparative framework for the cortex-based inter-subject analysis of iEEG and fMRI data sets is needed. We combined fMRI and iEEG recordings of the same patients with epilepsy during alternated intervals of passive movie viewing and music listening to explore the degree of local spatial correspondence and temporal coupling between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI changes and iEEG spectral power modulations across the cortical surface after cortex-based inter-subject alignment. To this purpose, we applied a simple model of the iEEG activity spread around each electrode location and the cortex-based inter-subject alignment procedure to transform discrete iEEG measurements into cortically distributed group patterns by establishing a fine anatomic correspondence of many iEEG cortical sites across multiple subjects. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-modal inter-subject cortex-based distributed analysis for combining iEEG and fMRI data sets acquired from multiple subjects with the same experimental paradigm but with different iEEG electrode coverage. The proposed iEEG-fMRI framework allows for improved group statistics in a common anatomical space and preserves the dynamic link between the temporal features of the two modalities.

The multi-level regulatory system of theta, based mainly on cholinergic transmission, includes structures from the forebrain to the medulla. Among them the most important are two reticular nuclei: the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) and rostral pontine tegmental nucleus (RPO). Functional relations between these two nuclei are still unidentified. It is known that cholinergic stimulation of these nuclei with carbachol leads to induction of theta in the hippocampus. Electrical stimulation has the same effect but only when applied to the RPO. In our experiments, performed on urethanized rats, each of these two methods was applied to the RPO with the PPN being inactivated in the contralateral hemisphere. We found that inactivation of the PPN does not suppress theta induced with carbachol microinjection into the RPO, but completely blocks theta induction with electrical stimulation of the RPO. The results suggest the important role of the PPN in theta rhythm generation from brainstem level, depending on the method of theta rhythm induction, i.e. cholinergic or electric stimulation of the RPO.

Coalescence of dominance motivation and responses to facial anger in resting-state and event-related electrophysiology	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dominance motivation; Delta/beta ratio; Facial anger; Resting state electroencephalogram; N170	ANGRY FACES; APPETITIVE MOTIVATION; REWARD ANTICIPATION; NEURAL RESPONSE; HUMAN BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; TESTOSTERONE; EEG; EXPRESSIONS; PERCEPTION	People vary in their proneness to dominate as a function of their motivation to fulfill their need for reward and social status. Recent research suggests that in humans dominant individuals respond vigilantly to angry faces, whereas non-dominant individuals rapidly signal submission. Dominance motivation has been suggested to reside in asymmetrical patterns of cortical and subcortical processing. The ratio between delta and beta band oscillations has been proposed as a proxy for this asymmetry, which we here aimed to map onto individual patterns of the event-related potentials (N170) as well as behavioral responses to facial anger in the context of dominance motivation. Results show that dominance motivation indeed predicts increased delta in the delta/beta asymmetry; a pattern that further translates into behavioral vigilance as well as attenuation of the event-related response to angry faces. The present data are interpreted to suggest that dominance motivation is related to increased subcortical and decreased cortical processing, and that this translates into increased vigilance in dominance challenges. This motivational state is further characterized by less detailed processing of facial information as reflected in the attenuation of N170 amplitude. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It concerns a prospective study in a large sample of children with a long-term follow-up. The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic factors that can lead children with FS to epilepsy. MethodsChildren with a first episode of FS were included. We gathered information about prenatal and perinatal history, family history of FS and epilepsy in first- and second degree relatives, age at the time of the initial FS, dates of FS recurrences, focality, duration of the FS and recurrent episodes within the same febrile illness, height and duration of fever prior to the seizure, cause of the fever, and frequency of febrile illnesses. Patients were seen every 4-6months and also at each recurrence. Key FindingsA group of 560 children with a first FS met all entry criteria. Epilepsy was recorded at 5.4%. Statistical analysis was performed between children with epilepsy and those with no afebrile seizure. We analyzed FS recurrences in accordance with the occurrence of epilepsy. From the third FS recurrence and beyond, only focality continued to have prognostic value. SignificanceMain prognostic factors for the development of epilepsy after FS are: (1) complex FS that increased the risk for epilepsy 3.6 times, (2) age at onset of FS beyond the third year of life that raised the risk 3.8 times, (3) positive family history of epilepsy 7.3 times, and (4) multiple episodes of FS about 10 times. Focality at the first and the second FS recurrence increased the risk of epilepsy about 9.7 and 11.7 times, respectively. Focality was the only factor that continued to be significant in further FS recurrences. A prognostic profile of each child with FS would be very useful for the follow-up of these children.

Methods: We analyzed interictal magnetoencephalography data in 35 children with intractable neocortical epilepsy. We used a spatiotemporal beamforming method to estimate the spatial distribution of source power in individual interictal spikes. We compared ERB results to source localization using the equivalent current dipole model and to the seizure onset zones on intracranial EEG. Results: Focal beamformer localization was observed in 66% of patients and multifocal in the remaining 34%. ERB localized within 2 cm of the equivalent current dipole cluster centroid in 77% of the patients. ERB localization was concordant with the seizure onset zone on intracranial EEG at the gyral level in 69% of patients. Focal ERB localization area was included in the resection margin in 22/23 patients. However, focal ERB localization was not statistically associated with better surgical outcome. Conclusions: ERB can be used for source localization of interictal spikes and can be predictive of the ictal onset zone in a subset of patients with neocortical epilepsy. Significance: These results support the utility of beamformer source localization as a fast semi-automated method for source localization of interictal spikes and planning the surgical strategy.

Therefore, we investigated long-range temporal correlations and spectral power in electroencephalographic recordings of patients during OFF versus ON bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation in comparison with healthy controls. Cortical dynamics were analyzed in the range of 6-30 Hz. We found the presence of long-range temporal correlations up to 20 s in patients and controls. Thalamic deep brain stimulation was associated with increased long-range temporal correlations in the high beta band (21-30 Hz) and decreased power in the low beta band (13-20 Hz) compared with OFF stimulation and healthy controls. Long-range temporal correlations in the 6-10 Hz range were increased with OFF stimulation compared with the controls. Importantly, deep brain stimulation-induced changes in long-range temporal correlations within 6-10 Hz and in the beta ranges (13-20, 21-30 Hz) were correlated with OFF-ON changes in the tremor severity and with the disease duration, respectively. The differential reactivity of long-range temporal correlations and spectral power to deep brain stimulation might suggest that both measures reflect distinct aspects of cortical dynamics and might represent biomarkers for stimulation-induced modulations of neural dynamics in electroencephalography. The fact that long-range temporal correlations, but not spectral power, were correlated with clinical information might suggest long-range temporal correlations as a potential marker for disease severity in essential tremor.

REDUCED SEIZURE THRESHOLD AND ALTERED NETWORK OSCILLATORY PROPERTIES IN A MOUSE MODEL OF RETT SYNDROME	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MECP2; Rett Syndrome; epilepsy; gamma oscillations; excitability; network	CPG-BINDING PROTEIN-2; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MECP2; MICE; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; HYPEREXCITABILITY; REVERSIBILITY; HIPPOCAMPUS	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a disorder with a pronounced neurological phenotype and is caused mainly by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. A common feature of RTT is an abnormal electroencephalography and a propensity for seizures. In the current study we aimed to assess brain network excitability and seizure propensity in a mouse model of RTT. Mice in which Mecp2 expression was silenced (Mecp2(stop/y)) showed a higher seizure score (mean = 6 +/- 0.8 compared to 4 +/- 0.2 in wild-type [WT]) and more rapid seizure onset (median onset = 10 min in Mecp2(stop/y) and 32 min in WT) when challenged with the convulsant drug kainic acid (25 mg/kg). Hippocampal slices from Mecp2(stop/y) brain displayed no spontaneous field potential activities under control conditions but showed higher power gamma frequency field potential oscillations compared to WT in response to kainic acid (400 nM) in vitro. Brain slices challenged with the GABA(A)-receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.1-10 mu M) and the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (1-50 mu M) also revealed differences between genotypes with hippocampal circuits from Mecp2(stop/y) mouse slices showing enhanced epileptiform burst duration and frequency. In contrast to these network level findings, single cell analysis of pyramidal cells by whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed no detectable differences in synaptic or biophysical properties between methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)-containing and MeCP2-deficient neurons. These data support the proposal that loss of MeCP2 alters network level excitability in the brain to promote epileptogenesis. (c) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study spontaneous and evoked oscillatory brain activities were analyzed jointly with established behavioral measures of altered visual oscillatory processing. Critical flicker and fusion frequencies (CFF, FUF) were measured in 25 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and 30 healthy controls. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were collected at rest and during a visual task employing repetitive stimulation. Resting MEG and evoked fields were analyzed. CFF and FUF were found to be reduced in patients, providing behavioral evidence for deficits in visual oscillatory processing. These alterations were found to be related to resting brain activity in patients, namely that the lower the dominant MEG frequency at rest, the lower the CFF and FUF. An analysis of evoked fields at sensor level indicated that in comparison to normal controls, patients were not able to dynamically adapt to flickering visual stimulation. Evoked activity was also analyzed based on independent components (ICs) derived by independent component analysis. The similarity between the shape of each IC and an artificial sine function representing the stimulation frequency was tested via magnitude squared coherence. In controls, we observed a small number of components that correlated strongly with the sine function and a high number of ICs that did not correlate with the sine function. Interestingly, patient data were characterized by a high number of moderately correlating components. Taken together, these results indicate a fundamental divergence of the cerebral resonance activity in cirrhotic patients. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

One core cognitive deficit is impaired working memory (WM) suggesting malfunctioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to transiently facilitate or consolidate neuronal processes. Pilot studies using rTMS have demonstrated improvement of psychopathology in other psychiatric disorders, but a systematic investigation of working memory effects outlasting the stimulation procedure has not been performed so far. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of a 3-week high frequency active or sham 10 Hz rTMS on cognition, specifically on working memory, in schizophrenia patients (n = 25) in addition to antipsychotic therapy and in healthy controls (n = 22). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation patterns during verbal WM (letter 2-back task) before and after 3-weeks treatment with rTMS. Additionally, other cognitive tasks were conducted. 10 Hz rTMS was applied over the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (EEG electrode location F3) with an intensity of 110% of the individual resting motor threshold (RMT) over a total of 15 sessions. Participants recruited the common fronto- parietal and subcortical WM network. Multiple regression analyses revealed no significant activation differences over time in any contrast or sample. According to the ANOVAs for repeated measures performance remained without alterations in all groups. This is the first fMRI study that has systematically investigated this topic within a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, contrasting the effects in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

Converging evidence also indicates that higher RT variability is (a) associated with lower behavioral performance on complex cognitive tasks, (b) distinguishes patients with neurological deficits from healthy individuals, and also (c) predicts longitudinal cognitive decline in older adults. However, so far the processes underlying increased RT variability are poorly understood. Previous evidence suggests that control signals in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) are reflected in theta band activity and may implicate the coordination of distinct brain areas during performance monitoring. We hypothesized that greater trial-to-trial variability in theta power during performance monitoring may be associated with greater behavioral variability in response latencies. We analyzed event-related theta oscillations assessed during a cued-Go/NoGo task in a lifespan sample covering the age range from middle childhood to old age. Our results show that theta inter-trial coherence during NoGo trials increases from childhood to early adulthood, and decreases from early adulthood to old age. Moreover, in all age groups, individuals with higher variability in medial frontal stimulus-locked theta oscillations showed higher trial-to-trial RT variability behaviorally. Importantly, this effect was strongest at high performance monitoring demands and independent of motor response execution as well as theta power. Taken together, our findings reveal that lower theta inter-trial coherence is related to greater behavioral variability within and across age groups. These results hint at the possibility that more variable MFC control may be associated with greater performance fluctuations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Disrupting the clustering of GABA(A) receptor alpha 2 subunits in the frontal cortex leads to reduced gamma-power and cognitive deficits	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							INHIBITORY SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; ACID TYPE-A; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; DIRECT BINDING; MESSENGER-RNA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXPRESSION; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION	In schizophrenia, cognitive dysfunction is highly predictive of poor patient outcomes and is not responsive to current medications. Postmortem studies have suggested that cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are correlated with modifications in the number and size of inhibitory synapses. To test if these modifications lead to cognitive deficits, we have created a dominant-negative virus [adeno-associated (AAV)-DN1] that disrupts the clustering of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) at postsynaptic inhibitory specializations. When injected into the frontal cortex of mice, AAV-DN1 impairs GABA(A)R alpha 2 subunit and GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) clustering, but increases GABA(A)R alpha 1 subunit clustering on the perisomatic region, with no influence on axon-initial segment clustering. Mice expressing AAV-DN1 have prepulse inhibition deficits and impairments in working memory. Significantly, these behavioral deficits are paralleled by a reduction in electroencephalography gamma-power. Collectively, our study provides functional evidence revealing that GABAergic synapses in the prefrontal cortex directly contribute to cognition and.-power.

Developing a Performance Brain Training (TM) Approach for Baseball: A Process Analysis with Descriptive Data	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Sport; Baseball; QEEG; Brain Training; NeuroPerformance Profile (TM)	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; NEUROFEEDBACK TREATMENT; BIOFEEDBACK	Neurofeedback may be useful for improving sports performance but few studies have examined this potential. Here we present data of five development players from a major league baseball team. The aims were to evaluate the feasibility of conducting sessions within a professional organization, assess changes in quantitative electroencephalograph (QEEG), NeuroPerformance Profile (TM), and report qualitative self-report data before and after brain training. The EEG was recorded with 19 electrodes for 20 min of baseline conditions and approximately 21 min of a continuous performance test. The fast Fourier transform analysis provided average cross-spectral matrices for bands delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), low beta (13-16 Hz), beta 1 (13-21 Hz), beta 2 (22-32 Hz), and gamma (32-45 Hz) from the pre and post intervention evaluations in the baseline condition of eyes open. The continuous performance test metrics included the errors of omission, errors of commission, response time and response time variability. The 9 scales of the NeuroPerformance Profile (TM) were examined. The QEEG data, CPT data and NeuroPerformance Profile (TM) data were all compared between the pre and post 15 sessions of brain training using a within subject paired t test design corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate method. Following brain training, comparative QEEG, CPT and NeuroPerformance Profile (TM) analyses illustrated significant differences. The QEEG findings of all participants illustrated significant changes within the training parameters but also across other frequency bands and electrode sites. Overall, the positive findings in both objective and subjective measures suggest further inquiry into the utility of brain training for performance enhancement with the specific application of sport is warranted. Particularly QEEG and CPT gains were noted in the areas that correspond to client self-report data demonstrating improvement in attention, decreased intrusive thought patterns and improvements in sleep patterns.

In heterologous systems, LTG inhibits Ca(v)2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which contribute to kainic-acid (KA)-induced epilepsy in vivo. To gain insight into the role of R-type currents in LTG drug action in vivo, we compared the effects of LTG to two other AEDs in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice and controls on KA-induced seizures. Methods: Behavioral seizure rating and quantitative electrocorticography were performed after injection of 20mg/kg (and 30mg/kg) KA. One hour before KA injection, mice were pretreated with 30mg/kg LTG, 50mg/kg topiramate (TPM), or 30mg/kg lacosamide (LSM). Key Findings: Ablation of Ca(v)2.3 reduced total seizure scores by 28.6% (p=0.0012), and pretreatment with LTG reduced seizure activity of control mice by 23.2% (p=0.02). In Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice, LTG pretreatment increased seizure activity by 22.1% (p=0.018) and increased the percentage of degenerated CA1 pyramidal neurons (p=0.02). All three AEDs reduced seizure activity in control mice; however, only the non-calcium channel modulating AED, LSM, had an anticonvulsive effect in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice. Furthermore, LTG altered electrocorticographic parameters differently in the two genotypes: decreasing relative power of ictal spikes in control mice but increasing relative power of high frequency fast ripple discharges during seizures in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice. Significance: These findings provided the first in vivo evidence for an essential role for Ca(v)2.3 in LTG pharmacology and shed light on a paradoxical effect of LTG in their absence. Furthermore, LTG appears to promote ictal activity in Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice by increasing high frequency components of seizures, resulting in increased neurotoxicity in the CA1. This paradoxical mechanism, possibly reflecting rebound hyperexcitation of pyramidal CA1 neurons after increased inhibition, may be key in understanding LTG-induced seizure aggravation observed in clinical practice.

Brain oscillatory activity is critical for cognitive function and is altered in AD patients. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (A) induces reorganization of hippocampal networks. However, whether fine changes in network activity might be present at very early stages, before A overproduction, remains to be determined. We therefore assessed whether theta and gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling, which are known to be essential for normal memory function, were precociously altered in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological field potential recordings were performed using complete hippocampal preparations in vitro from young transgenic CRND8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice showed robust alterations of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the principal output region of the hippocampus, the subiculum. In addition we showed that, compared to controls, these mice expressed negligible levels of A. Finally, these network alterations were not due to genetic factors as 15-day-old animals did not exhibit theta-gamma coupling alterations. Thus, initial alterations in hippocampal network activity arise before A accumulation and may represent an early biomarker for AD.

This issue has been addressed by comparing the temporal relationship between attentional modulations on neural activities and behavior. Our previous study measured the time course of attention with amplitude and phase coherence of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and found that the modulation latency of phase coherence rather than that of amplitude was consistent with the latency of behavioral performance. In this study, as a complementary report, we compared the time course of visual attention shift measured by event-related potentials (ERPs) with that by target detection task. We developed a novel technique to compare ERPs with behavioral results and analyzed the EEG data in our previous study. Two sets of flickering stimulus at different frequencies were presented in the left and right visual hemifields, and a target or distracter pattern was presented randomly at various moments after an attention-cue presentation. The observers were asked to detect targets on the attended stimulus after the cue. We found that two ERP components, P300 and N2pc, were elicited by the target presented at the attended location. Time-course analyses revealed that attentional modulation of the P300 and N2pc amplitudes increased gradually until reaching a maximum and lasted at least 1.5 s after the cue onset, which is similar to the temporal dynamics of behavioral performance. However, attentional modulation of these ERP components started later than that of behavioral performance. Rather, the time course of attentional modulation of behavioral performance was more closely associated with that of the concurrently recorded SSVEPs analyzed. These results suggest that neural activities reflected not by either the P300 or N2pc, but by the SSVEPs, are the source of attentional modulation of behavioral performance.

In the human motor system, tACS coincident with the idling beta rhythm of the quiescent motor cortex increased the corticospinal output. We reasoned that changing the initial state of the brain (i.e., from quiescence to a motor imagery task that desynchronizes the local beta rhythm) might also change the susceptibility of the corticospinal system to resonance effects induced by beta-tACS. We tested this hypothesis by delivering tACS at different frequencies (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) on the primary motor cortex at rest and during motor imagery. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the primary motor cortex with an online-navigated TMS-tACS setting. During motor imagery, the increase of corticospinal excitability was maximal with theta-tACS, likely reflecting a reinforcement of working memory processes required to mentally process and "execute" the cognitive task. As expected, the maximal MEPs increase with subjects at rest was instead obtained with beta-tACS, substantiating previous evidence. This dissociation provides new evidence of state and frequency dependency of tACS effects on the motor system and helps discern the functional role of different oscillatory frequencies of this brain region. These findings may be relevant for rehabilitative neuromodulatory interventions.

Here, we use electroencephalographic source imaging methods to estimate the cortical movement-related oscillatory activity during finger extension movements. Then, we apply network theory to investigate changes (expressed as differences from the baseline) in the connectivity structure of cortical networks related to the preparation and execution of the movement. We compute the topological accessibility of different cortical areas, measuring how well an area can be reached by the rest of the network. Analysis of cortical networks reveals specific agglomerates of cortical sources that become less accessible during the preparation and the execution of the finger movements. The observed changes neither could be explained by other measures based on geodesics or on multiple paths, nor by power changes in the cortical oscillations.

Methods: We recorded neuromagnetic event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) activities in response to a self-paced finger-lifting task in 16 patients with PKD and 17 healthy controls. Results: The amplitude of alpha-ERD was comparable between the healthy controls and patients with PKD, whereas either the contralateral or ipsilateral beta-ERS was decreased. The peak latency of contralateral beta-ERS was delayed in patients with PKD. Patients with less frequent dyskinetic attacks demonstrated a larger ipsilateral beta-ERS. Moreover, some patients with PKD revealed a lesser degree of contralateral preponderance of beta-ERS generation. Conclusions: The present data imply a decreased postmovement inhibition of motor cortex in patients with PKD, and the inhibitory function in the contralateral hemisphere is more affected than that in the ipsilateral hemisphere.

Exogenous cannabinoids probably disrupt the normal functioning of cannabinoid receptors and area of the brain in which they are located, and this disruption is reflected in the change of related functions. Particular attention is drawn to the research of brain electrical activity in cannabis users. These studies can be divided into two directions - the study of acute and of long-term effects. Principal acute effects of cannabis are: reduction in the power of the theta oscillations, and the decrease in the amplitude of P300. The results of studies of long-term effects are contradictory: some studies indicate a reduction of adverse effects during disuse. Other studies give reason to believe that cognitive disorders associated with chronic use of cannabinoids are stable and long-term.

While the content of interregional communication is complex, the pattern of connectivity (i.e., which regions communicate) may lie in a lower dimensional state-space. In epilepsy, seizures elicit changes in connectivity, whose patterns shed insight into the nature of seizures and the seizure focus. We investigated connectivity in 3 patients by applying network-based analysis on multi-day subdural electrocorticographic recordings (ECoG). We found that (i) the network connectivity defines a finite set of brain states, (ii) seizures are characterized by a consistent progression of states, and (iii) the focus is isolated from surrounding regions at the seizure onset and becomes most connected in the network towards seizure termination. Our results suggest that a finite-dimensional state-space model may characterize the dynamics of the epileptic brain, and may ultimately be used to localize seizure foci.

A Model of the Differential Representation of Signal Novelty in the Local Field Potentials and Spiking Activity of the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							NETWORK; OSCILLATIONS; CATEGORIES; REPETITION; PATTERNS; SOUNDS; EEG	Local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity reflect different types of information procssing. For example, neurophysiological studies indicate that signal novelty in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is differentially represented by LFPs and spiking activity: LFPs habituate to repeated stimulus presentations, whereas spiking activity does not. The neural mechanisms that allow for this differential representation between LFPs and spiking activity are not clear. Here, we model and simulate LFPs and spiking activity of neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in order to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying this differential representation. We demonstrate that dynamic negative-feedback loops cause LFPs to habituate in response to repeated presentations of the same stimulus while spiking activity is maintained. This disassociation between LFPs and spiking activity may be a mechanism by which LFPs code stimulus novelty, whereas spiking activity carries abstract information, such as category membership and decision-related activity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that many large-scale functional networks have a similar spatial structure during spontaneous and stimulus-driven states. However, it is unknown whether the temporal dynamics of network activity are also similar across these states. Here we demonstrate that, in the human brain, interhemispheric coupling of somatosensory regions is preferentially synchronized in the high beta frequency band (similar to 20-30 Hz) in response to somatosensory stimulation and interhemispheric coupling of auditory cortices is preferentially synchronized in the alpha frequency band (similar to 7-12 Hz) in response to auditory stimulation. Critically, these stimulus-driven synchronization frequencies were also selective to these interregional interactions during spontaneous activity. This similarity between stimulus-driven and spontaneous states suggests that frequency-specific oscillatory dynamics are intrinsic to the interactions between the nodes of these brain networks.

J	Kaiser, D				Kaiser, David			Infra low Frequencies and Ultradian Rhythms	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							EEG; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ASTROCYTES; CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Our brain activity demonstrates amazing stability across multiple time frames ranging from a few milliseconds to several hours. The longer cycles are commonly called ultradian rhythms and they correspond to infralow frequencies (ILFs) in the milli-Hz range (0.001 Hz). Ultradian rhythms between 90 minutes and 2 hours or longer are readily observed in our electroencephalogram, and they reflect periods of activity and rest, cycles of cortical excitability and plasticity followed by relative inactivity. Our nightly sleep is organized into similar stages (rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep) as is our daily behavior (ie, the basic rest-activity cycle). Astrocytes often exhibit milli-Hz ILFs, and they play a major role in shaping neuronal plasticity and activity, and thus may organize or influence the basic rhythms of sleep and waking. The nature and importance of astrocytes in human brain functioning is subsequently reviewed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is accompanied by emotional deficits coincidently caused by dysfunctional interplay of fronto-limbic circuits. This study aimed to examine the role of sleep in the consolidation of emotional memory in ADHD in the context of healthy development. 16 children with ADHD, 16 healthy children, and 20 healthy adults participated in this study. Participants completed an emotional picture recognition paradigm in sleep and wake control conditions. Each condition had an immediate (baseline) and delayed (target) retrieval session. The emotional memory bias was baseline-corrected, and groups were compared in terms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (sleep vs. wake). We observed an increased sleep-dependent emotional memory bias in healthy children compared to children with ADHD and healthy adults. Frontal oscillatory EEG activity (slow oscillations, theta) during sleep correlated negatively with emotional memory performance in children with ADHD. When combining data of healthy children and adults, correlation coefficients were positive and differed from those in children with ADHD. Since children displayed a higher frontal EEG activity than adults these data indicate a decline in sleep-related consolidation of emotional memory in healthy development. In addition, it is suggested that deficits in sleep-related selection between emotional and non-emotional memories in ADHD exacerbate emotional problems during daytime as they are often reported in ADHD.

Some intracranial EEG studies demonstrated that the amplitude of this hippocampal potential was greater in response to stimuli requiring an overt motor response, in comparison with stimuli for which no motor response is required. These findings could indicate that hippocampal-evoked activity is related to movement execution as well as stimulus evaluation and associated memory processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal relationship between the hippocampal negative potential latency and motor responses. We analyzed ERPs recorded with 22 depth electrodes implanted into the hippocampi of 11 epileptic patients. Subjects were instructed to press a button after the presentation of a tone. All investigated hippocampi generated a prominent negative ERP peaking at approximate to 420 ms. In 16 from 22 cases, we found that the ERP latency did not correlate with the reaction time; in different subjects, this potential could either precede or follow the motor response. Our results indicate that the hippocampal negative ERP occurs independently of motor execution. We suggest that hippocampal-evoked activity, recorded in a simple sensorimotor task, is related to the evaluation of stimulus meaning within the context of situation. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

During EEG acquisition, subjects were presented with a passive auditory oddball paradigm including rare complex sounds called Novels (the own first name - OWN, and an unfamiliar first name - OTHER) while they were watching a silent movie in the evening or sleeping at night. During the experimental night, the subjects' quality of sleep was generally preserved. During wakefulness, the decrease in alpha power (8-12 Hz) induced by Novels was significantly larger for OWN than for OTHER at parietal electrodes, between 600 and 900 ms after stimulus onset. Conversely, during REM sleep, Novels induced an increase in alpha power (from 0 to 1200 ms at all electrodes), significantly larger for OWN than for OTHER at several parietal electrodes between 700 and 1200 ms after stimulus onset. These results show that complex sounds have a different effect on the alpha power during wakefulness (decrease) and during REM sleep (increase) and that OWN induce a specific effect in these two states. The increased alpha power induced by Novels during REM sleep may 1) correspond to a short and transient increase in arousal; in this case, our study provides an objective measure of the greater arousing power of OWN over OTHER, 2) indicate a cortical inhibition associated with sleep protection. These results suggest that alpha modulation could participate in the selection of stimuli to be further processed during sleep.

This article reviews the evidence concerning the diagnostic yield of commonly ordered tests in evaluating the child with acute ataxia. The literature revealed the following frequencies of laboratory screening abnormalities in children with acute ataxia: CT (similar to 2.5%), MRI (similar to 5%), lumbar puncture (43%), EEG (42%), and toxicology (49%). In most studies, abnormalities detected by these screening tests were nondiagnostic. There are insufficient data to assess yields of testing for autoimmune disorders or inborn errors of metabolism. A toxicology screen should be considered in all children presenting with acute ataxia. Neuroimaging should be considered in all children with new onset ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis has limited diagnostic specificity unless clinically indicated. Studies to examine neurophysiology testing did have sufficient evidence to support their use. There is insufficient evidence to establish a role for autoantibody testing or for routine screening for inborn error of metabolism in children presenting with acute ataxia. Finally, in a child presenting with ataxia and opsoclonus myoclonus, urine catecholamine testing for occult neuroblastoma is recommended. Nuclear scan may be considered, however, there is insufficient evidence for additional body imaging. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The system is composed of: 1) a MRI compatible module for the transmission of the EPS into the MRI tunnel, 2) a gelatin-based tissue-mimicking phantom, placed inside the tunnel, in which EPS is injected, 3) a detection module composed of a five input channel MRI compatible transmitter placed inside the tunnel, allowing an on-site pre-amplification of the bio-potentials and their transmission, via an optical fiber cable, to a four filtered output per channel receiver (350 Hz, 160 Hz, 80 Hz, and 40 Hz, for a total of 20 channels) placed in the control room, and 4) a signal processing algorithm used to analyze the generated induced potentials. A set of tests were performed to validate the electronic performances of the setup. We also present in this work an interesting application of the setup, i.e., the acquisition and analysis of the induced potentials with respect of the slice orientation for a given MRI sequence. Significant modifications of the time and frequency characteristics were observed with respect to axial, coronal or sagittal orientations.

The developed BCI system allows users to express their binary intentions without needing to open their eyes. To present visual stimuli, we used a pair of glasses with two LEDs flickering at different frequencies. EEG spectral patterns were classified in real time while participants were attending to one of the presented visual stimuli with their eyes closed. Through offline experiments performed with 11 healthy participants, we confirmed that SSVEP responses could be modulated by visual selective attention to a specific light stimulus penetrating through the eyelids, and could be classified with accuracy high enough for use in a practical BCI system. After customizing the parameters of the proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm based on the offline analysis results, binary intentions of five healthy participants and one locked-in state patient were classified online. The average ITR of the online experiments reached to 10.83 bits/min with an average accuracy of 95.3 %. An online experiment applied to a patient with ALS showed a classification accuracy of 80 % and an ITR of 2.78 bits/min, demonstrating the practical feasibility of our BCI paradigm.

However, the underlying mechanism of this association remains yet to be elucidated. Results: In this study, we found that coupled local and global feedback (CLGF) circuits in the cortical functional network are related to the abnormal synchronization and also correlated to the negative symptom of schizophrenia. Analysis of the magnetoencephalography data obtained from patients with chronic schizophrenia during rest revealed an increase in beta band synchronization and a reduction in gamma band power compared to healthy controls. Using a feedback identification method based on non-causal impulse responses, we constructed functional feedback networks and found that CLGF circuits were significantly reduced in schizophrenia. From computational analysis on the basis of the Wilson-Cowan model, we unraveled that the CLGF circuits are critically involved in the abnormal synchronization and the dynamical switching between beta and gamma bands power in schizophrenia. Moreover, we found that the abundance of CLGF circuits was negatively correlated with the development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, suggesting that the negative symptom is closely related to the impairment of this circuit. Conclusions: Our study implicates that patients with schizophrenia might have the impaired coupling of inter-and intra-regional functional feedbacks and that the CLGF circuit might serve as a critical bridge between abnormal synchronization and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

The stimulation pole, anode and cathode, may make different contributions to the anti-epileptic effect of LFS. Objective: To determine whether electrode polarity influences the anti-epileptic effect of LFS at the kindling focus in amygdaloid kindling rats. Methods: The effect of bipolar and monopolar (or unipolar) LFS at the amygdala in different polarity directions on amygdaloid kindling acquisition, kindled seizures and electroencephalogram (EEG) were tested. Results: Bipolar LFS in the same direction of polarity as the kindling stimulation but not in the reverse direction retarded kindling acquisition. Anodal rather than cathodal monopolar LFS attenuated kindling acquisition and kindled seizures. Bipolar LFS showed a stronger anti-epileptic effect than monopolar LFS. Furthermore, anodal LFS (both bipolar and monopolar) decreased, while cathodal LFS increased the power of the EEG from the amygdala; the main changes in power were in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) band, which was specifically increased during kindling acquisition. Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence that the effect of LFS at the kindling focus on amygdaloid kindling in rats is polarity-dependent, and this may be due to the different effects of anodal and cathodal LFS on the activity in the amygdala, especially on the delta band activity. So, It is likely that the electrode polarity, especially that for anodal current, is a key factor affecting the clinical effects of LFS on epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This type of BCI often exploits mu and beta oscillations in EEG recorded over the sensorimotor areas, and their event-related desynchronization (ERD) following motor imagery is believed to represent increased sensorimotor cortex excitability. However, it remains unclear whether the sensorimotor cortex excitability is actually correlated with ERD. Thus we assessed the association of ERD with primary motor cortex (M1) excitability during motor imagery of right wrist movement. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twenty healthy participants were recruited. The participants performed 7 s of rest followed by 5 s of motor imagery and received online visual feedback of the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand M1 while performing the motor imagery task. TMS was applied to the right hand M1 when ERD exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF were recorded from the agonist muscle of the imagined hand movement. Results showed that the large ERD during wrist motor imagery was associated with significantly increased MEP amplitudes and reduced SICI but no significant changes in ICF. Thus ERD magnitude during wrist motor imagery represents M1 excitability. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that a motor imagery task involving ERD may induce changes in corticospinal excitability similar to changes accompanying actual movements.

Brisk heart rate and EEG changes during execution and withholding of cue-paced foot motor imagery	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor imagery; beta ERD; HR response; orienting reflex	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVOKED CARDIAC RESPONSE; CONSCIOUS INTENTION; MOVEMENT DIRECTION; TIME; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; BRADYCARDIA; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Cue-paced motor imagery (MI) is a frequently used mental strategy to realize a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Recently it has been reported that two MI tasks can be separated with a high accuracy within the first second after cue presentation onset. To investigate this phenomenon in detail we studied the dynamics of motor cortex beta oscillations in EEG and the changes in heart rate (HR) during visual cue-paced foot MI using a go (execution of imagery) vs. nogo (withholding of imagery) paradigm in 16 healthy subjects. Both execution and withholding of MI resulted in a brisk centrally localized beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) with a maximum at similar to 400 ms and a concomitant HR deceleration. We found that response patterns within the first second after stimulation differed between conditions. The ERD was significantly larger in go as compared to nogo. In contrast the HR deceleration was somewhat smaller and followed by an acceleration in go as compared to nogo. These findings suggest that the early beta ERD reflects visually induced preparatory activity in motor cortex networks. Both the early beta ERD and the HR deceleration are the result of automatic operating process that are likely part of the orienting reflex (OR). Of interest, however, is that the preparatory cortical activity is strengthened and the Hr modulated already within the first second after stimulation during the execution of MI. The subtraction of the HR time course of the nogo from the go condition revealed a slight HR acceleration in the first seconds most likely due to the increased mental effort associated with the imagery process.

We gain purchase on this problem by focusing on globally synchronous fields in within-trial evoked brain activity, rather than on localized peaks in the trial-averaged evoked response (ER). We analyzed data from three measurement modalities, each with different spatial resolutions: magnetoencephalogram (MEG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG). We first characterized the ER in terms of summation of phase and amplitude components over trials. Both contributed to the ER, as expected, but the ER topography was dominated by the phase component. This means the observed topography of cross-trial phase will not necessarily reflect the phase topography within trials. To assess the organization of within-trial phase, traveling wave (TW) components were quantified by computing the phase gradient. TWs were intermittent but ubiquitous in the within-trial evoked brain activity. At most task-relevant times and frequencies, the within-trial phase topography was described better by a TW than by the trial-average of phase. The trial-average of the TW components also reproduced the topography of the ER; we suggest that the ER topography arises, in large part, as an average over TW behaviors. These findings were consistent across the three measurement modalities. We conclude that, while phase is critical to understanding the topography of event-related activity, the preliminary step of collating cortical signals across trials can obscure the TW components in brain activity and lead to an underestimation of the coherent motion of cortical fields.

Optimizing Complexity Measures for fMRI Data: Algorithm, Artifact, and Sensitivity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCALE-INVARIANCE; BRAIN DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRUM; NOISE; MRI; EEG; AGE	Introduction: Complexity in the brain has been well-documented at both neuronal and hemodynamic scales, with increasing evidence supporting its use in sensitively differentiating between mental states and disorders. However, application of complexity measures to fMRI time-series, which are short, sparse, and have low signal/noise, requires careful modality-specific optimization. Methods: Here we use both simulated and real data to address two fundamental issues: choice of algorithm and degree/type of signal processing. Methods were evaluated with regard to resilience to acquisition artifacts common to fMRI as well as detection sensitivity. Detection sensitivity was quantified in terms of grey-white matter contrast and overlap with activation. We additionally investigated the variation of complexity with activation and emotional content, optimal task length, and the degree to which results scaled with scanner using the same paradigm with two 3T magnets made by different manufacturers. Methods for evaluating complexity were: power spectrum, structure function, wavelet decomposition, second derivative, rescaled range, Higuchi's estimate of fractal dimension, aggregated variance, and detrended fluctuation analysis. To permit direct comparison across methods, all results were normalized to Hurst exponents. Results: Power-spectrum, Higuchi's fractal dimension, and generalized Hurst exponent based estimates were most successful by all criteria; the poorest-performing measures were wavelet, detrended fluctuation analysis, aggregated variance, and rescaled range. Conclusions: Functional MRI data have artifacts that interact with complexity calculations in nontrivially distinct ways compared to other physiological data (such as EKG, EEG) for which these measures are typically used. Our results clearly demonstrate that decisions regarding choice of algorithm, signal processing, time-series length, and scanner have a significant impact on the reliability and sensitivity of complexity estimates.

Volitional eyes opening perturbs brain dynamics and functional connectivity regardless of light input	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Eyes open/ eyes closed; Visual input; Resting state; Brain dynamics; Brain network	LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; RESTING-STATE FMRI; DEFAULT MODE; MOTOR CORTEX; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; GLOBAL SIGNAL; FRACTAL TIME; NETWORKS	The act of opening (or closing) one's eyes has long been demonstrated to impact on brain function. However, the eyes open condition is usually accompanied by visual input, and this effect may have been a significant confounding factor in previous studies. To clarify this situation, we extended the traditional eyes open/closed study to a two-factor balanced, repeated measures resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) experiment, in which light on/off was also included as a factor. In 16 healthy participants, we estimated the univariate properties of the BOLD signal, as well as a bivariate measure of functional connectivity and multivariate network topology measures. Across all these measures, we demonstrate that human brain adopts a distinctive configuration when eyes are open (compared to when eyes are closed) independently of exogenous light input: (i) the eyes open states were associated with decreased BOLD signal variance (P-value = 0.0004), decreased fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF. P-value = 0.0061), and decreased Hurst exponent (H. P-value = 0.0321) mainly in the primary and secondary sensory cortical areas, the insula, and the thalamus. (ii) The strength of functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a major component of the default mode network (DMN), and the bilateral perisylvian and perirolandic regions was also significantly decreased during eyes open states. (iii) On the other hand, the average network connection distance increased during eyes open states (P-value = 0.0139). Additionally, the metrics of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses in this study are significantly correlated. In short, we have shown that the marked effects on the dynamics and connectivity of fMRI time series brought by volitional eyes open or closed are simply endogenous and irrespective of exogenous visual stimulus. The state of eyes open (or closed) may thus be an important factor to control in design of rs-fMRI and even other cognitive block or event-related experiments. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

An area of particular difficulty for children with ASD is cognitive flexibility, such as the ability to shift between attentional or response sets. The biological basis of such deficits remains poorly understood, although atypical development of structural and functional brain connectivity have been reported in ASD, suggesting that disruptions of normal patterns of inter-regional communication may contribute to cognitive problems in this group. The present magnetoencephalography study measured inter-regional phase synchronization while children with ASD and typically developing matched controls (6-14 years of age) performed a set-shifting task. Reduced theta-band phase synchronization was observed in children with ASD during extradimensional set-shifting. This reduction in task-dependent inter-regional connectivity encompassed numerous areas including multiple frontal lobe regions, and indicates that problems with communication among brain areas may contribute to difficulties with executive function in ASD.

Methods: We studied 56 epileptic patients (age: 4-56 years) who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography. The picture-naming task consisted of naming of a visually-presented object; the auditory-naming task consisted of answering an auditorily-presented sentence question. Results: Naming-related gamma-augmentation at 50-120 Hz involved the modality-specific sensory cortices during stimulus presentation and inferior-Rolandic regions during responses. Gamma-augmentation in the bilateral occipital and inferior/medial-temporal regions was more intense in the picture-naming than auditory-naming task, whereas that in the bilateral superior-temporal, left middle-temporal, left inferior-parietal, and left frontal regions was more intense in the auditory-naming task. Patients above 10 years old, compared to those younger, showed more extensive gamma-augmentation in the left dorsolateral-premotor region. Resection of sites showing naming-related gamma-augmentation in the left hemisphere assumed to contain essential language function was associated with increased risk of post-operative language deficits requiring speech therapy (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Measurement of gamma-augmentation elicited by either naming task was useful to predict postoperative language deficits. Significance: A smaller degree of frontal engagement in the picture-naming task can be explained by no requirement of syntactic processing or less working memory load.

However, electrophysiological investigations of the RSC and its interaction with the MTL have mostly remained limited to the rodent brain. Recently, we reported a selective increase of high-frequency broadband (HFB; 70-180 Hz) power within the human RSC during autobiographical retrieval, and a predominance of 3-5 Hz theta band oscillations within the RSC during the resting state. In the current study, we aimed to explore the temporal dynamics of theta band interaction between human RSC and MTL during autobiographical retrieval. Toward this aim, we obtained simultaneous recordings from the RSC and MTL in human subjects undergoing invasive electrophysiological monitoring, and quantified the strength of RSC-MTL theta band phase locking. We observed significant phase locking in the 3-4Hz theta range between the RSC and the MTL during autobiographical retrieval. This theta band phase coupling was transient and peaked at a consistent latency before the peak of RSC HFB power across subjects. Control analyses confirmed that theta phase coupling between the RSC and MTL was not seen for other conditions studied, other sites of recording, or other frequency ranges of interest (1-20 Hz). Our findings provide the first evidence of theta band interaction between the human RSC and MTL during conditions of autobiographical retrieval.

The neurocognitive reasons for these abnormal synchronization patterns, however, remain elusive. Recording the electroencephalogramm (EEG) during a selective visual attention task, the current study investigates whether abnormal brain oscillatory resting-state activity in the theta band might account for a lack of task-related brain oscillatory activity in schizophrenia. EEGs were recorded from 26 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy matched controls during rest and during the execution of a selective visual attention task, in which an unexpected object (monkey) appeared on the screen. On a behavioral level, patients were less likely to report perceiving the unexpected event than controls. Controls showed a stronger increase in task-related theta power than patients in prefrontal, parietal, and occipital brain regions. Task-related theta power change differed between patients who perceived, and patients who did not perceive the unexpected event. Moreover, patients showed higher levels of theta power during rest than controls, whereas the absolute theta power values during the selective attention task did not differ between groups. These results suggest that the failure to increase oscillatory activity during a cognitive task can be accounted for by abnormally high oscillatory activity in a resting state. This finding has important implications for future studies examining abnormal brain oscillatory activity in schizophrenia, which usually treat resting-state activity as a baseline for task-related activity.

Repeated injections of (D)-Amphetamine evoke rapid and dynamic changes in phase synchrony between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amphetamine; hippocampus; local field potential; oscillations; phase-locking; prefrontal cortex; synchrony	QUANTITATIVE EEG; OSCILLATIONS; AMPHETAMINE; SENSITIZATION; CUE; ALCOHOLISM; REVERSAL; RELEASE; LOCKING; RELAPSE	Repeated drug use evokes a number of persistent alterations in oscillatory power and synchrony. How synchronous activity in cortico-hippocampal circuits in progressively modified with repeated drug exposure, however, remains to be characterized. Drugs of abuse induce both short-term and long-term adaptations in cortical and hippocampal circuits and these changes are likely important for the expression of the altered behavioral and neurobiological phenotype associated with addiction. The present study explores how the initial (up to 1 h) pharmacological response to (D)-Amphetamine (AMPH) is altered with repeated injections in the rat. The methods employed herein allow for the progressive changes in synchronized dynamics with repeated intermittent AMPH exposure to be characterized over short time scales (minutes). Specifically, we examined the temporal variations of phase-locking strength in delta and theta bands within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and between PFC and hippocampus (HC) shortly after drug injection. After the first injection of AMPH synchrony increased within the PFC in the delta band, which was followed, by an increase in theta synchrony between the PFC and HC several minutes later. This relationship switched after repeated AMPH injections, where increases in theta synchrony between the PFC and HC preceded increases in delta synchrony in the PFC. The time-course of increases in synchronous activity were negatively correlated between the PFC delta and the PFC-HC theta. Collectively these data highlight the potential role of PFC-HC circuits in the development of addiction and outline dynamic changes in the time-course that cortico-hippocampal circuits become synchronized with repeated AMPH exposure.

Such adaptability may be contingent upon leaders having requisite complexity to facilitate effectiveness across a range of roles. However, there exists little empirical understanding of the etiology or basis of leader complexity. To this end, we conceptualized a model of leader self-complexity that is inclusive of both the mind (the complexity of leaders' self-concepts) and the brain (the neuroscientific basis for complex leadership). We derived psychometric and neurologically based measures, the latter based on quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) profiles of leader self-complexity, and tested their separate effects on the adaptive decision-making of 103 military leaders. Results demonstrated that both measures accounted for unique variance in external ratings of adaptive decision-making. We discuss how these findings provide a deeper understanding of the latent and dynamic mechanisms that underpin leaders' self-complexity and their adaptability.

We discuss recently published data from microelectrode array recordings of human neocortical seizures and speculate about the possible role of field effects in neuronal synchronization. We have identified two distinct seizure territories that cannot be easily distinguished by traditional EEG analysis. The ictal core exhibits synchronized neuronal burst firing, while the surrounding ictal penumbra exhibits asynchronous and relatively sparse neuronal activity. In the ictal core large amplitude rhythmic ictal discharges produce large electric fields that correspond with highly synchronous neuronal firing. In the penumbra rhythmic ictal discharges are smaller in amplitude, but large enough to influence spike timing, yet neuronal synchrony is not observed. These in homine observations are in accord with decades of animal studies supporting a role of field effects in neuronal synchronization during seizures, yet also highlight how field effects may be negated in the presence of strong synaptic inhibition in the penumbra.

Echoes in correlated neural systems	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							CROSS-CORRELATIONS; DYNAMICS; SPIKING; NEURONS; DISCHARGE; NETWORKS; CORTEX; MODEL	Correlations are employed in modern physics to explain microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, like the fractional quantum Hall effect and the Mott insulator state in high temperature superconductors and ultracold atoms. Simultaneously probed neurons in the intact brain reveal correlations between their activity, an important measure to study information processing in the brain that also influences the macroscopic signals of neural activity, like the electroencephalogram (EEG). Networks of spiking neurons differ from most physical systems: the interaction between elements is directed, time delayed, mediated by short pulses and each neuron receives events from thousands of neurons. Even the stationary state of the network cannot be described by equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we develop a quantitative theory of pairwise correlations in finite-sized random networks of spiking neurons. We derive explicit analytic expressions for the population-averaged cross correlation functions. Our theory explains why the intuitive mean field description fails, how the echo of single action potentials causes an apparent lag of inhibition with respect to excitation and how the size of the network can be scaled while maintaining its dynamical state. Finally, we derive a new criterion for the emergence of collective oscillations from the spectrum of the time-evolution propagator.

On the other hand, the shorter and more fragmented is our sleep, the more difficult it is for us to maintain wakefulness and stable cognitive performance the next day. This relationship between wakefulness and subsequent sleep becomes especially apparent after sleep deprivation or during chronic sleep restriction, which is experienced by millions of people in our society, as well as in multiple neurological, respiratory and other chronic diseases. Invariably, poor sleep leads to fatigue, sleepiness, marked cognitive deficits and impaired mood. The crucial question is what happens to the brain after a period of being awake or asleep, and where in the brain and why do these changes occur. This review summarizes information about neurophysiological substrates of sleep homeostatic processes at the cellular and network levels. It is suggested that sensory, behavioral and cognitive deficits after sleep deprivation resulting from the imbalance between local and global neuronal interactions can be reversed only by physiological sleep.

The load on working memory by extending the interstimuli time up to 16 sec between the target (facial image) and starting (spot light) stimuli does not lead to a significant slowdown of switching of the set. Differences in the magnitude of the induced synchronization of the alpha rhythm in interstimulus period obtained in the subjects with the change in recognition of emotional facial expressions and the subjects "without errors". At the last group synchronization is clearly more pronounced. The implementation of successive cognitive acts is modulated by selective attention, which is evident in the level of changes the induced synchronization/desynchronization of alpha range potential. The proposed mechanism "inhibitory control" provides the flexibility of cognitive processes by suppressing effect on cortical processes irrelevant factors during interstimulation pauses. This "protective" mechanism, we believe due to little effect of the loading on working memory.	[Kostandov, E. A.; Cheremushkin, E. A.; Yakovenko, I. A.; Petrenko, N.

Rhythmic alternating patterns of brain activity distinguish rapid eye movement sleep from other states of consciousness	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; thalamus; slow-wave sleep; brain dynamics	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HZ OSCILLATIONS; LOW-FREQUENCY; REM-SLEEP; MEMORY; FLUCTUATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; CORTICES; CORTEX	Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep constitutes a distinct "third state" of consciousness, during which levels of brain activity are commensurate with wakefulness, but conscious awareness is radically transformed. To characterize the temporal and spatial features of this paradoxical state, we examined functional interactions between brain regions using fMRI resting-state connectivity methods. Supporting the view that the functional integrity of the default mode network (DMN) reflects "level of consciousness," we observed functional uncoupling of the DMN during deep sleep and recoupling during REM sleep (similar to wakefulness). However, unlike either deep sleep or wakefulness, REM was characterized by a more widespread, temporally dynamic interaction between two major brain systems: unimodal sensorimotor areas and the higher-order association cortices (including the DMN), which normally regulate their activity. During REM, these two systems become anticorrelated and fluctuate rhythmically, in reciprocally alternating multisecond epochs with a frequency ranging from 0.1 to 0.01 Hz. This unique spatiotemporal pattern suggests a model for REM sleep that may be consistent with its role in dream formation and memory consolidation.

A novel approach to pharmaco-EEG for investigating analgesics: assessment of spectral indices in single-sweep evoked brain potentials	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						analgesic; electroencephalographic; EP; evoked potentials; opioids; pharmaco-EEG; single-sweep	EXPERIMENTAL PAIN MODELS; TRANSDERMAL BUPRENORPHINE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; NONCANCER PAIN; OPIOIDS; EFFICACY; SAFETY; REPRODUCIBILITY; RESPONSIVENESS; OSCILLATIONS	AIMS To compare results from analysis of averaged and single-sweep evoked brain potentials (EPs) by visual inspection and spectral analysis in order to identify an objective measure for the analgesic effect of buprenorphine and fentanyl. METHODS Twenty-two healthy males were included in a randomized study to assess the changes in EPs after 110 sweeps of painful electrical stimulation to the median nerve following treatment with buprenorphine, fentanyl or placebo patches. Bone pressure, cutaneous heat and electrical pain ratings were assessed. EPs and pain assessments were obtained before drug administration, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h after beginning of treatment. Features from EPs were extracted by three different approaches: (i) visual inspection of amplitude and latency of the main peaks in the average EPs, (ii) spectral distribution of the average EPs and (iii) spectral distribution of the EPs from single-sweeps. RESULTS Visual inspection revealed no difference between active treatments and placebo (all P > 0.05). Spectral distribution of the averaged potentials showed a decrease in the beta (12-32 Hz) band for fentanyl (P = 0.036), which however did not correlate with pain ratings. Spectral distribution in the single-sweep EPs revealed significant increases in the theta, alpha and beta bands for buprenorphine (all P < 0.05) as well as theta band increase for fentanyl (P = 0.05). For buprenorphine, beta band activity correlated with bone pressure and cutaneous heat pain (both P = 0.04, r = 0.90). CONCLUSION In conclusion single-sweep spectral band analysis increases the information on the response of the brain to opioids and may be used to identify the response to analgesics.

The assumption that real movements and motor imagery (virtual movements) use the same neurobiological basis has been questioned by functional magnetic resonance data. The functional similarity in the planning of real and virtual movements was studied here by analyzing event-related EEG recordings of the Mu-activity in the sensitive-motor cortex, pre-motor cortex and supplementary motor cortex. A visual stimulus (an arrow) which displayed the information needed for planning a motion (which can be executed or imaged later after the display of a second stimulus) induced a short-lasting phase-locked Mu-response (PLr) which was wider and more widespread when it was used for the motor planning of real or virtual movements than when it was passively watched. The phase-locked Mu-response was accompanied by a persistent decrease of the Mu-rhythms which were not phase-locked to stimuli (NPLr), a response which also was more marked and generalized when stimuli were used for motor planning than when they were passively observed. PLr and NPLr were similar during motor testing and imagery testing, suggesting that both tasks activated the Mu rhythms to a similar degree. This congruency between real and virtual movements was observed in the three cortical areas studied, where the amplitude, latency and duration of the phase-locked and non-phase-locked Mu response was similar in both cases. These noticeable similarities support the idea that the same cortical mechanisms are recruited during the planning of real and virtual movements, a fact that can be analyzed better when an event-related paradigm and a high time-resolution method are used.

We collected quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) data from nine SSD patients who underwent CI for tinnitus management. By correlating the degree of improvement in tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-related distress with preoperative source-localized qEEG findings and comparing qEEG findings of patients with marked improvement after CI with those with relatively slight improvement with regard to source-localized activity complimented by connectivity analysis, we attempted to find preoperative predictors of tinnitus improvement. Our results showed increased activities of the auditory cortex (AC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and increased functional connectivity between the AC and PCC as negative prognostic factors for the reduction of tinnitus intensity after CI in patients with SSD. Also, relatively increased activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreased connectivity between distress-related areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex/parahippocampus and sensory-perception areas such as the AC/precuneus were found in patients with relatively slight improvement in tinnitus-related distress as compared with those with marked improvement. The current study suggests that preoperative cortical oscillations can be applied to predict post-CI tinnitus reduction in patients with SSD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested the hypotheses (1) that psychoacoustically measured tinnitus loudness is related to gamma oscillatory band power, and (2) that tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related distress are related to distinct brain activity patterns as suggested by the distinction between loudness and distress experienced by tinnitus patients. Furthermore, we explored (3) how hearing impairment, minimum masking level, and (4) psychological comorbidities are related to spontaneous oscillatory brain activity in tinnitus patients. Methods and Findings: Resting state oscillatory brain activity recorded electroencephalographically from 46 male tinnitus patients showed a positive correlation between gamma band oscillations and psychoacoustic tinnitus loudness determined with the reconstructed tinnitus sound, but not with the other psychoacoustic loudness measures that were used. Tinnitus-related distress did also correlate with delta band activity, but at electrode positions different from those associated with tinnitus loudness. Furthermore, highly distressed tinnitus patients exhibited a higher level of theta band activity. Moreover, mean hearing loss between 0.125 kHz and 16 kHz was associated with a decrease in gamma activity, whereas minimum masking levels correlated positively with delta band power. In contrast, psychological comorbidities did not express significant correlations with oscillatory brain activity. Conclusion: Different clinically relevant tinnitus characteristics show distinctive associations with spontaneous brain oscillatory power. Results support hypothesis (1), but exclusively for the tinnitus loudness derived from matching to the reconstructed tinnitus sound. This suggests to preferably use the reconstructed tinnitus spectrum to determine psychoacoustic tinnitus loudness. Results also support hypothesis (2). Moreover, hearing loss and minimum masking level correlate with oscillatory power in distinctive frequency bands. The lack of an association between psychological comorbidities and oscillatory power may be attributed to the overall low level of mental health problems in the present sample.

Considering previous studies about morphovolumetric alterations in sleep apnea, in this study we aimed to investigate for the first time the functional connectivity profile of OSA patients and agegendermatched healthy controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty severe OSA patients (mean age 43.2 +/- 8years; mean apneahypopnea index, 36.3h1) and 20 non-apneic agegenderbody mass index (BMI)-matched controls underwent fMRI and polysomnographic (PSG) registration, as well as mood and sleepiness evaluation. Cerebro-cerebellar regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were calculated from fMRI acquisition, in order to identify pathology-related alterations in the local coherence of low-frequency signal (<0.1Hz). Multivariate pattern classification was also performed using ReHo values as features. We found a significant pattern of cortical and subcortical abnormal local connectivity in OSA patients, suggesting an overall rearrangement of hemispheric connectivity balance, with a decrease of local coherence observed in right temporal, parietal and frontal lobe regions. Moreover, an increase in bilateral thalamic and somatosensory/motor cortices coherence have been found, a finding due possibly to an aberrant adaptation to incomplete sleepwake transitions during nocturnal apneic episodes, induced by repetitive choke sensation and physical efforts attempting to restore breathing. Different hemispheric roles into sleep processes and a possible thalamus key role in OSA neurophysiopathology are intriguing issues that future studies should attempt to clarify.

Synchronous EMG Activity in the Piper Frequency Band Reveals the Corticospinal Demand of Walking Tasks	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Walking; Electromyography; Motor control; Nervous system; Locomotion	EVOKED MOTOR-RESPONSES; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; HUMAN GAIT; DEPENDENT MODULATION; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; SURFACE EMG; EEG-EMG; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DRIVE	Evidence indicates that the frequency-domain characteristics of surface electromyogram (EMG) signals are modulated according to the contributing sources of neural drive. Modulation of inter-muscular EMG synchrony within the Piper frequency band (30-60 Hz) during movement tasks has been linked to drive from the corticospinal tract. However, it is not known whether EMG synchrony is sufficiently sensitive to detect task-dependent differences in the corticospinal contribution to leg muscle activation during walking. We investigated this question in seventeen healthy older men and women. It was hypothesized that, relative to typical steady state walking, Piper band EMG synchrony of the triceps surae muscle group would be reduced for dual-task walking (because of competition for cortical resources), similar for fast walking (because walking speed is directed by an indirect locomotor pathway rather than by the corticospinal tract), and increased when taking a long step (because voluntary gait pattern modifications are directed by the corticospinal tract).

The strength of attentional biases reduces as visual short-term memory load increases	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; EEG; VSTM; biased competition	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SEARCH; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; HUMANS	Despite our visual system receiving irrelevant input that competes with task-relevant signals, we are able to pursue our perceptual goals. Attention enhances our visual processing by biasing the processing of the input that is relevant to the task at hand. The top-down signals enabling these biases are therefore important for regulating lower level sensory mechanisms. In three experiments, we examined whether we apply similar biases to successfully maintain information in visual short-term memory (VSTM). We presented participants with targets alongside distracters and we graded their perceptual similarity to vary the extent to which they competed. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the more items held in VSTM before the onset of the distracters, the more perceptually distinct the distracters needed to be for participants to retain the target accurately. Experiment 3 extended these behavioral findings by demonstrating that the perceptual similarity between target and distracters exerted a significantly greater effect on occipital alpha amplitudes, depending on the number of items already held in VSTM. The trade-off between VSTM load and target-distracter competition suggests that VSTM and perceptual competition share a partially overlapping mechanism, namely top-down inputs into sensory areas.

However, we do not have a detailed understanding of how the brain represents individual stimuli within a category. Here we used direct human brain recordings and machine-learning algorithms to characterize the distributed patterns that distinguish specific cognitive states. Epilepsy patients with surgically implanted electrodes performed a working-memory task and we used machine-learning algorithms to predict the identity of each viewed stimulus. We found that the brain's representation of stimulus-specific information is distributed across neural activity at multiple frequencies, electrodes, and timepoints. Stimulus-specific neuronal activity was most prominent in the high-gamma (65-128 Hz) and theta/alpha (4-16 Hz) bands, but the properties of these signals differed significantly between individuals and for novel stimuli compared to common ones. Our findings are helpful for understanding the neural basis of memory and developing brain-computer interfaces by showing that the brain distinguishes specific cognitive states by diverse spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal.

Prediction of brain-computer interface aptitude from individual brain structure	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BCI; motorimagery; aptitude; DTI; fractional anisotropy	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; BCI; STATE; PARALYSIS; EEG; ALS; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) provide a non-muscular communication channel for patients with impairments of the motor system. A significant number of BCI users is unable to obtain voluntary control of a BCI-system in proper time. This makes methods that can be used to determine the aptitude of a user necessary. Methods: We hypothesized that integrity and connectivity of involved white matter connections may serve as a predictor of individual BCI-performance. Therefore, we analyzed structural data from anatomical scans and DTI of motor imagery BCI-users differentiated into high and low BCI-aptitude groups based on their over all performance. Results: Using a machine learning classification method we identified discriminating structural brain trait features and correlated the best features with a continuous measure of individual BCI-performance. Prediction of the aptitude group of each participant was possible withn ear perfect accuracy (one error). Conclusions: Tissue volumetric analysis yielded only poor classification results. In contrast, the structural integrity and my elination quality of deep white matter structures such as the Corpus Callosum, Cingulum, and Superior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle were positively correlated with individual BCI performance. Significance: This confirms that structural brain traits contribute to individual performance in BCI use.

It demonstrates the first on-chip neural vector analyzer capable of wirelessly monitoring magnitude, phase and phase synchronization of neural signals. In a closed-loop, abnormal phase synchrony triggers the programmable-waveform biphasic current-mode neural stimulator. To implement these functionalities, the SoC integrates 64 neural recording amplifiers with tunable switched-capacitor (SC) bandpass filters, 64 multiplying 8-bit SAR ADCs, 64 programmable 16-tap FIR filters, a tri-core CORDIC processor, 64 biphasic current stimulation channels, and a 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB wireless transmitter onto a 4 mm x 3 mm 0.13 mu m CMOS die. To minimize both the area and power dissipation of the SoC, the SAR ADC is re-used as a multiplier for FIR filtering and as a DAC and duty cycle controller for the biphasic neural stimulator. The SoC has been validated in the early detection and abortion of seizures in freely moving rodents on-line and in early seizure detection in humans off-line.

Methods: As the brain is a highly complex network including numerous nonlinearly interacted neuronal areas, the FBCs of typically developing (TD) children and DS patients were computed using a nonlinear synchronization method. Then the differences in global organization of the obtained FBCs of the two groups were analyzed, in all electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands, in the framework of Small-Worldness Network (a network with optimum balance between segregation and integration of information). Results: The topology of the functional connectivity of DS patients is disrupted in the whole brain in alpha and theta bands, and especially in the left intra-hemispheric brain networks in upper alpha band. Conclusions: The global organization of the DS brain does not resemble a Small-World network, but it works as a random network. Significance: It is the first study on global organization of the FBC in DS. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet, the precise spatiotemporal neuronal activity patterns underlying the cortical information processing have remained largely elusive. Although the high temporal and spatial resolution of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings is increasingly being exploited in functional neuroimaging, it has not been used to study heart cycle-related effects. Here, we addressed the capacity of ECoG to characterize neuronal signals within the cardiac cycle, as well as to disentangle them from heart cycle-related artifacts. Based on topographical distribution and latency, we identified a biphasic potential within the primary somatosensory cortex, which likely constitutes a heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) of neuronal origin. We also found two different types of artifacts: i) oscillatory potential changes with a frequency identical to the heart pulse rate, which probably represent pulsatility artifacts and ii) sharp potentials synchronized to the R-peak, corresponding to the onset of ventricular contraction and the cardiac field artifact (CFA) in EEG. Finally, we show that heart cycle-related effects induce pronounced phase-synchrony patterns in the ECoG and that this kind of correlation patterns, which may confound ECoG connectivity studies, can be reduced by a suitable correction algorithm. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first one to show a focally localized cortical HEP that could be clearly and consistently observed over subjects, suggesting a basic role of primary sensory cortex in processing of heart-related sensory inputs. We also conclude that taking into account and reducing heart cycle-related effects may be advantageous for many ECoG studies, and are of crucial importance, particularly for ECoG-based connectivity studies. Thus, in summary, although ECoG poses new challenges, it opens up new possibilities for the investigation of heartbeat-related viscerosensory processing in the human brain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Longitudinal analysis of the electroencephalogram and sleep phenotype in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease	BRAIN			English	Article						EEG; biomarkers; sleep; Huntington's disease; R6; 2 transgenic mice	EEG POWER SPECTRA; TRANSGENIC MICE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; VIGILANCE STATES; SPINY NEURONS; HD; GENE; RAT; TEMPERATURE; DYSFUNCTION	Deficits in sleep and circadian organization have been identified as common early features in patients with Huntington's disease that correlate with symptom severity and may be instrumental in disease progression. Studies in Huntington's disease gene carriers suggest that alterations in the electroencephalogram may reflect underlying neuronal dysfunction that is present in the premanifest stage. We conducted a longitudinal characterization of sleep/wake and electroencephalographic activity in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease to determine whether analogous electroencephalographic 'signatures' could be identified early in disease progression. R6/2 and wild-type mice were implanted for electroencephalographic recordings along with telemetry for the continuous recording of activity and body temperature. Diurnal patterns of activity and core body temperature were progressively disrupted in R6/2 mice, with a large reduction in the amplitude of these rhythms apparent by 13 weeks of age. The diurnal variation in sleep/wake states was gradually attenuated as sleep became more fragmented and total sleep time was reduced relative to wild-type mice. These genotypic differences were augmented at 17 weeks and evident across the entire 24-h period. Quantitative electroencephalogram analysis revealed anomalous increases in high beta and gamma activity (25-60 Hz) in all sleep/wake states in R6/2 mice, along with increases in theta activity during both non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep and a reduction of delta power in non-rapid eye movement sleep. These dramatic alterations in quantitative electroencephalographic measures were apparent from our earliest recording (9 weeks), before any major differences in diurnal physiology or sleep/wake behaviour occurred. In addition, the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation was greatly attenuated with disease progression. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of quantitative electroencephalographic analysis to identify early pathophysiological alterations in the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease and suggest longitudinal studies in other preclinical Huntington's disease models are needed to determine the generality of these observations as a potential adjunct in therapeutic development.

Subjects and methods: We identified patients from our outpatient EEG database that were seen between 2006 and 2008 that had BECT, PS, and FS with rolandic or occipital spikes. We generated an averaged spike for each patient from the rolandic and occipital spikes that were detected using an automatic spike detection and clustering system. We compared the presence rate of the averaged spikes with the PPS among the three groups (BECT vs. PS vs. FS) using sequential mapping. Results: We identified 25 BECT, 18 PS, and 15 FS patients with rolandic spikes. Fifteen BECT and nine PS patients exhibited a PPS in their averaged rolandic spikes, whereas only four FS patients did. Three of these four FS patients later developed afebrile seizures, and one of them was diagnosed as having PS. We analyzed eight PS and six FS patients with occipital spikes. Five PS patients exhibited a PPS in their averaged occipital spikes, whereas only one FS patient did. This FS patient later developed prolonged autonomic febrile seizures. Conclusion: PPSs are observed not only in rolandic spikes associated with BECT that is related strictly to sylvian seizures, but also in rolandic and occipital spikes associated with PS. Although PPSs are rare in such spikes observed in FS, patients with FS and PPSs may have an increased risk of developing afebrile seizures or prolonged autonomic febrile seizures. Further studies are warranted to determine the diagnostic utility of PPSs as a marker of the future development of epilepsy when they are observed in FS patients.

For testing awareness in unresponsive patients it is necessary to know the natural variance of brain responses to motor imagery in healthy subjects. We examined 22 healthy subjects using EEG in three conditions: movement of both hands, imagery of the same movement, and an instruction to hold both hands still. Single-subject non-parametric statistics were applied to the fast-Fourier transformed data. Most effects were found in the alpha- and beta-frequency ranges over central electrodes, that is, in they-rhythm. We found significant power changes in 18 subjects during movement and in 11 subjects during motor imagery. In 8 subjects these changes were consistent over both conditions. The significant power changes during movement were a decrease of pi-rhythm. There were 2 subjects with an increase and 9 subjects with a decrease of mu-rhythm during imagery. alpha and beta are the most responsive frequency ranges, but there is a minor number of subjects who show a synchronization instead of the more common desynchronization during motor imagery. A (de)synchronization of mu-rhythm can be considered to be a normal response. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How PPHG electrophysiological activity could underlie these functions, and whether they share similar timing mechanisms is unknown. We addressed this question in two intracerebral experiments which revealed that PPHG neural activity dissociated an early stimulus-driven effect (>200 and <500 ms) and a late task-related effect (>600 and <800 ms). Strongest PPHG gamma band (50150 Hz) activities were found early when subjects passively viewed scenes (scene selectivity effect) and lately when they had to estimate the position of an object relative to the environment (allocentric effect). Based on single trial analyses, we were able to predict when patients viewed scenes (compared to other visual categories) and when they performed allocentric judgments (compared to other spatial judgments). The anatomical location corresponding to the strongest effects was in the depth of the collateral sulcus. Our findings directly affect current theories of visual scene processing and spatial orientation by providing new timing constraints and by demonstrating the existence of separable information processing stages in the functionally defined parahippocampal place area.

Thalamocortical Mechanisms for the Anteriorization of Alpha Rhythms during Propofol-Induced Unconsciousness	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							I-H CONTRIBUTES; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE ANALYSIS; NEURONS; MODEL; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION	As humans are induced into a state of general anesthesia via propofol, the normal alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) in the occipital cortex disappears and a frontal alpha rhythm emerges. This spatial shift in alpha activity is called anteriorization. We present a thalamocortical model that suggests mechanisms underlying anteriorization. Our model captures the neural dynamics of anteriorization when we adjust it to reflect two key actions of propofol: its potentiation of GABA and its reduction of the hyperpolarization-activated current I-h. The reduction in Ih abolishes the occipital alpha by silencing a specialized subset of thalamocortical cells, thought to generate occipital alpha at depolarized membrane potentials (>-60 mV). The increase in GABA inhibition imposes an alpha timescale on both the cortical and thalamic portions of the frontal component that are reinforced by reciprocal thalamocortical feedback. Anteriorization can thus be understood as a differential effect of anesthetic drugs on thalamic nuclei with disparate spatial projections, i.e.: (1) they disrupt the normal, depolarized alpha in posterior-projecting thalamic nuclei while (2) they engage a new, hyperpolarized alpha in frontothalamic nuclei. Our model generalizes to other anesthetics that include GABA as a target, since the molecular targets of many such anesthetics alter the model dynamics in a manner similar to that of propofol.

However, although social deficits have been a major concern in epilepsy treatment the relationship between social behavioral pathogenesis and the time course of epileptogenesis is not well defined. To address this, we investigated social behavioral alterations and cortical rhythms during two distinct periods in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE): 1) a seizure-free, latent period after status epilepticus and 2) the subsequent, chronic period characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). We found that severe social impairments, such as reduced sociability/social novelty preference, social interaction, social learning, and enhanced defensiveness, appeared during the latent period in mice with TLE. The social dysfunctions in the latent-period mice were nearly comparable to those in the chronic-period mice. We also found that both the latent- and chronic-period mice showed similar aberrant neural activities. They showed enhanced delta-band (1-4 Hz) activity and reduced alpha- (8.5-12 Hz) and gamma-band (30-55 Hz) activity during baseline behavior. Interestingly, concomitant increases in alpha- and gamma-band activities during social behavior, which were characteristic in control mice, were not observed in either latent- or chronic-period mice. Our results indicate that social deficits and abnormal neural activities appear at an earlier stage in epileptogenesis regardless of SRS occurrence. These findings may help to understand behavioral pathogenesis in patients with TLE and at-risk patients with initial insults that develop into TLE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

First published December 19, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00187.2012.-Isometric compensation of predictably frequency-modulated low forces is associated with corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in beta and low gamma range. It remains unclear how the CMC is influenced by unpredictably modulated forces, which create a mismatch between expected and actual sensory feedback. We recorded electroencephalography from the contralateral hand motor area, electromyography (EMG), and the motor performance of 16 subjects during a visuomotor task in which they had to isometrically compensate target forces at 8% of the maximum voluntary contraction with their right index finger. The modulated forces were presented with predictable or unpredictable frequencies. We calculated the CMC, the cortical motor alpha-, beta-, and gamma-range spectral powers (SP), and the task-related desynchronization (TRD), as well as the EMG SP and the performance. We found that in the unpredictable condition the CMC was significantly lower and associated with lower cortical motor SP, stronger TRD, higher EMG SP, and worse performance. The findings suggest that due to the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory feedback leading to higher computational load and less stationary motor state, the unpredictable modulation of the force leads to a decrease in corticospinal synchrony, an increase in cortical and muscle activation, and a worse performance.

When inhibition is compromised, such as by GABAergic blockade (Curtis et al., 1970; Connors, 1984; Traub and Miles, 1991) or by shifts in GABAergic reversal potential (Huberfeld et al., 2007), epileptiform discharges occur far more readily. Other studies have shown enhanced inhibition in vivo in the surrounding cortical territories associated with both focal pathological and physiological activity (Prince and Wilder, 1967; Dichter and Spencer, 1969a,b; Goldensohn and Salazar, 1986; Traub and Miles, 1991; Liang and Jones, 1997; Liang et al., 1998; Schwartz and Bonhoeffer, 2001). This gave rise to the concept of an "inhibitory restraint". This concept can explain the often confusing anatomical reorganizations seen in chronically epileptic brains (Sloviter, 1987; Cossart et al., 2001), indicating which changes might be pro-epileptic, and which oppose the epileptic state. It also may explain key electrophysiological features of epileptic seizures. Here we describe current knowledge about the restraint, gleaned mainly from acute pharmacological experiments in animals, both in vivo and in vitro, and speculate how this may alter our understanding of human seizure activity in clinical practice.

Experimental studies have shown that interictal discharges and ictal events (i.e., seizures) are characterized intracellularly by similar (but for duration) neuronal depolarizations leading to sustained action potential firing, thus indicating that they may share similar cellular and pharmacological mechanisms. It has also been proposed that interictal discharges may herald the onset of electrographic seizures, but other studies have demonstrated that interictal events interfere with the occurrence of ictal activity. The relationship between interictal and ictal activity thus remains ambiguous. Here we will review this issue in animal models of limbic seizures that are electrographically close to those seen in TLE patients. In particular we will: (i) focus on the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of, at least, two types of interictal discharge; (ii) propose that they play opposite roles in leading to ictogenesis; and (iii) discuss the possibility that mimicking one of these two types of interictal activity by low frequency repetitive stimulation can control ictogenesis. Finally, we will also review evidence indicating that specific types of interictal discharge may play a role in epileptogenesis.

Synchrony Dynamics Across Brain Structures in Limbic Epilepsy Vary Between Initiation and Termination Phases of Seizures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coherence; empirical mode decomposition (EMD); epilepsy; temporal lobe	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; KAINATE RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; INTRACRANIAL EEG; NEURAL NETWORKS; DEPRESSION; THALAMUS	Neuronal populations in the brain achieve levels of synchronous electrophysiological activity during both normal brain function and pathological states such as epileptic seizures. Understanding how the dynamics of neuronal oscillators in the brain evolve from normal to diseased states is a critical component toward decoding such complex behaviors. In this study, we sought to develop a more in-depth understanding of multisite dynamics underlying seizure evolution in limbic epilepsy by analyzing oscillators in recordings of local field potentials from three brain structures (bilateral hippocampi and anteromedial thalamus) in a kainic acid in vivo rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy extracted using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. EMD provides an adaptive nonlinear decomposition into a set of finite oscillatory components. Oscillator frequencies, power, and phase synchrony were assessed within and between sites as seizures evolved. Consistent patterns of low-frequency (similar to 35 Hz) synchrony occurred transiently during early-stage ictogenesis between thalamus and both hippocampi; in contrast, higher frequency (similar to 120 Hz) synchrony appeared between thalamus and focal hippocampus as seizures naturally terminated. These multi-site synchrony events may provide a key insight into how synchrony disruption via stimulation could be targeted as well as contribute to a better understanding of how brain synchrony evolves in epilepsy.

Biophysical Modeling of Alpha Rhythms During Halothane-Induced Unconsciousness	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; PROPOFOL; MECHANISMS; CONSCIOUSNESS; CHANNELS; SLEEP; EEG	During the induction of general anesthesia there is a shift in power from the posterior regions of the brain to the frontal cortices; this shift in power is called anteriorization. For many anesthetics, a prominent feature of anteriorization is a shift specifically in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) from posterior to frontal cortices. Here we present a biophysical computational model that describes thalamocortical circuit-level dynamics underlying anteriorization of the alpha rhythm in the case of halothane. Halothane potentiates GABA(A) and increases potassium leak conductances. According to our model, an increase in potassium leak conductances hyperpolarizes and silences the high-threshold thalamocortical (HTC) cells, a specialized subset of thalamocortical cells that fire at the alpha frequency at relatively depolarized membrane potentials (>-60 mV) and are thought to be the generators of quiet awake occipital alpha. At the same time the potentiation of GABA(A) imposes an alpha time scale on both the cortical and the thalamic component of the frontal portion of our model. The alpha activity in the frontal component is further strengthened by reciprocal thalamocortical feedback. Thus, we argue that the dual molecular targets of halothane induce the anteriorization of the alpha rhythm by increasing potassium leak conductances, which abolishes occipital alpha, and by potentiating GABA(A), which induces frontal alpha. These results provide a computational modeling formulation for studying highly detailed biophysical mechanisms of anesthetic action in silico.

Dynamic control of modeled tonic-clonic seizure states with closed-loop stimulation	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						seizure model; deep brain stimulation; tonic-clonic; synchrony	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; NEURONAL NETWORKS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris-Lecar (M-L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control.

The effects of propofol on local field potential sepctra, action potential firing rate, and their temporal relations in humans and felines	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						microelectrode array; consciousness; power spectrum; propofol; local field potential	CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ANESTHETICS; MECHANISMS; INDUCTION; ORIGIN; TARGET; STATES	Propofol is an intravenous sedative hypnotic, which, acting as a GABA(A) agonist, results in neocortical inhibiton. While propofol has been well studied at the molecular and clinical level, less is known about the effects of propofol at the level of individual neurons and local neocortical networks. We used Utah Electrode Arrays (UEAs) to investigate the effects of propofol anesthesia on action potentials (APs) and local field potentials (LFPs). UEAs were implanted into the neocortex of two humans and three felines. The two human patients and one feline received propofol by bolus injection, while the other two felines received target-controlled infusions. We examined the changes in LFP power spectra and AP firing at different levels of anesthesia. Increased propofol concentration correlated with decreased high-frequency power in LFP spectra and decreased AP firing rates, and the generation of large-amplitude spike-like LFP activity; however, the temporal relationship between APs and LFPs remained relatively consistent at all levels of propofol. The probability that an AP would fire at this local minimum of the LFP increased with propofol administration. The propofol-induced suppression of neocortical network activity allowed LFPs to be dominated by low-frequency spike-like activity increased and the AP-LFP relationship became more predictable firing rate encoding capacity is impaired. This suggests a mechanism for decreased information processing in the neocortex that accounts for propofol-induced unconsciousness.

Study 1 was conducted in remote monasteries of eastern Tibet with expert meditators performing g-tummo practices while their axillary temperature and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were measured. Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3 degrees C) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods. Without meditative visualization, both meditators and non-meditators were capable of using the Forceful Breath vase breathing only for a limited time, resulting in limited temperature increases in the range of normal body temperature. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of the g-tummo technique might help non-meditators learn how to regulate their body temperature, which has implications for improving health and regulating cognitive performance.

Without sleep optimal brain functioning such as responsiveness to stimuli, information processing, or learning may be impaired. Such observations suggest that sleep plays a crucial role in organizing or reorganizing neuronal networks of the brain toward states where information processing is optimized. Increasing evidence suggests that cortical neuronal networks operate near a critical state characterized by balanced activity patterns, which supports optimal information processing. However, it remains unknown whether critical dynamics is affected in the course of wake and sleep, which would also impact information processing. Here, we show that signatures of criticality are progressively disturbed during wake and restored by sleep. We demonstrate that the precise power-laws governing the cascading activity of neuronal avalanches and the distribution of phase-lock intervals in human electroencephalographic recordings are increasingly disarranged during sustained wakefulness. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in variability of synchronization. Interpreted in the context of a critical branching process, these seemingly different findings indicate a decline of balanced activity and progressive distance from criticality toward states characterized by an imbalance toward excitation where larger events prevail dynamics. Conversely, sleep restores the critical state resulting in recovered power-law characteristics in activity and variability of synchronization. These findings support the intriguing hypothesis that sleep may be important to reorganize cortical network dynamics to a critical state thereby assuring optimal computational capabilities for the following time awake.

It demonstrates the functionality of epileptic seizure detection through FR recording. This system features a fixed-gain, variable-bandwidth (BW) front-end circuit and a sigma-delta ADC with scalable bandwidth and power consumption. The ADC employs a 2nd-order single-bit sigma-delta modulator (SDM) followed by a low-power decimation filter. Direct impulse-response implementation of a sinc(3) filter and 8-cycle data pipelining in an IIR filter are proposed for the decimation filter design to improve the power and area efficiency. In measurements, the front end exhibits 39.6-dB DC gain, 0.8 Hz to 5.2 kHz of BW, 5.86-mu Vrms input-referred noise, and 2.4-mu W power consumption in AP mode, while showing 38.5-dB DC gain, 250 to 486 Hz of BW, 2.48-mu Vrms noise, and 4.5-mu W power consumption in FR mode. The noise efficiency factor (NEF) is 2.93 and 7.6 for the AP and FR modes, respectively. At 77-dB dynamic range (DR), the ADC has a peak SNR and SNDR of 75.9 dB and 67 dB, respectively, while consuming 2.75-mW power in AP mode. It achieves 78-dB DR, 76.2-dB peak SNR, 73.2-dB peak SNDR, and 588-mu W power consumption in FR mode. Both analog and digital power supply voltages are 2.8 V. The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.6-mu m CMOS process. The die size is 11.25 mm(2).

The subtraction ictal SPECT study in patients with West syndrome demonstrated the cortical epileptic region and subcortical involvement, which may consist of epilepsy networks related to the spasms. Moreover, subtraction ictal SPECT may have predictive power for short-term seizure outcome. Patients with a symmetric hyperperfusion pattern are predicted to have a better seizure outcome, whereas patients with asymmetric hyperperfusion pattern may develop poor seizure control. Importantly, asymmetric MRI findings had no predictive power for seizure outcome. Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopic topography applied to the patients with West syndrome detected an increase in regional cerebral blood volume in multiple areas which were activated either simultaneously or sequentially during spasms. Topographic changes in cerebral blood volume were closely correlated with spasm phenotype, suggesting that the cortex is involved in the generation of spasms. In conclusion, subtraction ictal SPECT may be considered as a useful tool for presurgical evaluation of patients with West syndrome and investigation of the pathophysiology of spasms. The ictal near-infrared spectroscopic topography should be more investigated to see if this is useful tool for presurgical evaluation. (C) 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

Electrical neuroimaging during auditory motion aftereffects reveals that auditory motion processing is motion sensitive but not direction selective. J Neurophysiol 109: 321-331, 2013. First published October 17, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00625.2012.-Following prolonged exposure to adaptor sounds moving in a single direction, participants may perceive stationary-probe sounds as moving in the opposite direction [direction-selective auditory motion aftereffect (aMAE)] and be less sensitive to motion of any probe sounds that are actually moving (motion-sensitive aMAE). The neural mechanisms of aMAEs, and notably whether they are due to adaptation of direction-selective motion detectors, as found in vision, is presently unknown and would provide critical insight into auditory motion processing. We measured human behavioral responses and auditory evoked potentials to probe sounds following four types of moving-adaptor sounds: leftward and rightward unidirectional, bidirectional, and stationary. Behavioral data replicated both direction-selective and motion-sensitive aMAEs. Electrical neuroimaging analyses of auditory evoked potentials to stationary probes revealed no significant difference in either global field power (GFP) or scalp topography between leftward and rightward conditions, suggesting that aMAEs are not based on adaptation of direction-selective motion detectors. By contrast, the bidirectional and stationary conditions differed significantly in the stationary-probe GFP at 200 ms poststimulus onset without concomitant topographic modulation, indicative of a difference in the response strength between statistically indistinguishable intracranial generators. The magnitude of this GFP difference was positively correlated with the magnitude of the motion-sensitive aMAE, supporting the functional relevance of the neurophysiological measures. Electrical source estimations revealed that the GFP difference followed from a modulation of activity in predominantly right hemisphere frontal-temporal-parietal brain regions previously implicated in auditory motion processing. Our collective results suggest that auditory motion processing relies on motion-sensitive, but, in contrast to vision, non-directionselective mechanisms.

Computational models have suggested that the location of the STN in the basal ganglia, as well as its numerous connections to conflict-related cortical structures, allows it to be ideally situated to act as a global inhibitor during conflict. Additionally, recent behavioral experiments have shown that deep brain stimulation to the STN results in impulsivity during high-conflict situations. However, the precise mechanisms that mediate the "hold-your-horses" function of the STN remain unclear. We recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted bilaterally in the STN of 13 human subjects with Parkinson's disease while they performed a flanker task. The incongruent trials with the shortest reaction times showed no behavioral or electrophysiological differences from congruent trials, suggesting that the distracter stimuli were successfully ignored. In these trials, cue-locked STN theta band activity demonstrated phase alignment across trials and was followed by a periresponse increase in theta power. In contrast, incongruent trials with longer reaction times demonstrated a relative reduction in theta phase alignment followed by higher theta power. Theta phase alignment negatively correlated with subject reaction time, and theta power positively correlated with trial reaction time. Thus, when conflicting stimuli are not properly ignored, disruption of STN theta phase alignment may help operationalize the hold-your-horses role of the nucleus, whereas later increases in the amplitude of theta oscillations may help overcome this function.

Knockout of NMDA Receptors in Parvalbumin Interneurons Recreates Autism-Like Phenotypes	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; electrophysiology; endophenotype; animal models; NMDA receptor 1 knockout	MICE MUS-MUSCULUS; MOUSE MODELS; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS	Autism is a disabling neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, language impairment, and repetitive behaviors with few effective treatments. New evidence suggests that autism has reliable electrophysiological endophenotypes and that these measures may be caused by n-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) disruption on parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons. These findings could be used to create new translational biomarkers. Recent developments have allowed for cell-type selective knockout of NMDARs in order to examine the perturbations caused by disrupting specific circuits. This study examines several electrophysiological and behavioral measures disrupted in autism using a PV-selective reduction in NMDA R1 subunit. Mouse electroencephalograph (EEG) was recorded in response to auditory stimuli. Event-related potential (ERP) component amplitude and latency analysis, social testing, and premating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) recordings were performed. Correlations were examined between the ERP latency and behavioral measures. The N1 ERP latency was delayed, sociability was reduced, and mating USVs were impaired in PV-selective NMDA Receptor 1 Knockout (NR1 KO) as compared with wild-type mice. There was a significant correlation between N1 latency and sociability but not between N1 latency and premating USV power or T-maze performance. The increases in N1 latency, impaired sociability, and reduced vocalizations in PV-selective NR1 KO mice mimic similar changes found in autism. Electrophysiological changes correlate to reduced sociability, indicating that the local circuit mechanisms controlling N1 latency may be utilized in social function. Therefore, we propose that behavioral and electrophysiological alterations in PV-selective NR1 KO mice may serve as a useful model for therapeutic development in autism. Autism Res 2013, 6: 6977.

It is important to understand the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue and to develop appropriate methods for evaluating mental fatigue. In this study we quantified the effect of a long-duration mental fatigue-inducing task on neural activity. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the time course change of neural activity over the long duration of the task trials. Nine healthy male volunteers participated in this study. They performed two mental fatigue-inducing tasks on separate days. The order of task presentation was randomized in a single-blinded, crossover fashion. Each task consisted of 25-min mental fatigue-inducing 0- or 2-back task session for three times. Subjective rating of mental fatigue sensation and electrocardiogram, and resting state MEG measurements were performed just before and after each task session. MEG data were analyzed using narrow-band adaptive spatial filtering methods. Alpha band (8-13 Hz) power in the visual cortex decreased after performing the mental fatigue-inducing tasks, and the decrease of alpha power was greater when they performed 2-back task trials. The decrease in alpha power was positively associated with the self-reported level of mental fatigue sensation and sympathetic nerve activity level. These results demonstrate that performing the prolonged mental fatigue-inducing task causes overactivation of the visual cortex, manifest as decreased alpha power in this brain region. Our results increase understanding of the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue and can be used to develop new quantitative methods to assess mental fatigue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such target users are called 'BCI-illiterate'. This phenomenon has been poorly investigated, and a clear understanding of the BCI-illiteracy mechanism or a solution to this problem has not been reported to date. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the neurophysiological differences between two groups (literate, illiterate) with a total of 52 subjects. We investigated recordings under non-task related state (NTS) which is collected during subject is relaxed with eyes open. We found that high theta and low alpha waves were noticeable in the BCI-illiterate relative to the BCI-literate people. Furthermore, these high theta and low alpha wave patterns were preserved across different mental states, such as NTS, resting before motor imagery (MI), and MI states, even though the spatial distribution of both BCI-illiterate and BCI-literate groups did not differ. From these findings, an effective strategy for pre-screening subjects for BCI illiteracy has been determined, and a performance factor that reflects potential user performance has been proposed using a simple combination of band powers. Our proposed performance factor gave an r = 0.59 (r(2) = 0.34) in a correlation analysis with BCI performance and yielded as much as r = 0.70 (r(2) = 0.50) when seven outliers were rejected during the evaluation of whole data (N = 61), including BCI competition datasets (N = 9). These findings may be directly applicable to online BCI systems.

In systems neuroscience, synchronised subthreshold and suprathreshold oscillatory neuronal activity within and between distributed neuronal assemblies is acknowledged as a fundamental mode of neuronal information processing. Coherent neuronal oscillations correlate with all basic cognitive functions, mediate local and long-range neuronal communication and affect synaptic plasticity. However, it remains unclear how the very fast and complex changes of functional neuronal connectivity necessary for cognition, as mediated by dynamic patterns of neuronal synchrony, could be explained exclusively based on the well-established synaptic mechanisms. A growing body of research indicates that the intraneuronal matrix, composed of cytoskeletal elements and their binding proteins, structurally and functionally connects the synapses within a neuron, modulates neurotransmission and memory consolidation, and is hypothesised to be involved in signal integration via electric signalling due to its charged surface. Theoretical modelling, as well as emerging experimental evidence indicate that neuronal cytoskeleton supports highly cooperative energy transport and information processing based on molecular coherence. We suggest that long-range coherent dynamics within the intra- and extracellular filamentous matrices could establish dynamic ordered states, capable of rapid modulations of functional neuronal connectivity via their interactions with neuronal membranes and synapses. Coherence may thus represent a common denominator of neurophysiological and biophysical approaches to brain information processing, operating at multiple levels of neuronal organisation, from which cognition may emerge as its cardinal manifestation.

The hypnotic zolpidem increases the synchrony of BOLD signal fluctuations in widespread brain networks during a resting paradigm	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						BOLD fMRI; Resting state; Functional connectivity; Zolpidem; Hypnotic; GABA(A)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STATE NETWORKS; VISUAL-STIMULATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; EEG; DYNAMICS; MECHANISM; CORTEX	Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series at rest, or "resting state networks" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for understanding intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action. The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem (Ambien (R)). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n = 12) underwent fMRI scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg), and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its powerful sedative effects.

This connectivity is modulated by rhythmic oscillations of brain electrical activity, which enable coordinated functions across brain regions. Oscillatory activity plays a central role in regulating thinking and memory, mood, cerebral blood flow, and neurotransmitter levels, and restoration of normal oscillatory patterns is associated with effective treatment of MDD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a robust treatment for MDD, but the mechanism of action (MOA) of its benefits for mood disorders remains incompletely understood. Benefits of rTMS have been tied to enhanced neuroplasticity in specific brain pathways. We summarize here the evidence that rTMS entrains and resets thalamocortical oscillators, normalizes regulation and facilitates reemergence of intrinsic cerebral rhythms, and through this mechanism restores normal brain function. This entrainment and resetting may be a critical step in engendering neuroplastic changes and the antidepressant effects of rTMS. It may be possible to modify the method of rTMS administration to enhance this MOA and achieve better antidepressant effectiveness. We propose that rTMS can be administered: (1) synchronized to a patient's individual alpha frequency (IAF), or synchronized rTMS (sTMS); (2) as a low magnetic field strength sinusoidal waveform; and, (3) broadly to multiple brain areas simultaneously. We present here the theory and evidence indicating that these modifications could enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of MDD.

Nevertheless, little is known about psychophysiological responses to pain faces in chronic pain. Event-related potentials and brain oscillations, corrugator activity, and heart rate were recorded in 20 fibromyalgia patients and 20 pain-free controls when viewing pain, anger, happy, and neutral faces. Pain and anger faces elicited greater unpleasantness and arousal than happy and neutral faces, and pain faces evoked greater corrugator response than the rest of faces in all participants. Fibromyalgia patients displayed greater cardiac deceleration to all facial expressions than pain-free controls, and enhanced N100 amplitudes to pain and anger faces in comparison with neutral faces. Pain-free controls were characterized by enhanced N100 amplitudes to happy faces as compared to patients, and by more positive event-related potential amplitudes to happy than to other faces in the time window of 200 to 300 ms. Fibromyalgia patients showed greater theta power in response to pain and anger faces, as well as more reduced alpha power than pain-free controls to all faces. These findings suggest that information processing in fibromyalgia might be characterized by enhanced defensive reactions and increased mobilization of attention resources to pain and anger faces, and by reduced allocation of attention to happy faces. Perspective: Our findings suggest that brain and cardiac activity elicited by viewing facial expressions of pain and anger in others is altered in fibromyalgia patients. This cognitive bias toward negative emotions could be used in clinical settings as a psychobiological marker during the assessment and treatment of fibromyalgia.

Spatial attention increases high-frequency gamma synchronisation in human medial visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Vision; MEG; Gamma oscillations; Early visual cortex	OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; AREAS V1; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CORTICAL AREAS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESPONSES; MACAQUE; EEG; V4	Visual information processing involves the integration of stimulus and goal-driven information, requiring neuronal communication. Gamma synchronisation is linked to neuronal communication, and is known to be modulated in visual cortex both by stimulus properties and voluntarily-directed attention. Stimulus-driven modulations of gamma activity are particularly associated with early visual areas such as V1, whereas attentional effects are generally localised to higher visual areas such as V4. The absence of a gamma increase in early visual cortex is at odds with robust attentional enhancements found with other measures of neuronal activity in this area. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the effect of spatial attention on gamma activity in human early visual cortex using a highly effective gamma-inducing stimulus and strong attentional manipulation. In separate blocks, subjects tracked either a parafoveal grating patch that induced gamma activity in contralateral medial visual cortex, or a small line at fixation, effectively attending away from the gamma-inducing grating. Both items were always present, but rotated unpredictably and independently of each other. The rotating grating induced gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex at 30-70 Hz, and in lateral visual cortex at 60-90 Hz, regardless of whether it was attended. Directing spatial attention to the grating increased gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex, but only at 60-90 Hz. These results suggest that the generally found increase in gamma activity by spatial attention can be localised to early visual cortex in humans, and that stimulus and goal-driven modulations may be mediated at different frequencies within the gamma range.

At the same time, it is known that the early evoked gamma-band response (GBR) can be modulated by top-down as well as bottom-up factors such as attention and sound intensity. In this study, we examined the effects of musicianship and attention on the intensity modulation of the auditory-evoked GBR. We compared the electroencephalogram of 17 professional musicians with that of 17 musical laymen obtained during either a forced-choice discrimination task (active) or a passive listening condition. Pure 1000 Hz sine tones were presented at three systematically varied sound intensities (40, 60, and 80 dB sound pressure levels). The results of auditory-evoked potentials and evoked GBRs obtained in the active condition predominantly corresponded to the findings of previous studies. Besides the already known augmentation of the early evoked GBR because of enhanced intertrial phase coherence with increasing sound intensity, we also observed stronger GBRs and enhanced phase locking under the active condition compared with passive listening, whereas the general shape of intensity modulation was comparable between the two conditions. In addition, phase locking to stimulus onset was increased for stimuli of all three intensities when attended, whereas in musicians, only stimuli of the highest intensity (80 dB) induced significantly increased phase locking under the active condition.

Testing the limits: Investigating the effect of tDCS dose on working memory enhancement in healthy controls	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Cognitive enhancement; Prefrontal cortex; Healthy controls; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Working memory	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RANDOM NOISE STIMULATION; HOMEOSTATIC PLASTICITY; BRAIN-STIMULATION; TIME; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS	Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation which has been shown to induce changes in brain activity and subsequent functioning. In particular, there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that anodal tDCS applied to the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to enhance aspects of cognitive functioning, in particular working memory (WM). This has led to both excitement and concerns regarding the possibility of 'electrodoping' in order to greatly improve ones cognitive performance. We investigated the behavioural and neurophysiological effects of increasing the current (or 'dose') of tDCS on the degree of WM improvement in healthy controls. Single sessions of 1 mA, 2 mA and sham anodal tDCS to the left PFC were undertaken over a period of three weeks. Participants underwent a WM task at three time points post-stimulation (0, 20 and 40 min) with concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) recordings. Our results showed that while active tDCS can enhance behavioural performance, with neurophysiological findings indicating improve efficiency of cognitive processing; we showed that 1 mA produced the most significant effects. These findings are somewhat unexpected as tDCS dose effects in cognitive enhancement have been shown previously in patient populations. Our results provide valuable information regarding the potential limits of tDCS induced cognitive enhancement in healthy controls, as well as providing additional insights into the possible mechanisms of action of tDCS.

Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of the developing ASD cortex, the physiological connectivity of the brain in young children with ASD under conscious conditions has not yet been described. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive brain imaging technique that is practical for use in young children. MEG produces a reference-free signal and is, therefore, an ideal tool for computing the coherence between two distant cortical rhythms. Using a custom child-sized MEG, we recently reported that 5-to 7-year-old children with ASD (n = 26) have inherently different neural pathways than typically developing (TD) children that contribute to their relatively preserved performance of visual tasks. In this study, we performed non-invasive measurements of the brain activity of 70 young children (3-7 years old, of which 18 were aged 3-4 years), a sample consisting of 35 ASD children and 35 TD children. Physiological connectivity and the laterality of physiological connectivity were assessed using intrahemispheric coherence for 9 frequency bands. As a result, significant rightward connectivity between the parietotemporal areas, via gamma band oscillations, was found in the ASD group. As we obtained the non-invasive measurements using a custom child-sized MEG, this is the first study to demonstrate a rightward-lateralized neurophysiological network in conscious young children (including children aged 3-4 years) with ASD.

In the present study, we combined multiple in vivo linear recordings in rats and a tridimensional finite element model of the dentate gyrus, a curved structure displaying abnormally large positive LFPs. We demonstrate that the polarized dendritic arbour of granule cells (GCs), combined with the curved layered configuration of the population promote the spatial clustering of GC currents in the interposed hilus and project them through the open side at a distance from cell domains. LFPs grow up to 20 times larger than observed in synaptic sites. The dominant positive polarity of hilar LFPs was only produced by the synchronous activation of GCs in both blades by either somatic inhibition or dendritic excitation. Moreover, the corresponding anatomical pathways must project to both blades of the dentate gyrus as even a mild decrease in the spatial synchronization resulted in a dramatic reduction in LFP power in distant sites, yet not in the GC domains. It is concluded that the activation of layered structures may establish sharply delimited spatial domains where synaptic currents from one or another input appear to be segregated according to the topology of afferent pathways and the cytoarchitectonic features of the target population. These also determine preferred directions for volume conduction in the brain, of relevance for interpretation of surface EEG recordings.

Effects of Memantine on Event-Related Potential, Oscillations, and Complexity in Individuals With and Without Family Histories of Alcoholism	JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS			English	Article							RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; HIGH-RISK; EEG; THETA; KETAMINE; GLUTAMATE; P300; TASK; MODULATION; DEPENDENCE	Objective: Enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function associated with a positive family history of alcoholism (FHP) has been hypothesized to contribute to the heritable risk for alcoholism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of alcoholism family history, NMDA receptor function, and cortical information processing by testing acute effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on event-related potential (ERP). Method: Twenty-two healthy FHP and 20 healthy family history negative (FEN; no alcoholic relatives) subjects were administered placebo or 40 mg of memantine under double-blind counterbalanced conditions on two separate occasions. Electroencephalogram data were collected from eight channels with eyes open during an auditory oddball discrimination task. We evaluated P3b amplitude, total theta, alpha activity, and fractal dimension from ERP trials. Results: FHP and FEN subjects did not differ in P3b amplitude. A significant Group x Drug interaction was observed in theta, alpha activity, and fractal dimension at the parietal and occipital sites. FHP individuals exhibited significantly higher fractal dimension and lower theta and alpha activity after placebo relative to FEN subjects. Following memantine administration, theta activity decreased in both groups but more markedly for FHN individuals. Alpha activity decreased for FHN subjects and increased for FHP individuals, whereas the fractal dimension decreased for FHP subjects and increased for FEN subjects after memantine. Conclusions: A plausible interpretation of these results is that FHP individuals may have altered NMDA receptor function compared with FHN individuals. These findings provide additional evidence of differences in the regulation of NMDA receptor function between FHP and FEN individuals. (J. Stud.

We present ten social phobic subjects with three individually selected groups of words representing unconscious conflict, conscious symptom experience, and Osgood Semantic negative valence words used as a control word group. The unconscious conflict and conscious symptom words, presented subliminally and supraliminally, act as primes preceding the conscious symptom and control words presented as supraliminal targets. With alpha power as a marker of inhibitory brain activity, we show that unconscious conflict primes, only when presented subliminally, have a unique inhibitory effect on conscious symptom targets. This effect is absent when the unconscious conflict primes are presented supraliminally, or when the target is the control words. Unconscious conflict prime effects were found to correlate with a measure of repressiveness in a similar previous study (Shevrin et al., 1992, 1996). Conscious symptom primes have no inhibitory effect when presented subliminally. Inhibitory effects with conscious symptom primes are present, but only when the primes are supraliminal, and they did not correlate with repressiveness in a previous study (Shevrin et al., 1992, 1996). We conclude that while the inhibition following supraliminal conscious symptom primes is due to conscious threat bias, the inhibition following subliminal unconscious conflict primes provides a neurological blueprint for dynamic repression: it is only activated subliminally by an individual's unconscious conflict and has an inhibitory effect specific only to the conscious symptom. These novel findings constitute neuroscientific evidence for the psychoanalytic concepts of unconscious conflict and repression, while extending neuroscience theory and methods into the realm of personal, psychological meaning.

Increases in gamma power within the cerebral cortex have been found during many cognitive processes such as attention, learning, memory and problem solving in both humans and animals. However, the specificity of gamma to the detailed contents of memory remains largely unknown. We investigated the relationship between learning-induced increased gamma power in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the strength of memory for acoustic frequency. Adult male rats (n = 16) received three days (200 trials each) of pairing a tone (3.66 kHz) with stimulation of the nucleus basalis, which implanted a memory for acoustic frequency as assessed by associatively-induced disruption of ongoing behavior, viz., respiration. Post-training frequency generalization gradients (FGGs) revealed peaks at non-CS frequencies in 11116 cases, likely reflecting normal variation in pre-training acoustic experiences. A stronger relationship was found between increased gamma power and the frequency with the strongest memory (peak of the difference between individual post- and pre-training FGGs) vs. behavioral responses to the CS training frequency. No such relationship was found for the theta/alpha band (4-15 Hz). These findings indicate that the strength of specific increased neuronal synchronization within primary sensory cortical fields can determine the specific contents of memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) represents an established measure of the pyramidal system's integrity. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) offers the possibility to modulate ongoing oscillatory activity. Behaviorally, 20 Hz tACS in healthy subjects has been shown to result in movement slowing. However, the neurophysiological changes underlying these effects are not entirely understood yet. The present study aimed at ascertaining the effects of tACS at 10 and 20 Hz in healthy subjects on CMC and local power of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded during isometric contraction before and at two time points (2-10 min and 30-38 min) after tACS of the left primary motor cortex (M1), using a 306 channel whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. Additionally, electromyography (EMG) of the right extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle was measured. TACS was applied at 10 and 20 Hz, respectively, for 10 min at 1 mA. Sham stimulation served as control condition. The data suggest that 10 Hz tACS significantly reduced low gamma band CMC during isometric contraction. This implies that tACS does not necessarily cause effects at stimulation frequency. Rather, the findings suggest cross-frequency interplay between alpha and low gamma band activity modulating functional interaction between motor cortex and muscle.

J	Li, XQ; Yang, YF				Li, Xiaoqing; Yang, Yufang			How long-term memory and accentuation interact during spoken language comprehension	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Accentuation; Spoken language comprehension; N400; Selective attention; Semantic meaning	STANDARD CHINESE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; N400; FOCUS; DISCOURSE; ATTENTION; SPEECH; WORDS	Spoken language comprehension requires immediate integration of different information types, such as semantics, syntax, and prosody. Meanwhile, both the information derived from speech signals and the information retrieved from long-term memory exert their influence on language comprehension immediately. Using EEG (electroencephalogram), the present study investigated how the information retrieved from long-term memory interacts with accentuation during spoken language comprehension. Mini Chinese discourses were used as stimuli, with an interrogative or assertive context sentence preceding the target sentence. The target sentence included one critical word conveying new information. The critical word was either highly expected or lowly expected given the information retrieved from long-term memory. Moreover, the critical word was either consistently accented or inconsistently de-accented. The results revealed that for lowly expected new information, inconsistently de-accented words elicited a larger N400 and larger theta power increases (4-6 Hz) than consistently accented words. In contrast, for the highly expected new information, consistently accented words elicited a larger N400 and larger alpha power decreases (8-14 Hz) than inconsistently de-accented words. The results suggest that, during spoken language comprehension, the effect of accentuation interacted with the information retrieved from long-term memory immediately. Moreover, our results also have important consequences for our understanding of the processing nature of the N400. The N400 amplitude is not only enhanced for incorrect information (new and de-accented word) but also enhanced for correct information (new and accented words). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In most of these studies, the choice of stimulation parameters is critical to obtain desired clinical effects. In particular, the stimulation frequency is a key parameter that is difficult to tune. A reason is that our knowledge about the frequency-dependant mechanisms according to which DBS indirectly impacts the dynamics of pathological neuronal systems located in the neocortex is still limited. We address this issue using both computational modeling and intracerebral EEG (iEEG) data. We developed a macroscopic (neural mass) model of the thalamocortical network. In line with already-existing models, it includes interconnected neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons, thalamocortical cells and reticular neurons. The novelty was to introduce, in the thalamic compartment, the biophysical effects of direct stimulation. Regarding clinical data, we used a quite unique data set recorded in a patient (drug-resistant epilepsy) with a focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). In this patient, DBS strongly reduced the sustained epileptic activity of the FCD for low-frequency (LFS, < 2 Hz) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS, > 70 Hz) while intermediate-frequency stimulation (IFS, around 50 Hz) had no effect. Signal processing, clustering, and optimization techniques allowed us to identify the necessary conditions for reproducing, in the model, the observed frequency-dependent stimulation effects. Key elements which explain the suppression of epileptic activity in the FCD include: (a) feed-forward inhibition and synaptic short-term depression of thalamocortical connections at LFS, and (b) inhibition of the thalamic output at HFS. Conversely, modeling results indicate that IFS favors thalamic oscillations and entrains epileptic dynamics.

There is a growing interest in whether and how propofol anesthesia inhibits WM function. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible inhibition mechanism of propofol anesthesia based on the functional connections of multi-local field potentials (LFPs) and behavior during WM tasks. Adult SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: pro group (0.5 mg.kg(-1).min(-1),2 h), PRO group (0.9 mg.kg(-1).min(-1), 2 h) and control group. The experimental data were 16-channel LFPs obtained at prefrontal cortex with implanted microelectrode array in SD rats during WM tasks in Y-maze at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours (day 1-day 5) after propofol anesthesia, and the behavior results of WM were recoded at the same time. Directed transfer function (DTF) method was applied to analyze the connections among LFPs directly. Furthermore, the causal networks were identified by DTF. The clustering coefficient (C), network density (D) and global efficiency (E-global) were selected to describe the functional connectivity quantitatively. The results show that: comparing with the control group, the LFPs functional connectivity in pro group were no significantly difference (p > 0.05); the connectivity in PRO group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 at 24 hours, p < 0.05 at 48 hours), while no significant difference at 72, 96 and 120 hours for rats (p > 0.05), which were consistent with the behavior results. These findings could lead to improved understanding the mechanism of inhibition of anesthesia on WM functions from the view of connections among LFPs.

Relation between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single neuron, local field potential (LFP) and electrocorticography (ECoG) activity in human cortex	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI BOLD; electrocorticogram; single neurons; local field potentials; human cortex	HUMAN TEMPORAL CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; BOLD SIGNAL; VERBAL MEMORY; MOTOR CORTEX; FIRING RATE; MRI; ACTIVATION; ALPHA	The relation between changes in the blood oxygen dependent metabolic changes imaged by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural events directly recorded from human cortex from single neurons, local field potentials (LFPs) and electrocorticogram (ECoG) is critically reviewed, based on the published literature including findings from the authors' laboratories. All these data are from special populations, usually patients with medically refractory epilepsy, as this provides the major opportunity for direct cortical neuronal recording in humans. For LFP and ECoG changes are often sought in different frequency bands, for single neurons in frequency of action potentials. Most fMRI studies address issues of functional localization. The relation of those findings to localized changes in neuronal recordings in humans has been established in several ways. Only a few studies have directly compared changes in activity from the same sites in the same individual, using the same behavioral measure. More often the comparison has been between fMRI and electrophysiologic changes in populations recorded from the same functional anatomic system as defined by lesion effects; in a few studies those systems have been defined by fMRI changes such as the "default" network. The fMRI-electrophysiologic relationships have been evaluated empirically by colocalization of significant changes, and by quantitative analyses, often multiple linear regression. There is some evidence that the fMRI-electrophysiology relationships differ in different cortical areas, particularly primary motor and sensory cortices compared to association cortex, but also within areas of association cortex. Although crucial for interpretation of fMRI changes as reflecting neural activity in human cortex, controversy remains as to these relationships.

Ketamine disrupts theta synchrony across the septotemporal axis of the CA1 region of hippocampus. J Neurophysiol 109: 570-579, 2013. First published October 31, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00561.2012.-The hippocampal theta signal reflects moment-to-moment variation in the synchrony of synaptic input to hippocampal neurons. Consistent with the topography of hippocampal afferents, the synchrony (coherence) of the theta signal varies across the septotemporal axis. Septotemporal variation in the theta signal can also be observed in relation to ongoing and past experience. Thus there is a systematic decrease in the relationship between locomotor speed and theta power across the septotemporal axis, septal hippocampus exhibiting the strongest relationship. Conversely, theta in temporal hippocampus decrements over repeated behavioral experience (running episodes), while theta in the septal hippocampus does not. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that can decrease theta power. The present study examined whether ketamine treatment could alter theta coherence across the long axis independent of changes in locomotor behavior. Rats were well trained to navigate a linear runway and outfitted with electrodes at different septotemporal positions within CA1. Locomotor behavior and theta coherence and power were examined after administration of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg ketamine. Ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) decreased theta coherence between distant CA1 electrode sites without altering running speed or theta power. Both doses of ketamine also blunted and reversed the decrement in theta power observed at midseptotemporal and temporal electrodes over repeated run sessions. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of global network synchronization to relatively low doses of ketamine and septotemporal differences in the influence of ketamine on hippocampal dynamics in relation to past experience.

J	Zhang, L; Peng, WW; Zhang, ZG; Hu, L				Zhang, Li; Peng, Weiwei; Zhang, Zhiguo; Hu, Li			Distinct Features of Auditory Steady-State Responses as Compared to Transient Event-Related Potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CLICK TRAINS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EEG RESPONSES; SPINE SURGERY; GAMMA-BAND; BRAIN; COMPONENTS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Transient event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state responses (SSRs) have been popularly employed to investigate the function of the human brain, but their relationship still remains a matter of debate. Some researchers believed that SSRs could be explained by the linear summation of successive transient ERPs (superposition hypothesis), while others believed that SSRs were the result of the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the periodic repetition of a sensory stimulus (oscillatory entrainment hypothesis). In the present study, taking auditory modality as an example, we aimed to clarify the distinct features of SSRs, evoked by the 40-Hz and 60-Hz periodic auditory stimulation, as compared to transient ERPs, evoked by a single click. We observed that (1) SSRs were mainly generated by phase synchronization, while late latency responses (LLRs) in transient ERPs were mainly generated by power enhancement; (2) scalp topographies of LLRs in transient ERPs were markedly different from those of SSRs; (3) the powers of both 40-Hz and 60-Hz SSRs were significantly correlated, while they were not significantly correlated with the N1 power in transient ERPs; (4) whereas SSRs were dominantly modulated by stimulus intensity, middle latency responses (MLRs) were not significantly modulated by both stimulus intensity and subjective loudness judgment, and LLRs were significantly modulated by subjective loudness judgment even within the same stimulus intensity. All these findings indicated that high-frequency SSRs were different from both MLRs and LLRs in transient ERPs, thus supporting the possibility of oscillatory entrainment hypothesis to the generation of SSRs. Therefore, SSRs could be used to explore distinct neural responses as compared to transient ERPs, and help us reveal novel and reliable neural mechanisms of the human brain.

Although it is well known that tremor depends on cortico-muscular coupling, it is unclear whether synchronization within and between brain areas is specifically related to the presence and severity of tremor. To tackle this longstanding issue, we took advantage of naturally occurring spontaneous tremor fluctuations and investigated cerebral synchronization in the presence and absence of rest tremor. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus, the magnetoencephalogram and the electromyogram of forearm muscles in 11 patients with Parkinson's disease (all male, age: 52-74 years). Recordings took place the day after surgery for deep brain stimulation, after withdrawal of anti-parkinsonian medication. We selected epochs containing spontaneous rest tremor and tremor-free epochs, respectively, and compared power and coherence between subthalamic nucleus, cortex and muscle across conditions. Tremor-associated changes in cerebro-muscular coherence were localized by Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources. Subsequently, cortico-cortical coupling was analysed by computation of the imaginary part of coherency, a coupling measure insensitive to volume conduction. After tremor onset, local field potential power increased at individual tremor frequency and cortical power decreased in the beta band (13-30 Hz). Sensor level subthalamic nucleus-cortex, cortico-muscular and subthalamic nucleus-muscle coherence increased during tremor specifically at tremor frequency. The increase in subthalamic nucleus-cortex coherence correlated with the increase in electromyogram power. On the source level, we observed tremor-associated increases in cortico-muscular coherence in primary motor cortex, premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex contralateral to the tremulous limb. Analysis of the imaginary part of coherency revealed tremor-dependent coupling between these cortical areas at tremor frequency and double tremor frequency. Our findings demonstrate a direct relationship between the synchronization of cerebral oscillations and tremor manifestation. Furthermore, they suggest the feasibility of tremor detection based on local field potentials and might thus become relevant for the design of closed-loop stimulation systems.

J	Engel, J				Engel, J., Jr.			Why Is There Still Doubt to Cut It Out?	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Review							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HOC TASK-FORCE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; SURGERY; BRAIN; BIOMARKERS; SEIZURES; TRENDS; EEG	Surgical treatment for epilepsy has made tremendous strides in the past few decades as a result of advances in neurodiagnostics-particularly structural and functional neuroimaging-and improved surgical techniques. This has not only resulted in better outcomes with respect to epileptic seizures and quality of life, and reduced surgical morbidity and mortality, but it has also increased the population of patients now considered as surgical candidates, particularly in the pediatric age range, and enhanced cost-effectiveness sufficient to make surgical treatment available to countries with limited resources. Yet surgical treatment for epilepsy remains arguably the most underutilized of all accepted medical interventions. In the United States, less than 1% of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy are referred to epilepsy centers. Although the number of epilepsy surgery centers has increased appreciably over the past two decades, the number of therapeutic surgical procedures performed for epilepsy has not increased at all. For patients who are referred, the average delay from onset of epilepsy to surgery is more than 20 years-too late for many to avoid a lifetime of disability or premature death. Not only has there been no consistent message to convince neurologists and primary care physicians to refer patients for surgery, but the increase in epilepsy surgery centers in the United States has appeared to result in a divergence of approaches to surgical treatment. Efforts are still needed to further improve the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment, including the identification of biomarkers that can reliably determine the extent of the epileptogenic region; however, the greatest benefits would derive from increasing access for potential surgical candidates to epilepsy surgery facilities. Information is needed to determine why appropriate surgical referrals are not being made. Consensus conferences are necessary to resolve controversies that still exist regarding presurgical evaluation and surgical approaches. Standards should be established for certifying epilepsy centers as recommended by the Institute of Medicine's report on epilepsy. Finally, the epilepsy community should not be promoting epilepsy surgery per se but instead emphasize that epilepsy centers do more than epilepsy surgery, promoting the message: All patients with disabling pharmacoresistant seizures deserve evaluation by specialists at epilepsy centers who can provide a variety of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic services.

In mammals and birds, electroencephalographic recordings reveal alternating states of wakefulness, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep (or rapid eye movement sleep). This control is profoundly impaired in narcolepsy with cataplexy, a disease resulting from the loss of orexin/hypocretin neurotransmitter signalling in the brain. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is characterized by irresistible bouts of sleep during the day, sleep fragmentation during the night and episodes of cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake and experiencing emotions. The neural mechanisms underlying cataplexy are unknown, but commonly thought to involve those of rapid eye movement-sleep atonia, and cataplexy typically is considered as a rapid eye movement sleep disorder. Here we reassess cataplexy in hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin) gene knockout mice. Using a novel video/electroencephalogram double-blind scoring method, we show that cataplexy is not a state per se, as believed previously, but a dynamic, multi-phased process involving a reproducible progression of states. A knockout-specific state and a stereotypical paroxysmal event were introduced to account for signals and electroencephalogram spectral characteristics not seen in wild-type littermates. Cataplexy almost invariably started with a brief phase of wake-like electroencephalogram, followed by a phase featuring high-amplitude irregular theta oscillations, defining an activity profile distinct from paradoxical sleep, referred to as cataplexy-associated state and in the course of which 1.5-2 s high-amplitude, highly regular, hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta bursts (similar to 7 Hz) occurred. In contrast to cataplexy onset, exit from cataplexy did not show a predictable sequence of activities. Altogether, these data contradict the hypothesis that cataplexy is a state similar to paradoxical sleep, even if long cataplexies may evolve into paradoxical sleep. Although not exclusive to overt cataplexy, cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta activities are highly enriched during cataplexy in hypocretin/orexin knockout mice. Their occurrence in an independent narcolepsy mouse model, the orexin/ataxin 3 transgenic mouse, undergoing loss of orexin neurons, was confirmed. Importantly, we document for the first time similar paroxysmal theta hypersynchronies (similar to 4 Hz) during cataplexy in narcoleptic children. Lastly, we show by deep recordings in mice that the cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta activities are independent of hippocampal theta and involve the frontal cortex. Cataplexy hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta bursts may represent medial prefrontal activity, associated in humans and rodents with reward-driven motor impulse, planning and conflict monitoring.
