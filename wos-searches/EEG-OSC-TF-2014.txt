MNE software for processing MEG and EEG data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Electroencephalography (EEG); Software; Inverse problem; Time-frequency analysis; Connectivity; Non-parametric statistics	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; SIGNAL; DIPOLE; HEAD; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECONSTRUCTION	Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals originating from neural currents in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate brain activity is a challenging task, as evidenced by several decades of methodological contributions. MNE, whose name stems from its capability to compute conically-constrained minimum-norm current estimates from M/EEG data, is a software package that provides comprehensive analysis tools and workflows including preprocessing, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. The present paper gives detailed information about the MNE package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential caveats in analysis. The MNE package is a collaborative effort of multiple institutes striving to implement and share best methods and to facilitate distribution of analysis pipelines to advance reproducibility of research.

We review here the most recent developments in the utility of EEG in the diagnosis of ADHD, with emphasis on the most commonly used and emerging EEG metrics and their reliability in diagnostic classification. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD and the complexity of information available from the EEG signals, we suggest that considerable benefits are to be gained from multivariate analyses and a focus towards understanding of the neural generators of EEG. We conclude that while EEG cannot currently be used as a diagnostic tool, vast developments in analytical and technological tools in its domain anticipate future progress in its utility in the clinical setting.

Seizure morphology is known to evolve both temporally and spatially with a similar evolution also observed in the frequency domain. The modulation frequency analysis which is widely used in speech processing is used here to extract the frequency-localized spectral dynamics of the neonatal EEG and investigate their discriminative capabilities in the context of neonatal seizure detection. This study suggests that the spectral dynamics of neonatal EEG are more informative than short-term spectral characteristics. It is shown that the seizure-relevant components of the modulation spectrogram are found in the vicinity of 0.4Hz. Modulation frequency analysis represents a new insight into the EEG signal which can uncover the underlying time-structural organization of the neonatal EEG signal and therefore improve clinical understanding of the dynamic processes involved.

This paper compares the EEG signals acquired simultaneously from the outer ring of the TCRE (oTCRE), shorting all three elements of the TCRE (sTCRE) and disc electrode (disc) concurrently from nearly the same location on the human scalp. We calculated the average correlation for the time series between each pair of signals and average coherence over the pass-band frequencies between all pairs of signals as well. All the correlations and coherences were above 0.99. The results suggest that the oTCRE can be used to record EEG concurrently with tEEG from the same sensor at the same location.

Here it is shown that a single functional principle-temporal fluctuations in oscillation peak frequency ("frequency sliding")-can be used as a common analysis approach to bridge multiple scales within neuroscience. Frequency sliding is demonstrated in simulated neural networks and in human EEG data during a visual task. Simulations of biophysically detailed neuron models show that frequency sliding modulates spike threshold and timing variability, as well as coincidence detection. Finally, human resting-state EEG data demonstrate that frequency sliding occurs endogenously and can be used to identify large-scale networks. Frequency sliding appears to be a general principle that regulates brain function on multiple spatial and temporal scales, from modulating spike timing in individual neurons to coordinating large-scale brain networks during cognition and resting state.

Part 1: Theory and proposed methodology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Sleep spindle; Time delay; Time-frequency analysis; Signal propagation; S-transform	S-TRANSFORM; SLOW OSCILLATION; BRAIN; COHERENCE; FORMULATION; LAPLACIAN; SPECTRUM; DEFICITS; RHYTHMS; MEG	Background: A convergence of studies has revealed sleep spindles to be associated with sleep-related cognitive processing and even with fundamental waking state capacities such as intelligence. However, some spindle characteristics, such as propagation direction and delay, may play a decisive role but are only infrequently investigated because of technical complexities. New method: A new methodology for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is described. This approach is based on the alignment of time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels. Results: This first of a two-part series concentrates on framing theoretical considerations related to EEG spindle propagation and on detailing the methodology. A short example application is provided that illustrates the repeatability of results obtained with the new propagation measure in a sample of 32 night recordings. A more comprehensive experimental investigation is presented in part two of the series. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared to existing methods, this approach is particularly well adapted for studying the propagation of sleep spindles because it estimates time delays rather than phase synchrony and it computes propagation properties for every individual spindle with windows adjusted to the specific spindle duration. Conclusions: The proposed methodology is effective in tracking the propagation of spindles across the scalp and may thus help in elucidating the temporal aspects of sleep spindle dynamics, as well as other transient EEG and MEG events. A software implementation (the Spyndle Python package) is provided as open source software. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a potential measure to assess stress through analysis of brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). In two experiments, White Pekin ducks were implanted with EEG transmitters and treated with potential stressors in a chamber or in their pens. Electrocardiograms and blood corticosterone levels were collected as standard measures of stress. EEG analysis showed an increase in the relative delta frequency and a decrease in the relative alpha frequency during the treatment period for shock (P < 0.05). EEG analysis of the second experiment showed no differences between time periods for all frequencies for all treatments. Based on these results, EEG is currently not a viable technique for the measurement of acute stress in commercial poultry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pritchett, E. M.; Rogers, A.

The interaction among the multiple brain oscillators might produce lag synchronisation. In addition, phase differences between EEG channels might also reflect this "time delay" phenomenon. It has been suggested that the lag-synchronisation of chaotic oscillators depends on the direction of the delay differences between characteristic frequencies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the direction of the phase difference between two electroencephalography (EEG) channels depends on the source of the characteristic frequency. The dependence of the phase shift on the mean frequency between two channels were examined in a group of 17,722 healthy truck drivers. The mean phase difference between two EEG channels was estimated using the Hilbert transform and compared with the difference in the characteristic frequency. The number of EEG segments with a phase delay from the electrode with a lower frequency to the electrode with a higher frequency was significantly higher than that moving in the opposite direction. The most significant direction of the phase delay was occipito-frontal. These results support the hypothesis that lag synchronisation occurs in the human brain as a result of phase differences that lead to "time delays" in the transfer of information from one part of the brain to another. However, this mechanism does not explain the dependence of phase differences on the frequencies between the electrodes. This work provides an alternative explanation for the phase shift between oscillations in different parts of the brain by the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems.

In this study, we have examined several algorithms of HFOs detection to facilitate analysis of intracranial recordings and increase their diagnostic yield. We have evaluated three newly designed and three published HFOs detectors. Detectors were applied on datasets containing HFOs labeled by experienced readers and their performance evaluated. Results of the detection and properties of the algorithms are reviewed and discussed in respect to clinical practice and their possible utilization during the diagnostic workup in patients with epilepsy.

Proposal of a three-dimensional brain mapping system based on the quantitative analysis of the electroencephalographic signal	5TH ISSNIP-IEEE BIOSIGNALS AND BIOROBOTICS CONFERENCE (2014): BIOSIGNALS AND ROBOTICS FOR BETTER AND SAFER LIVING	ISSNIP Biosignals and Biorobotics Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	5th ISSNIP-IEEE Biosignals and Biorobotics Conference - Biosignals and Robotics for Better and Safer Living (BRC)	MAY 26-28, 2014	Salvador, BRAZIL	IEEE, CNPq, Univ Fed Bahia, CAPES, ISSNIP		Quantitative; electroencephalography; three-dimensional; brain; mapping		Because of the evolution of technology and consequently, the development of advanced techniques, related to signal analysis and digitalization, has increased the use of data from brain electrical activity in clinical analysis and in researches, for example, with the use of the quantitative electroencephalography (EEGq). This is based in techniques of digital signal processing, such as, statistical analysis, transforming to the frequency domain, prediction and others. The topographic quantitative EEG (EEGQT) allows the creation of a scalp image showing the activity in many regions of the brain based on the quantitative analysis of the EEG signal. It gives an accurate graphical vision of the electrical activity, as well their localizations and alterations. The existing EEGQT software is based on the signal analysis on the frequency domain and gives a two-dimensional vision of the cortical activity. To obtain a more reliable EEGQT in real time, it would be important a three-dimensional mapping of the cortex. The main objective of this work is to present a proposal of architecture of a computational system capable to generate a three-dimensional brain mapping based not only on the frequency domain analysis, but in other characteristics of the EEG signals, such as, the similarity, stationarity, frequency, entropy and the signal linearity.

In this work, we propose a modified neural mass model that incorporates a time delay. This time-delay model can be used to simulate several different types of EEG activity including alpha wave, interictal EEG, and ictal EEG. We present a detailed description of the model's behavior with bifurcation diagrams. Through simulation and an analysis of the influence of the time delay on the model's oscillatory behavior, we demonstrate that a time delay in neuronal signal transmission could cause seizure-like activity in the brain. Further study of the bifurcations in this new neural mass model could provide a theoretical reference for the understanding of the neurodynamics in epileptic seizures.

Disrupted Gamma-Band Neural Oscillations During Coherent Motion Perception in Heavy Cannabis Users	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA MT; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; GLUTAMATERGIC NEURONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; TRANSPARENT MOTION; CORTICAL AREAS; CB1 RECEPTOR	Previous work in animals and humans has shown that exogenous cannabinoids disrupt time-locked, evoked gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz). However, no studies to date have examined the effect of cannabis on non-time-locked, induced gamma oscillations during more complex Gestalt perception. The current study therefore utilized electroencephalography (EEG) to examine gamma oscillations during coherent motion perception in heavy cannabis users and controls. Chronic cannabis users (n = 24; 12 h abstinence before study; positive 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol urine levels) and cannabis-naive controls (n = 23) were evaluated. Stimuli consisted of random dot kinetograms (RD1<s) that subjects passively viewed during three different conditions: coherent motion, incoherent motion, and static. Time x frequency analysis on EEG data was performed using Fourier-based mean trial power (MTP). Transient event-related potentials (ERPs) to stimulus onset (visual N100 and P200 components) were also evaluated. The results showed that the coherent motion condition produced a robust increase in neural activity in the gamma range (induced power from 40 to 59 Hz) as compared with the incoherent motion and static conditions. As predicted, the cannabis group showed significant reductions in induced gamma power in the coherent condition relative to healthy controls. No differences were observed between the groups in the N100 or P200 components, indicating intact primary sensory processing. Finally, cannabis users showed a trend toward increased scores on the Chapman Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) that was positively correlated with total years of active cannabis use. These data suggest that cannabis use may interfere with the generation of induced gamma-band neural oscillations that could in part mediate the perceptual-altering effects of exogenous cannabinoids.

This is a pilot study aiming to assess whether spontaneous activity transients (SAT) in the early preterm babies are affected by drugs that are routinely used in neonatal intensive care. Methods: We collected retrospectively seventeen EEG recordings (15 babies, conceptional age 26-33 weeks, no brain lesions) that were divided into groups according to drug administration at the time of EEG: phenobarbital, fentanyl, theophylline, and controls. SATs were extracted from the EEG for further analysis with several advanced time-series analysis paradigms. Results: The visual appearance of SATs was unaffected by drugs. Phenobarbital reduced the total power of the SAT events. Both fentanyl and phenobarbital reduced the length of SATs, and enhanced the oscillations at higher frequencies. Theophylline reduced the oscillatory activity at middle frequencies during SAT, but enhanced oscillations at higher frequencies during time-period prior to SAT. Conclusions: Our findings suggest, that (i) all drugs examined affect brain activity in ways that are not seen in the visual EEG interpretation, and that (ii) both acute and long term (i.e. developmental) effects of these drugs on brain may warrant more attention as a part of optimizing preterm neurological care.

Acute Effects of Alcohol on Stimulus-Induced Gamma Oscillations in Human Primary Visual and Motor Cortices	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; ETHANOL; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MODULATION; FREQUENCY; NEURONS	Alcohol is a rich drug affecting both the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems. Recent findings from both modeling and pharmacological manipulation have indicated a link between GABAergic activity and oscillations measured in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz), but there are no previous reports of alcohol's modulation of gamma-band activity measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG). In this single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, 16 participants completed two study days, on one day of which they consumed a dose of 0.8 g/kg alcohol, and on the other day a placebo. MEG recordings of brain activity were taken before and after beverage consumption, using visual grating and finger abduction paradigms known to induce gamma-band activity in the visual and motor cortices respectively. Time-frequency analyses of beamformer source reconstructions in the visual cortex showed that alcohol increased peak gamma amplitude and decreased peak frequency. For the motor task, alcohol increased gamma amplitude in the motor cortex. These data support the notion that gamma oscillations are dependent, in part, on the balance between excitation and inhibition. Disruption of this balance by alcohol, by increasing GABAergic inhibition at GABA(A) receptors and decreasing glutamatergic excitation at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, alters both the amplitude and frequency of gamma oscillations. The findings provide further insight into the neuropharmacological action of alcohol.

An accelerometer was placed on the head of the subjects in order to record the shocks undergone by the EEG electrodes during walking. Our results indicate that up to 15 harmonics of the fundamental stepping frequency may pollute EEG signals, depending on the walking speed and also on the electrode location. This finding may call into question some conclusions drawn in previous EEG studies where low-delta band (especially around 1 Hz, the fundamental stepping frequency) had been announced as being the seat of angular and linear kinematics control of the lower limbs during walk. Additionally, our analysis reveals that EEG and accelerometer signals exhibit similar time-frequency properties, especially in frequency bands extending up to 150 Hz, suggesting that previous conclusions claiming the activation of high-gamma rhythms during walking may have been drawn on the basis of insufficiently cleaned EEG signals. Our results are put in perspective with recent EEG studies related to locomotion and extensively discussed in particular by focusing on the low-delta and high-gamma bands.

We first identify pre-/post-stimulus EEG oscillatory activities that are correlated with the intensity of laser-evoked pain perception using a multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model, which is solved by partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Further, we used the MVLR model to predict the intensity of pain perception from identified pain-correlated time-frequency EEG data for each subject. Our results showed that the proposed MVLR prediction model provided a qualitative prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high pain) with an accuracy of 78.53 +/- 1.16% and a quantitative prediction of pain (on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.45 +/- 0.05, both of which are significantly better than the results of the conventional pain prediction based on single-trial detection of laser-evoked potentials. Besides, for the first time it was found that the pre-stimulus EEG oscillation could significantly contribute to the prediction, which extended our notion of the determinants of pain perception.

A correct presurgical identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) with intracranial electrodes has a direct impact on postsurgical outcome. We aimed at identifying biomarkers of the EZ based on computer-assisted inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Methods Computer-driven intracranial EEG analysis in the domains of time, frequency, and space was retrospectively applied to a population of 10 patients with focal epilepsy to detect EZ electrophysiologic markers. Next, a prospective study was performed on 14 surgery candidate patients. The stereo-EEG computer-assisted analysis of EZ boundaries performed blind from patients data was compared to that defined with the traditional visual inspection completed by neurophysiologists. Results In the retrospective study, the EZ was characterized by the combined detection of three biomarkers observed at seizure onset: (1) fast activity at 80-120Hz associated with (2) very slow transient polarizing shift and (3) voltage depression (flattening). Correlations between these indexes were calculated for each seizure. In the prospective study, the quantified analysis based on the three biomarkers confirmed a complete overlap between leads within the EZ identified by expert clinicians.

Significance Our findings demonstrate and validate with a prospective unbiased study the use of three neurophysiologic intracranial EEG parameters as excellent biomarkers of ictogenesis and as reliable indicators of EZ boundaries.

Additional information on cognitive functions can be assessed when analyzing ERPs in the frequency domain and treating them as event-related oscillations (EROs). This procedure results in frequency spectra but lacks information about the temporal dynamics of EROs. Here, we describe a method-called time-frequency analysis-that allows analyzing both the frequency of an ERO and its evolution over time. In a brief tutorial, the reader will learn how to use wavelet analysis in order to compute time-frequency transforms of ERP data. Basic steps as well as potential artifacts are described. Rather than in terms of formulas, descriptions are in textual form (written text) with numerous figures illustrating the topics. Recommendations on how to present frequency and time-frequency data in journal articles are provided. Finally, we briefly review studies that have applied time-frequency analysis to mismatch negativity paradigms. The deviant stimulus of such a paradigm evokes an ERO in the theta frequency band that is stronger than for the standard stimulus. Conversely, the standard stimulus evokes a stronger gamma-band response than does the deviant. This is interpreted in the context of the so-called match-and-utilization model.

Simultaneous recording of MEG, EEG and intracerebral EEG during visual stimulation: From feasibility to single-trial analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; EEG; SEEG; Simultaneous recordings; Single-trial analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; COMPONENTS	Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and intracerebral stereotaxic EEG (SEEG) are the three neurophysiological recording techniques, which are thought to capture the same type of brain activity. Still, the relationships between non-invasive (EEG, MEG) and invasive (SEEG) signals remain to be further investigated. In early attempts at comparing SEEG with either EEG or MEG, the recordings were performed separately for each modality. However such an approach presents substantial limitations in terms of signal analysis. The goal of this technical note is to investigate the feasibility of simultaneously recording these three signal modalities (EEG, MEG and SEEG), and to provide strategies for analyzing this new kind of data. Intracerebral electrodes were implanted in a patient with intractable epilepsy for presurgical evaluation purposes. This patient was presented with a visual stimulation paradigm while the three types of signals were simultaneously recorded. The analysis started with a characterization of the MEG artifact caused by the SEEG equipment. Next, the average evoked activities were computed at the sensor level, and cortical source activations were estimated for both the EEG and MEG recordings; these were shown to be compatible with the spatiotemporal dynamics of the SEEG signals. In the average time-frequency domain, concordant patterns between the MEG/EEG and SEEG recordings were found below the 40 Hz level. Finally, a fine-grained coupling between the amplitudes of the three recording modalities was detected in the time domain, at the level of single evoked responses. Importantly, these correlations have shown a high level of spatial and temporal specificity. These findings provide a case for the ability of trimodal recordings (EEG, MEG, and SEEG) to reach a greater level of specificity in the investigation of brain signals and functions.

Modafinil Effects on Middle-Frequency Oscillatory Power During Rule Selection in Schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INTERNEURON DIVERSITY SERIES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; DOUBLE-BLIND	Control-related cognitive processes such as rule selection are associated with cortical oscillations in the theta, alpha and, beta ranges, and modulated by catecholamine neurotransmission. Thus, a potential strategy for improving cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia would be to use pro-catecholamine pharmacological agents to augment these control-related oscillations. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled (within-subjects) study, we tested the effects of adjunctive single-dose modafinil 200 mg on rule-related 4-30 Hz oscillations in 23 stable schizophrenia patients, using EEG during cognitive control task performance. EEG data underwent time-frequency decomposition with Morlet wavelets to determine the power of 4-30 Hz oscillations. Modafinil (relative to placebo) enhanced oscillatory power associated with high-control rule selection in theta, alpha, and beta ranges, with modest effects during rule maintenance. Modafinil treatment in schizophrenia augments middle-frequency cortical oscillatory power associated with rule selection, and may subserve diverse subcomponent processes in proactive cognitive control.

Simple visual stimulation was presented to 17 healthy subjects during EEG recording. An O-2 electrode was used for analysis with a 32 channel EEG sampling system. We used a segmentation of raw data in order to obtain the evoked potential. Prestimulus and poststimulus activities were filtered in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band. Later, four different events (blocked, time-locked, phase-locked, and eliminated) were separately averaged. Phase-locked sweeps were determined by application of inter-trial coherence analysis. The evaluation of the data shows that "time-locked and phase-locked sweeps" were the dominating pattern and not "the blocked pattern", which occurred only when the prestimulus alpha was high. In the analyses of EEG-EP sweeps, only 22 % of epochs showed (ERD). The ANOVA revealed significant differences between four different alpha responses (F(3,48) = 11.175; p < 0.001). Furthermore, alpha oscillations in time-locked responses were significantly higher than blocked (p < 0.0001). The analyses clearly demonstrate that important precaution is needed when using the ERD as a cognitive or pathological marker.

ElectroEncephalography (EEG) appears as a non-invasive and repeatable technique to diagnose brain abnormalities. Despite technical advances, the analysis of EEG spectra is usually carried out by experts that must manually perform laborious interpretations. Computational methods may lead to a quantitative analysis of these signals and hence to characterize EEG time series. The aim of this work is to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals involved in AD and MCI in order to support medical doctors in the right diagnosis formulation. The analysis of the biological EEG signals requires effective and efficient computer science methods to extract relevant information. Data mining, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, is a natural way to approach EEG data analysis. Specifically, in our work we apply the following analysis steps: (i) pre-processing of EEG data; (ii) processing of the EEG-signals by the application of time-frequency transforms; and (iii) classification by means of machine learning methods. We obtain promising results from the classification of AD, MCI, and control samples that can assist the medical doctors in identifying the pathology.

We aimed to investigate event-related oscillations associated with the Stroop test. EEG data was collected from 23 healthy volunteers while they performed a computer version of Stroop test. Both evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) oscillatory responses in the EEG were analyzed by wavelet transform. Data from the congruent (color-word matching) and incongruent stimuli (color-word non-matching) conditions are compared. In the incongruent condition, N450 wave was more negative and amplitude of the late slow wave was more positive. In the time-frequency plane, the fronto-central total theta amplitude (300-700 ms) was larger in the incongruent condition. The evoked delta (250-600 ms) was larger in the congruent condition particularly over parieto-occipital regions. The larger frontal theta response in the incongruent condition was associated with the detection of interference and inhibition of the response to task-irrelevant features, while the larger evoked delta in the congruent condition was suggestive of the easier decision process owing to congruency between the physical attribute and the verbal meaning of the stimuli. Furthermore, in the incongruent condition, amplitude of the occipital total alpha in the very late phase (700-900 ms) was smaller. This prolonged desynchronization in the alpha band could be reflecting augmentation of attentional filters in visual modality for the next stimulus. These multiple findings on EEG time-frequency plane provide improved description of the overlapping processes in Stroop test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Historically, clinicians and researchers have always been interested in quantifying and characterizing those effects through recordings of surface brain electrical activity, namely electroencephalography (EEG). Over decades of research, the complex signal has been dissected to extract its core substance, with significant advances in the interpretation of the information it may contain. Methodological, engineering, statistical, mathematical, and computer progress now furnishes advanced tools that not only allow quantification of the effects of anesthesia, but also shed light on some aspects of anesthetic mechanisms. In this article, we will review how advanced EEG serves the anesthesiologist in that respect, but will not review other intraoperative utilities that have no direct relationship with consciousness, such as monitoring of brain and spinal cord integrity. We will start with a reminder of anesthestic effects on raw EEG and its time and frequency domain components, as well as a summary of the EEG analysis techniques of use for the anesthesiologist. This will introduce the description of the use of EEG to assess the depth of the hypnotic and anti-nociceptive components of anesthesia, and its clinical utility. The last part will describe the use of EEG for the understanding of mechanisms of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness. We will see how, eventually in association with transcranial magnetic stimulation, it allows exploring functional cerebral networks during anesthesia. We will also see how EEG recordings during anesthesia, and their sophisticated analysis, may help corroborate current theories of mental content generation.

We investigated VLF-EEG case-control differences in adult samples and the effects of methylphenidate (MPH). A longitudinal case-control study was conducted examining the effects of MPH on VLF-EEG (.02-0.2 Hz) during a cued continuous performance task. 41 untreated adults with ADHD and 47 controls were assessed, and 21 cases followed up after MPH treatment, with a similar follow-up for 38 controls (mean follow-up = 9.4 months). Cases had enhanced frontal and parietal VLF-EEG and increased omission errors. In the whole sample, increased parietal VLF-EEG correlated with increased omission errors. After controlling for subthreshold comorbid symptoms, VLF-EEG case-control differences and treatment effects remained. Post-treatment, a time by group interaction emerged; VLF-EEG and omission errors reduced to the same level as controls, with decreased inattentive symptoms in cases. Reduced VLF-EEG following MPH treatment provides preliminary evidence that changes in VLF-EEG may relate to MPH treatment effects on ADHD symptoms; and that VLF-EEG may be an intermediate phenotype of ADHD. Further studies of the treatment effect of MPH in larger controlled studies are required to formally evaluate any causal link between MPH, VLF-EEG and ADHD symptoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to study the earliest preictal changes in children with absence epilepsy. In this report, magnetoencephalography recordings of 44 absence seizures recorded from 12 children with drug-naive childhood absence seizures were used to perform time frequency analysis and source localization prior to the onset of the seizures. Evidence of preictal magnetoencephalography frequency changes were detected a mean of 694 ms before the initial spike on the EEG. A consistent pattern of focal sources was present in the frontal cortex and thalamus during this preictal period, but source localization occurred synchronously so that independent activity between the 2 structures could not be distinguished.

Low-Dimensional Dynamics of Resting-State Cortical Activity	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Resting-state network; Functional connectivity; Neuronal synchronization; Electroencephalography	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DEFAULT NETWORK; EEG; FLUCTUATIONS; CORTEX; MODE; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Endogenous brain activity supports spontaneous human thought and shapes perception and behavior. Connectivity-based analyses of endogenous, or resting-state, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have revealed the existence of a small number of robust networks which have a rich spatial structure. Yet the temporal information within fMRI data is limited, motivating the complementary analysis of electrophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG). Here we provide a novel method based on multivariate time-frequency interdependence to reconstruct the principal resting-state network dynamics in human EEG data. The stability of network expression across subjects is assessed using resampling techniques. We report the presence of seven robust networks, with distinct topographic organizations and high frequency (similar to 5-45 Hz) fingerprints, nested within slow temporal sequences that build up and decay over several orders of magnitude. Interestingly, all seven networks are expressed concurrently during these slow dynamics, although there is a temporal asymmetry in the pattern of their formation and dissolution. These analyses uncover the complex temporal character of endogenous cortical fluctuations and, in particular, offer an opportunity to reconstruct the low dimensional linear subspace in which they unfold.

In this work, a time-series discrimination methodology, called Motor Imagery Discrimination by Relevance Analysis (MIDRA), is presented to support the development of BCI from EEG data. Particularly, a Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm is studied, i.e., imagination of left-right hand movements. In this sense, a feature relevance analysis strategy is presented to select representing characteristics using a variability criterion. Besides, short-time parameters are estimated from EEG data by considering both time and time-frequency representations to deal with non-stationary dynamics. MIDRA is assessed on two different BCI databases, a well-known MI data and an Emotiv-based dataset. Attained results showed that MIDRA enhances the BCI system performance in comparison with benchmark methods by suitable ranking the input feature set. Moreover, applying MIDRA in a BCI based on the Emotiv device is a straightforward alternative for dealing with MI paradigms.

M.; Deco, Gustavo			Intra-cortical propagation of EEG alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; WAVES; MEG; POTENTIALS; RHYTHMS	The most salient feature of spontaneous human brain activity as recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) are rhythmic fluctuations around 10 Hz. These alpha oscillations have been reported to propagate over the scalp with velocities in the range of 5-15 m/s. Since these velocities are in the range of action potential velocities through cortico-cortical axons, it has been hypothesized that the observed scalp waves reflect cortico-cortically mediated propagation of cortical oscillations. The reported scalp velocities however, appear to be inconsistent with those estimated from local field potential recordings in dogs, which are <1 m/s and agree with the propagation velocity of action potentials in intra-cortical axons. In this study, we resolve these diverging findings using a combination of EEG data-analysis and biophysical modeling. In particular, we demonstrate that the observed scalp velocities can be accounted for by slow traveling oscillations, which provides support for the claim that spatial propagation of alpha oscillations is mediated by intra-cortical axons.

However, functional subdivisions within this broad range of frequencies are disputed, with most studies hypothesizing only about single frequency bands. The present study utilizes an established paradigm of spoken word recognition (lexical decision) to test the hypothesis that within the slow neural oscillatory frequency range, distinct functional signatures and cortical networks can be identified at least for theta- (similar to 3-7 Hz) and alpha-frequencies (similar to 8-12 Hz). Listeners performed an auditory lexical decision task on a set of items that formed a word-pseudoword continuum: ranging from (1) real words over (2) ambiguous pseudowords (deviating from real words only in one vowel; comparable to natural mispronunciations in speech) to (3) pseudowords (clearly deviating from real words by randomized syllables). By means of time-frequency analysis and spatial filtering, we observed a dissociation into distinct but simultaneous patterns of alpha power suppression and theta power enhancement. Alpha exhibited a parametric suppression as items increasingly matched real words, in line with lowered functional inhibition in a left-dominant lexical processing network for more word-like input Simultaneously, theta power in a bilateral fronto-temporal network was selectively enhanced for ambiguous pseudowords only. Thus, enhanced alpha power can neurally 'gate' lexical integration, while enhanced theta power might index functionally more specific ambiguity-resolution processes. To this end, a joint analysis of both frequency bands provides neural evidence for parallel processes in achieving spoken word recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to use behaviorally active drug doses, experiments detecting changes in locomotor activity and sensorimotor gating were also conducted. In EEG experiments, adult male Wistar rats were injected with ketamine 30 mg/kg i.p. and LY379268 3 mg/kg i.p. Cortical EEG was recorded from twelve (2 x 6) electrodes placed homolaterally on each hemisphere. To avoid interference with the behavioral hyperactivity of ketamine challenge, the behavioral activity of animals was simultaneously registered at the time of recording. Subsequent power spectral and coherence analyses were assessed in epochs corresponding to behavioral inactivity. Analysis of segments with behavioral activity compared to inactivity was also performed. The effects of LY379268 3 mg/kg i.p. on the deficits in sensorimotor processing and on hyperlocomotion induced by ketamine were evaluated in the test of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle reaction (PPI ASR) and in the open field. LY379268 reversed the ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion but had no effect on ketamine-induced PPI deficits. In EEG epochs corresponding to behavioral inactivity ketamine decreased the power in the delta band, induced a power increase in the high frequency bands and globally decreased EEG coherence. Pretreatment with the LY379268 completely reversed the ketamine-induced power increase in high frequency bands and had a partial effect on EEG coherence. LY379268 alone induced a decrease of beta, high beta and low-gamma power, and an increase in coherence in high frequency bands. Additional analysis revealed that behavioral activity increases power as well as coherence in most frequency bands. In conclusion, agonism of mGlu2/3 receptors was effective in reversing most of the changes induced by ketamine, however due to the lack of effectiveness on PPI deficits its potential antipsychotic properties remain disputable.

Previous simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that alpha rhythm is associated with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in several different functional networks. How these networks influence alpha rhythm respectively is unclear. The low-frequency oscillations (LFO) in spontaneous BOLD activity are thought to contribute to the local correlations in resting state. Recent studies suggested that either LFO or other components of fMRI can be further divided into sub-components on different frequency bands. We hypothesized that those BOLD sub-components characterized the contributions of different brain networks to alpha rhythm. To test this hypothesis, EEG and fMRI data were simultaneously recorded from 17 human subjects performing an eyes-close resting state experiment. EEG alpha rhythm was correlated with the filtered fMRI time courses at different frequency bands (0.01-0.08 Hz, 0.08-0.25 Hz, 0.01-0.027 Hz, 0.027-0.073 Hz, 0.073-0.198 Hz, and 0.198-0.25 Hz). The results demonstrated significant relations between alpha rhythm and the BOLD signals in the visual network and in the attention network at LFO band, especially at the very low frequency band (0.01-0.027 Hz).

Time-variant coherence between heart rate variability and EEG activity in epileptic patients: an advanced coupling analysis between physiological networks	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						network coupling; epilepsy; empirical mode decomposition; tensor decomposition; time-variant coherence	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; TUTORIAL; TERM; SIMILARITIES; METAANALYSIS; PREMATURE; CHILDREN; SLEEP	Time-variant coherence analysis between the heart rate variability (HRV) and the channel-related envelopes of adaptively selected EEG components was used as an indicator for the occurrence of (correlative) couplings between the central autonomic network (CAN) and the epileptic network before, during and after epileptic seizures. Two groups of patients were investigated, a group with left and a group with right hemispheric temporal lobe epilepsy. The individual EEG components were extracted by a signal-adaptive approach, the multivariate empirical mode decomposition, and the envelopes of each resulting intrinsic mode function (IMF) were computed by using Hilbert transform. Two IMFs, whose envelopes were strongly correlated with the HRV's low-frequency oscillation (HRV-LF; approximate to 0.1 Hz) before and after the seizure were identified. The frequency ranges of these IMFs correspond to the EEG delta-band. The time-variant coherence was statistically quantified and tensor decomposition of the time-frequency coherence maps was applied to explore the topography-time-frequency characteristics of the coherence analysis. Results allow the hypothesis that couplings between the CAN, which controls the cardiovascular-cardiorespiratory system, and the 'epileptic neural network' exist. Additionally, our results confirm the hypothesis of a right hemispheric lateralization of sympathetic cardiac control of the HRV-LF.

EEG Oscillatory States: Universality, Uniqueness and Specificity across Healthy-Normal, Altered and Pathological Brain Conditions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL MASS MODEL; SPACE-ORIENTED SEGMENTATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; INTERICTAL EEG; THETA-BAND; MAP SERIES; GAMMA	For the first time the dynamic repertoires and oscillatory types of local EEG states in 13 diverse conditions (examined over 9 studies) that covered healthy-normal, altered and pathological brain states were quantified within the same methodological and conceptual framework. EEG oscillatory states were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. The results demonstrated that brain activity consists of a limited repertoire of local EEG states in any of the examined conditions. The size of the state repertoires was associated with changes in cognition and vigilance or neuropsychopathologic conditions. Additionally universal, optional and unique EEG states across 13 diverse conditions were observed. It was demonstrated also that EEG oscillations which constituted EEG states were characteristic for different groups of conditions in accordance to oscillations' functional significance. The results suggested that (a) there is a limit in the number of local states available to the cortex and many ways in which these local states can rearrange themselves and still produce the same global state and (b) EEG individuality is determined by varying proportions of universal, optional and unique oscillatory states. The results enriched our understanding about dynamic microstructure of EEG-signal.

To address this, we made simultaneous surface EEG measurements along with intracortical recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the primary visual cortex of behaving nonhuman primates. We found that trial-by-trial fluctuations in EEG power could be explained by a linear combination of LFP power and interelectrode temporal synchrony. This effect was observed in both stimulus and stimulus-free conditions and was particularly strong in the gamma range (30100 Hz). Subsequently, we used pharmacological manipulations to show that neural synchrony can produce a positively modulated EEG signal even when the LFP signal is negatively modulated. Taken together, our results demonstrate that neural synchrony can modulate EEG signals independently of amplitude changes in neural activity. This finding has strong implications for the interpretation of EEG in basic and clinical research, and helps reconcile EEG response discrepancies observed in different modalities (e.g., EEG vs. functional magnetic resonance imaging) and different spatial scales (e.g., EEG vs. intracranial EEG).

However, whether neural oscillations are conditional to the frequency demand and task quality of rhythmic force regulation is still unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate EEG dynamics and behavior correlates during force-tracking at different target rates. Fourteen healthy volunteers conducted load-varying isometric abduction of the index finger by coupling the force output to sinusoidal targets at 0.5 Hz, 1.0 Hz, and 2.0 Hz. Our results showed that frequency demand significantly affected EEG delta oscillation (1-4 Hz) in the 0, CP3, CPz, and CP4 electrodes, with the greatest delta power and lowest delta peak around 1.5 Hz for slower tracking at 0.5 Hz. Those who had superior tracking congruency also manifested enhanced alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz). Alpha rhythms of the skilled performers during slow tracking-spread through the whole target cycle, except for the phase of direction changes. However, the alpha rhythms centered at the mid phase of a target cycle with increasing target rate. In conclusion, our findings clearly suggest two advanced roles of cortical oscillation in rhythmic force regulation. Rate-dependent delta oscillation involves a paradigm shift in force control under different time scales. Phasic organization of alpha rhythms during rhythmic force tracking is related to behavioral success underlying the selective use of bimodal controls (feedback and feedforward processes) and the timing of attentional focus on the target's peak velocity.

In this paper, we investigate the way QoE affects brain oscillations captured by electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, sixteen subjects watched 2D and 3D videos of various quality levels while their EEG signals were recorded, and were asked to provide their self-assessed perceived quality ratings for each video. EEG signals were decomposed into six frequency bands, namely theta, alpha, beta low, beta middle, beta high and gamma bands. The results revealed frontal asymmetry patterns in the alpha band, which correspond to right frontal activation when perceived quality is low. This finding implies that perceived high quality may be related to positive emotional processes.

Converging evidence from time-frequency decompositions of the response-related ERP revealed that evoked theta activity at fronto-central electrode positions differentiates correct from erroneous responses in simple tasks, but also in more complex tasks. However, up to now it is unclear how different electrophysiological parameters of error processing, especially at the level of neural oscillations are related, or predictive for BOLD signal changes reflecting error processing at a functional-neuroanatomical level. The present study aims to provide crosslinks between time domain information, time-frequency information, MRI BOLD signal and behavioral parameters in a task examining error monitoring due to mistakes in a mental rotation task. The results show that BOLD signal changes reflecting error processing on a functional-neuroanatomical level are best predicted by evoked oscillations in the theta frequency band. Although the fMRI results in this study account for an involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and the Insula in error processing, the correlation of evoked oscillations and BOLD signal was restricted to a coupling of evoked theta and anterior cingulate cortex BOLD activity. The current results indicate that although there is a distributed functional-neuroanatomical network mediating error processing, only distinct parts of this network seem to modulate electrophysiological properties of error monitoring.

Towards alleviating the fatigue, a fundamental step is to measure and evaluate it but most existing works adopt self-reported questionnaire methods which are subjective, offline and memory dependent. This paper proposes an objective and real-time approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) spectral analysis to evaluate the fatigue in SSVEP-based BCIs. Methods: How the EEG indices (amplitudes in delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands), the selected ratio indices (0/alpha and (0 + alpha)/beta), and SSVEP properties (amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) changes with the increasing fatigue level are investigated through two elaborate SSVEP-based BCI experiments, one validates mainly the effectiveness and another considers more practical situations. Meanwhile, a self-reported fatigue questionnaire is used to provide a subjective reference. ANOVA is employed to test the significance of the difference between the alert state and the fatigue state for each index. Results: Consistent results are obtained in two experiments: the significant increases in alpha and (theta + alpha)/beta, as well as the decrease in theta/alpha are found associated with the increasing fatigue level, indicating that EEG spectral analysis can provide robust objective evaluation of the fatigue in SSVEP-based BCIs. Moreover, the results show that the amplitude and SNR of the elicited SSVEP are significantly affected by users' fatigue. Conclusions: The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method as an objective and real-time evaluation of the fatigue in SSVEP-based BCIs. This method would be helpful in understanding the fatigue problem and optimizing the system design to alleviate the fatigue in SSVEP-based BCIs.

High frequency oscillations and infraslow activity in epilepsy	ANNALS OF INDIAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; high frequency oscillations; infraslow activity; intracranial electroencephalogram; seizure	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; SEIZURE ONSET; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FAST RIPPLES; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; ICTAL LOCALIZATION; SURGICAL RESECTION; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; FOCAL SEIZURES	In pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy, there has been an increased interest in the study of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity outside the 1-70 Hz band of conventional frequency activity (CFA). Research over the last couple of decades has shown that EEG activity in the 70-600 Hz range, termed high frequency oscillations (HFOs), can be recorded intracranially from all brain regions both interictally and at seizure onset. In patients with epilepsy, HFOs are now considered as pathologic regardless of their frequency band although it may be difficult to distinguish them from the physiologic HFOs, which occur in a similar frequency range. Interictal HFOs are likely to be confined mostly to the seizure onset zone, thus providing a new measure for localizing it. More importantly, several studies have linked HFOs to underlying epileptogenicity, suggesting that HFOs can serve as potential biomarkers for the illness. Along with HFOs, analysis of ictal baseline shifts (IBS; or direct current shifts) and infraslow activity (ISA) (ISA: < 0.1 Hz) has also attracted attention. Studies have shown that: IBSs can be recorded using the routine AC amplifiers with long time constants; IBSs occur at the time of conventional EEG onset, but in a restricted spatial distribution compared with conventional frequencies; and inclusion of IBS contacts in the resection can be associated with favorable seizure outcome. Only a handful of studies have evaluated all the EEG frequencies together in the same patient group. The latter studies suggest that the seizure onset is best localized by the ictal HFOs, the IBSs tend to provide a broader localization and the conventional frequencies could be non-localizing. However, small number of patients included in these studies precludes definitive conclusions regarding post-operative seizure outcome based on selective or combined resection of HFO, IBS and CFA contacts. Large, preferably prospective, studies are needed to further evaluate the implications of different EEG frequencies in epilepsy.

The challenges focus on (1) unambiguous and consistent terminology, (2) neurophysiologically meaningful interpretations of results, (3) evaluation and comparison of different spatial filters often used in M/EEG research, (4) the role of multiscale interactions in brain and cognitive function, and (5) development of biophysically plausible cognitive models. We also suggest research directions that will help address these challenges. We hope that this paper will help foster discussions and debates about important themes in the study of how the brain's rhythmic patterns of spatiotemporal electrophysiological activity support cognition.

Age-related differences in working memory evoked gamma oscillations	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Age; Gamma oscillation; Working memory; EEG; Frontal brain region	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; POTENTIALLY DELETERIOUS IMPACT; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; EEG; CHILDHOOD; MYELINATION; ADOLESCENCE	Objective: Working memory is associated with gamma oscillations (30-50 Hz). Previous studies have demonstrated altered gamma oscillations in the elderly population that may be related to general cognitive decline. However, it is unknown how gamma oscillations change with age or if there is an age when gamma oscillations optimally mediate working memory performance. That is, gamma oscillations may be maximal in middle-aged adults compared to younger and elderly adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate working memory evoked gamma oscillations in adults aged 19-29 years (mean 23.32 + 2.85 1 SD) compared to adults aged 30-60 years (mean 39.10+8.11 1 SD). Methods: Subjects completed the verbal N-back task administered at four working loads (0, 1, 2, 3), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Gamma power was measured during correct responses. Results: Reduced gamma oscillations were observed in the adults aged 19-29 compared to those aged 30-60 years. Age was found to be positively related to the power of gamma oscillations. No differences were found on N-Back accuracy. Conclusions: Increased working memory evoked gamma oscillatory activity may provide a neurophysiological marker in the healthy aging brain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From EEG/MEG studies it has been hypothesized that coupled oscillatory activity in primary sensory cortices regulates multi sensory processing (Senkowski et al. 2008). We follow up on a study in which evidence of phase reset was found using a purely behavioral paradigm by including also EEG measures. In this paradigm, presentation of an auditory accessory stimulus was followed by a visual target with a stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) across a range from 0 to 404 ms in steps of 4 ms. This fine-grained stimulus presentation allowed us to do a spectral analysis on the mean SRT as a function of the SOA, which revealed distinct peak spectral components within a frequency range of 6 to 11 Hz with a modus of 7 Hz. The EEG analysis showed that the auditory stimulus caused a phase reset in 7-Hz brain oscillations in a widespread set of channels. Moreover, there was a significant difference in the average phase at which the visual target stimulus appeared between slow and fast SRT trials. This effect was evident in three different analyses, and occurred primarily in frontal and central electrodes.

To examine this question, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during a cued task-switching version of the Wisconsin card-sorting test. Each target card was announced by a tone cueing either to switch or repeat the task. Novel sound distracters were interspersed among trials. Time-frequency EEG analyses revealed bursts of delta (2-4Hz) power associated with enhanced nP3 amplitudes to both task-switch cues and novel distractersbut no association with target P3b. These findings indicate that the P300-delta response indexes contextual novelty regardless of whether novelty emanates from endogenous (new task rules) or exogenous (novel distracters) sources of information.

The key issue is whether frequency oscillations of Electroencephalography (EEG) are related to cognitive task or not in occipital region. All frequency bands delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta) and gamma (gamma) are involved in brain tasks. This study is conducted to investigate the functional relationship between EEG frequency bands and the cognitive task. In various studies theta, alpha and beta bands are discussed for cognitive tasks; however there are few studies which have been focused on delta band for cognitive tasks. In this paper, behavior of theta, alpha, beta, and gamma is described but the primary focus is on delta (delta) band during cognitive task in occipital region as it had been ignored in the literature. In conclusion, this study explains how different frequencies change during cognitive task as compared to base line (eyes open) in occipital region and the results show that there is an increase in power during the task in delta and theta band.

Whether conventional hierarchical central commands sent by the brain to the heart alone explain all the interplay between these two organs should be reconsidered. Here, we demonstrate correlations between the signal complexity of brain and cardiac activity. Eighty-seven geriatric outpatients with healthy hearts and varied cognitive abilities each provided a 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) and a 19-channel eye-closed routine electroencephalography (EEG). Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was applied to three epochs (resting-awake state, photic stimulation of fast frequencies (fast-PS), and photic stimulation of slow frequencies (slow-PS)) of EEG in the 1-58 Hz frequency range, and three RR interval (RRI) time series (awake-state, sleep and that concomitant with the EEG) for each subject. The low-to-high frequency power (LF/HF) ratio of RRI was calculated to represent sympatho-vagal balance. With statistics after Bonferroni corrections, we found that: (a) the summed MSE value on coarse scales of the awake RRI (scales 11-20, RRI-MSE-coarse) were inversely correlated with the summed MSE value on coarse scales of the resting-awake EEG (scales 6-20, EEG-MSE-coarse) at Fp2, C4, T6 and T4; (b) the awake RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the fast-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at O1, O2 and C4; (c) the sleep RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the slow-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at Fp2; (d) the RRI-MSE-coarse and LF/HF ratio of the awake RRI were correlated positively to each other; (e) the EEG-MSE-coarse at F8 was proportional to the cognitive test score; (f) the results conform to the cholinergic hypothesis which states that cognitive impairment causes reduction in vagal cardiac modulation; (g) fast-PS significantly lowered the EEG-MSE-coarse globally. Whether these heart-brain correlations could be fully explained by the central autonomic network is unknown and needs further exploration.

The aim of the study is to analyze the common and distinct parameters of affective picture perception in block and random designs by means of analysis of high frequency oscillatory dynamics (beta and gamma). EEG of 22 healthy subjects was recorded at 32 locations. The participants passively viewed 120 emotional pictures (10 x 4 unpleasant, 10 x 4 pleasant, 10 x 4 neutral) in block and random designs. The phase-locking and power of event related beta (14-28 Hz) and gamma (29-48 Hz) oscillations were analyzed for two different time windows (0-200 ms/200-400 ms). Statistical analysis showed that in the 0-200 ms time window, during the block design, unpleasant stimulation elicited higher beta phase-locking and beta power than the pleasant and neutral stimulation (p<0.05). In the 200-400 ms time window, during the block design, over occipital electrodes unpleasant stimulation elicited higher gamma response power than the pleasant stimulation and neutral stimulation (p<0.05). Unpleasant stimulation did not elicit higher beta or gamma responses in the random design. The present study showed that experimental design highly influences the perception of IAPS pictures. Unpleasant stimulation elicited higher event related beta and gamma phase-locking and power only in block design but not in random design. It seems that longer blocks of aversive pictures affect the brain more than the rapid observation of these pictures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ERP and adaptive autoregressive identification with spectral power decomposition to study rapid auditory processing in infants	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			FREQUENCY	The ability to process rapidly-occurring auditory stimuli plays an important role in the mechanisms of language acquisition. For this reason, the research community has begun to investigate infant auditory processing, particularly using the Event Related Potentials (ERP) technique. In this paper we approach this issue by means of time domain and time-frequency domain analysis. For the latter, we propose the use of Adaptive Autoregressive (AAR) identification with spectral power decomposition. Results show EEG delta-theta oscillation enhancement related to the processing of acoustic frequency and duration changes, suggesting that, as expected, power modulation encodes rapid auditory processing (RAP) in infants and that the time-frequency analysis method proposed is able to identify this modulation.

Single-trial time-frequency analysis of electrocortical signals: Baseline correction and beyond	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Baseline correction; Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Partial least squares (PLS) analysis	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG RESPONSES; PAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION; FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULATION; DYNAMICS; THETA	Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) of electrocortical signals (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG] and magnetoencephalogram) reflect important aspects of sensory, motor, and cognitive cortical processing. The detection of ERD and ERS relies on time-frequency decomposition of single-trial electrocortical signals, to identify significant stimulus-induced changes in power within specific frequency bands. Typically, these changes are quantified by expressing post-stimulus EEG power as a percentage of change relative to pre-stimulus EEG power. However, expressing post-stimulus EEG power relative to pre-stimulus EEG power entails two important and surprisingly neglected issues. First, it can introduce a significant bias in the estimation of ERD/ERS magnitude. Second, it confuses the contribution of pre- and post-stimulus EEG power. Taking the human electrocortical responses elicited by transient nociceptive stimuli as an example, we demonstrate that expressing ERD/ERS as the average percentage of change calculated at single-trial level introduces a positive bias, resulting in an overestimation of ERS and an underestimation of ERD. This bias can be avoided using a single-trial baseline subtraction approach. Furthermore, given that the variability in ERD/ERS is not only dependent on the variability in post-stimulus power but also on the variability in pre-stimulus power, an estimation of the respective contribution of pre- and post-stimulus EEG variability is needed. This can be achieved using a multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model, which could be optimally estimated using partial least square (PLS) regression, to dissect and quantify the relationship between behavioral variables and pre- and post-stimulus EEG activities. In summary, combining single-trial baseline subtraction approach with PLS regression can be used to achieve a correct detection and quantification of ERD/ERS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

SPoC: A novel framework for relating the amplitude of neuronal oscillations to behaviorally relevant parameters	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; MEG; Oscillations; SPoC; Source power comodulation; ASSEP	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; FREQUENCY	Previously, modulations in power of neuronal oscillations have been functionally linked to sensory, motor and cognitive operations. Such links are commonly established by relating the power modulations to specific target variables such as reaction times or task ratings. Consequently, the resulting spatio-spectral representation is subjected to neurophysiological interpretation. As an alternative, independent component analysis (ICA) or alternative decomposition methods can be applied and the power of the components may be related to the target variable. In this paper we show that these standard approaches are suboptimal as the first does not take into account the superposition of many sources due to volume conduction, while the second is unable to exploit available information about the target variable. To improve upon these approaches we introduce a novel (supervised) source separation framework called Source Power Comodulation (SPoC). SPoC makes use of the target variable in the decomposition process in order to give preference to components whose power comodulates with the target variable. We present two algorithms that implement the SPoC approach. Using simulations with a realistic head model, we show that the SPoC algorithms are able extract neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the target variable. In this task, the SPoC algorithms outperform other commonly used techniques that are based on the sensor data or ICA approaches. Furthermore, using real electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during an auditory steady state paradigm, we demonstrate the utility of the SPoC algorithms by extracting neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the intensity of the auditory input. Taking into account the results of the simulations and real EEG recordings, we conclude that SPoC represents an adequate approach for the optimal extraction of neuronal components showing coupling of power with continuously changing behaviorally relevant parameters.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the spatiotemporal relationship between spike-related HFOs and PSS in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II. MethodsWe studied 10 pediatric patients with FCD type II, who underwent extraoperative video-electroencephalography (EEG). We selected spike and slow waves, which included HFOs (80-200Hz), and performed spike peak-locked averaging 10 times during both 30 s interictal (>1h apart from seizures) and 30 s preictal periods. We calculated the power of spike-related HFOs and PSS during both periods for the following three areas: (1) inside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), (2) inside the resection area (RA) but outside SOZ (RA-SOZ), and (3) outside the RA. Between the interictal and preictal periods we performed correlation (Spearman's coefficient) and simple linear regression analyses comparing HFO and PSS power within each area. ResultsA total of 1,614 averaged spike and slow waves were analyzed during both periods. During the interictal periods, there were significant positive correlations between HFO and PSS power in all areas (inside SOZ, r=0.568; RA-SOZ, r=0.700; outside RA, r=0.320). During the preictal periods, the correlation became weaker inside SOZ (r=0.149) and remained unchanged both inside the RA-SOZ (r=0.704) and outside RA (r=0.346). From the interictal to preictal period, the slope (PSS power/HFO power) of the simple regression line decreased inside SOZ (0.349 to 0.051) but increased in RA-SOZ (0.534 to 0.734) and outside RA (0.267 to 0.435). SignificanceRelative power reduction of PSS to spike-related HFOs in SOZ is relevant for seizure initiation. Our analysis will contribute to future studies of seizure prediction and distinction between pathologic and physiologic HFOs.

As MRI moves towards using ultra-high magnetic fields in the quest for increased signal-to-noise, the question arises whether combined EEG-fMRI measurements are feasible at magnetic fields of 7 T and higher. We describe the challenges of MRI-EEG at 1.5, 3, 7 and 9.4 T and review the proposed solutions. In an outlook, we discuss further developments such as simultaneous trimodal imaging using MR, positron emission tomography (PET) and EEG under the same physiological conditions in the same subject.

In this study, it is presented a novel epileptic-like event detection algorithm based on a mixture of amplitude, frequency and spatial analysis with rule-based decision. In this work, EEG signals from 6 different subjects were searched for epileptic-like and normal data segments. The herein proposed algorithm detects putative epileptic EEG channels by comparing the RMS values of EEG activity with a hysteresis threshold, on a channel basis. The raw EEG signals are filtered with an artefact attenuation technique. The threshold is calculated on a reviewer-visually-selected baseline epoch, free of artefacts. Generalized epileptic activity detection is based on a spatial decision rule. Experimental results have shown detection rates as high as 95% with a false-negative rate as low as 1%. The algorithm seems to show a promising detection performance, even on artifact contaminated datasets. The proposed algorithm is intended to be used in real-time ambulatory monitoring of epileptic patients, with subject personalization, small size window analysis, good artefact immunity and no need for classifier training.

Dynamic modulation of epileptic high frequency oscillations by the phase of slower cortical rhythms	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Cross-frequeney coupling; Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; HFOs; Seizure; Intracranial EEG; Networks	THALAMOCORTICAL-THETA COHERENCE; IN-VITRO; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; RESECTION	Pathological high frequency oscillations (pHFOs) have been proposed to be robust markers of epileptic cortex. Oscillatory activity below this frequency range has been shown to be modulated by phase of lower frequency oscillations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that dynamic cross-frequency interactions involving pHFOs are concentrated within the epileptogenic cortex. Intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from 17 children with medically-intractable epilepsy secondary to focal cortical dysplasia were obtained. A time-resolved analysis was performed to determine topographic concentrations and dynamic changes in cross-frequency amplitude-to-phase coupling (CFC). CFC between pHFOs and the phase of theta and alpha rhythms was found to be significantly elevated in the seizure-onset zone compared to non-epileptic regions (p < 0.01). Data simulations showed that elevated CFC could not be attributed to the presence of sharp transients or other signal properties. The phase of low frequency oscillations at which pHFO amplitudes were maximal was inconsistent at seizure initiation, yet consistently at the trough of the low frequency rhythm at seizure termination. Amplitudes of pHFOs were most significantly modulated by the phase of alpha-band oscillations (p < 0.01). These results suggest that increased CFC between pHFO amplitude and alpha phase may constitute a marker of epileptogenic brain areas and may be relevant for understanding seizure dynamics.

Following a within-subjects design, healthy humans either received the dopamine precursor L-Dopa (150 mg) or a placebo before they performed a Sternberg WM paradigm. Here, sequences of sample images had to be memorized for a delay of 5 s in three different load conditions (two, four or six items). On the next day, long-term memory (LTM) for the images was tested. Behaviorally, L-Dopa improved WM and LTM performance as a function of WM load. More precisely, there was a specific drug effect in the four-load condition with faster reaction times to the probe in the WM task and higher corrected hit-rates in the LTM task. During the maintenance period, there was a linear and quadratic effect of WM load on power in the high theta (5-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) frequency range at frontal sensors. Importantly, a drug by load interaction - mimicking the behavioral results - was found only in low theta power (2-4 Hz). As such, our results indicate a specific link between prefrontal low theta oscillations, dopaminergic neuromodulation during WM and subsequent LTM performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Characterization of neonatal seizures in an animal model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Video; Electroclinical; Hypoxia; Ischemia	BRAIN-DAMAGE; CEREBRAL INJURY; NEURONAL DEATH; IMMATURE RATS; EEG; EPILEPSY; CORRELATE; TRIAL; ONSET; BIRTH	Objective: In this study, we use time-locked video and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to characterize acute seizures and EEG abnormalities in an animal model that replicates many salient features of human neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) including the brain injury pattern and long-term neurologic outcome. Methods: Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was induced in 7-day-old rats by ligating the right carotid artery and exposing the pups to hypoxia for 2 h (Rice-Vannucci method). To identify seizures and abnormal EEG activity, pups were monitored by video-EEG during hypoxia and at various time points after HI. Occurrence of electroclinical seizures, purely electrographic seizures and other abnormal discharges on EEG, was quantified manually. A power spectrum analysis was done to evaluate the effects of HI on EEG spectra in the 1-50 Hz frequency band. Results: During hypoxia, all pups exhibit short duration, but frequent electroclinical seizures. Almost all pups continue to have seizures in the immediate period following termination of hypoxia. In more than half of the HI rats, seizures persisted for 24 h; for some of them, the seizures continued for >48 h. Seizures were not observed in any rats at 72 h after HI induction. A significant reduction in background EEG voltage in the cortex ipsilateral to the ligated carotid artery occurred in rats subjected to HI. In addition, purely electrographic seizures, spikes, sharp waves, and brief runs of epileptiform discharges (BREDs) were also observed in these rats. Significance: HI induction in P7 rats using the Rice-Vannucci method resulted in the development of seizures and EEG abnormalities similar to that seen in human neonates with HIE. Therefore, we conclude that this is a valid model to test the efficacy of novel interventions to treat neonatal seizures.

Since EEG signals are considered to be non-stationary, time-frequency analysis has frequently been used for analysis. The S-transform is a time-frequency analysis method and is used in this paper to analyze EEG signals during alert and fatigue states during a driving simulator task. Repeated-measure MANOVA results show significant differences between alert and fatigue states within the alpha (8-13Hz) frequency band. The two sites demonstrating the greatest increases in alpha activity during fatigue were the Cz and P4 sites. The results show that S-transform analysis can be used to distinguish between alert and fatigue states in the EEG and also supports the use of the S-transform for EEG analysis.

Detecting millisecond-range coupling delays between brainwaves in terms of power correlations by magnetoencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brainwave; MEG; Coupling; Power correlation; Millisecond resolution	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; MEG; DYNAMICS; PREDICT; EEG	Background: The spatiotemporal coupling of brainwaves is commonly quantified using the amplitude or phase of signals measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). To enhance the temporal resolution for coupling delays down to millisecond level, a new power correlation (PC) method is proposed and tested. New method: The cross-correlations of any two brainwave powers at two locations are calculated sequentially through a measurement using the convolution theorem. For noise suppression, the cross-correlation series is moving-average filtered, preserving the millisecond resolution in the cross-correlations, but with reduced noise. The coupling delays are determined from the delays of the cross-correlation peaks. Results: Simulations showed that the new method detects reliably power cross-correlations with millisecond accuracy. Moreover, in MEG measurements on three healthy volunteers, the method showed average alpha-alpha coupling delays of around 0-20 ms between the occipital areas of two hemispheres. Lower-frequency brainwaves vs. alpha waves tended to have a larger lag; higher-frequency waves vs. alpha waves showed delays with large deviations. Comparison with existing methods: The use of signal power instead of its square root (amplitude) in the cross-correlations improves noise cancellation. Compared to signal phase, the signal power analysis time delays do not have periodic ambiguity. In addition, the novel method allows fast calculation of cross-correlations. Conclusions: The PC method conveys novel information about brainwave dynamics. The method may be extended from sensor-space to source-space analysis, and can be applied also for electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dvorak, D; Fenton, AA				Dvorak, Dino; Fenton, Andre A.			Toward a proper estimation of phase-amplitude coupling in neural oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Theta; Gamma; Coupling; Modulation; Oscillation; Event; PAC	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; CELL ASSEMBLIES; FREQUENCY; HIPPOCAMPUS; EEG; HZ; COMPONENT; SEARCH	Background: The phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between distinct neural oscillations is critical to brain functions that include cross-scale organization, selection of attention, routing the flow of information through neural circuits, memory processing and information coding. Several methods for PAC estimation have been proposed but the limitations of PAC estimation as well as the assumptions about the data for accurate PAC estimation are unclear. New method: We define boundary conditions for standard PAC algorithms and propose "oscillation-triggered coupling" (OTC), a parameter-free, data-driven algorithm for unbiased estimation of PAC. OTC establishes a unified framework that treats individual oscillations as discrete events for estimating PAC from a set of oscillations and for characterizing events from time windows as short as a single modulating oscillation. Results: For accurate PAC estimation, standard PAC algorithms require amplitude filters with a bandwidth at least twice the modulatory frequency. The phase filters must be moderately narrow-band, especially when the modulatory rhythm is non-sinusoidal. The minimally appropriate analysis window is similar to 10 s. We then demonstrate that OTC can characterize PAC by treating neural oscillations as discrete events rather than continuous phase and amplitude time series. Comparison with existing methods: These findings show that in addition to providing the same information about PAC as the standard approach, OTC facilitates characterization of single oscillations and their sequences, in addition to explaining the role of individual oscillations in generating PAC patterns.

We proposed a high frequency source imaging (HFSI) approach to noninvasively image the brain sources of the scalp-recorded HF EEG activity. Both computer simulation and clinical patient data analysis were performed to investigate the feasibility of using the HFSI approach to image the sources of HF activity from noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. The HF activity was identified from high-density scalp recordings after high-pass filtering the EEG data and the EEG segments with HF activity were concatenated together to form repetitive HF activity. Independent component analysis was utilized to extract the components corresponding to the HF activity. Noninvasive EEG source imaging using realistic geometric boundary element head modeling was then applied to image the sources of the pathological HF brain activity. Five medically intractable focal epilepsy patients were studied and the estimated sources were found to be concordant with the surgical resection or intracranial recordings of the patients. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that source imaging from the scalp HF activity could help to localize the seizure onset zone and provide a novel noninvasive way of studying the epileptic brain in humans. This study also indicates the potential application of studying HF activity in the presurgical planning of medically intractable epilepsy patients.

Beat-induced fluctuations in auditory cortical beta-band activity: using EEG to measure age-related changes	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						neural oscillation; time perception; electroencephalography (EEG); musical rhythm; child development	RHYTHM PERCEPTION; GAP DETECTION; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; INFANTS PERCEPTION; MUSICAL RHYTHMS; MOTOR; SEQUENCES; TIME; OSCILLATIONS	People readily extract regularity in rhythmic auditory patterns, enabling prediction of the onset of the next beat. Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) research suggests that such prediction is reflected by the entrainment of oscillatory networks in the brain to the tempo of the sequence. In particular, induced beta-band oscillatory activity from auditory cortex decreases after each beat onset and rebounds prior to the onset of the next beat across tempi in a predictive manner. The objective of the present study was to examine the development of such oscillatory activity by comparing electroencephalography (EEG) measures of beta-band fluctuations in 7-year-old children to adults. EEG was recorded while participants listened passively to isochronous tone sequences at three tempi (390, 585, and 780 ms for onset-to-onset interval). In adults, induced power in the high beta-band (20 25 Hz) decreased after each tone onset and rebounded prior to the onset of the next tone across tempo conditions, consistent with MEG findings. In children, a similar pattern was measured in the two slower tempo conditions, but was weaker in the fastest condition. The results indicate that the beta-band timing network works similarly in children, although there are age-related changes in consistency and the tempo range over which it operates.

Multichannel EEG signal recording analysis based on Cross Frequency Coupling method	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN ENGINEERING (INTER-ENG 2013)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Interdisciplinarity in Engineering (INTER-ENG)	OCT 10-11, 2013	Tarqu Mures, ROMANIA	Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures		EEG signals; multichannel recording; cross frequency coupling; phase amplitude coupling	PHASE; OSCILLATIONS	Cross-frequency coupling (CFCo) could be important to study task-relevant manner changes in time series (TS). CFCo might also serve as an instrument to distinguish between oscillatory states and interrelations in signals, and to exhibit characteristic changes. Presenting the use of phase-amplitude type Cross Frequency Coupling, named Phase-Amplitude-Coupling (PAC) is the objective of this presentation. PAC describes the statistical dependence between the phase of a low-frequency brain rhythm and the amplitude (or power) of the higher-frequency component of electrical activity in the brain. Two other varieties of signal coupling are possible. These are the cross-frequency phase synchronization (phase-phase CFCo) and cross-frequency amplitude envelope correlation (amplitude-amplitude CFCo). These procedures should be efficient to study possible mechanism to regulate interrelation of the multichannel recorded EEG signals. As it is known, EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Interdependence of the different frequency range EEG signals, must be studied to understand internal behaviour of signals generated by different cortical areas. The paper is based on multichannel EEG recordings. It is possible to detect correlations between distal cortical regions during different task related events as Event Related Potentials (ERP). Correlation factor of left-right hemisphere's signals, recorded in biologically symmetric scalp positions are important in ERP studies. The Hilbert transform based method is also involved to have a way to analyze the interrelations of different brain region activities. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd	[Marton, L.

Electroencephalography Correlates of Spatial Working Memory Deficits in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Vigilance, Encoding, and Maintenance	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; alpha; EEG; ICA; theta	HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EEG DYNAMICS; ALPHA-BAND; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; RATING-SCALES; VISUAL-SEARCH; ADHD; CHILDREN; OSCILLATIONS; LOAD	In the current study we sought to dissociate the component processes of working memory (WM) (vigilance, encoding and maintenance) that may be differentially impaired in attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 52 children with ADHD and 47 typically developing (TD) children, ages 7-14 years, while they performed a spatial Sternberg working memory task. We used independent component analysis and time-frequency analysis to identify midoccipital alpha (8-12 Hz) to evaluate encoding processes and frontal midline theta (4-7 Hz) to evaluate maintenance processes. We tested for effects of task difficulty and cue processing to evaluate vigilance. Children with ADHD showed attenuated alpha band event-related desynchronization (ERD) during encoding. This effect was more pronounced when task difficulty was low (consistent with impaired vigilance) and was predictive of memory task performance and symptom severity. Correlated with alpha ERD during encoding were alpha power increases during the maintenance period (relative to baseline), suggesting a compensatory effort. Consistent with this interpretation, midfrontal theta power increases during maintenance were stronger in ADHD and in high-load memory conditions. Furthermore, children with ADHD exhibited a maturational lag in development of posterior alpha power whereas age-related changes in frontal theta power deviated from the TD pattern. Last, subjects with ADHD showed age-independent attenuation of evoked responses to warning cues, suggesting low vigilance. Combined, these three EEG measures predicted diagnosis with 70% accuracy. We conclude that the interplay of impaired vigilance and encoding in ADHD may compromise maintenance and lead to impairedWMperformance in this group.

Tonic and phasic brain responses on multiple timescales were analyzed using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) sources identified by independent component analysis (ICA). Sorting EEG spectra with respect to reaction times (RT) to randomly introduced lane-departure events revealed distinct effects of kinesthetic stimuli on the brain under different performance levels. Experimental results indicated that EEG spectral dynamics highly correlated with performance lapses when driving involved kinesthetic feedback. Furthermore, in the realistic environment involving both visual and kinesthetic feedback, a transitive relationship of power spectra between optimal-, suboptimal-, and poor-performance groups was found predominately across most of the independent components. In contrast to the static environment with visual input only, kinesthetic feedback reduced theta-power augmentation in the central and frontal components when preparing for action and error monitoring, while strengthening alpha suppression in the central component while steering the wheel. In terms of behavior, subjects tended to have a short response time to process unexpected events with the assistance of kinesthesia, yet only when their performance was optimal. Decrease in attentional demand, facilitated by kinesthetic feedback, eventually significantly increased the reaction time in the suboptimal-performance state. Neurophysiological evidence of mutual relationships between behavioral performance and neurocognition in complex task paradigms and experimental environments, presented in this study, might elucidate our understanding of distributed brain dynamics, supporting natural human cognition and complex coordinated, multi-joint naturalistic behavior, and lead to improved understanding of brain-behavior relations in operating environments.

J	Ketz, N; O'Reilly, RC; Curran, T				Ketz, Nicholas; O'Reilly, Randal C.; Curran, Tim			Classification aided analysis of oscillatory signatures in controlled retrieval	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Memory; EEG; Oscillations; Beta; Control; Classification	AVERAGE REFERENCE; THETA-RHYTHM; MEMORY; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; BAND	Control processes are critical for both facilitating and suppressing memory retrieval, but these processes are not well understood. The current work, inspired by a similar fMRI design (Detre et al., in press), used a modified Think/No-Think(TNT) paradigm to investigate the neural signatures of volition over enhancing and suppressing memory retrieval. Previous studies have shown memory enhancement when well-learned stimulus pairs are restudied in cued recall ("Recall or think of studied pair item"), and degradation when restudied with cued suppression ("Avoid thinking of studied pair item"). We used category-based (faces vs. scenes) multivariate classification of electroencephalography signals to determine if individual target items were successfully retrieved or suppressed. A logistic regression based on classifier output determined that retrieval activation during the cued recall/suppression period was a predictor for subsequent memory. Labeling trials with this internal measure, as opposed to their nominal Think vs. No-Think condition, revealed the classic TNT pattern of enhanced memory for successful cued-retrieval and degraded memory for cued-suppression. This classification process enabled a more selective investigation into the time-frequency signatures of control over retrieval. Comparing controlled retrieval vs. controlled suppression, results showed more prominent Theta oscillations (3 to 8 Hz) in controlled retrieval. Beta oscillations (12 to 30 Hz) were involved in high levels of both controlled retrieval and suppression, suggesting it may have a more general control-related role. These results suggest unique roles for these frequency bands in retrieval processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We have reported "heat-sensitization" responses during suspended moxibustion, whose occurrence is associated with significantly better therapeutic effects. The present study aimed to characterize the electrophysiological features of this interesting phenomenon with high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Methods. We performed EEG recording in a group of patients with chronic low back pain before, during, and after moxibustion treatment at DU3. Results. 12 out of 25 subjects experienced strong heat-sensitization during moxibustion, which was accompanied by increased power spectral densities (PSDs) at the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. The scalp topographies of averaged power indicated that the theta and beta PSD changes were most obvious in fronto-central regions, whereas those of the alpha band were more global. In addition, nonsensitized and sensitized groups showed distinct activity patterns, with heat-sensitization inducing increased phase coherence at the theta and beta ranges. Conclusions. These data were the first objective evidence of heat-sensitization responses during suspended moxibustion, which were characterized by widespread oscillatory changes in scalp EEG.

It could not reflect the dynamic properties changing with time. Coherence analysis is a method developed on base of classic coherence analysis and signal's joint time-frequency representations in recent years. It was used to extract transient characteristics of interactions among brain areas. It describes the temporal, spatial and frequency relationships of brain activities. This paper discuss the frequency-varying coherence of EEG (Electroencephalogram) to study the coordination mechanism of brain. The power spectral density is the frequency-varying method to study the coordination mechanism of brain areas. The Welch method and the periodogram method are the two methods to study the power spectral density. The results showed that appropriate methods were effective tools for EEG to study the coordination between brain areas.

Time-frequency characteristics and dynamics of sleep spindles in WAG/Rij rats with absence epilepsy	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sleep spindles; Absence epilepsy; WAG/Rij rats; Continuous wavelet transform; Instantaneous frequency dynamics	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; SEIZURES; STRAIN; EEG; AGE	In rat models of absence epilepsy, epileptic spike-wave discharges appeared in EEG spontaneously, and the incidence of epileptic activity increases with age. Spike-wave discharges and sleep spindles are known to share common thalamo-cortical mechanism, suggesting that absence seizures might affect some intrinsic properties of sleep spindles. This paper examines time frequency EEG characteristics of anterior sleep spindles in non-epileptic Wistar and epileptic WAG/Rij rats at the age of 7 and 9 months. Considering non-stationary features of sleep spindles, EEG analysis was performed using Morlet-based continuous wavelet transform. It was found, first, that the average frequency of sleep spindles in non-epileptic Wistar rats was higher than in WAG/Rij (13.2 vs 11.2 Hz). Second, the instantaneous frequency ascended during a spindle event in Wistar rats, but it was constant in WAG/Rij. Third, in WAG/Rij rats, the number and duration of epileptic discharges increased in a period between 7 and 9 months of age, but duration and mean value of intra-spindle frequency did not change. In general, age-dependent aggravation of absence seizures in WAG/Rij rats did not affect EEG properties of sleep spindles; it was suggested that pro-epileptic changes in thalamo-cortical network in WAG/Rij rats might prevent dynamic changes of sleep spindles that were detected in Wistar.

Reproducibility of psychophysics and electroencephalography during offset analgesia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							ROSTRAL VENTROMEDIAL MEDULLA; NOCICEPTIVE INFORMATION; CONVERGENT NEURONS; EXPERIMENTAL PAIN; EEG; MECHANISMS; ACTIVATION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES	BackgroundOffset analgesia (OA) is a pain-inhibiting mechanism, defined as a disproportionately large decrease in pain perception in response to a discrete decrease in noxious stimulus intensity. Hence, the aims were (1) to investigate whether psychophysics and electroencephalography (EEG) can be assessed simultaneously during OA and (2) to assess whether OA is reproducible within the same day as well as between different days. MethodsTwo separate studies investigated OA: Study I (13 healthy volunteers; seven men; 25.50.65 years) aimed at determining the feasibility of recording psychophysics and EEG simultaneously during OA. Study II (18 healthy volunteers; 12 men; 343.15 years) assessed reproducibility of OA in terms of psychophysics and EEG. Subjects were presented to a 30-s OA heat stimulus paradigm on the volar forearm and psychophysics, and EEG recordings were obtained throughout the procedure. Reproducibility was assessed within the same day and between different days, using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Additionally, the reproducible psychophysical parameters were correlated to relevant EEG frequency bands. ResultsSimultaneous recording of psychophysics and EEG affects the frequency distribution in terms of alpha suppression. Reproducibility was proven for the psychophysics and EEG frequency bands both within the same day (all ICCs>0.62) and between different days (all ICCs>0.66, except for the delta band). Correlations between psychophysics and EEG were found in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz) and gamma (32-80Hz) bands (all p<0.01). ConclusionOA is a robust and reproducible model for experimental pain research, making it suitable for future research.	[Nilsson, M.; Nissen, T. D.; Graversen, C.; Drewes, A.

The assessment was presented to five left-handed and five right-handed children who have no records of working memory disability. The EEG signals are recorded using Neurofax-EEG 9200 (taken at channel F7, C3, F4, F8, and C4) during two assessments: Task 1 and Task 2. Raw EEG data is analysed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) which decomposes signals into different frequency bands. Correlation analysis and T-test are used to statistically identify significant interaction which occurs. The voltage activity mean value for Task 1 is 9.664 mu V while Task 2 is 5.666 mu V. Results showed that there is no significant difference between the working memory average means of left and right handed children. Besides that, there is no significant sensory motor performance difference between the average means of left and right handed children when carrying out the assessments. In conclusion, this study proposed that handwriting behaviour (right-handed and left-handed) does not affect the memory performance of normal children.

J	Yang, Y; Chevallier, S; Wiart, J; Bloch, I				Yang, Yuan; Chevallier, Sylvain; Wiart, Joe; Bloch, Isabelle			Time-frequency optimization for discrimination between imagination of right and left hand movements based on two bipolar electroencephalography channels	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Time-frequency analysis; Electrode reduction; Feature extraction	MOTOR IMAGERY; SPATIAL FILTERS; EEG DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; COMMUNICATION; ELECTRODE	To enforce a widespread use of efficient and easy to use brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the inter-subject robustness should be increased and the number of electrodes should be reduced. These two key issues are addressed in this contribution, proposing a novel method to identify subject-specific time-frequency characteristics with a minimal number of electrodes. In this method, two alternative criteria, time-frequency discrimination factor (TFDF) and F score, are proposed to evaluate the discriminative power of time-frequency regions. Distinct from classical measures (e.g., Fisher criterion, r(2) coefficient), the TFDF is based on the neurophysiologic phenomena, on which the motor imagery BCI paradigm relies, rather than only from statistics. F score is based on the popular Fisher's discriminant and purely data driven; however, it differs from traditional measures since it provides a simple and effective measure for quantifying the discriminative power of a multi-dimensional feature vector. The proposed method is tested on BCI competition IV datasets IIa and IIb for discriminating right and left hand motor imagery. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method based on both criteria led to comparable or even better classification results, while using fewer electrodes (i.e., only two bipolar channels, C3 and C4). This work indicates that time-frequency optimization can not only improve the classification performance but also contribute to reducing the number of electrodes required in motor imagery BCIs.

Based on available research, we hypothesized that baseline theta oscillations would prospectively predict response to hypnotic analgesia. Analyses involving other oscillations and the other treatments (meditation, neurofeedback, and both active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation) were viewed as exploratory, given the lack of previous research examining brain oscillations as predictors of response to these other treatments. DesignRandomized controlled study of single sessions of four neuromodulatory pain treatments and a control procedure. MethodsThirty individuals with spinal cord injury and chronic pain had their EEG recorded before each session of four active treatments (hypnosis, meditation, EEG biofeedback, transcranial direct current stimulation) and a control procedure (sham transcranial direct stimulation). ResultsAs hypothesized, more presession theta power was associated with greater response to hypnotic analgesia. In exploratory analyses, we found that less baseline alpha power predicted pain reduction with meditation. ConclusionsThe findings support the idea that different patients respond to different pain treatments and that between-person treatment response differences are related to brain states as measured by EEG. The results have implications for the possibility of enhancing pain treatment response by either 1) better patient/treatment matching or 2) influencing brain activity before treatment is initiated in order to prepare patients to respond. Research is needed to replicate and confirm the findings in additional samples of individuals with chronic pain.

Synchronization of EEG: Bivariate and Multivariate Measures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bivariate measurement; coupled oscillators; electroencephalogram (EEG); multivariate measurement; synchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STATE-SPACE ANALYSIS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ONLINE CONTROL; FREQUENCY; SYSTEMS; POWER	Synchronization behavior of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is important for decoding information processing in the human brain. Modern multichannel EEG allows a transition from traditional measurements of synchronization in pairs of EEG signals to whole-brain synchronization maps. The latter can be based on bivariate measures (BM) via averaging over pair-wise values or, alternatively, on multivariate measures (MM), which directly ascribe a single value to the synchronization in a group. In order to compare BM versus MM, we applied nine different estimators to simulated multivariate time series with known parameters and to real EEGs. We found widespread correlations between BM and MM, which were almost frequency-independent for all the measures except coherence. The analysis of the behavior of synchronization measures in simulated settings with variable coupling strength, connection probability, and parameter mismatch showed that some of them, including S-estimator, S-Renyi, omega, and coherence, are more sensitive to linear interdependences, while others, like mutual information and phase locking value, are more responsive to nonlinear effects. One must consider these properties together with the fact that MM are computationally less expensive and, therefore, more efficient for the large-scale data sets than BM while choosing a synchronization measure for EEG analysis.

Although the concept of using EEG as a biometric modality has been validated in various studies but, new features are still impending to examine. In particular, we have proposed study of new features from various time and frequency domain of EEG for person identification. The data collected from ten volunteer subjects in five different sessions under relaxed state. The results indicated that the Hjorth parameter of time domain and Spectral Edge frequency of frequency domain has the minimum intra individuality and maximum inter individuality among pool of all subjects. Overall, this study shows the potentiality of using EEG as a biometric modality and its robustness against the fraud collection.

We show that a detailed analysis of EEG measurements provides highly discriminant features which indicate the mental state of patients with clinical depression. Our feature extraction method revolves around a novel processing structure that combines wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and non-linear algorithms. WPD was used to select appropriate EEG frequency bands. The resulting signals were processed with the non-linear measures of approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), renyi entropy (REN) and bispectral phase entropy (Ph). The features were selected using t-test and only discriminative features were fed to various classifiers, namely probabilistic neural network (PNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), naive bayes classification (NBC), Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC). Our classification results show that, with a classification accuracy of 99.5%, the PNN classifier performed better than the rest of classifiers in discriminating between normal and depression EEG signals. Hence, the proposed decision support system can be used to diagnose, and monitor the treatment of patients suffering from depression.

Sitting and standing intention can be decoded from scalp EEG recorded prior to movement execution	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalography; movement-related cortical potentials; classification; brain-machine; interface; mobile neuroimaging; lower extremity	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SINGLE-TRIAL CLASSIFICATION; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; TREADMILL WALKING; MOTOR IMAGERY; FEATURE-SELECTION; POTENTIALS; HAND; DISCRIMINATION; GAIT	Low frequency signals recorded from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), in particular movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs), are associated with preparation and execution of movement and thus present a target for use in brain-machine interfaces. We investigated the ability to decode movement intent from delta-band (0.1-4 Hz) EEG recorded immediately before movement execution in healthy volunteers. We used data from epochs starting 1.5 s before movement onset to classify future movements into one of three classes: stand-up, sit-down, or quiet. We assessed classification accuracy in both externally triggered and self-paced paradigms. Movement onset was determined from electromyography (EMG) recordings synchronized with EEG signals. We employed an artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) algorithm to eliminate high amplitude noise before building our time-embedded EEG features. We applied local Fisher's discriminant analysis to reduce the dimensionality of our spatio-temporal features and subsequently used a Gaussian mixture model classifier for our three class problem. Our results demonstrate significantly better than chance classification accuracy (chance level = 33.3%) for the self-initiated (78.0 2.6%) and triggered (74.7 5.7%) paradigms. Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in classification accuracy between the self-paced and cued paradigms when using the full set of non-peripheral electrodes. However, accuracy was significantly increased for self-paced movements when only electrodes over the primary motor area were used. Overall, this study demonstrates that delta-band EEG recorded immediately before movement carries discriminative information regarding movement type. Our results suggest that EEG-based classifiers could improve lower-limb neuroprostheses and neurorehabilitation techniques by providing earlier detection of movement intent, which could be used in robot-assisted strategies for motor training and recovery of function.

To develop an alternative time-frequency method for better extracting the feature information underlying the ERD/ERS during motor imagery, the Gabor filter is used in the algorithm to extract the amplitude information of the EEG in each frequency band. Then the inter-trail variance method is used to quantify the ERD/ERS. At last, the time-frequency map is shown to make a comprehensive analysis of hand motor imagery. The result shows a contralateral dominant alpha and beta ERD, and a beta ERS bilaterally. The present method is tested with EEG data from BCI competition III dataset IIIa. The feasibility of this method is proved and a compare with band-pass filter-based method is presented.

Participants read emotionally negative, neutral and positive nouns while performing a color detection task in which only perceptual-level analysis was required. Event-related potentials and time frequency representations were computed from the concurrently measured EEG. Negative words elicited a larger P2 and a larger late positivity than positive and neutral words, indicating deeper semantic/evaluative processing of negative words. In addition, sustained alpha power suppressions were found for the emotional compared to neutral words, in the time range from 500 to 1000 ms post-stimulus. These results suggest that sustained attention was allocated to the emotional words, whereas the attention allocated to the neutral words was released after an initial analysis. This seems to hold even when the emotional content of the words is task-irrelevant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The exact characteristics of clinically relevant HFOs and their detection are still to be defined. Methods: We propose a new method for HFO detection, which we have applied to six patient iEEGs. In a first stage, events of interest (EoIs) in the iEEG were defined by thresholds of energy and duration. To recognize HFOs among the EoIs, in a second stage the iEEG was Stockwell-transformed into the time-frequency domain, and the instantaneous power spectrum was parameterized. The parameters were optimized for HFO detection in patient 1 and tested in patients 2-5. Channels were ranked by HFO rate and those with rate above half maximum constituted the HFO area. The seizure onset zone (SOZ) served as gold standard. Results: The detector distinguished HFOs from artifacts and other EEG activity such as interictal epileptiform spikes. Computation took few minutes. We found HFOs with relevant power at frequencies also below the 80-500 Hz band, which is conventionally associated with HFOs. The HFO area overlapped with the SOZ with good specificity. 90% for five patients and one patient was re-operated. The performance of the detector was compared to two well-known detectors. Conclusions: Compared to methods detecting energy changes in filtered signals, our second stage - analysis in the time-frequency domain - discards spurious detections caused by artifacts or sharp epileptic activity and improves the detection of HFOs. The fast computation and reasonable accuracy hold promise for the diagnostic value of the detector.

This paper presents a novel method to detect neonatal bust suppression from multichannel EEG using a time-frequency (T-F) based approach. In this approach, features are extracted from T-F representations of EEG signals obtained using quadratic time-frequency distributions (QTFDs). Such features take into account the non-stationarity of EEG signals and are shown to be able to discriminate between burst and suppression patterns. The features are based on the energy concentration of the signals in the T-F domain, instantaneous frequency of the signals, and Renyi entropy and singular-value decomposition (SVD) of the TFDs of EEG. For each feature, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is found and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated as the performance criterion. Experimental results using EEG signals with burst suppression acquired from 3 term neonates show that the features extracted from the singular values of TFDs and energy concentration outperform others. Amongst different QTFDs, features extracted from the optimized extended modified B distribution exhibit the best performance. Also, a classifier which uses these features achieves a total accuracy of 99.6%.	[Awal, Md.

Our approach consists of a low-complexity signal analysis block which is well-suited to implementation as an integrated circuit followed by constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection-a strategy borrowed from the digital communications field. In addition to being very low in complexity, we demonstrate here that the proposed framework provides good detection performance while effectively rejecting false alarms. Compared to more conventional detection procedures that rely on the formation of surrogate distributions, the proposed approach is both lower in complexity and allows detection decisions to be accurately made using smaller time windows.

They usually occur in patients with mental deficiency and showing widely extended cortical lesions, often involving the sensorimotor area. Here we report three cases who did not fulfill these criteria, and in whom stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings demonstrated the prominent involvement of the supplementary motor area (SMA). Visual analysis was complemented by time-frequency analysis of SEEG signals using a neuroimaging approach (Epileptogenicity Maps), which showed at seizure onset a significant increase of high frequency oscillations (HFOs, 60-100 Hz) over the premotor and prefrontal areas. Critically, in all cases, the SMA showed ictal HFOs at seizure onset and was included in the surgical resection. All patients became seizure-free after surgery, and histopathological examinations showed no specific lesion. These cases suggest the prominent but not exclusive role of SMA in startle seizures, and highlight the fact that surgery can be considered even in the absence of any magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion.

J	Kawasaki, M; Kitajo, K; Yamaguchi, Y				Kawasaki, Masahiro; Kitajo, Keiichi; Yamaguchi, Yoko			Fronto-parietal and fronto-temporal theta phase synchronization for visual and auditory-verbal working memory	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						working memory; electroencephalogram; synchronization; visual; auditory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; CAPACITY; DYNAMICS	In humans, theta phase (4-8 Hz) synchronization observed on electroencephalography (EEG) plays an important role in the manipulation of mental representations during working memory (WM) tasks; fronto-temporal synchronization is involved in auditory-verbal WM tasks and fronto-parietal synchronization is involved in visual WM tasks. However, whether or not theta phase synchronization is able to select the to-be-manipulated modalities is uncertain. To address the issue, we recorded EEG data from subjects who were performing auditory-verbal and visual WM tasks; we compared the theta synchronizations when subjects performed either auditory-verbal or visual manipulations in separate WM tasks, or performed both two manipulations in the same WM task. The auditory-verbal WM task required subjects to calculate numbers presented by an auditory-verbal stimulus, whereas the visual WM task required subjects to move a spatial location in a mental representation in response to a visual stimulus. The dual WM task required subjects to manipulate auditory-verbal, visual, or both auditory-verbal and visual representations while maintaining auditory-verbal and visual representations. Our time-frequency EEG analyses revealed significant fronto-temporal theta phase synchronization during auditory-verbal manipulation in both auditory-verbal and auditory-verbal/visual WM tasks, but not during visual manipulation tasks. Similarly, we observed significant fronto-parietal theta phase synchronization during visual manipulation tasks, but not during auditory-verbal manipulation tasks. Moreover, we observed significant synchronization in both the fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal theta signals during simultaneous auditory-verbal/visual manipulations. These findings suggest that theta synchronization seems to flexibly connect the brain areas that manipulate WM.

Quantitative electroencephalography as a biomarker for proneness toward developing psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizotypy; Electroencephalography (EEG); Resting-state oscillations; Spectral analysis; Thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD)	THALAMOCORTICAL-THETA COHERENCE; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY QUESTIONNAIRE; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; POWER ABNORMALITIES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EEG; DISEASE; ALPHA	The fully dimensional approach to the relationship between schizotypal personality traits and schizophrenia describes schizotypy as a continuum throughout the general population ranging from low schizotypy (LoS) and psychological health to high schizotypy (HiS) and psychosis-proneness. However, no biological markers have yet been discovered that reliably quantify an individual's degree of schizotypy and/or psychosis. This study aimed to evaluate quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures of power spectra as potential bio-markers of the proneness towards the development of psychosis in schizotypal individuals. The resting-state oscillatory brain dynamics under eyes-closed condition from 16 LoS and 16 HiS individuals were analysed for qEEG measures of background rhythm frequency, relative power in delta, theta, low-alpha, high-alpha, low-beta, high-beta and low-gamma frequency bands, and the high-temporal cross-correlation of power spectra between low- and high-frequency bands observed by averaging signals from whole-head EEG electrodes. HiS individuals at rest locked the thalamocortical loop in the low-alpha band at a lower-frequency oscillation and displayed an abnormally high level of neural synchronisation. In addition, the high-alpha band was found to be positively correlated with both the high-beta and low-gamma bands unlike LoS individuals, indicating widespread thalamocortical resonance in HiS individuals. The increase of regional alpha oscillations in HiS individuals suggests abnormal high-level attention, whereas the pattern of correlation between frequency bands resembles the thalamocortical dysrhythmia phenomenon which underlies the symptomatology of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. These qEEG biomarkers may aid clinicians in identifying HiS individuals with a high-risk of developing psychosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the primary diagnostic imaging tool used by care providers in order to observe the aggressive paroxysmal activity that manifests from CEE. Though EEG is an effective diagnostic tool, it provides limited insight into the etiology and pathophysiology that can be obtained through other imaging techniques. The aim of this paper is to review current neuroimaging techniques, such as intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography and discuss howthey complement EEG findings and contribute to our understanding of CEE. In addition, we address the value of imaging techniques in defining and predicting cognitive changes in CEE.

Nevertheless, the instantaneous mixing model of ICA cannot properly describe spatio-temporal dynamics, such as those related to traveling waves of neural activity. In this work, we exploit the application of the Complex ICA (cICA) to describe the underlying brain activities in time and frequency domain. In particular, we show how to effectively extract the most significant timefrequency structure of cortical activity in order to solve a compelling EEG-based pattern classification problem. The crucial step of independent component selection among frequencies is performed using an objective computational method based on template matching techniques with physiologically-plausible activations. Experimental results are obtained using on-line EEG data from the BCI Competition 2003 and are expressed in terms of confusion matrix after leave-one-out validation procedure. A comparative analysis between ICA and cICA models reveals that cICA estimation gives powerful information and allows to achieve a higher classification accuracy with respect to instantaneous ICA.

The purpose of the study was to compare electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra and cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (CFPAC) at rest and during a simple subtraction task after acute alcohol ingestion. MethodsTwenty-one healthy subjects participated in this study. Two experiments were performed 1week apart, and the order of the experiments was randomly assigned to each subject. During the experiments, each subject was provided with orange juice containing alcohol or orange juice only. We recorded EEG activity and analyzed power spectra and CFPAC data. ResultsThe results showed prominent theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling at the frontal and parietal electrodes at rest. This effect was significantly reduced after alcohol ingestion. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling is deficiently synchronized at rest after alcohol ingestion. Therefore, cross-frequency coupling could be a useful tool for studying the effects of alcohol on the brain and investigating alcohol addiction.

Electroencephalography recordings from the scalp, or sometimes directly from the brain, are also used to locate brain areas where seizure begins, and in surgical treatment help plan the area for resection. As seizures are unpredictable and can occur infrequently, ictal recordings are not ideal in terms of time, cost, or risk when, for example, determining the efficacy of existing or new anti-seizure drugs, evaluating potential anti-epileptogenic interventions, or for prolonged intracerebral electrode studies. Thus, there is a need to identify and validate other electrophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy that could be used to diagnose, treat, cure, and prevent epilepsy. Electroencephalography recordings in the epileptic brain contain other interictal electrophysiological disturbances that can occur more frequently than seizures, such as interictal spikes (IIS) and sharp waves, and from invasive studies using wide bandwidth recording and small diameter electrodes, the discovery of pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and microseizures. Of IIS, HFOs, and microseizures, a significant amount of recent research has focused on HFOs in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Results from studies in animals with epilepsy and presurgical patients have consistently found a strong association between HFOs and epileptogenic brain tissue that suggest HFOs could be a potential biomarker of epileptogenicity and epileptogenesis. Here, we discuss several aspects of HFOs, as well as IIS and microseizures, and the evidence that supports their role as biomarkers of epilepsy.

This paper classifies the sleep stages based on graph domain features from a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. First, each epoch (30 s) EEG signal is mapped into a visibility graph (VG) and a horizontal VG (HVG). Second, a difference VG (DVG) is obtained by subtracting the edges set of the HVG from the edges set of the VG to extract essential degree sequences and to detect the gait-related movement artifact recordings. The mean degrees (MDs) and degree distributions (DDs) P (k) on HVGs and DVGs are analyzed epoch-by-epoch from 14,963 segments of EEG signals. Then, the MDs of each DVG and HVG and seven distinguishable DD values of P (k) from each DVG are extracted. Finally, nine extracted features are forwarded to a support vector machine to classify the sleep stages into two, three, four, five, and six states. The accuracy and kappa coefficients of six-state classification are 87.5% and 0.81, respectively. It was found that the MDs of the VGs on the deep sleep stage are higher than those on the awake and light sleep stages, and the MDs of the HVGs are just the reverse.

After a removal of ocular and movement-related artifacts, EEG band activity was computed by means of the frequency-selective Hilbert transform providing envelopes of frequency bands. Synchronization between HRV and EEG envelopes was quantified by Morlet wavelet coherence. A surrogate data approach was adapted to test for statistical significance of time-variant coherences. Using this processing scheme, significant coherence values between a HRV low-frequency sub-band (0.08-0.12 Hz) and the EEG delta envelope (1.5-4 Hz) occurring both in the preictal and early postictal periods of a seizure can be shown. Investigations were performed for all electrodes at 20-s intervals and for selected electrode pairs (T3 divided by C3, T4 divided by C4) in a time-variant mode. Synchronization was more pronounced in the group of right hemispheric TLE patients than in the left hemispheric group. Such a group-specific augmentation of synchronization confirms the hypothesis of a right hemispheric lateralization of sympathetic cardiac control of the low-frequency HRV components.

Role of ictal baseline shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations in stereo-electroencephalography analysis of mesial temporal lobe seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Depth intracranial monitoring; Ripples; Fast ripples; Infraslow activity; DC shifts	NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INFRASLOW ACTIVITY; FOCAL SEIZURES; EEG ACTIVITY; 100-500 HZ; DC SHIFTS; HIPPOCAMPAL; LOCALIZATION; GENERATION; RIPPLES	ObjectiveTo assess the role of ictal baseline shifts (IBS) and ictal high-frequency oscillations (iHFOs) in intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) presurgical evaluation by analysis of the spatial and temporal relationship of IBS, iHFOs with ictal conventional stereo-electroencephalography (icEEG) in mesial temporal lobe seizures (MTLS). MethodsWe studied 15 adult patients with medically refractory MTLS who underwent monitoring with depth electrodes. Seventy-five ictal EEG recordings at 1,000Hz sampling rate were studied. Visual comparison of icEEG, IBS, and iHFOs were performed using Nihon-Kohden Neurofax systems (acquisition range 0.016-300Hz). Each recorded ictal EEG was analyzed with settings appropriate for displaying icEEG, IBS, and iHFOs. ResultsIBS and iHFOs were observed in all patients and in 91% and 81% of intracranial seizures, respectively. IBS occurred before (22%), at (57%), or after (21%) icEEG onset. In contrast, iHFOs occurred at (30%) or after (70%) icEEG onset. The onset of iHFOs was 11.5s later than IBS onset (p<0.0001). All of the earliest onset of IBS and 70% of the onset of iHFOs overlapped with the ictal onset zone (IOZ). Compared with iHFOs, interictal HFOs (itHFOs) were less correlated with IOZ. In contrast to icEEG, IBS and iHFOs had smaller spatial distributions in 70% and 100% of the seizures, respectively. An IBS dipole was observed in 66% of the seizures. Eighty-seven percent of the dipoles had a negative pole at the anterior/medial part of amygdala/hippocampus complex (A-H complex) and a positive pole at the posterior/lateral part of the A-H complex. SignificanceThe results suggest that evaluation of IBS and iHFOs, in addition to routine icEEG, helps in more accurately defining the IOZ. This study also shows that the onset and the spatial distribution of icEEG, IBS, and iHFOs do not overlap, suggesting that they reflect different cellular or network dynamics.

To understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we used electroencephalography while subjects played as proposers in a repeated ultimatum game. We found that subjects adapted their offers to obtain more acceptances in the last round and that this adaptation correlated negatively with prefrontal theta oscillations. People with higher prefrontal theta activity related to a rejection did not adapt their offers along the game to maximize their earning. Moreover, between-subject variation in posterior theta oscillations correlated positively with how individual theta activity influenced the change of offer after a rejection, reflecting a process of behavioral adaptation to the others' demands. Interestingly, people adapted better their offers when they knew that they where playing against a computer, although the behavioral adaptation did not correlate with prefrontal theta oscillation. Behavioral changes between human and computer games correlated with prefrontal theta activity, suggesting that low adaptation in human games could be a strategy. Taken together, these results provide evidence for specific roles of prefrontal and posterior theta oscillations in social bargaining.

The present study compared EEG in BD during manic and depressive episodes, using brain electrical source imaging [standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)] to assess the cortical spatial distribution of the sources of EEG oscillation frequencies. MethodsTwo independent datasets (a total of 95 patients with bipolar I disorder, of whom 59 were female) were analyzed. Dataset #1 comprised 14 patients in a manic as well as a depressive episode. Dataset #2 comprised 26 patients in a manic episode and 55 patients in a depressive episode. From the head surface-recorded EEG, sLORETA cortical activity was computed in eight EEG frequency bands, and compared between mood states in both datasets. The results from the two datasets were combined using conjunction analysis. ResultsConjunction analysis yielded significant differences between mood states: In manic compared to depressive states, patients had lesser theta frequency band activity (right-hemispheric lateral lower prefrontal and anterior temporal, mainly Brodmann areas 13, 38, and 47), and greater beta-2 and beta-3 frequency band activity (extended bilateral prefrontal-to-parietal, mainly Brodmann area 6, and the cingulate). ConclusionsThe spatial organization of the brain's electrical oscillations differed in patients with BD between manic and depressive mood states. The brain areas implementing the main functions that show opposing abnormalities during manic and depressive episodes were affected by unduly increased or decreased activity (beta or theta). The discussion considers that facilitating (beta) or inhibiting (theta) electrical activity can in either case result in behavioral facilitation or inhibition, depending on the function of the brain area.

Stimulus-Response Mappings Shape Inhibition Processes: A Combined EEG-fMRI Study of Contextual Stopping	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; SIGNAL PARADIGM; N2/P3 COMPLEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; TIME; CORTEX; MODEL; COMPATIBILITY; PROBABILITY	Humans are rarely faced with one simple task, but are typically confronted with complex stimulus constellations and varying stimulus-relevance in a given situation. Through modifying the prototypical stop-signal task and by combined recording and analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied the effects of stimulus relevance for the generation of a response or its inhibition. Stimulus response mappings were modified by contextual cues, indicating which of two different stimuli following a go stimulus was relevant for stopping. Overall, response inhibition, that is comparing successful stopping to a stop-signal against go-signal related processes, was associated with increased activity in right inferior and left midfrontal regions, as well as increased EEG delta and theta power; however, stimulus-response conditions in which the most infrequent stop-signal was relevant for inhibition, were associated with decreased activity in regions typically involved in response inhibition, as well as decreased activity in the delta and theta bands as compared to conditions wherein the relevant stop-signal frequency was higher. Behaviorally, this (aforementioned) condition, which demanded inhibition only from the most infrequent stimulus, was also associated with reduced reaction times and lower error rates. This pattern of results does not align with typical stimulus frequency-driven findings and suggests interplay between task relevance and stimulus frequency of the stop-signal. Moreover, with a multimodal EEG-fMRI analysis, we demonstrated significant parameterization for response inhibition with delta, theta and beta time-frequency values, which may be interpreted as reflecting conflict monitoring, evaluative and/or motor processes as suggested by previous work (Huster et al., 2013; Aron, 2011). Further multimodal results suggest a possible neurophysiological and behavioral benefit under conditions whereby the most infrequent stimulus demanded inhibition, indicating that the frequency of the stop-signal interacts with the current stimulus-response contingency. These results demonstrate that response inhibition is prone to influence from other cognitive functions, making it difficult to dissociate real inhibitory capabilities from the influence of moderating mechanisms.

Phase TE quantifies the transfer entropy between phase time-series extracted from neuronal signals by filtering for instance. To validate the measure, we used coupled Neuronal Mass Models to both evaluate the characteristics of Phase TE and compare its performance with that of a real-valued TE implementation. We showed that Phase TE detects the strength and direction of connectivity even in the presence of such amounts of noise and linear mixing that typically characterize MEG and EEG recordings. Phase TE performed well across a wide range of analysis lags and sample sizes. Comparisons between Phase TE and real-valued TE estimates showed that Phase TE is more robust to nuisance parameters and considerably more efficient computationally. In addition, Phase TE accurately untangled bidirectional frequency band specific interaction patterns that confounded real-valued TE. Finally, we found that surrogate data can be used to construct appropriate null-hypothesis distributions and to estimate statistical significance of Phase TE. These results hence suggest that Phase TE is well suited for the estimation of directed phase-based connectivity in large-scale investigations of the human functional connectome.

J	Weisz, N; Obleser, J				Weisz, Nathan; Obleser, Jonas			Synchronisation signatures in the listening brain: A perspective from non-invasive neuroelectrophysiology	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Review							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; ALPHA-BAND; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; HEARING-LOSS; MEMORY LOAD; EEG ALPHA	Human magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) are capable of tracking brain activity at millisecond temporal resolution in an entirely non-invasive manner, a feature that offers unique opportunities to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hearing brain. In general, precise synchronisation of neural activity within as well as across distributed regions is likely to subserve any cognitive process, with auditory cognition being no exception. Brain oscillations, in a range of frequencies, are a putative hallmark of this synchronisation process. Embedded in a larger effort to relate human cognition to brain oscillations, a field of research is emerging on how synchronisation within, as well as between, brain regions may shape auditory cognition. Combined with much improved source localisation and connectivity techniques, it has become possible to study directly the neural activity of auditory cortex with unprecedented spatio-temporal fidelity and to uncover frequency-specific long-range connectivities across the human cerebral cortex. In the present review, we will summarise recent contributions mainly of our laboratories to this emerging domain. We present (1) a more general introduction on how to study local as well as interareal synchronisation in human M/EEG; (2) how these networks may subserve and influence illusory auditory perception (clinical and non-clinical) and (3) auditory selective attention; and (4) how oscillatory networks further reflect and impact on speech comprehension.

HFOs are also indicators of disease activity as HFO rates increase after reduction of antiepileptic medication. Electrical stimulation (ES) can be used for diagnostic purposes as well as therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy. This study investigates the occurrence and changes of HFOs during ES in patients with refractory epilepsy. Objective: Analysis of the effects of ES using intracranial ES on the occurrence of epileptic HFOs. Methods: Patients underwent ES for diagnostic purposes. Ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (200-500 Hz) were visually marked in a baseline EEG segment prior to ES, after each period of ES as well as after the end of ES. In patients in whom ES triggered a seizure a pre- and postictal segment was marked. Rates of HFOs were compared for the different time periods using a Spearman's correlation and Wilcoxon rank sum test (p< 0.05). Results: 12 patients with 911 EEG channels were analyzed. Ripple (r= 0.42, p< 0.001) as well as fast ripple (r= 0.21, p< 0.001) rates decreased significantly over the course of stimulation. This phenomenon was not focal over the seizure onset or neighboring contacts but even observed over distant contacts. Conclusions: ES resulted in a gradual decrease of HFO-Rates over time. The decrease of HFOs was not limited to SOZ areas. If HFOs are considered as markers of disease activity the reduction in HFO-rates as a result of intracranial ES has to be interpreted as a reduction of disease activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We combined data from four separate cognitive tasks and 64 subjects in which EEG and EMG (muscle activity from the thumb used to respond) were recorded. In typical neuroscience experiments, behavioral responses are classified as "error" or "correct"; however, closer inspection of our data revealed that correct responses were often accompanied by "partial errors" a muscle twitch of the incorrect hand ("mixed correct trials,"similar to 13% of the trials). We found that these muscle twitches dissociated conflicts from errors in time-frequency domain analyses of EEG data. In particular, both mixed-correct trials and full error trials were associated with enhanced theta-band power (4-9 Hz) compared to correct trials. However, full errors were additionally associated with power and frontal-parietal synchrony in the delta band. Single-trial robust multiple regression analyses revealed a significant modulation of theta power as a function of partial error correction time, thus linking trial-to-trial fluctuations in power to conflict. Furthermore, single-trial correlation analyses revealed a qualitative dissociation between conflict and error processing, such that mixed correct trials were associated with positive theta-RT correlations whereas full error trials were associated with negative delta-RT correlations. These findings shed new light on the local and global network mechanisms of conflict monitoring and error detection, and their relationship to online action adjustment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

There is no consensus about its efficacy for oncological patients, especially for post-mastectomy pain and eletrocortical changes in somatosensory areas. The aim of this study was to analyze acute electrocortical changes after TENS treatment of patients with intercostobrachial post mastectomy pain. [Subjects] Eighteen patients were divided into acupuncture (A) and burst (B) group. [Methods] In this pre and post-intervention study each group was measured for EEG analysis in absulte power in alpha band (8-14 Hz). Outcomes variables were the alpha waveband in the sensorymotor cortex and pain pre-and-post TENS intervention. Data were analyzed using ANOVA to compare times (rest, 10 and 15 min), group and electrodes. Pain was analyzed using percentual pain evaluation (PPE) in both groups. [Results] Outcomes indicate main effects of time and electrodes because of slow (8-10 Hz) and fast alpha (10-12 Hz) wavebands decreased. PPE reduced 88.4% in A and 66.3% in G. [Conclusion] TENS promoted electrical modification in the parietal region and a decrease in pain. Future studies should investigate other wave must be proposed for other bands and use different methods of EEG analysis to elucidate the actual mechanisms behind the efficacy of TENS treatment.

Electroencephalographic Upper/Low Alpha Frequency Power Ratio Relates to Cortex Thinning in Mild Cognitive Impairment	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Alpha frequency; Cortex thinning; Mild cognitive impairment	ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; EEG-ALPHA; FIELD-STRENGTH; DISEASE; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; PRECUNEUS	Objective: Temporoparietal cortex thinning is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD). The increase in EEG upper/low a frequency power ratio has been associated with AD converter MCI subjects. We investigated the association of the EEG upper/low a frequency power ratio with patterns of cortical thickness in MCI. Methods: 74 adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalography (EEG) recording and high-resolution 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The EEG upper/low a frequency power ratio as well as cortical thickness were computed for each subject. Three MCI groups were detected according to increasing tertile values of EEG upper/low a frequency power ratios, and the difference of cortical thickness among the groups was estimated. Results: The EEG high upper/low a frequency power ratio group had a total cortical grey matter volume reduction of 471 mm(2), greater than that of the EEG low upper/low a frequency power ratio group (p < 0.001). The EEG high upper/low a frequency power ratio group showed a similar but less marked pattern (160 mm(2)) of cortical thinning when compared to the EEG middle upper/low a frequency power ratio group (p < 0.001). Moreover, the EEG high upper/low a frequency power ratio group had wider cortical thinning than other groups, mapped to the supramarginal gyrus and precuneus bilaterally. No significant regional cortical thickness differences were found between middle and low EEG upper/low a frequency power ratio groups. Conclusion: A high EEG upper/low a frequency power ratio was associated with temporoparietal cortical thinning in MCI subjects. The combination of upper/low a frequency power ratio and cortical thickness measurement could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for progression to AD dementia and may be of value in the clinical context.

Yet, previous studies on human brain activity during navigation focus on stationary setups, neglecting vestibular and kinesthetic feedback. The aim of our work is to uncover the influence of those sensory modalities on cortical processing. We developed a fully immersive virtual reality setup combined with high density mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants traversed one leg of a triangle, turned on the spot, continued along the second leg, and finally indicated the location of their starting position. Vestibular and kinesthetic information was provided either in combination, as isolated sources of information, or not at all within a 2x2 full factorial intra subjects design. EEG data were processed by clustering independent components, and time-frequency spectrograms were calculated. In parietal, occipital, and temporal clusters, we detected alpha suppression during the turning movement, which is associated with a heightened demand of visuo-attentional processing and closely resembles results reported in previous stationary studies. This decrease is present in all conditions and therefore seems to generalize to more natural settings. Yet, in incongruent conditions, when different sensory modalities did not match, the decrease is significantly stronger. Additionally, in more anterior areas we found that providing only vestibular but no kinesthetic information results in alpha increase. These observations demonstrate that stationary experiments omit important aspects of sensory feedback. Therefore, it is important to develop more natural experimental settings in order to capture a more complete picture of neural correlates of spatial navigation.

Transitory effect of spike and spike-and-wave discharges on EEG power in children	BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Spectral analysis; Interictal spikes; Spike-and-wave; Oscillations; EEG	FOCAL INTERICTAL SPIKES; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; REACTION-TIME; EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENESIS; PERCEPTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ABNORMALITIES; HIPPOCAMPUS; LATERALITY	Background: Spikes and spike-and-wave discharges on the EEG of children are a strong biomarker of epilepsy. There is increasing evidence that these EEG abnormalities also impair brain function and result in transitory cognitive impairment. Studies in animal models have shown that EEG spikes alters single cell firing and that such impairment in firing may extend beyond the duration of the spike-and-wave discharge. Whether interictal epileptiform discharges have lasting effects on EEG activity in humans is not known. Methods and Results: The EEGs of 60 consecutive children with focal or interictal spike-and-wave discharges were evaluated using power spectral analysis to determine if there were any changes in power spectra from before to after the interictal abnormalities. Neither focal spike-and-wave nor generalized spike-and-wave discharges had any effect on the EEG frequency or spectral power following the discharge. Conclusion: While interictal EEG discharges temporarily alter neural activity during the duration of the spike-and-wave discharge, there is no evidence that alterations of spectral power continue beyond the duration of the interictal discharge. The effects of interictal activity on EEG rhythms therefore appear to be quite transient and confined to the duration of the interictal discharge. (C) 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

N.; Darvas, Felix			Non-invasive detection of high gamma band activity during motor imagery	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						high gamma; EEG; fMRI; motor imagery	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENTS; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	High gamma oscillations (70-150 Hz; HG) are rapidly evolving, spatially localized neurophysiological signals that are believed to be the best representative signature of engaged neural populations. The HG band has been best characterized from invasive electrophysiological approaches such as electrocorticography because of the increased signal-to-noise ratio that results when by-passing the scalp and skull. Despite the recent observation that HG activity can be detected non-invasively by electroencephalography (EEG), it is unclear to what extent EEG can accurately resolve the spatial distribution of HG signals during active task engagement. We have overcome some of the limitations inherent to acquiring HG signals across the scalp by utilizing individual head anatomy in combination with an inverse modeling method. We applied a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer method on EEG data during a motor imagery paradigm to extract a time-frequency spectrogram at every voxel location on the cortex. To confirm spatially distributed patterns of HG responses, we contrasted overlapping maps of the EEG HG signal with blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from the same set of neurologically normal subjects during a separate session. We show that scalp-based HG band activity detected by EEG during motor imagery spatially co-localizes with BOLD fMRI data. Taken together, these results suggest that EEG can accurately resolve spatially specific estimates of local cortical high frequency signals, potentially opening an avenue for non-invasive measurement of HG potentials from diverse sets of neurologically impaired populations for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

This activation can be measured by several technologies such as electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. It is proposed that motor network activation and therefore increased cortical excitability of primary motor cortex occur due to premotor mirror neuron system inputs. This mechanism has been demonstrated as important for planning actions and seems relevant for anticipating others actions and for empathy establishing as well as for language development.

One of the most frequently used approaches is the self regulation of oscillatory signals recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Many patients are, however, unable to achieve sufficient voluntary control of brain activity. This could be due to the specific anatomical and physiological changes of the patient's brain after the lesion, as well as to methodological issues related to the technique chosen for recording brain signals. Methods: A patient with an extended ischemic lesion of the cortex did not gain volitional control of sensorimotor oscillations when using a standard EEG-based approach. We provided him with neurofeedback of his brain activity from the epidural space by electrocorticography (ECoG). Results: Ipsilesional epidural recordings of field potentials facilitated self-regulation of brain oscillations in an online closed-loop paradigm and allowed reliable neurofeedback training for a period of 4 weeks. Conclusion: Epidural implants may decode and train brain activity even when the cortical physiology is distorted following severe brain injury. Such practice would allow for reinforcement learning of preserved neural networks and may well provide restorative tools for those patients who are severely afflicted.

Reinstatement of distributed cortical oscillations occurs with precise spatiotemporal dynamics during successful memory retrieval	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						memory; intracranial EEG; oscillations; reinstatement	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; MULTIVOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL REPLAY; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FREE-RECALL; CONTEXT; CONSOLIDATION	Reinstatement of neural activity is hypothesized to underlie our ability to mentally travel back in time to recover the context of a previous experience. We used intracranial recordings to directly examine the precise spatiotemporal extent of neural reinstatement as 32 participants with electrodes placed for seizure monitoring performed a paired-associates episodic verbal memory task. By cueing recall, we were able to compare reinstatement during correct and incorrect trials, and found that successful retrieval occurs with reinstatement of a gradually changing neural signal present during encoding. We examined reinstatement in individual frequency bands and individual electrodes and found that neural reinstatement was largely mediated by temporal lobe theta and high-gamma frequencies. Leveraging the high temporal precision afforded by intracranial recordings, our data demonstrate that high-gamma activity associated with reinstatement preceded theta activity during encoding, but during retrieval this difference in timing between frequency bands was absent. Our results build upon previous studies to provide direct evidence that successful retrieval involves the reinstatement of a temporal context, and that such reinstatement occurs with precise spatiotemporal dynamics.

While the first are easily obtained by means of averaging techniques (the evoked response), this latter reflects changes in the ongoing EEG that are important in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) studies. Techniques have been proposed for assessing such changes but they only provide the spectral estimate of the time-locked activities. New method: An independent component analysis-based method is proposed for the EEG analysis during IPS. Artificially generated sinusoidal functions at the stimulation frequency and harmonics are used together with the acquired EEG signal to build the observed vector that is presented to the ICA algorithm. Results: The proposed method was evaluated with simulated data and applied to EEG signals acquired on two electrodes placed over the occipital region showing that this method is capable of providing a suitable estimation of the ongoing EEG activities in both time and frequency domains. Comparison with existing method(s): The results were compared with a coherence-based method, showing that the proposed method can estimate the power spectrum of the ongoing EEG activity as precisely as the coherence-based method with the advantage of allowing the ongoing EEG activity in time domain to be also obtained. Conclusions: The application of the proposed method could be used for ERS/ERD studies, since it separates evoked responses, which are phase-locked to the stimuli, from those that change the ongoing EEG in a time-locked manner to the external stimulation.

However, the temporal, frequency, and functional profiles of IOG activity during face processing remain unclear. Here, this issue was investigated by recording intracranial field potentials in the JOG during the presentation of faces, mosaics, and houses in upright and inverted orientations. Time frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed greater gamma-band activation in the TOG beginning at 110 msec and covering 40-300 Hz in response to upright faces relative to upright houses and mosaics. Phase amplitude cross-frequency coupling analyses revealed more evident theta gamma couplings at 115-256 msec during the processing of upright faces as compared with that of upright houses and mosaics. Comparable gamma-band activity was observed during the processing of inverted and upright faces at about 100-200 msec, but weaker activity and different coupling with theta-band activity after 200 msec. These patterns of activity were more evident in the right than in the left IOG. These results, together with other evidence on neural communication, suggest that broadband gamma oscillations in the right IOG conduct rapid and multistage (i.e., both featural and configural) face processing in collaboration with theta oscillations transmitted from other brain regions.

Sensors are combined linearly with weights that are chosen to provide optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Signal and noise can be variably defined to match the specific need, e.g. reproducibility over trials, frequency content, or differences between stimulus conditions. We demonstrate how the method can be used to remove power line or cardiac interference, enhance stimulus-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, isolate narrow-band cortical activity, and so on. The approach involves decorrelating both the original and filtered data by joint diagonalization of their covariance matrices. We trace its origins; offer an easy-to-understand explanation; review a range of applications; and chart failure scenarios that might lead to misleading results, in particular due to overfitting. In addition to its flexibility and effectiveness, a major appeal of the method is that it is easy to understand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

The current study was conducted to assess whether dissociable processes occurring in the theta and delta bands would similarly account for activity underlying N2 and P3 components in a go/no-go task. Methods: The current study measured EEG signals from 66 participants during a go/no-go task, and a time-frequency principal components analysis decomposition approach was used to extract theta and delta measures from condition averages. Results: Theta and delta measures separately increased in relation to response inhibition, and were uniquely related to the N2 and P3 components, as predicted. Conclusions: Findings support the view that the theta and delta measures indexed separable processes related to response inhibition, and better indexed the processes underlying N2 and P3 components in this go/no-go task. Significance: Theta and delta measures may index separable functional processes across other common ERP tasks, and may represent an improved target for research relative to standard time-domain components.

When they liked a specific shoe, they pressed on a button and marked the time of this activity and the particular epoch was labeled as a LIKE case. No button press meant that the subject did not like the particular shoe that was displayed and corresponding epoch designated as a DISLIKE case. After preprocessing, power spectral density (PSD) of EEG data was estimated at different frequencies (4, 5, ... , 40 Hz) using the Burg method, for each epoch corresponding to one shoe presentation. Each subject's data consisted of normalized PSD values (NPVs) from all LIKE and DISLIKE cases/epochs coming from all 19 EEG channels. In order to determine the most discriminative frequencies and channels, we have utilized logistic regression, where LIKE/DISLIKE status was used as a categorical (binary) response variable and corresponding NPVs were the continuously valued input variables or predictors. We observed that when all the NPVs (total of 37) are used as predictors, the regression problem was becoming ill-posed due to large number of predictors (compared to the number of samples) and high correlation among predictors. To circumvent this issue, we have divided the frequency band into low frequency (LF) 4-19 Hz and high frequency (HF) 20-40 Hz bands and analyzed the influence of the NPV in these bands separately. Then, using the p-values that indicate how significantly estimated predictor weights are different than zero, we have determined the NPVs and channels that are more influential in determining the outcome, i. e., like/dislike decision. In the LF band, 4 and 5 Hz were found to be the most discriminative frequencies (MDFs). In the HF band, none of the frequencies seemed offer significant information. When both male and female data was used, in the LF band, a frontal channel on the left (F7-A1) and a temporal channel on the right (T6-A2) were found to be the most discriminative channels (MDCs). In the HF band, MDCs were central (Cz-A1) and occipital on the left (O1-A1) channels. The results of like timings suggest that male and female behavior for this set of stimulant images were similar.

An early detection of the abnormality, due to irregular processing in the brain, can be achieved using electroencephalograms (EEG). The variations in the EEG signals cannot be deciphered by mere visual inspection. Computer-aided diagnostic tools can be used to recognize the subtle and invisible information present in the irregular EEG pattern and diagnose autism. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of automated EEG-based diagnosis of autism. Various time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinear dynamics for the analysis of autistic EEG signals are described briefly. A focus of the review is the use of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory to discover the mathematical biomarkers for the diagnosis of the autism analogous to biological markers. A combination of the time-frequency and nonlinear dynamic analysis is the most effective approach to characterize the nonstationary and chaotic physiological signals for the automated EEG-based diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The features extracted using these nonlinear methods can be used as mathematical markers to detect the early stage of autism and aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. This will expedite the administration of appropriate therapies to treat the disorder.

A 1 /f-like power spectrum is indicative of arrhythmic brain activity that does not contain a predominant temporal scale (hence, 'scale-free'). This characteristic of scale-free brain activity distinguishes it from brain oscillations. Although scale-free brain activity and brain oscillations coexist, our understanding of the former remains limited. Recent research has shed light on the spatiotemporal organization, functional significance, and potential generative mechanisms of scale-free brain activity, as well as its developmental and clinical relevance. A deeper understanding of this prevalent brain signal should provide new insights into, and analytical tools for, cognitive neuroscience.

We modified the time-varying generalized partial directed coherence (tv-gPDC) method, by orthogonalization of the strictly causal multivariate autoregressive model coefficients, to minimize the effect of mutual sources. The novel measure, generalized orthogonalized PDC (gOPDC), was tested first using two simulated models with feature dimensions relevant to EEG activities. We then used the method for assessing event-related directional information flow from flash-evoked responses in neonatal EEG. For testing statistical significance of the findings, we followed a thresholding procedure driven by baseline periods in the same EEG activity. The results suggest that the gOPDC method 1) is able to remove common components akin to volume conduction effect in the scalp EEG, 2) handles the potential challenge with different amplitude scaling within multichannel signals, and 3) can detect directed information flow within a subsecond time scale in nonstationary multichannel EEG datasets. This method holds promise for estimating directed interactions between scalp EEG channels that are commonly affected by the confounding impact of mutual cortical sources.

Recent neuroimaging studies in monolinguals indicated that core language areas in human neocortex together with sensorimotor structures form a highly interactive system underpinning native language comprehension. While the experience of a native speaker promotes the establishment of strong action-perception links in the comprehension network, this may not necessarily be the case for L2 where, as it has been argued, the most a typical L2 speaker may get is a link between an L2 wordform and its L1 translation equivalent. Therefore, we investigated, whether the motor cortex of bilingual subjects shows differential involvement in processing action semantics of native and non-native words. We used high-density EEG to dynamically measure changes in the cortical motor system's activity, indexed by event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the mu-rhythm, in response to passively reading L1 (German) and L2 (English) action words. Analysis of motor-related EEG oscillations at the sensor level revealed an early (starting similar to 150 ms) and left-lateralised coupling between action and semantics during both L1 and L2 processing. Crucially, source-level activation in the motor areas showed that mu-rhythm ERD, while present for both languages, is significantly stronger for L1 words. This is the first neurophysiological evidence of rapid motor-cortex involvement during L2 action-semantic processing. Our results both strengthen embodied cognition evidence obtained previously in monolinguals and, at the same time, reveal important quantitative differences between L1 and L2 sensorimotor brain activity in language comprehension.

The aim of this study was examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the PMBS involved during multi-limb coordination task. We investigated post-switching beta synchronization (assigned PMBS) using time-frequency and source estimations analyzes. Participants (n = 17) initiated an auditory-paced bimanual tapping. After a 1500 ms preparatory period, an imperative stimulus required to either selectively stop the left while maintaining the right unimanual tapping (Switch condition: SWIT) or to continue the bimanual tapping (Continue condition: CONT). PMBS significantly increased in SWIT compared to CONT with maximal difference within right central region in broad-band 14-30 Hz and within left central region in restricted-band 22-26 Hz. Source estimations localized these effects within right pre-frontal cortex and left parietal cortex, respectively. A negative correlation showed that participants with a low percentage of errors in SWIT had a large PMBS amplitude within right parietal and frontal cortices. This study shows for the first time simultaneous PMBS with distinct functions in different brain regions and frequency ranges. The left parietal PMBS restricted to 22-26 Hz could reflect the sensory reafferences of the right hand tapping disrupted by the switching. In contrast, the right prefrontal PMBS in a broad-band 14-30 Hz is likely reflecting the active inhibition of the left hand stopped. Finally, correlations between behavioral performance and the magnitude of the PMBS suggest that beta oscillations can be viewed as a marker of successful active inhibition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

EEG is one of the most popular methods of studying and understanding the processes that underlie behavior. This is so, because EEG is relatively cheap, easy to wear, light weight and has high temporal resolution. In terms of behavior, this encompasses actions, such as movements that are performed in response to the environment. However, there are methodological difficulties which can occur when recording EEG during movement such as movement artifacts. Thus, most studies about the human brain have examined activations during static conditions. This article attempts to compile and describe relevant methodological solutions that emerged in order to measure body and brain dynamics during motion. These descriptions cover suggestions on how to avoid and reduce motion artifacts, hardware, software and techniques for synchronously recording EEG, EMG, kinematics, kinetics, and eye movements during motion. Additionally, we present various recording systems, EEG electrodes, caps and methods for determinating real/custom electrode positions. In the end we will conclude that it is possible to record and analyze synchronized brain and body dynamics related to movement or exercise tasks.	[Reis, Pedro M.

One of the strategies used, is to decode the motor imagery of the subject, which can modify the neuronal activity in the sensory-motor areas in a similar way to which it is observed in real movement. The present study shows the activation patterns that are registered in motor and motor imagery tasks of right and left hand movement in a sample of young healthy subjects of Mexican nationality. By means of frequency analysis it was possible to determine the difference conditions of motor imagery and movement. Using U Mann-Whitney tests, differences with statistical significance (p < 0.05) where obtained, in the EEG channels C3, Cz, C4, T3 and P3 in the mu and beta rhythms, for subjects with similar characteristics (age, gender, and education). With these results, it would be possible to define a classifier or decoder by gender that improves the performance rate and diminishes the training time, with the goal of designing a functional BCI system that can be transferred from the laboratory to the clinical application in patients with motor disabilities.

Scalp EEG is not a Blur: It Can See High Frequency Oscillations Although Their Generators are Small	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						High frequency oscillations; Scalp HFO; Ripple; Simultaneous scalp and subdural EEG; Spatial sampling	IN-VIVO; EPILEPTIC SPIKES; BRAIN; SKULL; HZ; EPILEPTOGENICITY; LOCALIZATION; MACROELECTRODES; CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTRODES	High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are emerging as biomarkers of epileptogenicity. They have been shown to originate from small brain regions. Surprisingly, spontaneous HFOs can be recorded from the scalp. To understand how is it possible to observe these small events on the scalp, one avenue is the analysis of the cortical correlates at the time of scalp HFOs. Using simultaneous scalp and intracranial recordings of 11 patients, we studied the spatial distribution of scalp events on the cortical surface. For typical interictal epileptiform discharges the subdural distributions were, as expected, spatially extended. On the contrary, for scalp HFOs the subdural maps corresponded to focal sources, consisting of one or a few small spatial extent activations. These topographies suggest that small cortical areas generated the HFOs seen on the scalp. Similar scalp distributions corresponded to distinct distributions on a standard 1 cm subdural grid and averaging similar scalp HFOs resulted in focal subdural maps. The assumption that a subdural grid "sees" everything that contributes to the potential of nearby scalp contacts was not valid for HFOs. The results suggest that these small extent events are spatially undersampled with standard scalp and grid inter-electrode distances. High-density scalp electrode distributions seem necessary to obtain a solid sampling of HFOs on the scalp. A better understanding of the influence of spatial sampling on the observation of high frequency brain activity on the scalp is important for their clinical use as biomarkers of epilepsy.

Does sleep deprivation alter functional EEG networks in children with focal epilepsy?

Sleep deprivation is associated with increased interictal EEG abnormalities in patients with epilepsy, but the exact mechanism is unknown. In this feasibility study, we used a network analytical approach to provide novel insights into this clinical observation. The aim was to characterize the effect of sleep deprivation on the interictal functional network organization using a unique dataset of paired routine and sleep deprivation recordings in patients and controls. We included 21 children referred to the first seizure clinic of our center with suspected new onset focal epilepsy in whom a routine interictal and a sleep deprivation EEG (SD-EEG) were performed. Seventeen children, in whom the diagnosis of epilepsy was excluded, served as controls. For both time points weighted functional networks were constructed based on interictal artifact free time-series. Routine and sleep deprivation networks were characterized at different frequency bands using minimum spanning tree (MST) measures (leaf number and diameter) and classical measures of integration (path length) and segregation (clustering coefficient). A significant interaction was found for leaf number and diameter between patients and controls after sleep deprivation: patients showed a shift toward a more path-like MST network whereas controls showed a shift toward a more star-like MST network. This shift in network organization after sleep deprivation in patients is in accordance with previous studies showing a more regular network organization in the ictal state and might relate to the increased epileptiform abnormalities found in patients after sleep deprivation. Larger studies are needed to verify these results. Finally, MST measures were more sensitive in detecting network changes as compared to the classical measures of integration and segregation.

J	Zhang, C; Yu, XL; Yang, Y; Xu, L				Zhang, Chong; Yu, Xiaolin; Yang, Yong; Xu, Lei			Phase Synchronization and Spectral Coherence Analysis of EEG Activity During Mental Fatigue	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental fatigue; electroencephalogram; phase synchronization; spectral coherence	POWER; OSCILLATIONS; SLEEPINESS	In this article, 2 synchronization measures, phase locking value (PLV) and spectral coherence value (SCV), are used to characterize the changes of the phase synchronization and functional coupling of electroencephalogram (EEG) waves at different brain cortical areas for mental fatigue caused by a long-term cognitive task. The long-term cognitive task induces a significant decrease in the interhemispheric SCVs and PLVs of beta in central and parietal regions, a significant decrease in the intrahemispheric SCVs and PLVs of beta frequency band at the frontal-parietal and central-parietal, and frontal-central middle electrode pairs, suggesting EEG decreases in cooperative processing, strength of functional coupling, and flux of mutual information exchange in the corresponding inter-and intrahemispheres. However, when the mental fatigue level increases, the interhemispheric PLVs of theta are enhanced in the frontal region and C3-Cz electrode pair, and the intrahemispheric PLVs of theta are heightened at frontal-central middle electrode pairs. PLV and SCV measures could reflect the changes of the phase synchronization and functional coupling of EEG waves from time and frequency domains, which are sensitive to mental fatigue. Therefore, PLVs and SCVs can provide an effective and reliable way to quantify brain response to mental fatigue.

J	Osuagwu, BA; Vuckovic, A				Osuagwu, Bethel. A.; Vuckovic, Aleksandra			Similarities between explicit and implicit motor imagery in mental rotation of hands: An EEG study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Mental rotation; Motor imagery; Sensorimotor cortex; EEG; Source localisation; sLORETA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; ALPHA; PET	Chronometric and imaging studies have shown that motor imagery is used implicitly during mental rotation tasks in which subjects for example judge the laterality of human hand pictures at various orientations. Since explicit motor imagery is known to activate the sensorimotor areas of the cortex, mental rotation is expected to do similar if it involves a form of motor imagery. So far, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have been used to study mental rotation and less attention has been paid to electroencephalogram (EEG) which offers a high time-frequency resolution. The time-frequency analysis is an established method for studying explicit motor imagery. Although hand mental rotation is claimed to involve motor imagery, the time-frequency characteristics of mental rotation have never been compared with those of explicit motor imagery. In this study, time-frequency responses of EEG recorded during explicit motor imagery and during a mental rotation task, inducing implicit motor imagery, were compared. Fifteen right-handed healthy volunteers performed motor imagery of hands in one condition and hand laterality judgement tasks in another while EEG of the whole head was recorded. The hand laterality judgement was the mental rotation task used to induce implicit motor imagery. The time-frequency analysis and sLORETA localisation of the EEG showed that the activities in the sensorimotor areas had similar spatial and time-frequency characteristics in explicit motor imagery and implicit motor imagery conditions. Furthermore this sensorimotor activity was different for the left and for the right hand in both explicit and implicit motor imagery. This result supports that motor imagery is used during mental rotation and that it can be detected and studied with EEG technology. This result should encourage the use of mental rotation of body parts in rehabilitation programmes in a similar manner as motor imagery. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Osuagwu, Bethel.

This study aimed to investigate which areas of the cerebral cortices are associated with the peripheral cardiac autonomic control involved in the CAN in uremic patients with autonomic dysfunction and normal controls. The central and peripheral autonomic network in 19 uremic patients with significant autonomic dysfunction and 24 age-and sex-matched controls [mean age +/- standard deviation (SD), 55.16 +/- 10.45 years and 55.42 +/- 5.42 years, respectively] were evaluated by simultaneous spectral analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography recording (ECG), along with serial autonomic tests [autonomic questionnaire and orthostatic blood pressure (BP) change]. Only frequency-domain heart rate variability (f-HRV) during the deep-breathing stage could differentiate the two groups. Although there is no significant difference in f-HRV during the quiet-breathing stage, different patterns of central oscillation and their correlation with peripheral cardiac autonomic indices could be found for the two groups. Although the power of specific EEG bands under electrode T3 and T6 correlated significantly with the power of peripheral HRV indices in the control group, those under electrodes P3 and Pz had significant correlations in the uremic group suggesting a role of functional connectivity between them. In addition, sympathetic activity is correlated with slow wave EEG (theta/delta) power whereas parasympathetic activity is correlated with fast wave EEG (beta) power. In conclusion, there is functional connectivity between the parietal cortex and the peripheral cardiac autonomic system (PAN) in uremics and the pattern of central autonomic connectivity differs between uremic patients with autonomic dysfunction and normal controls.

Here, we propose a subspace analysis method to elucidate large-scale networks by the joint analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The new approach is based on the notion that the neuroelectrical activity underlying the fMRI signal may have EEG spectral features that report on regional neuronal dynamics and interregional interactions. Applying this approach to resting healthy adults, we indeed found characteristic spectral signatures in the EEG correlates of spontaneous fMRI signals at individual brain regions as well as the temporal synchronization among widely distributed regions. These spectral signatures not only allowed us to parcel the brain into clusters that resembled the brain's established functional subdivision, but also offered important clues for disentangling the involvement of individual regions in fMRI network activity.

Removing artefacts from TMS-EEG recordings using independent component analysis: Importance for assessing prefrontal and motor cortex network properties	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Electroencephalography; Independent component analysis; Artefacts; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Motor cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; EVOKED EEG; BRAIN RESPONSES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RESPONSES; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; INHIBITION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXCITABILITY; POTENTIALS	Introduction: The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is emerging as a powerful tool for causally investigating cortical mechanisms and networks. However, various artefacts contaminate TMS-EEG recordings, particularly over regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of this study was to substantiate removal of artefacts from TMS-EEG recordings following stimulation of the DLPFC and motor cortex using independent component analysis (ICA). Methods: 36 healthy volunteers (30.8 +/- 9 years, 9 female) received 75 single TMS pulses to the left DLPFC or left motor cortex while EEG was recorded from 57 electrodes. A subset of 9 volunteers also received 50 sham pulses. The large TMS artefact and early muscle activity (-2 to similar to 15 ms) were removed using interpolation and the remaining EEG signal was processed in two separate ICA runs using the FastICA algorithm. Five sub-types of TMS-related artefacts were manually identified: remaining muscle artefacts, decay artefacts, blink artefacts, auditory-evoked potentials and other noise-related artefacts. The cause of proposed blink and auditory-evoked potentials was assessed by concatenating known artefacts (i.e. voluntary blinks or auditory-evoked potentials resulting from sham TMS) to the TMS trials before ICA and evaluating grouping of resultant independent components (ICs). Finally, we assessed the effect of removing specific artefact types on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-evoked oscillations. Results: Over DLPFC, ICs from proposed muscle and decay artefacts correlated with TMS-evoked muscle activity size, whereas proposed TMS-evoked blink ICs combined with voluntary blinks and auditory ICs with auditory-evoked potentials from sham TMS. Individual artefact sub-types characteristically distorted each measure of DLPFC function across the scalp. When free of artefact, TEPs and TMS-evoked oscillations could be measured following DLPFC stimulation. Importantly, characteristic TEPs following motor cortex stimulation (N15, P30, N45, P60, N100) could be recovered from artefactual data, corroborating the reliability of ICA-based artefact correction. Conclusions: Various different artefacts contaminate TMS-EEG recordings over the DLPFC and motor cortex. However, these artefacts can be removed with apparent minimal impact on neural activity using ICA, allowing the study of TMS-evoked cortical network properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

They result from a widespread thalamo-cortical loop and involve synchronous cortical networks that are still poorly understood. We investigated whether brain activity during spindles can be characterized by specific patterns of functional connectivity among cortical generators. For that purpose, we developed a wavelet-based approach aimed at imaging the synchronous oscillatory cortical networks from simultaneous MEG-EEG recordings. First, we detected spindles on the EEG and extracted the corresponding frequency-locked MEG activity under the form of an analytic ridge signal in the time-frequency plane (Zerouali et al., 2013). Secondly, we performed source reconstruction of the ridge signal within the Maximum Entropy on the Mean framework (Amblard et al., 2004), yielding a robust estimate of the cortical sources producing observed oscillations. Lastly, we quantified functional connectivity among cortical sources using phase-locking values. The main innovations of this methodology are (1) to reveal the dynamic behavior of functional networks resolved in the time-frequency plane and (2) to characterize functional connectivity among MEG sources through phase interactions. We showed, for the first time, that the switch from fast to slow oscillatory mode during sleep spindles is required for the emergence of specific patterns of connectivity. Moreover, we show that earlier synchrony during spindles was associated with mainly intra-hemispheric connectivity whereas later synchrony was associated with global long-range connectivity. We propose that our methodology can be a valuable tool for studying the connectivity underlying neural processes involving sleep spindles, such as memory, plasticity or aging.

J	Adjamian, P				Adjamian, Peyman			The application of electro- and magneto-encephalography in tinnitus research - methods and interpretations	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						tinnitus; magnetoencephalography; electroencephalography; induced and evoked responses; source localization; top-down processing; functional and effective connectivity	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; RESIDUAL INHIBITION FUNCTIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY	In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate changes in oscillatory brain activity associated with tinnitus with many conflicting results. Current view of the underlying mechanism of tinnitus is that it results from changes in brain activity in various structures of the brain as a consequence of sensory deprivation. This in turn gives rise to increased spontaneous activity and/or synchrony in the auditory centers but also involves modulation from non-auditory processes from structures of the limbic and paralimbic system. Some of the neural changes associated with tinnitus may be assessed non-invasively in human beings with MEG and EEG (M/EEG) in ways, which are superior to animal studies and other non-invasive imaging techniques. However, both MEG and EEG have their limitations and research results can be misinterpreted without appropriate consideration of these limitations. In this article, I intend to provide a brief review of these techniques, describe what the recorded signals reflect in terms of the underlying neural activity, and their strengths and limitations. I also discuss some pertinent methodological issues involved in tinnitus-related studies and conclude with suggestions to minimize possible discrepancies between results. The overall message is that while MEG and EEG are extremely useful techniques, the interpretation of results from tinnitus studies requires much caution given the individual variability in oscillatory activity and the limits of these techniques.

Ictal propagation of high frequency activity is recapitulated in interictal recordings: Effective connectivity of epileptogenic networks recorded with intracranial EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						High frequency oscillations (HFOs); Seizure onset zone; Epileptic network; Epilepsy surgery; Brain mapping; ECoG	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; EVENT-RELATED CAUSALITY; OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; SEIZURE-ONSET; TEMPORAL-LOBE; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; CORTICAL STIMULATION; INFORMATION-FLOW; DENTATE GYRUS; DYNAMICS	Seizures are increasingly understood to arise from epileptogenic networks across which ictal activity is propagated and sustained. In patients undergoing invasive monitoring for epilepsy surgery, high frequency oscillations have been observed within the seizure onset zone during both ictal and interictal intervals. We hypothesized that the patterns by which high frequency activity is propagated would help elucidate epileptogenic networks and thereby identify network nodes relevant for surgical planning. Intracranial EEG recordings were analyzed with a multivariate autoregressive modeling technique (short-time direct directed transfer function-SdDTF), based on the concept of Granger causality, to estimate the directionality and intensity of propagation of high frequency activity (70-175 Hz) during ictal and interictal recordings. These analyses revealed prominent divergence and convergence of high frequency activity propagation at sites identified by epileptologists as part of the ictal onset zone. In contrast, relatively little propagation of this activity was observed among the other analyzed sites. This pattern was observed in both subdural and depth electrode recordings of patients with focal ictal onset, but not in patients with a widely distributed ictal onset. In patients with focal ictal onsets, the patterns of propagation recorded during pre-ictal (up to 5 min immediately preceding ictal onset) and interictal (more than 24 h before and after seizures) intervals were very similar to those recorded during seizures. The ability to characterize epileptogenic networks from interictal recordings could have important clinical implications for epilepsy surgery planning by reducing the need for prolonged invasive monitoring to record spontaneous seizures.

Learned EEG-based brain self-regulation of motor-related oscillations during application of transcranial electric brain stimulation: feasibility and limitations	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-machine interface (BMI) control; motor imagery; EEG; transcranial electric stimulation (TES); stimulation artifacts	INTERFACE BCI SYSTEM; COMPUTER INTERFACE; SKILL ACQUISITION; CHRONIC STROKE; MODULATION; CORTEX; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PLASTICITY; MOVEMENT	Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves motor learning and can affect emotional processing and attention. However, it is unclear whether learned electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) control during tDCS is feasible, how application of transcranial electric currents during BMI control would interfere with feature-extraction of physiological brain signals and how it affects brain control performance. Here we tested this combination and evaluated stimulation-dependent artifacts across different EEG frequencies and stability of motor imagery-based BMI control. Approach: Ten healthy volunteers were invited to two BMI-sessions, each comprising two 60-trial blocks. During the trials, learned desynchronization of mu-rhythms (8-15 Hz) associated with motor imagery (MI) recorded over C4 was translated into online cursor movements on a computer screen. During block 2, either sham (session A) or anodal tDCS (session B) was applied at 1 mA with the stimulation electrode placed 1 cm anterior of C4. Main results: tDCS was associated with a significant signal power increase in the lower frequencies most evident in the signal spectrum of the EEG channel closest to the stimulation electrode. Stimulation-dependent signal power increase exhibited a decay of 12 dB per decade, leaving frequencies above 9 Hz unaffected. Analysis of BMI control performance did not indicate a difference between blocks and tDCS conditions. Conclusion: Application of tDCS during learned EEG-based self-regulation of brain oscillations above 9 Hz is feasible and safe, and might improve applicability of BMI systems.

Nowadays, some portable EEG recording systems are emerged as the peripheral devices to allow people use their EEG to play computer games or control toys, and it was also demonstrated that the single-channel EEG signals recorded by the portable equipment can be used for personal identification. However, unlike multi-electrodes devices for medical use, this kind of portable device will amplify noises introducing by power line interference, poor connection of electrode and eyeball movements. So the key point becomes how to effectively remove artifacts and maximally preserve neural activity to reduce adverse effects on EEG identification system. In this paper, a new time-frequency EEG artifacts removing method is proposed. Experimental results show the better performance of the proposed one comparing with the common used EEMD-ICA method.

The psychophysiological study included healthy men in two models of evoked emotions - anxious apprehension (awaiting of inescapable aversive punishment) and discrete (opposite) emotions. Analysis of self-report, multichannel EEG, galvanic skin response, and cardiovascular reactivity showed that individuals with high IAF are characterized by predominance of parasympathetic infl uences in autonomic regulation circuit, proactive strategies of coping with inescapable threat, higher activity of positive emotional attitude and availability of memory traces about positive experience. Individuals with low IAF demonstrate predominance of sympathetic infl uences and maladaptive avoidance-like coping with inescapable threat and insuffi ciency of positive emotional activation mechanisms. It is suggested that IAF participates in the formation of individual emotional space and strategies of coping with emotional challenges.	[Tumyalis, A. V.; Aftanas, L.

The purpose of the present study was to address this shortcoming. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we found that individuals exhibited reduced cerebral cortical activation and increased attentional reserve when performing in adaptive and neutral team environments as compared with a maladaptive team environment. Additionally, in the adaptive team environment, individuals exhibited superior cognitive-motor task performance relative to neutral and maladaptive team environments. Thus, the results suggest that relative to neutral team environments, maintaining performance in maladaptive team environments comes at the expense of neural and attentional resources, whereas adaptive team environments enhance performance without additional neurophysiological costs.

HFOs usually co-occur with interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and are specific and accurate markers for the epileptic focus, but the brain regions involved when HFOs are generated are unknown. We investigated this question with combined EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measuring the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and examined HFOs in the gamma (40-80Hz) and ripple (80-200Hz) bands. MethodsTwenty-eight consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who underwent HFO and EEG-fMRI studies were selected; six were excluded because of negative EEG-fMRI. The remaining 22 patients were divided into two equal groups (11 patients each) based on the frequency of co-occurrence of gamma or ripples with IEDs: low versus high gamma (LG/HG) and low versus high ripples (LR/HR). ResultsNo significant changes were found in the BOLD characteristics between the LG and HG groups. As a group, HR had a larger IED concordant BOLD cluster than the LR group, despite similar IED rates. In addition, the HR group had significantly more thalamic BOLD changes than the LR group (11/11 vs. 2/11). In HR, 5 of 11 patients had thalamic activation only, 4 of 11 had thalamic deactivation only, and 2 of 11 had activation and deactivation in different thalamic regions. In the LR group, 2 of 11 had thalamic activation. The lateralization of thalamic BOLD responses was concordant with the lateralization of cortical ripples in 12 of 13 patients. SignificanceScalp IEDs, when frequently accompanied by HFOs in the ripple but not in the gamma band, are associated with larger cortical metabolic responses and with thalamic involvement lateralized to the side of cortical ripples. We propose that a high rate of epileptic ripples is associated with a more active pathologic cortical-thalamocortical network.

This has been interpreted as the electrophysiological signature of the automatic monitoring of the surrounding environment while subjects are immersed in self-reflecting mental activities. Although delta BROs were directly correlated to the degree of consciousness impairment in patients with disorders of consciousness, they failed to differentiate vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS). In the present study, we have extended the analysis of BROs to frequency bands other than delta in the attempt to find a biological marker that could support the differential diagnosis between VS/UWS and MCS. Four patients with VS/UWS, 5 patients with MCS, and 12 healthy matched controls (CTRL) underwent standard 19-channels EEG recordings during resting conditions. Three-second-lasting EEG epochs centred on each blink instance were submitted to time-frequency analyses in order to extract the normalized Blink-Related Synchronization/Desynchronization (nBRS/BRD) of three bands of interest (low-alpha, high-alpha and low-beta) in the time-window of 50-550 ms after the blink-peak and to estimate the corresponding cortical sources of electrical activity. VS/UWS nBRS/BRD levels of all three bands were lower than those related to both CTRL and MCS, thus enabling the differential diagnosis between MCS and VS/UWS. Furthermore, MCS showed an intermediate signal intensity on PCC/PCu between CTRL and VS/UWS and a higher signal intensity on the left temporo-parieto-occipital junction and inferior occipito-temporal regions when compared to VS/UWS. This peculiar pattern of activation leads us to hypothesize that resting MCS patients have a bottom-up driven activation of the task positive network and thus are tendentially prone to respond to environmental stimuli, even though in an almost unintentional way.

Study design: Measures of high-density EEG (including cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs)), dipole and current-density analyses, independent component analyses-stacked trials (ICA), inter-trial coherence, and the patient's performance on measures of speech perception were compared for the ear with normal hearing (NH) and the ear with ANSD. Results: Differences were observed between the NH ear and the ear with ANSD for all test measures. Conclusions: Our results suggest that for some patients, 1) congenital ANSD may result in abnormal auditory cortical organization, and 2) neural dys-synchrony in the central auditory system, which characterizes ANSD, may result in a high degree of variability in cortical responses. In this study, cortical auditory activation in ANSD was examined using high-density EEG. Our study also demonstrates use of single-trial and time-frequency EEG analyses in evaluating the effect of neural dys-synchrony on cortical variability in patients with ANSD.

However, it is not possible to identify the directional information flow between distant areas using conventional phase synchronization analyses. In the present study, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the occipital area in subjects who were resting with their eyes closed, and analyzed the spatial propagation of transient TMS-induced phase resetting by using the transfer entropy (TE), to quantify the causal and directional flow of information. The time-frequency EEG analysis indicated that the theta (5 Hz) phase locking factor (PLF) reached its highest value at the distant area (the motor area in this study), with a time lag that followed the peak of the transient PLF enhancements of the TMS-targeted area at the TMS onset. Phase-preservation index (PPI) analyses demonstrated significant phase resetting at the TMS-targeted area and distant area. Moreover, the TE from the TMS-targeted area to the distant area increased clearly during the delay that followed TMS onset. Interestingly, the time lags were almost coincident between the PLF and TE results (152 vs. 165 ms), which provides strong evidence that the emergence of the delayed PLF reflects the causal information flow. Such tendencies were observed only in the higher-intensity TMS condition, and not in the lower-intensity or sham TMS conditions. Thus, TMS may manipulate large-scale causal relationships between brain areas in an intensity-dependent manner. We demonstrated that single-pulse TMS modulated global phase dynamics and directional information flow among synchronized brain networks. Therefore, our results suggest that single-pulse TMS can manipulate both incoming and outgoing information in the TMS-targeted area associated with functional changes.

This new approach allows for improved EEG spatial resolution based on simultaneous fMRI activity measurements. Advanced signal processing and machine learning methods were applied on EEG data acquired simultaneously with fMRI during relaxation training guided by on-line continuous feedback on changing alpha/theta EEG measure. We focused on demonstrating improved EEG prediction of activation in sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala. Our analysis shows that a ridge regression model that is based on time/frequency representation of EEG data from a single electrode, can predict the amygdala related activity significantly better than a traditional theta/alpha activity sampled from the best electrode and about 1/3 of the times, significantly better than a linear combination of frequencies with a pre-defined delay. The far-reaching goal of our approach is to be able to reduce the need for fMRI scanning for probing specific sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala as the basis for brain-training procedures. On the other hand, activity in those regions can be characterized with higher temporal resolution than is obtained by fMRI alone thus revealing additional information about their processing mode.

Characterizing Long Interval Cortical Inhibition over the Time-Frequency Domain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG; STIMULATION; MECHANISMS; DEFICITS; GABA	Objective: Long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) can be recorded from motor and non-motor regions of the cortex through combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG). This study aimed to evaluate additional dimensions of LICI characteristics over an extended time-frequency and spatial domain. This was done by introducing two alternative measures of LICI signal amplitude: the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Hilbert transform (HT). Both approaches estimate signal amplitude not taking into account the phase. In both cases LICI was measured as the difference between the unconditioned and conditioned activity evoked by the test pulse. Finally, we evaluated whether the topographical patterns of single and paired responses differed beyond the expected variations in amplitude. Materials and Methods: LICI was delivered as single and paired pulses to the motor cortex (MC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in 33 healthy subjects with TMS-EEG. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.0001) between the unconditioned and conditioned evoked activity were found for both the DLPFC and MC using both methods (i.e., DFT and HT) after correcting for multiple comparisons in the time-frequency domain. The influence of inhibition was found to be significantly larger in space and time than previously considered. Single and paired conditions differ in intensity, but also in their topographic pattern (i.e., the specific spatiotemporal configuration of active sources). Conclusion: Similar results were found by both DFT and HT. The effect of inhibition across the cortex was also found to be complex and extended. In particular, it was found that LICI may be measured with high sensitivity in areas that were relatively distant from the stimulation site, which may have important practical applications. The analysis presented in this study overcomes some limitations of previous studies and could serve as a key reference for future studies examining TMS-indices of inhibition/excitation in healthy and diseased states.

Semi-automatic sleep EEG scoring based on the hypnospectrogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Sleep EEG; Sleep scoring; Time-frequency analysis; K-means clustering	VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; DELTA	Background: Sleep EEG organization is revealed by sleep scoring, a time-consuming process based on strictly defined visual criteria. New method: We explore the possibility of sleep scoring using the whole-night time-frequency analysis, termed hypnospectrogram, with a computer-assisted K-means clustering method. Results: Hypnograms were derived from 10 whole-night sleep EEG recordings using either standard visual scoring under the Rechtshaffen and Kales criteria or semi-automated analysis of the hypnospectrogram derived from a single EEG electrode. We measured substantial agreement between the two approaches with Cohen's kappa considering all 7 stages at 0.61. Comparison with existing methods: A number of existing automated procedures have reached the level of human inter-rater agreement using the standard criteria. However, our approach offers the scorer the opportunity to exploit the information-rich graphic representation of the whole night sleep upon which the automated method works.

The method, called envelope spatial Fourier independent component analysis (eSFICA), maximizes the spatial and spectral sparseness of Fourier energies of a cortically constrained source current estimate. We compared this method using a simulated data set against 5 other variants of independent component analysis and found that eSF1CA performed on par with its temporal variant, eTFICA, and better than other ICA variants, in characterizing dynamics at time scales of the order of minutes. We then applied eSFICA to real MEG data obtained from 9 subjects during rest. The method identified several networks showing within- and cross-frequency inter-areal functional connectivity profiles which resemble previously reported resting-state networks, such as the bilateral sensorimotor network at similar to 20 Hz, the lateral and medial parieto-occipital sources at similar to 10 Hz, a subset of the default-mode network at similar to 8 and similar to 15 Hz, and lateralized temporal lobe sources at similar to 8 Hz. Finally, we interpreted the estimated networks as spatiospectral filters and applied the filters to obtain the dynamics during a natural stimulus sequence presented to the same 9 subjects. We observed occipital alpha modulation to visual stimuli, bilateral rolandic mu modulation to tactile stimuli and video clips of hands, and the temporal lobe network modulation to speech stimuli, but no modulation of the sources in the default-mode network. We conclude that (1) the proposed method robustly detects inter-areal cross-frequency networks at long time scales, (2) the functional relevance of the resting-state networks can be probed by applying the obtained spatiospectral filters to data from measurements with controlled external stimulation.

From the topographical scalp distributions of delta, theta, alpha, and beta power spectrum can clearly discriminate between the signal when the eyes were open or closed, but it was difficult to distinguish between resting and action states when the eyes were closed. In open eyes condition, the frontal area (Fp1, Fp2) was activated (higher power) in delta and theta bands whilst occipital (O1, O2) and partial (P3, P4, Pz) area of brain was activated alpha band in closed eyes condition. The cross coherence method of time frequency analysis is capable of discrimination between rest and action brain signals in closed eyes condition.	[Almurshedi, A.; Ismail, A.

Loss of sleep spindle frequency deceleration in Obstructive Sleep Apnea	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spindle; EEG; Chirp; OSA; Sleep; Matching pursuit	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MATCHING PURSUIT; TOPOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; BRAIN STRUCTURE; EEG; MEMORY; TIME; DYNAMICS; CORTEX	Objective: Sleep spindles have been suggested as surrogates of thalamo-cortical activity. Internal frequency modulation within a spindle's time frame has been demonstrated in healthy subjects, showing that spindles tend to decelerate their frequency before termination. We investigated internal frequency modulation of slow and fast spindles according to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity and brain topography. Methods: Seven non-OSA subjects and 21 patients with OSA contributed with 30 min of Non-REM sleep stage 2, subjected to a Matching pursuit procedure with Gabor chirplet functions for automatic detection of sleep spindles and quantification of sleep spindle internal frequency modulation (chirp rate). Results: Moderate OSA patients showed an inferior percentage of slow spindles with deceleration when compared to Mild and Non-OSA groups in frontal and parietal regions. In parietal regions, the percentage of slow spindles with deceleration was negatively correlated with global apnea-hypopnea index (r(s) = -0.519, p = 0.005). Discussion: Loss of physiological sleep spindle deceleration may either represent a disruption of thalamocortical loops generating spindle oscillations or some compensatory mechanism, an interesting venue for future research in the context of cognitive dysfunction in OSA. Significance: Quantification of internal frequency modulation (chirp rate) is proposed as a promising approach to advance description of sleep spindle dynamics in brain pathology.

A Nonlinear Generalization of Spectral Granger Causality	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); frequency response function (FRF); Granger causality; nonlinear systems; spectral analysis	DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; FREQUENCY-RESPONSE; TIME-SERIES; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORK; DOMAIN; EEG	Spectral measures of linear Granger causality have been widely applied to study the causal connectivity between time series data in neuroscience, biology, and economics. Traditional Granger causality measures are based on linear autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) inputs models of time series data, which cannot truly reveal nonlinear effects in the data especially in the frequency domain. In this study, it is shown that the classical Geweke's spectral causality measure can be explicitly linked with the output spectra of corresponding restricted and unrestricted time-domain models. The latter representation is then generalized to nonlinear bivariate signals and for the first time nonlinear causality analysis in the frequency domain. This is achieved by using the nonlinear ARX (NARX) modeling of signals, and decomposition of the recently defined output frequency response function which is related to the NARX model.

Low- and High-Frequency Oscillations Reveal Distinct Absence Seizure Networks	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; WAG/RIJ RATS; EEG-FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; BOLD RESPONSE; BRAIN; ACTIVATION	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency-dependent, spatiotemporal involvement of corticothalamic networks to the generation of absence seizures. Methods: Magnetoencephalography recordings were obtained in 12 subjects (44 seizures) with untreated childhood absence seizures. Time-frequency analysis of each seizure was performed to determine bandwidths with significant power at ictal onset. Source localization was then completed to determine brain regions contributing to generalized spike and wave discharges seen on electroencephalogram. Results: Significant power in the time-frequency analysis was seen within 1 to 20Hz, 20 to 70Hz, and 70 to 150Hz bandwidths. Source localization revealed that sources localized to the frontal cortex similarly for the low-and gamma-frequency bandwidths, whereas at the low-frequency bandwidth (3-20Hz) significantly more sources localized to the parietal cortex (odds ratio [ OR] = 16.7). Cortical sources within the high-frequency oscillation (HFO) bandwidth (70-150Hz) localized primarily to the frontal region compared to the parietal (OR = 7.32) or temporal (OR = 2.78) areas. Interpretation: Neuromagnetic activity within frontal and parietal cortical regions provides further confirmation of hemodynamic changes reported using functional magnetic resonance imaging that have been associated with absence seizures. The frequency-dependent nature of these networks has not previously been reported, and the presence of HFOs during absence seizures is a novel finding. Co-occurring frontal and parietal corticothalamic networks may interact to produce a pathological state that contributes to the generation of spike and wave discharges. The clinical and pathophysiological implications of HFOs within the frontal cortical region are unclear and should be further investigated.

Here, we investigated the effects of cognition enhancers (donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine, galantamine and memantine), which are approved for symptomatic treatment of dementia, on EEG oscillations and network connectivity in conscious rats chronically instrumented with epidural electrodes in different cortical areas. Next, EEG network indices of cognitive impairments with the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine were modeled. Lastly, we examined the efficacy of cognition enhancers to normalize those aberrant oscillations. Cognition enhancers elicited systematic ("fingerprint") enhancement of cortical slow theta (4.5 - 6 Hz) and gamma (30.5-50 Hz) oscillations correlated with lower activity levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a compact cluster that corresponds to shared underlying mechanisms as compared to different drug classes. Functional network connectivity revealed consistent elevated coherent slow theta activity in parieto-occipital and between interhemispheric cortical areas. In rats instrumented with depth hippocampal CA1-CA3 electrodes, donepezil elicited similar oscillatory and coherent activities in cortico-hippocampal networks. When combined with scopolamine, the cognition enhancers attenuated the leftward shift in coherent slow delta activity. Such a consistent shift in EEG coherence into slow oscillations associated with altered slow theta and gamma oscillations may underlie cognitive deficits in scopolamine-treated animals, whereas enhanced coherent slow theta and gamma activity may be a relevant mechanism by which cognition enhancers exert their beneficial effect on plasticity and cognitive processes. The findings underscore that PCA and network connectivity are valuable tools to assess efficacy of novel therapeutic drugs with cognition enhancing potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Intrinsic and Evoked EEG Dynamics	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Ultrasound; Neuromodulation; Oscillations; Phase; Electroencephalography (EEG)	MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; CORTEX	Background: The integration of EEG recordings and transcranial neuromodulation has provided a useful construct for noninvasively investigating the modification of human brain circuit activity. Recent evidence has demonstrated that focused ultrasound can be targeted through the human skull to affect the amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials and its associated spectral content. Objective/hypothesis: The present study tests whether focused ultrasound transmitted through the human skull and targeted to somatosensory cortex can affect the phase and phase rate of cortical oscillatory dynamics. Methods: A computational model was developed to gain insight regarding the insertion behavior of ultrasound induced pressure waves in the human head. The instantaneous phase and phase rate of EEG recordings before, during, and after transmission of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to human somatosensory cortex were examined to explore its effects on phase dynamics. Results: Computational modeling results show the skull effectively reinforces the focusing of tFUS due to curvature of material interfaces. Neurophysiological recordings show that tFUS alters the phase distribution of intrinsic brain activity for beta frequencies, but not gamma. This modulation was accompanied by a change in phase rate of both beta and gamma frequencies. Additionally, tFUS modulated phase distributions in the beta band of early sensory-evoked activity but did not affect late sensory-evoked activity, lending support to the spatial specificity of tFUS for neuromodulation. This spatial specificity was confirmed through an additional experiment where the ultrasound transducer was moved 1 cm laterally from the original cortical target. Conclusions: Focused ultrasonic energy can alter EEG oscillatory dynamics through local mechanical perturbation of discrete cortical circuits. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Multi-subject EEG source imaging studies that apply Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to data concatenated across subjects have overlooked the fact that projections to the scalp sensors from functionally equivalent cortical sources vary from subject to subject. This study demonstrates an approach to spatiotemporal independent component decomposition and alignment that spatially co-registers the MR-derived cortical topographies of individual subjects to a well-defined, shared spherical topology (Fischl et al., 1999). Its efficacy for identifying functionally equivalent EEG sources in multi-subject analysis is demonstrated by analyzing EEG and behavioral data from a stop-signal paradigm using two source-imaging approaches, both based on individual subject independent source decompositions. The first, two-stage approach uses temporal infomax ICA to separate each subject's data into temporally independent components (ICs), then estimates the source density distribution of each IC process from its scalp map and clusters similar sources across subjects (Makeig et al., 2002). The second approach, Electromagnetic Spatiotemporal Independent Component Analysis (EMSICA), combines ICA decomposition and source current density estimation of the artifact-rejected data into a single spatiotemporal ICA decomposition for each subject (Tsai et al., 2006), concurrently identifying both the spatial source distribution of each cortical source and its event-related dynamics. Applied to the stop-signal task data, both approaches gave IC clusters that separately accounted for EEG processes expected in stop-signal tasks, including pre/ postcentral mu rhythms, anterior-cingulate theta rhythm, and right-inferior frontal responses, the EMSICA clusters exhibiting more tightly correlated source areas and time-frequency features.

Resting-state EEG theta activity and risk learning: sensitivity to reward or punishment?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Resting-state EEG; Theta/beta ratio; Decision-making; Reinforcement learning; Reward-punishment sensitivity	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; DECISION-MAKING; STIMULANT MEDICATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; ASYMMETRY; DOPAMINE; FUTURE; CORTEX; HYPERSENSITIVITY	Increased theta (4-7 Hz)-beta.(13-30 Hz) power ratio in resting state electroencephalography (EEG) has been associated with risky disadvantageous decision making and with impaired reinforcement learning. However, the specific contributions of theta and beta power in risky decision making remain unclear. The first aim of the present study was to replicate the earlier found relationship and examine the specific contributions of theta and beta power in risky decision making using the Iowa Gambling Task. The second aim of the study was to examine whether the relation were associated with differences in reward or punishment sensitivity. We replicated the earlier found relationship by showing a positive association between theta/beta ratio and risky decision making. This correlation Was mainly driven by theta oscillations. Furthermore, theta power correlated with reward motivated learning, but not with punishment learning. The present results replicate and extend earlier findings by providing novel insights into the relation between thetabeta ratios and risky decision making. Specifically, findings show that resting-state theta activity is correlated with reinforcement learning, and that this association may be explained by differences in reward sensitivity.

Modafinil augments oscillatory power in middle frequencies during rule selection	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Prefrontal cortex; Cognitive control; Oscillations; Theta; Modafinil; Rule selection	INTERNEURON DIVERSITY SERIES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOCUS-COERULEUS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; CONTROL MECHANISMS; EEG ACTIVITY	Control-related cognitive processes are associated with cortical oscillations and modulated by catecholamine neurotransmitters. It remains unclear how catecholamine systems modulate control-related oscillations. We tested modafinil effects on rule-related 4-30 Hz oscillations, with double-blind, placebo-controlled (within-subjects) testing of 22 healthy adults, using EEG during cognitive control task performance. EEG data underwent time-frequency decomposition with Morlet wavelets to determine power of 4-30 Hz oscillations. Modafinil enhanced oscillatory power associated with high-control rule selection in theta, alpha, and beta ranges, with a frontotemporal topography and minimal effects during rule maintenance. Augmentation of catecholamine signaling enhances middle-frequency cortical oscillatory power associated with rule selection, which may subserve diverse subcomponent processes in proactive cognitive control.

However, the adoption of this approach to human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been more limited, despite the ability of this methodology to quantify canonical neuronal processes. Here, we provide evidence that theta band activities over the midfrontal cortex appear to reflect a common computation used for realizing the need for cognitive control. Moreover, by virtue of inherent properties of field oscillations, these theta band processes may be used to communicate this need and subsequently implement such control across disparate brain regions. Thus, frontal theta is a compelling candidate mechanism by which emergent processes, such as 'cognitive control', may be biophysically realized.

However, varying temporal and topographical patterns have emerged, possibly due to varying arousal levels of the stimuli. In addition, recent studies suggest neural oscillations in delta, theta, alpha, and beta-band frequencies play a functional role in information processing in the brain. This study implemented a data-driven PCA based analysis investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of electroencephalographic delta, theta, alpha, and beta-band frequencies during an implicit visual threat processing task. While controlling for the arousal dimension (the intensity of emotional activation), we found several spatial and temporal differences for threatening compared to nonthreatening visual images. We detected an early posterior increase in theta power followed by a later frontal increase in theta power, greatest for the threatening condition. There was also a consistent left lateralized beta desynchronization for the threatening condition. Our results provide support for a dynamic corticolimbic network, with theta and beta band activity indexing processes pivotal in visual threat processing. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Lei, X; Wang, YL; Yuan, H; Mantini, D				Lei, Xu; Wang, Yulin; Yuan, Hong; Mantini, Dante			Neuronal Oscillations and Functional Interactions Between Resting State Networks: Effects of Alcohol Intoxication	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						functional connectivity; alcohol; anti-correlated networks; simultaneous EEG-fMRI	DEFAULT MODE; EEG/FMRI ANALYSIS; BRAIN NETWORKS; EEG-ALPHA; MRI DATA; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNAL; FLUCTUATIONS	Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies showed that resting state activity in the healthy brain is organized into multiple large-scale networks encompassing distant regions. A key finding of resting state fMRI studies is the anti-correlation typically observed between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), whichduring task performanceare activated and deactivated, respectively. Previous studies have suggested that alcohol administration modulates the balance of activation/deactivation in brain networks, as well as it induces significant changes in oscillatory activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, our knowledge of alcohol-induced changes in band-limited EEG power and their potential link with the functional interactions between DAN and DMN is still very limited. Here we address this issue, examining the neuronal effects of alcohol administration during resting state by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Our findings show increased EEG power in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) after administration of alcohol compared to placebo, which was prominent over the frontal cortex. More interestingly, increased frontal tonic EEG activity in this band was associated with greater anti-correlation between the DAN and the frontal component of the DMN. Furthermore, EEG theta power and DAN-DMN anti-correlation were relatively greater in subjects who reported a feeling of euphoria after alcohol administration, which may result from a diminished inhibition exerted by the prefrontal cortex. Overall, our findings suggest that slow brain rhythms are responsible for dynamic functional interactions between brain networks.

In this paper, we analyze a scalp Electro Encephalogram (EEG) database of 33 human subjects during the cognitive activity of Meditation, specifically Kriya Yoga. The information measures such as Renyi, Shannon entropies and Relative Energy of the different EEG Bands such as Alpha, Beta, & delta of scalp EEG captured at specific electrodes are calculated for all subjects for the entire duration of Meditation. These frequency domain parameters are obtained as sequences corresponding to the dynamical activity of Meditation and are found to have a hidden dominant trend with many variations present which make the problem of Identification of the dominant trend a difficult problem. Here use of a data driven optimal filter has been employed to find out the dominant trend, and found to yield a clear monotonic change in the frequency parameters. This monotonic sequence can easily assumed to be corresponding to the dynamic activity during Meditation.

However, mechanisms underpinning the emergence of scalp fast oscillations, and whether they differ from those of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs), are yet to be understood. The visibility of cortical electric activity on scalp EEG recordings is dependent on two factors: the characteristics of the cortical generator and the background level. We studied this issue using scalp EEG recordings and detailed simulations, with a finite element model including 8 million elements and 8 different tissues. We observed an almost linear relationship between the amplitude of scalp electric potential and the extent of the generator on the cortex. However, this relationship is subject to substantial variability, with variations in factors greater than 3 occurring simply by changing the location on the cortex of generators of fixed extent. In addition, we showed that the background power in scalp EEG recordings decreases at higher frequency bands, being inversely proportional to a power of 2.5 of the frequency. In the specific case of fast oscillations, they can be detected within the lower noise level of the ripple band (80-200 Hz) even though their median amplitude on scalp EEG recordings is more than 10 times smaller than IEDs and consistent with cortical generators of approximately 1 cm(2). In conclusion, the physics governing the propagation of electrical activity from the brain to the scalp are consistent with the hypothesis that scalp fast oscillations and intracranial high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz) are expressions of common generators. Given the potential role of HFOs as biomarkers in epilepsy, the possibility to obtain some of the associated information from scalp EEG is of high clinical significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Recent research has also shown that elements of RSA described by high-frequency and nonoscillatory properties are non-random and functionally relevant. Motivated by this research, we investigated nonoscillatory aspects of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) RSA using a novel method for characterizing subtle fluctuation dynamics. The metric that we develop quantifies the relative variance of the amplitude of local-maxima and local-minima in a BOLD time course (amplitude variance asymmetry; AVA). This metric reveals new properties of RSA activity, without relying on connectivity as a descriptive tool. We applied the AVA analysis to data from 3 different participant groups (2 adults, 1 child) collected from 3 different centers. The analyses show that AVA patterns a) identify 3 types of RSA profiles in adults sensory systems b) differ in topology and pattern of dynamics in adults and children, and c) are stable across magnetic resonance scanners. Furthermore, children with higher IQ demonstrated more adult-like AVA patterns. These findings indicate that AVA reflects important and novel dimensions of brain development and RSA.

Over the last decade, theories emphasizing cortical dysfunction have received increasing attention to explain the heterogeneous symptoms experienced in SCZ. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation that is particularly suited to probing the fidelity of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in conscious humans. In this study, we review the contribution of TMS in assessing inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations and their long-range connections in SCZ. In addition, we discuss insights from combined TMS and electroencephalography into the functional consequences of impaired excitation/inhibition on cortical oscillations in SCZ.

We analyzed non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from able- bodied volunteers who participated in a robot-assisted gait-training experiment. To enable functional neuroimaging during walking, we applied source modeling to high-density (120 channels) EEG recordings using individual anatomy reconstructed from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. First, we analyzed amplitude differences between the conditions, walking and upright standing. Second, we investigated amplitude modulations related to the gait phase. During active walking upper mu (10-12 Hz) and beta (18-30 Hz) oscillations were suppressed [event-related desynchronization (ERD)] compared to upright standing. Significant beta ERD activity was located focally in central sensorimotor areas for 9/10subjects. Additionally, we found that low gamma (24-40 Hz) amplitudes were modulated related to the gait phase. Because there is a certain frequency band overlap between sustained beta ERD and gait phase related modulations in the low gamma range, these two phenomena are superimposed. Thus, we observe gait phase related amplitude modulations at a certain ERD level. We conclude that sustained mu and beta ERD reflect a movement related state change of cortical excitability while gait phase related modulations in the low gamma represent the motion sequence timing during gait. Interestingly, the center frequencies of sustained beta ERD and gait phase modulated amplitudes were identified to be different. They may therefore be caused by different neuronal rhythms, which should be taken under consideration in future studies.

The neural mechanism of this phenomenon may help to clarify the determinants of decision-making. In this study, thirty-nine young adults finished a risky gambling task by choosing between a high- and a low-risk option in each trial during electroencephalographic data collection. We found that risk-taking strategies significantly modulated mean amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) component P3, particularly at the central scalp. The event-related spectral perturbation and the inter-trial coherence measurements of the independent component analysis (ICA) data indicated that the "stay" vs. "switch" electrophysiological difference associated with subsequent decision-making was mainly due to fronto-central theta and left/right mu independent components. Event-related cross-coherence results suggested that the neural information of action monitoring and updating emerged in the fronto-central cortex and propagated to sensorimotor area for further behavior adjustment. Based on these findings of ERP and event-related oscillation (ERO) measures, we propose a neural model of the influence of current outcomes on future decisions.

The present study was designed to detect high-frequency brain signals in the developing brain using newly developed magnetoencephalography (MEG) methods. Twenty healthy children were studied with a high-sampling rate MEG system. Functional high-frequency brain signals were evoked by electrical stimulation applied to the index fingers. To determine if the highf-requency neuromagnetic signals are true brain responses in high-frequency range, we analyzed the MEG data using the conventional averaging as well as newly developed time-frequency analysis along with beamforming. The data of healthy children showed that very high-frequency brain signals (>1000 Hz) in the somatosensory cortex in the developing brain could be detected and localized using MEG. The amplitude of very high-frequency brain signals was significantly weaker than that of the low-frequency brain signals. Very high-frequency brain signals showed a much earlier latency than those of a low-frequency. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) revealed that a portion of the high-frequency signals was from the somatosensory cortex, another portion of the high-frequency signals was probably from the thalamus. Our results provide evidence that the developing brain generates high-frequency signals that can be detected with the non-invasive technique of MEG. MEG detection of high-frequency brain signals may open a new window for the study of developing brain function.

This phenomenon is traditionally explained by forward models of sensory action-outcome, which arise from motor processing. Although these forward models critically predict anticipatory modulation of sensory neural processing, neurophysiological evidence for anticipatory modulation is sparse and has not been linked to perceptual data showing sensory attenuation. By combining a psychophysical task involving contrast discrimination with source-level time-frequency analysis of MEG data, we demonstrate that the amplitude of alpha-oscillations in visual cortex is enhanced before the onset of a visual stimulus when the identity and onset of the stimulus are controlled by participants' motor actions. Critically, this prestimulus enhancement of alpha-amplitude is paralleled by psychophysical judgments of a reduced contrast for this stimulus. We suggest that alpha-oscillations in visual cortex preceding self-generated visual stimulation are a likely neurophysiological signature of motor-induced sensory anticipation and mediate sensory attenuation. We discuss our results in relation to proposals that attribute generic inhibitory functions to alpha-oscillations in prioritizing and gating sensory information via top-down control.

Adaptive Multiscale Time-Frequency Analysis	SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF BIO-/NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article; Book Chapter							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; PHASE-LOCKING; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Time-frequency analysis techniques are now adopted as standard in many applied fields, such as bio-informatics and bioengineering, to reveal frequency-specific and time-locked event-related information of input data. Most standard time-frequency techniques, however, adopt fixed basis functions to represent the input data and are thus suboptimal. To this cause, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm has shown considerable prowess in the analysis of nonstationary data as it offers a fully data-driven approach to signal processing. Recent multivariate extensions of the EMD algorithm, aimed at extending the framework for signals containing multiple channels, are even more pertinent in many real world scenarios where multichannel signals are commonly obtained, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. In this chapter, the multivariate extensions of EMD are reviewed and it is shown how these extensions can be used to alleviate the long-standing problems associated with the standard (univariate) EMD algorithm. The ability of the multivariate extensions of EMD as a powerful real world data analysis tool is demonstrated via simulations on biomedical signals.

This paper designed two neuromuscular activity paradigms of hand movement, i.e. static gripping task and dynamic finger moving task. The electroencephalography (EEG) from C3 and C4 channels and the surface electromyography (sEMG) from the flexor digitorum superficialis were collected simultaneously from 4 male and 4 female right-handed healthy young subjects. For the static griping task, CMCs during low-level forces under 4%, 8%, and 16% MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) were investigated by using magnitude squared coherence calculated from EEGs and sEMGs. For the dynamic finger moving task, the time-frequency domain analysis was used to process dynamic data of temporary action in a period of 2 seconds and get the latency of the maximum CMC. The results of this study indicated that the force increasing within the low-level range in static task is associated with the enhanced CMC. The maximum amplitude of CMC occurred about 0.3-0.5s after the onset of hand movement. Subjects showed significant CMC performance both in static and dynamic task of hand movement.

Compensation mechanisms counteract synaptic loss and prevent the catastrophic amnesia induced by synaptic loss via maintaining the activity levels of neural circuits. Here we investigate the interplay between various synaptic degeneration and compensation mechanisms, and abnormal cortical oscillations based on a large-scale network model consisting of 100,000 neurons exhibiting several cortical firing patterns, 8.5 million synapses, short-term plasticity, axonal delays and receptor kinetics. The structure of the model is inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. The results of the modelling study suggest that cortical oscillations respond differently to compensation mechanisms. Local compensation preserves the baseline activity of theta (5-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations whereas delta (1-4 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations are maintained via global compensation. Applying compensation mechanisms independently shows greater effects than combining both compensation mechanisms in one model and applying them in parallel. Consequently, it can be speculated that enhancing local compensation might recover the neural processes and cognitive functions that are associated with theta and alpha oscillations whereas inducing global compensation might contribute to the repair of neural (cognitive) processes which are associated with delta and beta band activity. Compensation mechanisms may vary across cortical regions and the activation of inappropriate compensation mechanism in a particular region may fail to recover network dynamics and/or induce secondary pathological changes in the network.

This study aims to reveal the abnormal amplitude dynamics of electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations in schizophrenia patients on multiple time scales. EEGs were recorded from schizophrenia patients (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 16) while they were at resting state with eyes closed, at resting state with eyes open, and at watching video. Detrended fluctuation analysis and measures of life-time and waiting-time were used to characterize the abnormal dynamics of EEG oscillations on both long (1-20 s) and short (<= 1 s) time scales. Abnormal dynamics of EEG oscillations in alpha and beta bands were observed. In particular, compared with healthy controls, schizophrenia patients have smaller DFA exponent (implying weaker long-range temporal correlation) in the left fronto-temporal area and smaller DFA exponent, smaller life-time (indicating shorter oscillation burst), and smaller waiting-time in the occipital area in beta band at resting state with eyes open. In addition, schizophrenia patients have larger DFA exponent, larger life-time, and larger waiting-time at some clustered channels in the temporo-parietal area in alpha band at watching video. The present results provide new insights for cognitive deficits and the underlying neuronal dysfunction in schizophrenia.

J	Chand, GB; Dhamala, M				Chand, Ganesh B.; Dhamala, Mukesh			Spectral factorization-based current source density analysis of ongoing neural oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Spontaneous neural oscillations; Neural current sources; Local field potentials; Evoked brain activity; Induced brain activity; Electrophysiological recordings	MULTIVARIATE STOCHASTIC PROCESSES; ANURAN CEREBELLUM; PREDICTION THEORY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Background: Current source density (CSD) analysis is widely used in neurophysiological investigations intended to reveal the patterns of localized neuronal activity in terms of current sources and sinks. CSD is based on the second spatial derivatives of multi-electrode electrophysiological recordings, and can be applied to brain activity related to repeated external stimulations (evoked brain activity) or ongoing (spontaneous) brain activity. In evoked brain activity, event-related time-series averages of ensembles are used to compute CSD patterns. However, for ongoing neural activity, the lack of external events requires a different approach other than ensemble averaging. New method: Here, we propose a new spectral factorization-based current source density (SF-CSD) analysis method for ongoing neural oscillations. Results: We validated this new SF-CSD analysis method using simulated data and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying to experimental intra-cortical local field potentials recorded on multi-contact depth electrodes from monkeys performing selective visual attention tasks. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method gives space-unbiased estimates since it does not rely on a reference for CSD calculation in the frequency-domain. Conclusion: The proposed SF-CSD method is expected to be a useful tool for systematic analysis of neural sources and oscillations from multi-site electrophysiological recordings.

Wavelet-Based Localization of Oscillatory Sources From Magnetoencephalography Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electrophysiological imaging; epilepsy; inverse problem; magnetoencephalography (MEG); maximum entropy on the mean (MEM); wavelet representation	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MAXIMUM STATISTICAL ENTROPY; BIOMAGNETIC INVERSE PROBLEM; HUMAN BRAIN; EPILEPTIC PATIENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG; MEG; RECONSTRUCTION	Transient brain oscillatory activities recorded with Eelectroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) are characteristic features in physiological and pathological processes. This study is aimed at describing, evaluating, and illustrating with clinical data a new method for localizing the sources of oscillatory cortical activity recorded by MEG. The method combines time-frequency representation and an entropic regularization technique in a common framework, assuming that brain activity is sparse in time and space. Spatial sparsity relies on the assumption that brain activity is organized among cortical parcels. Sparsity in time is achieved by transposing the inverse problem in the wavelet representation, for both data and sources. We propose an estimator of the wavelet coefficients of the sources based on the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) principle. The full dynamics of the sources is obtained from the inverse wavelet transform, and principal component analysis of the reconstructed time courses is applied to extract oscillatory components. This methodology is evaluated using realistic simulations of single-trial signals, combining fast and sudden discharges (spike) along with bursts of oscillating activity.

The proposed method applies the relationship between EEG activity and the Egogram. The EEG senses a single point and records readings by means of a dry-type. sensor and a number of electrodes. The EEG analysis adapts the feature mining and the clustering on EEG patterns using a self-organizing map (SOM). EEG activity of the prefrontal cortex displays individual difference. To take the individual difference into account, we construct a feature vector for input modality of the SOM. The input vector for the SOM consists of the extracted EEG feature vector and a human character vector, which is the human character quantified through the ego analysis using psychological testing. In preprocessing, we extract the EEG feature vector by calculating the time average on each frequency band: 0, low-,0, and high-,0. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments using real EEG data. These results show that the accuracy rate of the EEG pattern classification is higher than it was before improvement of the input vector.

An interictal EEG spectral metric for temporal lobe epilepsy lateralization	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Partial epilepsy; Synchronization; Epilepsy surgery	SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES	Objective: Visually-obvious abnormalities in the resting baseline EEG slowing, spiking and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) - are cardinal, though incompletely understood, features of the seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy. We hypothesized that evidence of cortical network dysfunction in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) would persist in the absence of visually-classifiable abnormalities in the baseline EEG recorded within the conventional passband, and that metrics of such dysfunction could serve as a lateralizing diagnostic in TLE. Methods: Epochs of resting EEG without significant abnormalities in light sleep over several days were compared between a group of 10 patients with proven TLE and 10 subjects without epilepsy. A novel laterality metric computed from the line length of normalized power spectra from the temporal channels was compared between the two groups. Results: Significant group differences in spectral line length laterality metric were found between the TLE and control group. At the individual level, seven of 10 TLE patients had highly significant laterality metrics, all concordant with the known laterality of their disease. Significance: Detailed spectral analysis offers novel insight into TLE network behavior, independent of the orthodox abnormalities of EEG slowing, spikes or HFOs. The results may be deployed in a practical diagnostic manner, offer insight into the EEG manifestations of disordered cellular network architecture in TLE, and maybe understood through simple analogy with the theory of linear time-invariant physical systems.

We applied a previously proposed algorithm for the detection of such events and investigated their incidence and frequency in baseline and recovery sleep after 40h of sustained wakefulness in 27 healthy young subjects. The changes in oscillatory events induced by sleep deprivation were compared to the corresponding spectral changes. Both approaches revealed, on average, an increase in low frequency activity and a decrease in spindle activity after sleep deprivation. However, the increase of oscillatory events in the delta range and decrease in the sigma range occurred in a more restricted frequency range compared to spectral changes. The mean relative power spectra showed a significant increase in theta and alpha activity after sleep deprivation while, on average, the event analysis showed only a weak effect in the theta band. The reason for this discrepancy is that the spectral analysis does not distinguish between diffuse activity and clearly visible temporally localized oscillations, while the event analysis would detect only the latter. Additionally, only a few individuals clearly showed activity in the theta or alpha frequency bands. Conversely, event analysis revealed that some individuals showed an increased rate of sleep spindles after sleep deprivation, a fact that was not evident in the relative power spectra due to a decrease in background activity. The two methods complement each other and facilitate the interpretation of distinct changes induced by prolonged wakefulness in sleep EEG.

Despite its efficiency, a potential problem is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition accuracy due to their lack of features from the real electro-encephalo-gram (EEG) data. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with EEG data from 10 healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs.

Detection of emotions in Parkinson's disease using higher order spectral features from brain's electrical activity	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion recognition; Parkinson's disease; Bispectrum; Support vector machine	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; EEG; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; PERCEPTION; DIAGNOSIS	Objective: Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) involving cognition and emotion have been progressively receiving more attention in recent times. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system, can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This paper presents a computational framework for classifying PD patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using emotional information from the brain's electrical activity. Approach: Emotional EEG data were obtained from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender- and education level-matched controls by inducing the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust using multimodal (audio and visual) stimuli. In addition, participants were asked to report their subjective affect. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, we utilized higher order spectral features (specifically, bispectrum) for analysis. Two different classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to investigate the performance of the HOS based features to classify each of the six emotional states of PD patients compared to HC. Ten-fold cross-validation method was used for testing the reliability of the classifier results. Main results: From the experimental results with our EEG data set, we found that (a) classification performance of bispectrum features across ALL frequency bands is better than individual frequency bands in both the groups using SVM classifier; (b) higher frequency band plays a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency band; and (c) PD patients showed emotional impairments compared to HC, as demonstrated by a lower classification performance, particularly for negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust). Significance: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying EEG features with machine learning techniques to classify the each emotional state difference of PD patients compared to HC, and offer a promising approach for detection of emotional impairments associated with other neurological disorders.

Relationship between delta power and the electrocardiogram-derived cardiopulmonary spectrogram: possible implications for assessing the effectiveness of sleep	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Delta power; Sleep spectrogram; High frequency coupling; Correlation; Sleep effectiveness; NREM slow oscillation	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW-WAVE MAGNITUDE; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; HUMANS; HOMEOSTASIS; DEPRIVATION; OSCILLATION; RESTRICTION; HEALTH; STATES	Objectives: The physiologic relationship between slow-wave activity (SWA) (0-4 Hz) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and high-frequency (0.1-0.4 Hz) cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) sleep spectrograms is not known. Because high-frequency CPC appears to be a biomarker of stable sleep, we tested the hypothesis that that slow-wave EEG power would show a relatively fixed-time relationship to periods of high-frequency CPC. Furthermore, we speculated that this correlation would be independent of conventional nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages. Methods: We analyzed selected datasets from an archived polysomnography (PSG) database, the Sleep Heart Health Study I (SHHS-I). We employed the cross-correlation technique to measure the degree of which 2 signals are correlated as a function of a time lag between them. Correlation analyses between high-frequency CPC and delta power (computed both as absolute and normalized values) from 3150 subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of <= 5 events per hour of sleep were performed. Results: The overall correlation (r) between delta power and high-frequency coupling (HFC) power was 0.40 +/- 0.18 (P = .001). Normalized delta power provided improved correlation relative to absolute delta power. Correlations were somewhat reduced in the second half relative to the first half of the night (r = 0.45 +/- 0.20 vs r = 0.34 +/- 0.23). Correlations were only affected by age in the eighth decade. There were no sex differences and only small racial or ethnic differences were noted. Conclusions: These results support a tight temporal relationship between slow wave power, both within and outside conventional slow wave sleep periods, and high frequency cardiopulmonary coupling, an ECG-derived biomarker of "stable'' sleep. These findings raise mechanistic questions regarding the cross-system integration of neural and cardiopulmonary control during sleep. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

De Vico			Human Brain Distinctiveness Based on EEG Spectral Coherence Connectivity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biometrics; electroencephalography (EEG); match score fusion; resting state; spectral coherence	HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERSON IDENTIFICATION; TEMPORAL STABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNATURES; NETWORKS; ALPHA; PHASE	The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition, has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of the current analyses rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain regions, like power spectrum estimation, thus neglecting possible temporal dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses spectral coherence-based connectivity between different brain regions as a possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large dataset of subjects (N = 108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting state conditions. The obtained recognition performance shows that using brain connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.5% is obtained in EC (96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from parieto-occipital (centro-parietal in EO) regions. Taken together, these results suggest that the functional connectivity patterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric systems.

Here, using electroencephalography, we provide further evidence for coupling between prefrontal theta and parietal gamma during successful memory retrieval in the human brain. In a pictorial recognition task, the coupling between prefrontal theta phase and parietal gamma amplitude was quantified using the modulation index, 100-1500 ms after stimulus onset. Results show an increased coupling for remembered, as opposed to forgotten and new stimuli (i.e. a "recognition effect" and an "old/new effect"). Phase-amplitude coupling between the prefrontal theta phase and posterior gamma amplitudes is hypothesized to reflect long range communication between prefrontal control processes and the activation of posterior object representations accompanying mnemonic processing.

Unsupervised classification of neocortical activity patterns in neonatal and pre-juvenile rodents	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						development; principal component analysis; network oscillations; synchrony; high-frequency oscillations; prefrontal cortex	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPINDLE BURSTS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; MATURATION; SWITCH; WAVES; HZ	Flexible communication within the brain, which relies on oscillatory activity, is not confined to adult neuronal networks. Experimental evidence has documented the presence of discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity already during early development. Their highly variable spatial and time-frequency organization has been related to region specificity. However, it might be equally due to the absence of unitary criteria for classifying the early activity patterns, since they have been mainly characterized by visual inspection. Therefore, robust and unbiased methods for categorizing these discontinuous oscillations are needed for increasingly complex data sets from different labs. Here, we introduce an unsupervised detection and classification algorithm for the discontinuous activity patterns of rodents during early development. For this, in a first step time windows with discontinuous oscillations vs. epochs of network "silence" were identified. In a second step, the major features of detected events were identified and processed by principal component analysis for deciding on their contribution to the classification of different oscillatory patterns. Finally, these patterns were categorized using an unsupervised cluster algorithm. The results were validated on manually characterized neonatal spindle bursts (SB), which ubiquitously entrain neocortical areas of rats and mice, and prelimbic nested gamma spindle bursts (NG). Moreover, the algorithm led to satisfactory results for oscillatory events that, due to increased similarity of their features, were more difficult to classify, e.g., during the pre-juvenile developmental period. Based on a linear classification, the optimal number of features to consider increased with the difficulty of detection. This algorithm allows the comparison of neonatal and pre-juvenile oscillatory patterns in their spatial and temporal organization. It might represent a first step for the unbiased elucidation of activity patterns during development.

The influence of time-varying, instantaneous modifications of the electroencephalography (EEG) properties immediately preceding the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has rarely been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the pre-TMS motor cortex and related areas EEG profile on time variants of the MEPs amplitude. Method MRI-navigated TMS and multichannel TMS-compatible EEG devices were used. For each experimental subject, post-hoc analysis of the MEPs amplitude that was based on the 50th percentile of the MEPs amplitude distribution provided two subgroups corresponding to "high" (large amplitude) and "low" (small amplitude). The pre-stimulus EEG characteristics (coherence and spectral profile) from the motor cortex and related areas were analyzed separately for the "high" and "low" MEPs and were then compared. Results On the stimulated hemisphere, EEG coupling was observed more often in the high compared to the low MEP trials. Moreover, a paradigmatic pattern in which TMS was able to lead to significantly larger MEPs was found when the EEG of the stimulated motor cortex was coupled in the beta 2 band with the ipsilateral prefrontal cortex and in the delta band with the bilateral centro-parietal-occipital cortices. Conclusion This data provide evidence for a statistically significant influence of time-varying and spatially patterned synchronization of EEG rhythms in determining cortical excitability, namely motor cortex excitability in response to TMS.

Nonlinearity in the thalamic relay nuclei gives rise to a spindle harmonic visible in the cortical EEG. By deriving an analytic expression for nonlinear spectrum, the power in the spindle harmonic is predicted to scale quadratically with the power in the spindle oscillation. By isolating sleep spindles from background sleep in experimental EEG data, the spindle harmonic is directly observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Abeysuriya, R. G.; Rennie, C.

On the other hand, cross-frequency communications are more flexible allowing interactions between oscillations with different frequencies. Among such cross-frequency interactions amplitude-to-amplitude interactions are of a special interest as they show how the strength of spatial synchronization in different neuronal populations relates to each other during a given task. While, previously, amplitude-to-amplitude correlations were studied primarily on the sensor level, we present a source separation approach using spatial filters which maximize the correlation between the envelopes of brain oscillations recorded with electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) or intracranial multichannel recordings. Our approach, which is called canonical source power correlation analysis (cSPoC), is thereby capable of extracting genuine brain oscillations solely based on their assumed coupling behavior even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals is low. In addition to using cSPoC for the analysis of cross-frequency interactions in the same subject, we show that it can also be utilized for studying amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations across subjects. We assess the performance of cSPoC in simulations as well as in three distinctively different analysis scenarios of real EEG data, each involving several subjects. In the simulations, cSPoC outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art approaches. In the analysis of real EEG recordings, we demonstrate excellent unsupervised discovery of meaningful power-to-power couplings, within as well as across subjects and frequency bands.

Previously, we proposed that alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations, which fluctuate with both sustained and directed attention, represent a pulsed inhibition of ongoing sensory brain activity. Here we tested the prediction that inhibitory alpha oscillations in visual cortex are modulated by top-down signals from frontoparietal attention networks. We measured modulations in phase-coherent alpha oscillations from superficial frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices using the event-related optical signal (EROS), a measure of neuronal activity affording high spatiotemporal resolution, along with concurrently recorded EEG, while participants performed a visual target detection task. The pretarget alpha oscillations measured with EEG and EROS from posterior areas were larger for subsequently undetected targets, supporting alpha's inhibitory role. Using EROS, we localized brain correlates of these awareness-related alpha oscillations measured at the scalp to the cuneus and precuneus. Crucially, EROS alpha suppression correlated with posterior EEG alpha power across participants. Sorting the EROS data based on EEG alpha power quartiles to investigate alpha modulators revealed that suppression of posterior alpha was preceded by increased activity in regions of the dorsal attention network and decreased activity in regions of the cingulo-opercular network. Cross-correlations revealed the temporal dynamics of activity within these preparatory networks before posterior alpha modulation. The novel combination of EEG and EROS afforded localization of the sources and correlates of alpha oscillations and their temporal relationships, supporting our proposal that top-down control from attention networks modulates both posterior alpha and awareness of visual stimuli.

J	Nunez, PL; Srinivasan, R				Nunez, Paul L.; Srinivasan, Ramesh			Neocortical dynamics due to axon propagation delays in cortico-cortical fibers: EEG traveling and standing waves with implications for top-down influences on local networks and white matter disease	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Global fields; Axon propagation; Cross-frequency interactions; White matter disease	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; ANATOMICAL CONNECTIVITY; TEMPORAL STRUCTURES; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; BRAIN NETWORKS	The brain is treated as a nested hierarchical complex system with substantial interactions across spatial scales. Local networks are pictured as embedded within global fields of synaptic action and action potentials. Global fields may act top-down on multiple networks, acting to bind remote networks. Because of scale-dependent properties, experimental electrophysiology requires both local and global models that match observational scales. Multiple local alpha rhythms are embedded in a global alpha rhythm. Global models are outlined in which cm-scale dynamic behaviors result largely from propagation delays in cortico-cortical axons and cortical background excitation level, controlled by neuromodulators on long time scales. The idealized global models ignore the bottom-up influences of local networks on global fields so as to employ relatively simple mathematics. The resulting models are transparently related to several EEG and steady state visually evoked potentials correlated with cognitive states, including estimates of neocortical coherence structure, traveling waves, and standing waves. The global models suggest that global oscillatory behavior of self-sustained (limit-cycle) modes lower than about 20 Hz may easily occur in neocortical/white matter systems provided: Background cortical excitability is sufficiently high; the strength of long cortico-cortical axon systems is sufficiently high; and the bottom-up influence of local networks on the global dynamic field is sufficiently weak. The global models provide "entry points" to more detailed studies of global top-down influences, including binding of weakly connected networks, modulation of gamma oscillations by theta or alpha rhythms, and the effects of white matter deficits.

We hypothesized that abnormal characteristics of neural networks may alter functional connectivity and distort propagation of activation in schizophrenic brains. Thus, electroencephalography (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex were compared between schizophrenia and healthy subjects. There was no difference in the initial response. However, TMS-induced waves of recurrent excitation spreading across the cortex were observed in schizophrenia, while in healthy subjects the activation faded away soon after stimulation. This widespread activation in schizophrenia was associated with increased oscillatory activities in the proximal central leads and in fronto-temporo-parietal leads bilaterally. A positive correlation was found between increased TMS-induced cortical activation in gamma frequency and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, while negative symptoms were correlated with activation in theta and delta bands. We suggest that excessive activation in response to stimulation in schizophrenia brains may lead to abnormal propagation of the signal that could potentially result in aberrant activity in areas remote from the activation origin. This mechanism may account for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and could worsen signal to noise deficits, jeopardizing adequate information processing with ensuing cognitive deficits.

Magnetic field recordings of spontaneous and evoked activity by means of magnetic encephalography demonstrated that multichannel precise Fourier spectrum contains a very large set of harmonics with high coherence. The inverse problem can be solved with great precision based on coherent harmonics, so the technique is a promising platform of general analysis in brain imaging. The analysis method makes it possible to reconstruct sites and timing of electrical activity generated by both spontaneous and evoked brain function at different depths in the brain in the millisecond time range.

For this, the time-frequency analysis of SSVEP during visual stimuli presentation with different duty cycles was performed. The commercial wireless EEG headset with 01 and 02 channels was utilized to record the associated brain activity. The experimental paradigm, in this experiment, we mainly focus on instantaneously changes of duty cycle of SSVEP in the four principal frequency bands, i.e., theta (3 - 7 Hz), alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (13 - 30 Hz), and gamma (30 - 40 Hz). Peak magnitude, peak frequency, and spectral coherence of SSVEP were measured. Results showed that coherences measured in the theta and alpha bands differed significantly with p <0.001. Thus, the present results suggest that the duty cycle is recommended as a feature for potential multicommand SSVEP-based applications.

In this paper, the wavelet entropy (WE) and wavelet time-frequency analysis were used to find the eLectroencephalogram (EEG) features of the operators in a complex industrial process (i. e. the grinding process).

Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used-i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.

Here, we attempted to characterize changes in cortical activities during tonic heat pain perception and investigated the influence of directed/distracted attention on these responses. We collected 5-minute long continuous Electroencephalography (EEG) data from 38 healthy volunteers during four conditions presented in a counterbalanced order: (A) resting condition; (B) innoxious-distracted condition; (C) noxious-distracted condition; (D) noxious-attended condition. The effects of tonic heat pain stimulation and selective attention on oscillatory activities were investigated by comparing the EEG power spectra among the four experimental conditions and assessing the relationship between spectral power difference and subjective pain intensity. The change of oscillatory activities in condition D was characterized by stable and persistent decrease of alpha oscillation power over contralateral-central electrodes and widespread increase of gamma oscillation power, which were even significantly correlated with subjective pain intensity. Since EEG responses in the alpha and gamma frequency band were affected by attention in different manners, they are likely related to different aspects of the multidimensional sensory experience of pain. The observed contralateral-central alpha suppression (conditions D vs. B and D vs. C) may reflect primarily a top-down cognitive process such as attention, while the widespread gamma enhancement (conditions D vs. A) may partly reflect tonic pain processing, representing the summary effects of bottom-up stimulus-related and top-down subject-driven cognitive processes.

A Transition in Brain State during Propofol-Induced Unconsciousness	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha rhythm; anesthesia; cross-frequency coupling; propofol; Slow oscillation; unconsciousness	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL SURFACE; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BURST-SUPPRESSION; CONSCIOUSNESS; SLEEP; EEG; COMPONENTS; RESOLUTION; AWARENESS	Rhythmic oscillations shape cortical dynamics during active behavior, sleep, and general anesthesia. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling is a prominent feature of cortical oscillations, but its role in organizing conscious and unconscious brain states is poorly understood. Using high-density EEG and intracranial electrocorticography during gradual induction of propofol general anesthesia in humans, we discovered a rapid drug-induced transition between distinct states with opposite phase-amplitude coupling and different cortical source distributions. One state occurs during unconsciousness and may be similar to sleep slow oscillations. A second state occurs at the loss or recovery of consciousness and resembles an enhanced slow cortical potential. These results provide objective electrophysiological land marks of distinct unconscious brain states, and could be used to help improve EEG-based monitoring for general anesthesia.

Themain aim of the present study was to determine whether patients with evidence of independent bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (biTLE) can be identified noninvasively on the basis of seizure semiology analysis. Thirteen patients with biTLE, as defined by invasive EEG, were matched with 13 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (uniTLE). In all 26 patients, the frequency of predefined clusters of ictal and periictal signs were evaluated: ictal motor signs (IMSs), periictalmotor signs (PIMSs), periictal vegetative signs (PIVSs), the frequency of early oroalimentary automatisms (EOAs), and the duration of postictal unresponsiveness (PU). Some other noninvasive and clinical data were also evaluated. A lower frequency of IMSs was noted in the group with biTLE (patients = 46.2%, seizures = 20.7%) than in the group with uniTLE (patients = 92.3%, seizures = 61.0%) (p = 0.030; p < 0.001, respectively). The individual IMS average per seizure was significantly lower in the group with biTLE (0.14; range = 0-1.0) than in the group with uniTLE (0.80; range = 0-2.6) (p = 0.003). Postictal unresponsiveness was longer than 5 min in more patients (75.0%) and seizures (42.9%) in the group with biTLE than in the groupwith uniTLE (patients = 30.8%, seizures= 18.6%) (p= 0.047; p= 0.002). The frequency of EOAs, PIMSs, PIVSs, and other clinical data did not differ significantly. There is a lower frequency of ictal motor signs and longer duration of postictal unresponsiveness in patients with biTLE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Slow Oscillations during Sleep Coordinate Interregional Communication in Cortical Networks	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; functional connectivity; memory; sleep spindles; slow oscillations	LOCAL SLEEP; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; EEG; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	Large-amplitude sleep slow oscillations group faster neuronal oscillations and are of functional relevance for memory performance. However, relatively little is known about the impact of slow oscillations on functionally coupled networks. Here, we provide a comprehensive view on how human slow oscillatory dynamics influence various measures of brain processing. We demonstrate that slow oscillations coordinate interregional cortical communication, as assessed by phase synchrony in the sleep spindle frequency range and cross-frequency coupling between spindle and beta activity. Furthermore, we show that the organizing role of slow oscillations is restricted to circumscribed topographical areas. These findings add importantly to our basic understanding of the orchestrating role of slow oscillations. In addition, they are of considerable relevance for accounts of sleep-dependent memory reprocessing and consolidation.

Gamma band oscillations in the visual cortex play a functional role in perceptual processing. In a previous study, we were able to demonstrate that gamma band oscillations prior to stimulus presentation have a significant influence on perceptual processing of visual stimuli. In the present study, we aimed to investigate longer lasting effects of gamma band neurofeedback training on perceptual processing. For this purpose, a feedback group was trained to modulate oscillations in the gamma band, while a control group participated in a task with an identical design setting but without gamma band feedback. Before and after training, both groups participated in a perceptual object detection task and a spatial attention task. Our results clearly revealed that only the feedback group but not the control group exhibited a visual processing advantage and an increase in oscillatory gamma band activity in the pre-stimulus period of the processing of the visual object stimuli after the neurofeedback training. Results of the spatial attention task showed no difference between the groups, which underlines the specific role of gamma band oscillations for perceptual processing. In summary, our results show that modulation of gamma band activity selectively affects perceptual processing and therefore supports the relevant role of gamma band activity for this specific process. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the eligibility of gamma band oscillations as a valuable tool for neurofeedback applications.

However, despite a rise in empirical evidence attesting to its clinical benefits, a solid theoretical basis is still lacking on the manner in which NFB is able to achieve these outcomes. The present work attempts to bring together various concepts from neurobiology, engineering, and dynamical systems so as to propose a contemporary theoretical framework for the mechanistic effects of NFB. The objective is to provide a firmly neurophysiological account of NFB, which goes beyond traditional behaviorist interpretations that attempt to explain psychological processes solely from a descriptive standpoint whilst treating the brain as a "black box". To this end, we interlink evidence from experimental findings that encompass a broad range of intrinsic brain phenomena: starting from "bottom-up" mechanisms of neural synchronization, followed by "top-down" regulation of internal brain states, moving to dynamical systems plus control-theoretic principles, and concluding with activity-dependent as well as homeostatic forms of brain plasticity. In support of our framework, we examine the effects of NFB in several brain disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and post traumatic stress disorder (RISC)). In sum, it is argued that pathological oscillations emerge from an abnormal formation of brain-state attractor landscape(s). The central thesis put forward is that NFB tunes brain oscillations toward a homeostatic set-point which affords an optimal balance between network flexibility and stability (i.e., self organised criticality (SOC)).

Among them, the most ambitious is the reduction of artifacts due to body movements. This paper studies the effect of head movement artifacts on the EEG signal and on the dry electrode-tissue impedance (ETI), monitored continuously using the imec's wireless EEG headset. We have shown that motion artifacts have huge impact on the EEG spectral content in the frequency range lower than 20Hz. Coherence and spectral analysis revealed that ETI is not capable of describing disturbances at very low frequencies (below 2Hz). Therefore, we devised a motion artifact reduction (MAR) method that uses a combination of a band-pass filtering and multi-channel adaptive filtering (AF), suitable for real-time MAR. This method was capable of substantially reducing artifacts produced by head movements.

We adopted an integrated approach involving a hypnosis-based clinical protocol to improve recall and decrease memory inaccuracy together with electroencephalography (EEG) recording in order to investigate the characteristics of NDE memories and their neural markers compared to memories of both real and imagined events. We included 10 participants with NDEs, defined by the Greyson NDE scale, and 10 control subjects without NDE. Memories were assessed using the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire. Our hypnosis-based protocol increased the amount of details in the recall of all kind of memories considered (NDE, real, and imagined events). Findings showed that NDE memories were similar to real memories in terms of detail richness, self-referential, and emotional information. Moreover, NDE memories were significantly different from memories of imagined events. The pattern of EEG results indicated that real memory recall was positively associated with two memory-related frequency bands, i.e., high alpha and gamma. NDE memories were linked with theta band, a well-known marker of episodic memory. The recall of NDE memories was also related to delta band, which indexes processes such as the recollection of the past, as well as trance states, hallucinations, and other related portals to transpersonal experience. It is notable that the EEG pattern of correlations for NDE memory recall differed from the pattern for memories of imagined events. In conclusion, our findings suggest that, at a phenomenological level, NDE memories cannot be considered equivalent to imagined memories, and at a neural level, NDE memories are stored as episodic memories of events experienced in a peculiar state of consciousness.

While most research focuses on event-related changes of brain activity in response to external events there is also increasing interest in internal brain states influencing information processing. Several studies suggest amplitude changes of EEG oscillatory activity selectively influencing cortical excitability, and more recently it was shown that phase of EEG activity (instantaneous phase) conveys additional meaning. Here we review this field with many conflicting findings and further investigate whether corticospinal excitability in the resting brain is dependent on a specific spontaneously occurring brain state reflected by amplitude and instantaneous phase of EEG oscillations. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left sensorimotor cortex, while simultaneously recording ongoing oscillatory activity with EEG. Results indicate that brain oscillations reflect rapid, spontaneous fluctuations of cortical excitability. Instantaneous phase but not amplitude of oscillations at various frequency bands at stimulation site at the time of TMS-pulse is indicative for brain states associated with different levels of excitability (defined by size of the elicited motor evoked potential). These results are further evidence that ongoing brain oscillations directly influence neural excitability which puts further emphasis on their role in orchestrating neuronal firing in the brain.

Oscillatory Brain State Predicts Variability in Working Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; cognitive variability; cortical excitability; precision; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION; INHIBITION	Our capacity to remember and manipulate objects in working memory (WM) is severely limited. However, this capacity limitation is unlikely to be fixed because behavioral models indicate variability from trial to trial. We investigated whether fluctuations in neural excitability at stimulus encoding, as indexed by low-frequency oscillations (in the alpha band, 8-14 Hz), contribute to this variability. Specifically, we hypothesized that the spontaneous state of alpha band activity would correlate with trial-by-trial fluctuations in visual WM. Electroencephalography recorded from human observers during a visual WM task revealed that the prestimulus desynchronization of alpha oscillations predicts the accuracy of memory recall on a trial-by-trial basis. A model-based analysis indicated that this effect arises from a modulation in the precision of memorized items, but not the likelihood of remembering them (the recall rate). The phase of posterior alpha oscillations preceding the memorized item also predicted memory accuracy. Based on correlations between prestimulus alpha levels and stimulus-related visual evoked responses, we speculate that the prestimulus state of the visual system prefigures a cascade of state-dependent processes, ultimately affecting WM-guided behavior. Overall, our results indicate that spontaneous changes in cortical excitability can have profound consequences for higher visual cognition.

Methods: High-density EEG was recorded while participants heard a stream of standard pure tones, into which occasional (14%) frequency deviants were inserted. In a first run they listened passively while watching a closed-captioned movie, whereas in a second run they pressed a button each time they detected a deviant while watching the movie with neither sound nor captioning. Results: Independent component analysis revealed independent components that we localized to temporal and frontal regional brain sources relevant to the generation of the MMN. Relative power in various oscillatory frequency bands, computed from a wavelet analysis on the time series of these independent components, was modulated by task demands and stimulus type, as was dynamic phase-locking between pairs of the independent components in those same frequency bands. Conclusion: These results support a hierarchical model of MMN generation that emphasizes information processing and transfer between temporal and frontal brain regions. Significance: In addition to enhancing the use of the MMN to evaluate some aspects of central auditory functioning, these results could be important for the evaluation of alterations in other cognitive functions or in consciousness.

The background EEG activity, however, has received less attention. In this chapter we discuss the characteristic features of the background activity of the brain when individuals are at rest and awake (resting wake) and during sleep. The characteristic rhythms of the background EEG are presented, and the presence of 1/f(beta) behavior of the EEG power spectral density is discussed and its possible origin and functional significance. The interictal EEG findings of focal epilepsy and the impact of interictal epileptiform spikes on cognition are also discussed.

High-Frequency Oscillations Recorded on the Scalp of Patients With Epilepsy Using Tripolar Concentric Ring Electrodes	IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; tripolar concentric ring electrode sensors; Laplacian	TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; SURFACE LAPLACIANS; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; GAMMA ACTIVITY; 80-500 HZ; EEG; BRAIN; DISCHARGE	Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder (similar to 1% prevalence) affecting similar to 67 million people worldwide with up to 75% from developing countries. The conventional electroencephalogram is plagued with artifacts from movements, muscles, and other sources. Tripolar concentric ring electrodes automatically attenuate muscle artifacts and provide improved signal quality. We performed basic experiments in healthy humans to show that tripolar concentric ring electrodes can indeed record the physiological alpha waves while eyes are closed. We then conducted concurrent recordings with conventional disc electrodes and tripolar concentric ring electrodes from patients with epilepsy. We found that we could detect high frequency oscillations, a marker for early seizure development and epileptogenic zone, on the scalp surface that appeared to become more narrow-band just prior to seizures. High frequency oscillations preceding seizures were present in an average of 35.5% of tripolar concentric ring electrode data channels for all the patients with epilepsy whose seizures were recorded and absent in the corresponding conventional disc electrode data. An average of 78.2% of channels that contained high frequency oscillations were within the seizure onset or irritative zones determined independently by three epileptologists based on conventional disc electrode data and videos.

EEG signals are continuously recorded through many channels over prolonged time periods at extremely high resolution and thus possess enormous data size. This may lead to large storage space and more transmission bandwidth requirement for remote EEG signal analysis. An attempt has been made to compress multichannel EEG by exploiting neighboring channel and sample redundancy, present along with the information content. This paper presents a high performance hybrid multichannel EEG compression algorithm based on frequency transformation and parameter extraction techniques. It compares discrete cosine transform (DCT) with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compress the multichannel EEG. This compressed EEG is embedded with corresponding EEG sub band power information to obtain a high quality signal reconstruction for accurate brain state analysis. The performance of proposed hybrid compression scheme is quantified in terms of compression level achieved and reconstruction error introduced. A high compression ratio and considerably low percent root-mean-square difference (PRD) error is found thereby preserving diagnostic information while transmission/ recovery of real time multichannel EEG for efficient telehealth monitoring applications with reduced computational complexity. This research has also resulted in repeatability and thus reliability testing of an efficient hybrid compression technique developed earlier for ECG signals.

Because few, if any studies have applied these analytic methods to examine feedback processing in children or adolescents, we used a fine-grained approach that explored one half hertz by 16 ms increments during feedback (no win vs. win events) in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band. Complex wavelet frequency decomposition revealed that no win feedback was associated with enhanced theta power and phase coherence. We observed condition and age-based differences for both ERSP and ITC, with stronger effects for ITC. The transition from childhood to early adolescence (13-14 yrs.) was a point of increased differentiation of ITC favoring no win vs. wins feedback and also compared to children or older adolescents, a point of heightened ITC for no win feedback (quadratic effect).

Long range frontal/posterior phase synchronization during remembered pursuit task is impaired in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Endophenotype; Smooth pursuit eye movements; Predictive pursuit; Phase synchronization; Electroencephalography	EYE-MOVEMENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; INITIATION; COHERENCE; THALAMUS; DEFICIT	Although smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) is a reliable endophenotype of schizophrenia, exact underlying cognitive and neural substrates remain unknown. A simple mechanistic model of SPEM assumes an efficient interaction in integrating sensory input from the medial temporal (MT)/medial superior temporal (MST) brain regions and subsequent motor response through the frontal eye field (FEF). Poor functional connectivity between these two regions could explain impaired motion perception and SPEM maintenance in schizophrenia. In the present study, we combined an eye tracking paradigm with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to investigate the putative functional connectivity among frontal/posterior brain regions in mediating the modulation of SPEM. Twenty four schizophrenic (SZ) and 22 healthy control (HC) participants performed remembered pursuit tasks with EEG recordings. Behaviorally, HC subjects showed significant improvement in SPEM response on repeated presentations of target compared to SZ subjects. Neurophysiologically HC subjects showed higher frontal/posterior phase synchronization in the beta to low gamma range frequency bands during all target presentations. In addition there was a significant increase in phase synchronization in the beta-2 frequency band in HC subjects during late compared to early target presentation. In contrast, higher frontal/posterior phase synchronization in the beta-2 frequency predicted better performance during late target presentation and lower enduring psychosis in SZ subjects. These data suggest a pathologically perturbed connectivity between frontal and posterior cortical regions during SPEM in SZ. The integrative eye tracking-EEG approach used in this study to dissect the endophenotype may reveal novel targets for studying schizophrenia psychopathology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In 8 subjects, 6-channel EEG data of 3-minute duration were recorded during 88 relaxation sessions. Time course of spectral EEG features was examined. Alpha powers were decreasing during resting conditions of 3-minute sessions in lying position with eyes closed. This was followed by a decrease of total power in centro-parietal cortex regions and an increase of beta power in fronto-central areas. Represented by EEG coherences the interhemispheric communication between the parieto-occipital regions was enhanced within a frequency range of 2-10 Hz. In order to discern between higher and lower levels of relaxation distinguished according to self-rated satisfaction, EEG features were assessed and discriminating parameters were identified. Successful relaxation was determined mainly by the presence of decreased delta-1 power across the cortex. Potential applications for these findings include the clinical, pharmacological, and stress management fields.

Accumulated source imaging of brain activity with both low and high-frequency neuromagnetic signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; brain; multi-frequency; high-frequency oscillations; magnetic source imaging	OSCILLATIONS HFOS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; FOCAL SEIZURES; HUMAN EPILEPSY; HEAD MODEL; EEG; MEG; LOCALIZATION; HZ; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Recent studies have revealed the importance of high-frequency brain signals (>70 Hz). One challenge of high-frequency signal analysis is that the size of time-frequency representation of high-frequency brain signals could be larger than 1 terabytes (TB), which is beyond the upper limits of a typical computer workstation's memory (<196 GB). The aim of the present study is to develop a new method to provide greater sensitivity in detecting high-frequency magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals in a single automated and versatile interface, rather than the more traditional, time-intensive visual inspection methods, which may take up to several days. To address the aim, we developed a new method, accumulated source imaging, defined as the volumetric summation of source activity over a period of time. This method analyzes signals in both low- (1 similar to 70 Hz) and high-frequency (70 similar to 200 Hz) ranges at source levels. To extract meaningful information from MEG signals at sensor space, the signals were decomposed to channel-cross-channel matrix (CxC) representing the spatiotemporal patterns of every possible sensor-pair. A new algorithm was developed and tested by calculating the optimal CxC and source location-orientation weights for volumetric source imaging, thereby minimizing multi-source interference and reducing computational cost. The new method was implemented in C/C++ and tested with MEG data recorded from clinical epilepsy patients. The results of experimental data demonstrated that accumulated source imaging could effectively summarize and visualize MEG recordings within 12.7 h by using approximately 10 GB of computer memory. In contrast to the conventional method of visually identifying multi-frequency epileptic activities that traditionally took 2-3 days and used 1-2 TB storage, the new approach can quantify epileptic abnormalities in both low- and high-frequency ranges at source levels, using much less time and computer memory.

Therefore we focused on resting state brain activity and functional connectivity. Method: We included 11 patients with developmental stuttering and 11 age matched controls. To objectify stuttering severity and the impact on quality of life (QoL), we used the Dutch validated Test for Stuttering Severity-Readers (TSS-R) and the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES), respectively. Furthermore, we used standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analyses to look at resting state activity and functional connectivity differences and their correlations with the TSS-R and OASES. Results: No significant results could be obtained when looking at neural activity, however significant alterations in resting state functional connectivity could be demonstrated between persons who stutter (PWS) and fluently speaking controls, predominantly interhemispheric, i.e., a decreased functional connectivity for high frequency oscillations (beta and gamma) between motor speech areas (BA44 and 45) and the contralateral premotor (BA6) and motor (BA4) areas. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between functional connectivity at low frequency oscillations (theta and alpha) and stuttering severity, while a mixed increased and decreased functional connectivity at low and high frequency oscillations correlated with QoL. Discussion: PWS are characterized by decreased high frequency interhemispheric functional connectivity between motor speech, premotor and motor areas in the resting state, while higher functional connectivity in the low frequency bands indicates more severe speech disturbances, suggesting that increased interhemispheric and right sided functional connectivity is maladaptive.

The solution reduces to two possible t-f approaches that use a general formulation of t-f matched filters (TFMFs) based on the Wigner-Ville and cross Wigner-Ville distributions, and a third new approach based on the signal ambiguity domain representation; referred to as Radon-ambiguity detector. This contribution defines a general design formulation and then implements it for newborn seizure detection using multichannel EEG signals. Finally, the performance of different TFMFs is evaluated for different t-f kernels in terms of classification accuracy using real newborn EEG signals. Experimental results show that the detection method which uses TFMFs based on the cross Wigner-Ville distribution outperforms other approaches including the existing TFMF-based ones. The results also show that TFMFs which use high-resolution kernels such as the modified B-distribution, achieve higher detection accuracies compared to the ones which use other reduced-interference t-f kernels.

Cognitive architectures as a tool for investigating the role of oscillatory power and coherence in cognition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ACT-R; Attentional blink; Oscillations; Model-based neuroscience	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; MODEL; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; FMRI; EEG	In contrast to our increasing knowledge of the role that oscillations in single brain regions play in cognition, very little is known about how coherence between oscillations in distant brain regions is related to information transmission. Here I present a cognitive modeling approach that can address that question. Specifically, I show how a model of the attentional blink implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture is related to the amplitude and coherence of EEG oscillations. The dynamics of the model's working memory resource is primarily associated with parietal 4-9 Hz theta oscillations, while the dynamics of the model's declarative memory, visual perception and procedural resources together are correlated with posterior theta oscillations. I further show that model predictions about inter-module communication during the processes of stimulus identification and target consolidation are associated with selective increases in coherence at the predicted points in time.

Developmental change in EEG theta activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during response control	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain development; Electroencephalography (EEG); Neural oscillations; Theta activity; Response control; Anterior cingulate cortex	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; INHIBITORY CONTROL; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS	Cognitive control functions continue to improve from infancy until early adulthood, allowing flexible adaptation to a complex environment. However, it remains controversial how this development in cognitive capabilities is mediated by changes in cortical activity: both age-related increases and decreases of mediofrontal neural activity have been observed and interpreted as neural underpinnings of this functional development. To better understand this developmental process, we examined EEG theta activity in the mediofrontal region using a Go/No-go response control task. We found that both pre-stimulus baseline theta-power and theta-power during the response control task, without baseline-correction, decreased with age. Conversely, when task-related theta-power was baseline corrected (using a ratio method), it exhibited a positive developmental trajectory. The age-related theta-power increase was source-localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. This increase in theta activity also partially mediated age-related improvements in response control and was greatest in a condition that demanded greater effort. Theta activity in older children also showed greater temporal reliability across trials as measured by inter-trial phase-coherence. Interestingly, directly subtracting baseline activity from task-related activity did not yield significant developmental effects, which highlights the necessity of separating and contrasting the pre-stimulus baseline with task-related processing in the understanding of neurodevelopmental changes.

Alpha has been generally proposed to be associated with attention and memory and to be particularly important for the mediation of long-distance communication between neuronal populations. However, how these apply to object recognition is still unclear. This study aimed at describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of alpha rhythms while recognizing fragmented images of objects presented for the first time and presented again 24 hr later. Intracranial electro-encephalography was performed in six epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Time-frequency analysis revealed a strong alpha activity, mainly of the evoked type, propagating from posterior cerebral areas to anterior regions, which was similar whether the objects were recognized or not. Phase coherence analysis, however, showed clear phase synchronization specific for the moment of recognition. Twenty-four hr later, frontal regions displayed stronger alpha activity and more distributed phase synchronization than when images were presented for the first time. In conclusion, alpha amplitude seems to be related to nonspecific mechanism. Phase coherence analysis suggests a communicational role of alpha activity in object recognition, which may be important for the comparison between bottom-up representations and memory templates.

It is currently unknown whether such superior attention control abilities are mediated by stronger suppression of irrelevant information, enhancement of relevant information, or both. Here we used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) with the Eriksen flanker task to track simultaneously the attention to relevant and irrelevant information by tagging target and distractors with different frequencies. This design allowed us to dissociate attentional biasing of perceptual processing (via SSVEPs) and stimulus processing in the frontal cognitive control network (via time-frequency analyses of EEG data). We show that while preparing for the upcoming stimulus, high- and low-WMC individuals use different strategies: High-WMC individuals show attentional suppression of the irrelevant stimuli, whereas low-WMC individuals demonstrate attentional enhancement of the relevant stimuli. Moreover, behavioral performance was predicted by trial-to-trial fluctuations in strength of distractor-suppression for high-WMC participants. We found no evidence for WMC-related differences in cognitive control network functioning, as measured by midfrontal theta-band power. Taken together, these findings suggest that early suppression of irrelevant information is a key underlying neural mechanism by which superior attention control abilities are implemented.

Application of Modulation Spectrum for iEEG Seizure Analysis	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology	MAY 21-24, 2014	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; EPILEPSY	Millions of people worldwide suffer with recurrent epileptic seizures that often require hospitalized intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) for diagnosing their seizure onset zone (SOZ) for surgical therapy. The standard diagnostic procedures for the brain signals rely on time-consuming human review of data via visual analysis. This study investigates whether modulation spectrum measures, with further study, could provide a quantitative algorithmic approach to reliably identify the SOZ for a patient and reduce or eliminate the burden of manual iEEG review. In a pilot dataset of four patients (one seizure per person), we analyzed human iEEG before, during, and after their seizure from signals inside and outside their clinically annotated SOZ to observe changes in 49 modulation spectrum measures. Regarding electrode location effects (i.e., inside vs. outside SOZ), we observed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in modulation measures at certain cross-frequency bins (e.g., delta:gamma bandwidths) with high effect size (g >= 0.80) for some patients. For seizure state effects, we observed significant differences with high effect size in many measures across almost all cross-frequency bins between various pairings of seizure states (e.g., during vs. before) for all patients. We concluded that the modulation spectrum had potential in quantifying SOZ and seizure states for diagnostic purposes and in understanding the effect of seizures on brain networks.

In the new parametric modeling framework, the time-dependent parameters of the TVAR model are locally represented using a novel multiresolution wavelet decomposition scheme. The wavelet coefficients are estimated using an effective orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm. The resultant estimation of time-dependent spectral density in the signal can simultaneously achieve high resolution in both time and frequency, which is a powerful TFA technique for nonstationary signals. An artificial EEG signal is included to show the effectiveness of the new proposed approach. The experimental results elucidate that the multiresolution wavelet approach is capable of achieving a more accurate time-frequency representation of nonstationary signals.

Methods: Spindle oscillations were extracted from EEG data from nine subjects using an automated algorithm. The power and frequency of the spindle oscillation and the harmonic oscillation were compared across subjects. The bicoherence of the EEG was calculated to identify nonlinear coupling. Results: All subjects displayed a spindle harmonic at almost exactly twice the frequency of the spindle. The power of the harmonic scaled nonlinearly with that of the spindle peak, consistent with model predictions. Bicoherence was observed at the spindle frequency, confirming the nonlinear origin of the harmonic oscillation. Conclusions: The properties of the sleep spindle harmonic were consistent with the theoretical modeling of the sleep spindle harmonic as a nonlinear phenomenon. Significance: Most models of sleep spindle generation are unable to produce a spindle harmonic oscillation, so the observation and theoretical explanation of the harmonic is a significant step in understanding the mechanisms of sleep spindle generation. Unlike seizures, sleep spindles produce nonlinear effects that can be observed in healthy controls, and unlike the alpha oscillation, there is no linearly generated harmonic that can obscure nonlinear effects. This makes the spindle harmonic a good candidate for future investigation of nonlinearity in the brain. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Many epilepsy patients undergo electroencephalography (EEG) continuously for days to weeks in a hospital to have seizures that might help doctors identify the anatomical focus of those seizures. But screening days to weeks of iEEG for seizures that can happen anytime or not at all is a time-consuming clinical burden for clinicians and staff. Thus, a computerized method to perform this duty objectively in lieu of subjective manual labor is highly beneficial toward robust timely clinical care of patients. I present such a method using two unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to cross-frequency coupling measures, comparing the classification performance of the methods. The methods perform similarly in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity (positive predictive value). Overall a proof-of-concept for a new approach is made. With more development, either approach could be used in practical clinical settings.

Dimensionality reduction for the analysis of brain oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Brain oscillations; Spatio-spectral decomposition; Principal component analysis	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; DYNAMICS; EEG/MEG; ALPHA; INTEGRATION	Neuronal oscillations have been shown to be associated with perceptual, motor and cognitive brain operations. While complex spatio-temporal dynamics are a hallmark of neuronal oscillations, they also represent a formidable challenge for the proper extraction and quantification of oscillatory activity with non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG and MEG. In order to facilitate the study of neuronal oscillations we present a general-purpose pre-processing approach, which can be applied for a wide range of analyses including but not restricted to inverse modeling and multivariate single-trial classification. The idea is to use dimensionality reduction with spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) instead of the commonly and almost exclusively used principal component analysis (PCA). The key advantage of SSD lies in selecting components explaining oscillations-related variance instead of just any variance as in the case of PCA. For the validation of SSD pre-processing we performed extensive simulations with different inverse modeling algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin. Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from 80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly increases the performance of single-trial classification of imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that, while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of extracting components primarily relating to the signal of interest often using as little as 20% of the data variance, instead of > 90% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal subjects and patients.

Intensive care unit depth of sleep: proof of concept of a simple electroencephalography index in the non-sedated	CRITICAL CARE			English	Article							CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; DISRUPTION; QUALITY; ICU; DEPRIVATION; FREQUENCY; DELIRIUM; EEG	Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are known to experience severely disturbed sleep, with possible detrimental effects on short-and long-term outcomes. Investigation into the exact causes and effects of disturbed sleep has been hampered by cumbersome and time consuming methods of measuring and staging sleep. We introduce a novel method for ICU depth of sleep analysis, the ICU depth of sleep index (IDOS index), using single channel electroencephalography (EEG) and apply it to outpatient recordings. A proof of concept is shown in non-sedated ICU patients. Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of five ICU patients and 15 healthy outpatients were analyzed using the IDOS index, based on the ratio between gamma and delta band power. Manual selection of thresholds was used to classify data as either wake, sleep or slow wave sleep (SWS). This classification was compared to visual sleep scoring by Rechtschaffen & Kales criteria in normal outpatient recordings and ICU recordings to illustrate face validity of the IDOS index. Results: When reduced to two or three classes, the scoring of sleep by IDOS index and manual scoring show high agreement for normal sleep recordings. The obtained overall agreements, as quantified by the kappa coefficient, were 0.84 for sleep/wake classification and 0.82 for classification into three classes (wake, non-SWS and SWS). Sensitivity and specificity were highest for the wake state (93% and 93%, respectively) and lowest for SWS (82% and 76%, respectively). For ICU recordings, agreement was similar to agreement between visual scorers previously reported in literature. Conclusions: Besides the most satisfying visual resemblance with manually scored normal PSG recordings, the established face-validity of the IDOS index as an estimator of depth of sleep was excellent. This technique enables real-time, automated, single channel visualization of depth of sleep, facilitating the monitoring of sleep in the ICU.

The simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) were used for this study, recorded from five distinct cortical regions of the brain. We focused on the 'alpha' functional network, corresponding to the individual peak frequency in the alpha band. The total data set of 120 seconds was divided into three segments of 18 seconds each, taken from start, middle, and end of the recording. This segmentation allowed us to analyze the evolution of the underlying functional network. The method of time-resolved partial directed coherence (tPDC) was used to assess the causality. This method allowed us to focus on the individual peak frequency in the 'alpha' band (7-13 Hz). Because of the significantly higher power in the recorded EEG in comparison to MEG, at the individual peak frequency of the alpha band, results rely only on EEG. The MEG was used only for comparison. Our results show that different regions of the brain start to 'disconnect' from one another over the course of time. The driving signals, along with the feedback signals between different cortical regions start to recede over time. This shows that, with the course of rest, brain regions reduce communication with each another.

Superior time perception for lower musical pitch explains why bass-ranged instruments lay down musical rhythms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						temporal perception; auditory scene analysis; rhythmic pulse; beat	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; AUDITORY-NERVE; MASKING; FREQUENCY; ADAPTATION; MOVEMENT; CORTEX; MODEL	The auditory environment typically contains several sound sources that overlap in time, and the auditory system parses the complex sound wave into streams or voices that represent the various sound sources. Music is also often polyphonic. Interestingly, the main melody (spectral/pitch information) is most often carried by the highest-pitched voice, and the rhythm (temporal foundation) is most often laid down by the lowest-pitched voice. Previous work using electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated that the auditory cortex encodes pitch more robustly in the higher of two simultaneous tones or melodies, and modeling work indicated that this high-voice superiority for pitch originates in the sensory periphery. Here, we investigated the neural basis of carrying rhythmic timing information in lower-pitched voices. We presented simultaneous high-pitched and low-pitched tones in an isochronous stream and occasionally presented either the higher or the lower tone 50 ms earlier than expected, while leaving the other tone at the expected time. EEG recordings revealed that mismatch negativity responses were larger for timing deviants of the lower tones, indicating better timing encoding for lower-pitched compared with higher-pitch tones at the level of auditory cortex. A behavioral motor task revealed that tapping synchronization was more influenced by the lower-pitched stream. Results from a biologically plausible model of the auditory periphery suggest that nonlinear cochlear dynamics contribute to the observed effect. The low-voice superiority effect for encoding timing explains the widespread musical practice of carrying rhythm in bass-ranged instruments and complements previously established high-voice superiority effects for pitch and melody.

These signals are captured by a multi-channel electrode system. Any muscle movement impacts the EEG signal recording which translates to artifacts. Therefore, noise from the recording is eliminated by subtracting the noisy signal from the original EEG recording. The actual EEG signals are then subjected to band pass filtering with cut-off frequencies 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. The filtered signals are analyzed using a time-frequency technique known as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). A third order Debauchies' wavelet and five level decomposition is utilized to segregate the signal into five sub-bands, namely, delta (0.5 - 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (12 - 30 Hz) and gamma (> 30 Hz). First order statistical moments such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation and mode of the sub-bands are calculated and stored as features. These features serve as an input to the next stage of system classification. Unsupervised learning through K-means clustering is employed since the classes of the signals are unknown. This provides a strong decision making tool for a real-time drowsiness detection system. The algorithm developed in this work has been tested on twelve samples from the Physionet sleep-EDF database.

Measuring temporal, spectral and spatial changes in electrophysiological brain network connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Functional connectivity; Neural oscillations; Non-stationarity; Brain networks; Canonical correlation; Multi-variate; Leakage reduction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MEG SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; BEAMFORMER; CORTEX; EEG; FLUCTUATIONS	The topic of functional connectivity in neuroimaging is expanding rapidly and many studies now focus on coupling between spatially separate brain regions. These studies show that a relatively small number of large scale networks exist within the brain, and that healthy function of these networks is disrupted in many clinical populations. To date, the vast majority of studies probing connectivity employ techniques that compute time averaged correlation over several minutes, and between specific pre-defined brain locations. However, increasing evidence suggests that functional connectivity is non-stationary in time. Further, electrophysiological measurements show that connectivity is dependent on the frequency band of neural oscillations. It is also conceivable that networks exhibit a degree of spatial inhomogeneity, i.e. the large scale networks that we observe may result from the time average of multiple transiently synchronised sub-networks, each with their own spatial signature. This means that the next generation of neuroimaging tools to compute functional connectivity must account for spatial inhomogeneity, spectral non-uniformity and temporal non-stationarity. Here, we present a means to achieve this via application of windowed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to source space projected MEG data. We describe the generation of time-frequency connectivity plots, showing the temporal and spectral distribution of coupling between brain regions. Moreover, CCA over voxels provides a means to assess spatial non-uniformity within short time-frequency windows. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated in simulation and in a resting state MEG experiment where we elucidate multiple distinct spatio-temporal-spectral modes of covariation between the left and right sensorimotor areas.

To greatly facilitate the diagnostic process and improve the efficiency of decision making decision support systems are developed based on expert knowledge. This paper presents the design of a computer system supporting seizure detection, based on real EEG records. The system is based on modern signal processing tools that allow for time-frequency representation of the analyzed signal. The proposed solution should be treated as a decision support computer system. The system has been designed to facilitate the rapid detection of characteristic graphoelements to effectively detect epileptic seizures. The proposed solution can have a significant impact on an accuracy and speed in the analysis of EEG signals, which may significantly shorten the time of making diagnosis trials. The proposed system is based on studies using real EEG records of patients with epilepsy as well as healthy subjects prepared in collaboration with the medical staff of the Ward of Neurology and Strokes of the Provincial Hospital of Zielona Gora, Poland.

The assessments were conducted on 30 children aged between 7 to 9 years old who have no records of working memory disability. The raw EEG signals were decomposed using discrete wavelet transform with mother wavelet: Daubechies 4 (db4) at a level of decomposition of 8. The EEG signals were recorded at the prefrontal cortex (channel F3, F4, FZ, F7, and F8) during two visual assessments. The feature extractions at alpha frequency are mean and standard deviation of voltage activity during brain activation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to identify when the working memory performance and visual sensory interaction occur. The percentage accuracy for Phase 1 is 73.33% for the control group and 26.67% for the test group. However, at the Phase 2, the percentage of accuracy for the control group decreased to 56.67% and the accuracy for the test group is 43.33%. Results showed that the accuracy of working memory is affected by the task given. In conclusion, the study proposed that age and the increased level of tasks affect working memory performance.

Many evidences suggest that abnormalities in the event-related brain potentials (ERPs), resting state electroencephalography (EEG) and synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons may reflect core pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Abnormalities in amplitude and latency of the ERPs reflecting aberrations in gating and difficulties in the detection of changes in auditory stimuli, as well as defects in stimuli evaluation and integration of information are common in patients with schizophrenia. This chapter highlights the findings of electrophysiological studies in schizophrenia dealing with early sensory perception and attention, automatic sensory detection of stimuli changes and cognitive evaluation and integration of information, relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning hallucinations and delusions. Results of electrophysiological studies investigating the neural correlates of positive symptoms suggest aberrant intrinsic organization of functional brain networks.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while participants performed a modified Sternberg visual memory task. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to factorise the EEG signals into distinct temporal activations to perform spectrotemporal analysis and localisation of source activities. We found encoding' and maintenance' operations were correlated with negative and positive changes in -band power, respectively. Transient activities were observed during encoding of information in the bilateral cuneus, precuneus, inferior parietal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, and a sustained activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. Strong correlations were also observed between changes in -power and behavioral performance during both encoding and maintenance. Furthermore, it was also found that individuals with higher working memory capacity experienced stronger neural oscillatory responses during the encoding of visual objects into working memory. Our results suggest an interplay between two distinct neural pathways and different spatiotemporal operations during the encoding and maintenance of information which predict individual differences in working memory capacity observed at the behavioral level.

However it is not known whether ongoing cortical activity qualitatively determines different memory types at encoding. In this study, using a remember/know procedure, we measured the EEG oscillations that emerge before and during the encoding of abstract visual stimuli in episodic and non-episodic memory, focusing on the theta (2-8 Hz) and alpha (9-12 Hz) oscillation range. We found that enhanced prestimulus theta oscillations precede episodic memory encoding, compared to non-episodic encoding. The prestimulus difference appeared at frontal and temporal sites. Furthermore, the theta enhancement reappeared after stimulus onset. Enhanced upper alpha oscillations suggested increased working memory processing in the case of episodic memory. Finally, the pre- and post-stimulus theta and alpha amplitudes showed different correlation patterns for episodic and non-episodic encoding.

This method can not contribute to acquire real time analysis and obtain a high confidence in the clinic due to low discrimination. To solve the problems, the development of a new index is carried out using the bispectrum analyzing the EEG(electromyogram) including the non-linear characteristic. After analyzing the bispectrum of the 2 dimension, the most significant power spectrum density peaks appeared abundantly at the specific area in awakening and anesthesia state. These points are utilized to create the new index since many peaks appeared at the specific area in the frequency coordinate. The measured range of an index was 0-100. An index is 20-50 at an anesthesia, while the index is 90-60 at the awake. New index could afford to effectively discriminate the awake and anesthesia state.

Electroencephalography (EEG) activities were recorded in 14 healthy subjects when they performed an emotional recognition task for facial expressions. TBS was delivered over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) between a set of tasks. In order to time-variant characteristic in the dynamic brain, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was calculated within alpha frequency bands (8-13Hz) for four time windows (1-200ms, 201400ms, 401-600ms and 601-800ms). We found that the react time of positive stimuli is lower than negative stimuli, but no difference for both emotions was observed between pre-TBS and post-TBS nor for accuracy; the significant decreased of ERSP after TBS were found in alpha band in left prefrontal cortex, indicating the obvious activation. Our results support mechanism of interhemispheric competition, and also demonstrate the important role of right prefrontal cortex in processing emotionrelated attention.

However, there is no previous study analyzing the delta responses in euthymic medication-free patients with bipolar disorder. Participants comprised of 22 euthymic medication-free patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar disorder and 21 healthy controls who were matched to the patients for sex, age, and education. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded at 30 electrode sites using an application of an auditory oddball paradigm. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-3.5 Hz) were measured. There was a significant inter-group difference in evoked and event-related delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) responses. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the event-related delta oscillatory responses of the bipolar patient group were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group over the temporo-parietal and occipital electrode sites. Euthymic bipolar patients showed reduced event-related delta oscillatory responses in comparison to healthy subjects under cognitive load. The decrease of delta oscillations may be a common phenomenon that can be observed in different neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive dysfunction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

PHASE INTERACTION BETWEEN EEG RHYTHMS IN THE STUDY OF PROCESSES OF TIME PERCEPTION	BYULLETEN SIBIRSKOY MEDITSINY			Russian	Article						perception of time; phase interactions; EEG rhythms		The present study pursued to investigate the role of phase interactions between EEG rhythms in the process of the perception of time. The purpose of the study was to analyse the dependence of these interactions on the type and stage of the activity being performed, as well as on the individual characteristics of a human. For this purpose, 27 boys and 29 girls, all university students, were asked to reproduce and measure short intervals of time (200 and 800 ms), during which their EEG was recorded in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, according to the system 10-20%. While studying phase interactions between EEG rhythms, we used wavelet bispectral analysis and calculated the bicoherence function. As it follows from the conducted research, most often close phase interactions are observed between the gamma-rhythm and other rhythms of EEG or between different frequencies of the gamma-rhythm. It was established that the phase interactions under study were influenced by the factors of "sex", "activity type", and "activity stage". The study showed correlations of phase interactions with the levels of intellect, extraversion, neuroticism, with the particularities of the lateral organisation of brain, and the accuracy of time perception.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the acute effects of tDCS on cortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with an affective disorder. Eighteen patients diagnosed with an affective disorder and experiencing a depressive episode participated in a sham-controlled study of tDCS, each receiving a session of active (2 mA for 20 minutes) and sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The effects of tDCS on EEG activity were assessed after each session using event-related potentials (ERP) and measurement of spectral activity during a visual working memory (VWM) task. We observed task and intervention dependent effects on both ERPs and task-related alpha and theta activity, where active compared to sham stimulation resulted in a significant reduction in the N2 amplitude and reduced theta activity over frontal areas during memory retrieval. In summary a single session of anodal tDCS stimulation to the left DLPFC during a major depressive episode resulted in modulated brain activity evident in task-related EEG. Effects on the N2 and frontal theta activity likely reflect modulated activity in the medial frontal cortex and hence indicate that the after-effects of tDCS extend beyond the direct focal effects to the left DLPFC.

In this paper, nonnegative Tucker decomposition which is one model of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is used to fuse two kinds of bioelectricity signals (EEG and sEMG) and extract multi-domain features of EEG and sEMG signals for classification which contain time, frequency, and space domains. In the first step the EEG and sEMG data are transformed into multidimensional information using continuous wavelet transform and the 4-D EEG-sEMG tensor is established. Then the tensor is decomposed into four components (spatial components, spectral components, temporal components and category components) and the core tensor is the feature extracted. The feature after being eliminated and compressed are fed into KNN, LDA and SVM classifiers for pattern recognition, and a comparison is done in single EEG analysis, single sEMG analysis and both EEG and sEMG analysis. An experiment about 10 healthy participants' upper limb movements was carried out to verify the validity of this algorithm. The result implied that NTF is a meaningful and valuable synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction method which may be promising in power-assist rehabilitation robot control.

A Three-Step Multimodal Analysis Framework for Modeling Corticomuscular Activity With Application to Parkinson's Disease	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Blind source separation; corticomuscular coupling; data fusion; Multimodal; Parkinson's disease (PD)	SPATIAL ATTENTION; MOTOR CORTEX; FMRI DATA; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; EEG; MOVEMENT; CONNECTIVITY; MODULATION; SEPARATION	Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple datasets such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides a useful tool for understanding human motor control systems. A popular conventional method to assess corticomuscular coupling has been the pair-wise magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant EMG recordings. However, there are certain limitations associated with the MSC, including the difficulty in robustly assessing group inference, only dealing with two types of datasets simultaneously and the biologically implausible assumption of pair-wise interactions. To overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose assessing corticomuscular coupling by combining multiset canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA) and joint independent component analysis (jICA). The proposed method takes advantage of the M-CCA and jICA to ensure that the extracted components are maximally correlated across multiple datasets and meanwhile statistically independent within each dataset. Simulations were performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. We also applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG, EMG, and behavior data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results reveal highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and corresponding spatial activation patterns. In addition to the expected motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation patterns demonstrate enhanced occipital connectivity in the PD subjects, consistent with previous medical findings.

EEG-informed fMRI analysis during a hand grip task: estimating the relationship between EEG rhythms and the BOLD signal	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; motor task; BOLD; GLM; neural correlates; alpha rhythm; beta rhythm	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; LEFT PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; HIGH-RESOLUTION; MOTOR ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ALPHA-RHYTHM; MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION	In the last decade, an increasing interest has arisen in investigating the relationship between the electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of brain activity, such as EEG and (BOLD) fMRI. In particular, changes in BOLD have been shown to be associated with changes in the spectral profile of neural activity, rather than with absolute power. Concurrently, recent findings showed that different EEG rhythms are independently related to changes in the BOLD signal: therefore, it would be also important to distinguish between the contributions of the different EEG rhythms to BOLD fluctuations when modeling the relationship between the two signals. Here we propose a method to perform EEG-informed fMRI analysis where the changes in the spectral profile are modeled, and, at the same time, the distinction between rhythms is preserved. We compared our model with two other frequency-dependent regressors modeling using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data from healthy subjects performing a motor task. Our results showed that the proposed method better captures the correlations between BOLD signal and EEG rhythms modulations, identifying task-related, well localized activated volumes. Furthermore, we showed that including among the regressors also EEG rhythms not primarily involved in the task enhances the performance of the analysis, even when only correlations with BOLD signal and specific EEG rhythms are explored.

Entrainment of Brain Oscillations by Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							CORTICAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; ALPHA-PHASE; FREQUENCY; EXCITABILITY; INHIBITION; MODULATION; SYNCHRONY; TACS	Novel methods for neuronal entrainment [1-4] provide the unique opportunity to modulate perceptually relevant brain oscillations [5, 6] in a frequency-specific manner and to study their functional impact on distinct cognitive functions. Recently, evidence has emerged that tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) can modulate cortical oscillations [7-9]. However, the study of electrophysiological effects has been hampered so far by the absence of concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Here, we applied 10 Hz tACS to the parieto-occipital cortex and utilized simultaneous EEG recordings to study neuronal entrainment during stimulation. We pioneer a novel approach for simultaneous tACS-EEG recordings and successfully separate stimulation artifacts from ongoing and event-related cortical activity. Our results reveal that 10 Hz tACS increases parieto-occipital alpha activity and synchronizes cortical oscillators with similar intrinsic frequencies to the entrainment frequency. Additionally, we demonstrate that tACS modulates target detection performance in a phase-dependent fashion highlighting the causal role of alpha oscillations for visual perception.

This contribution presents an efficient scheme to extract features in phase space by exploiting the theoretical results derived in nonlinear dynamics for motor imagery tasks recognition. To remodel the single nonlinear sequence is to reveal variety of information hidden in the origin series by its phase space reconstruction (PSR), and maintaining the original information continuity. The phase space features (PSF) were extracted by the amplitude-frequency analysis (AFA) method in the state space of EEG signals (AFAPS). The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers based on the AFAPS features are used to classify two Graz datasets used in BCI Competition 2003 and 2005. The results have shown that the LDA classifiers based on PSF outperformed most of other similar studies on the same Graz dataset in terms of the competition criterions. The features extracted by the proposed scheme contain the nonlinear information which helps to improve the classification results in the BCI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The underlying mechanism and involved neuronal levels of this attentional gain control are still a matter of debate. Here, we investigated the influence of intermodal attention on different levels of auditory processing in humans. It is known that the activity of the cochlear amplifier can be modulated by efferent neurons of the medial olivocochlear complex. We used distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements to monitor cochlear activity during an intermodal cueing paradigm. Simultaneously, central auditory processing was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) with a steady-state paradigm targeting early cortical responses and analysis of alpha oscillations reflecting higher cognitive control of attentional modulation. We found effects of selective attention at all measured levels of the auditory processing: DPOAE levels differed significantly between periods of visual and auditory attention, showing a reduction during visual attention, but no change during auditory attention. Primary auditory cortex activity, as measured by the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), differed between conditions, with higher ASSRs during auditory than visual attention. Furthermore, the analysis of cortical oscillatory activity revealed increased alpha power over occipitoparietal and frontal regions during auditory compared with visual attention, putatively reflecting suppression of visual processing. In conclusion, this study showed both enhanced processing of attended acoustic stimuli in early sensory cortex and reduced processing of distracting input, both at higher cortical levels and at the most peripheral level of the hearing system, the cochlea.

We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

Polysomnography is used in clinical diagnostics but is also applicable to animal models. Rodent sleep architecture (nocturnal) differs from larger diurnal mammals, including humans, increasing the translational potential of non-rodent species to the clinic. This study aimed to characterize the response to pharmacological agents known to affect sleep structure and EEG activity in a non-human primate (Macaca fascicularis) using telemetry-based polysomnography. Methods: Animals were instrumented with telemetry transmitters for continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring combined with video. EEG, EMG and EOG were monitored for 12 to 24 h to establish baseline values, followed by administration of pharmacological agents (saline, d-amphetamine, diazepam or caffeine). Results: Amphetamine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, by oral administration (PO)) significantly reduced total sleep time, including the duration of both non-rapid eye movement [ NREM] sleep and REM sleep. It also decreased EEG activity in low frequencies (i.e., 4-6 Hz) during wakefulness. Diazepam (2 mg/kg, PO) did not significantly alter sleep duration, but importantly reduced EEG activity in low frequencies (approximately 2-12 Hz) during wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep. Finally, caffeine (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO) decreased both NREM and REM sleep duration. In addition, spectral analysis revealed important decreases in low frequency activity (i.e., 1-8 Hz) during wakefulness with a parallel increase in high frequency activity (i.e., 20-50 Hz) during NREM sleep. Discussion: As these observations are similar to previously reported pharmacological effects in humans, results support that EEG, EOG and EMG monitoring by telemetry in Cynomolgus monkeys represents a useful non-clinical model to investigate and quantify drug-induced sleep disturbances.

Forty-five players were tested for topic comprehension by a questionnaire administered before and after solo playing of the game Peacemaker (Impact Games 2007), during which electroencephalography and other physiological signals were measured. Play lasted for one hour, with a break at half time. We used the Bloom taxonomy to distinguish levels of difficulty in demonstrated learning-with the first five levels assigned to fixed questions-and "gain" scores to measure actual value of demonstrated learning. We present the analysis of the physiological signals recorded during game play and their relationship to learning scores. Main effects related to biomarkers of vigilance and motivation-including decreased delta power and relatively balanced fronto-hemispheric alpha powerpredicted learning at the analysed Bloom levels. Results suggest multiple physiological dispositions that support on-task learning styles, and highlight the utility of the psychophysiological method for interpreting game-based learning evaluations.

Permutation entropy (PE) has been developed to describe the relative occurrence of each of these motifs. However, PE has few limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif, and its sensitivity to noise. To minimize those limitations, Weighted-Permutation Entropy (WPE) was proposed as a modification version of PE to improve complexity measuring for times series. This paper presents an approach by incorporating WPE into the analysis of different physiological states namely EEG time series. Three different EEG physiological states, eye-closed (EC), eye-open (EO), and visual oddball task (VOT) were included to examine ability of WPE to identify and discriminate different physiological states. The classification using WPE has achieved the results with accuracy of 87% between EC and EO states, and 83% between EO and VOT, respectively, using linear discrimination analysis. The results showed the potential of WPE to be a promising feature for nonlinear analysis in different physiological states of brain. It was also observed that WPE also could be used as marker for large artifact with low frequency such as eye-blink.

Prestimulation phase predicts the TMS-evoked response	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial magnetic stimulation; electroencephalography; phase; power; excitability	CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; EEG; EXCITABILITY; FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULATION; DYNAMICS	Prestimulation oscillatory phase and power in particular frequency bands predict perception of at-threshold visual stimuli and of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced phosphenes. These effects may be due to changes in cortical excitability, such that certain ranges of power and/or phase values result in a state in which a particular brain area is more receptive to input, thereby biasing behavior. However, the effects of trial-by-trial fluctuations in phase and power of ongoing oscillations on the brain's electrical response to TMS itself have thus far not been addressed. The present study adopts a combined TMS and electroencepalography (EEG) approach to determine whether the TMS-evoked response is sensitive to momentary fluctuations in prestimulation phase and/or power in different frequency bands. Specifically, TMS was applied to superior parietal lobule while subjects performed a short-term memory task. Results showed that the prestimulation phase, particularly within the beta (15-25 Hz) band, predicted pulse-by-pulse variations in the global mean field amplitude. No such relationship was observed between prestimulation power and the global mean field amplitude. Furthermore, TMS-evoked power in the beta band fluctuated with prestimulation phase in the beta band in a manner that differed from spontaneous brain activity. These effects were observed in areas at and distal to the stimulation site. Together, these results confirm the idea that fluctuating phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations create "windows of excitability" in the brain, and they give insight into how TMS interacts with ongoing brain activity on a pulse-by-pulse basis.

Polysomnography is used in clinical diagnostics but is also applicable to animal models. Rodent sleep architecture (nocturnal) differs from larger diurnal mammals, including humans, increasing the translational potential of non-rodent species to the clinic. This study aimed to characterize the response to pharmacological agents known to affect sleep structure and EEG activity in a non-human primate (Macaca fascicularis) using telemetry-based polysomnography. Methods: Animals were instrumented with telemetry transmitters for continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring combined with video. EEG, EMG and EOG were monitored for 12 to 24 h to establish baseline values, followed by administration of pharmacological agents (saline, d-amphetamine, diazepam or caffeine). Results: Amphetamine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, by oral administration (PO)) significantly reduced total sleep time, including the duration of both non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep and REM sleep. It also decreased EEG activity in low frequencies (i.e., 4-6 Hz) during wakefulness. Diazepam (2 mg/kg, PO) did not significantly alter sleep duration, but importantly reduced EEG activity in low frequencies (approximately 2-12 Hz) during wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep. Finally, caffeine (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO) decreased both NREM and REM sleep duration. In addition, spectral analysis revealed important decreases in low frequency activity (i.e., 1-8 Hz) during wakefulness with a parallel increase in high frequency activity (i.e., 20-50 Hz) during NREM sleep. Discussion: As these observations are similar to previously reported pharmacological effects in humans, results support that EEG, EOG and EMG monitoring by telemetry in Cynomolgus monkeys represents a useful non-clinical model to investigate and quantify drug-induced sleep disturbances.

Deep brain stimulation suppresses pallidal low frequency activity in patients with phasic dystonic movements	BRAIN			English	Article						deep brain stimulation; dystonia; oscillations; electrophysiology; basal ganglia	FIELD POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; PRIMARY GENERALIZED DYSTONIA; INTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; CERVICAL DYSTONIA	Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus alleviates involuntary movements in patients with dystonia. However, the mechanism is still not entirely understood. One hypothesis is that deep brain stimulation suppresses abnormally enhanced synchronized oscillatory activity within the motor cortico-basal ganglia network. Here, we explore deep brain stimulation-induced modulation of pathological low frequency (4-12 Hz) pallidal activity that has been described in local field potential recordings in patients with dystonia. Therefore, local field potentials were recorded from 16 hemispheres in 12 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for severe dystonia using a specially designed amplifier allowing simultaneous high frequency stimulation at therapeutic parameter settings and local field potential recordings. For coherence analysis electroencephalographic activity (EEG) over motor areas and electromyographic activity (EMG) from affected neck muscles were recorded before and immediately after cessation of high frequency stimulation. High frequency stimulation led to a significant reduction of mean power in the 4-12 Hz band by 24.8 +/- 7.0% in patients with predominantly phasic dystonia. A significant decrease of coherence between cortical EEG and pallidal local field potential activity in the 4-12 Hz range was revealed for the time period of 30 s after switching off high frequency stimulation. Coherence between EMG activity and pallidal activity was mainly found in patients with phasic dystonic movements where it was suppressed after high frequency stimulation. Our findings suggest that high frequency stimulation may suppress pathologically enhanced low frequency activity in patients with phasic dystonia. These dystonic features are the quickest to respond to high frequency stimulation and may thus directly relate to modulation of pathological basal ganglia activity, whereas improvement in tonic features may depend on long-term plastic changes within the motor network.

The aim of this work is to detect a real-time Epileptic seizure. We designed an algorithm which decomposes EEG signals of a database, normal and epileptics, by the lifted wavelet transform (LWT), in order to extract the features. To reduce the time allocated to the classification decision and the parameter space, we applied the principal component analysis (PCA). Among 46 lifted wavelets, the SVM classifier has enabled us to choose, the most appropriate lifted wavelets for this type of application. Our work shows that if we choose the good sampling frequency and good lifted wavelet, with only one vector feature, we can achieved in real time the best classification rate, with a maximum of specificity and a sensitivity.

We aim to fill this gap by analyzing sleep records of a twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome extending our focus on presleep wakefulness and sleep spindling. Methods - We performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the 7q11.23 region of a 17 years old dizygotic opposite-sex twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome. Polysomnography of laboratory sleep at this age was analyzed and followed-up after 1.5 years by ambulatory polysomnography. Sleep stages scoring, EEG power spectra and sleep spindle analyses were carried out. Results - The twin brother showed reduced levels of amplification for all of the probes in the 7q11.23 region indicating a typical deletion spanning at least 1.038 Mb between FKBP6 and CLIP2. The results of the twin sister showed normal copy numbers in the investigated region. Lower sleep times and efficiencies, as well as higher slow wave sleep percents of the twin brother were evident during both recordings. Roughly equal NREM, Stage 2 and REM sleep percents were found. EEG analyses revealed state and derivation-independent decreases in cc power, lack of an a spectral peak in presleep wakefulness, as well as higher NREM sleep a peak frequency in the twin brother. Faster sleep spindles with lower amplitude and shorter duration characterized the records of the twin brother. Spectra show a striking reliability and correspondence between the two situations (laboratory vs. home records). Conclusion - Alterations in sleep and specific neural oscillations including the alpha/sigma waves are inherent aspects of Williams syndrome.

Does electroencephalogram phase variability account for reduced P3 brain potential in externalizing disorders?

We sought to understand if group differences in task-induced phase-locking in electroencephalographic (EEG) delta and theta frequencies may account for P3-externalizing associations. Methods: Adult males (N = 410) completed a visual oddball task and frontal and parietal P3-related delta- and theta-band phase-invariant evoked energy and inter-trial phase-locking measures were investigated with respect to the externalizing spectrum, including substance dependence, adult antisociality, and childhood disruptive disorders. We hypothesized that P3-related phase-locking is weaker in externalizing-diagnosed individuals and this might mediate prior findings of reduced evoked P3 energy. Results: Reductions in both evoked energy and phase-locking, in both frequency bands, at both scalp sites, were associated with greater odds of externalizing diagnoses. Generally, adding phase-locking to evoked energy came with better prediction model fit. Moreover, reduced theta-band phase-locking partially mediated the effects of within-frequency evoked energy on externalizing prediction. Conclusions: Inter-trial phase-locking underlying P3 appears to be an important distinction between externalizing and control subjects. Significance: This cross-trial phase-variability for externalizing-diagnosed individuals might reflect deficient top-down "tuning'' by neuromodulatory systems.

To test the hypothesis that aging processes modulate the brain connectivity network, EEG recording was conducted on 113 healthy volunteers. They were divided into three groups in accordance with their ages: 36 Young (15-45 years), 46 Adult (50-70 years), and 31 Elderly (>70 years). To evaluate the stability of the investigated parameters, a subgroup of 10 subjects underwent a second EEG recording two weeks later. Graph theory functions were applied to the undirected and weighted networks obtained by the lagged linear coherence evaluated by eLORETA on cortical sources. EEG frequency bands of interest were: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), beta2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz). The spectral connectivity analysis of cortical sources showed that the normalized Characteristic Path Length (.) presented the pattern Young>Adult>Elderly in the higher alpha band. Elderly also showed a greater increase in delta and theta bands than Young. The correlation between age and lambda showed that higher ages corresponded to higher lambda in delta and theta and lower in the alpha2 band; this pattern reflects the age-related modulation of higher (alpha) and decreased (delta) connectivity. The Normalized Clustering coefficient (gamma) and small-world network modeling (sigma) showed non-significant age-modulation. Evidence from the present study suggests that graph theory can aid in the analysis of connectivity patterns estimated from EEG and can facilitate the study of the physiological and pathological brain aging features of functional connectivity networks.

We studied EEG correlates of the "awakening reaction" in the different domains of frequency, time and cortical topography, along with the intrinsic connectivity within both the task-positive and the linguistic network. Methods: EEG recorded before and after midazolam administration has been submitted to spectral power analysis, sLORETA analysis and intrinsic connectivity analysis within both functional networks. Results: A critical change in the power spectrum profile was observed after midazolam: a) the power between 1 and 12 Hz decreased, reaching its maximum difference with respect to pre-infusion at about 7 Hz and b) the power between 12 and 30 Hz increased, with a maximum difference at about 15 Hz. At the same time, midazolam induced significant connectivity changes, especially for these two frequency bands, within both functional networks. Conclusions: We advance some hypotheses about certain aspects of the recovery from the MCS both in terms of anatomo-functional correlations and functional brain systems and we make inferences about the role that some kind of 'catatonic' symptoms might play in determining and/or maintaining this peculiar clinical state.

The wavelet coherence based on Monte Carlo method (MC-WTC) is effective in measuring the time-frequency coherence of neural signals, but it generates large intermediate data and could not be applied in real-time neural signal analysis. We develop a parallelised MC-WTC method with general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), namely G-MC-WTC, which speeds up the calculations using the CUDA toolkit. Simulation data showed that it can improve the runtime performance by almost 200 times. This method has been applied to a visual-auditory EEG data and to obtain the coherence information between different brain areas in real time. The result revealed a coherence difference in. band at left temporal lobe. This method may become a useful tool for studying the cooperation mechanisms of brain regions in cognitive processes.

Sleep misperception, EEG characteristics and Autonomic Nervous System activity in primary insomnia: A retrospective study on polysomnographic data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Insomnia; Sleep misperception; Hyperarousal; Power spectrum analyses; Heart rate variability; Beta EEG activity	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MESOGRADE AMNESIA; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; TIME-ESTIMATION; K-COMPLEX; DISTURBANCE; ACTIVATION; SPINDLES; AROUSAL; MODEL	Misperception of Sleep Onset Latency, often found in Primary Insomnia, has been cited to be influenced by hyperarousal, reflected in EEG- and ECG-related indices. The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the association between Central Nervous System (i.e. EEG) and Autonomic Nervous System activity in the Sleep Onset Period and the first NREM sleep cycle in Primary Insomnia (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 11). Furthermore, the study examined the influence of elevated EEG and Autonomic Nervous System activity on Stage2 sleep-protective mechanisms (K-complexes and sleep spindles). Confirming previous findings, the Primary Insomnia-group overestimated Sleep Onset Latency and this overestimation was correlated with elevated EEG activity. A higher amount of beta EEG activity during the Sleep Onset Period was correlated with the appearance of K-complexes immediately followed by a sleep spindle in the Primary Insomnia-group. This can be interpreted as an extra attempt to protect sleep continuity or as a failure of the sleep-protective role of the K-complex by fast EEG frequencies following within one second. The strong association found between K-alpha (K-complex within one second followed by 8-12 Hz EEG activity) in Stage2 sleep and a lower parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System dominance (less high frequency HR) in Slow-wave sleep, further assumes a state of hyperarousal continuing through sleep in Primary Insomnia.

Here we present a new means of resolving this spatial organization using a combination of non-invasive observables (EEG, MEG, and MRI), model-based estimates of spectrotemporal patterns of neural activation, and multivariate pattern analysis. The method exploits both the fine-grained temporal patterning of auditory cortical responses and the millisecond scale temporal resolution of EEG and MEG. Participants listened to 400 English words while MEG and scalp EEG were measured simultaneously. We estimated the location of cortical sources using the MRI anatomically constrained minimum norm estimate (MNE) procedure. We then combined a form of multivariate pattern analysis (representational similarity analysis) with a spatiotemporal searchlight approach to successfully decode information about patterns of neuronal frequency preference and selectivity in bilateral superior temporal cortex. Observed frequency preferences in and around Heschl's gyrus matched current proposals for the organization of tonotopic gradients in primary acoustic cortex, while the distribution of narrow frequency selectivity similarly matched results from the fMRI literature. The spatial maps generated by this novel combination of techniques seem comparable to those that have emerged from fMRI or ECOG studies, and a considerable advance over earlier MEG results.

The results are compared with data from previous experiments with increased load in the form of additional cognitive tasks, when there was an increase of gamma responses by "success" of the job subjects. In this study, the responses to set-stimuli were observed significant lower (relative to prestimulus period) in all groups of subjects that were treated as inhibition of gamma activity. Significant differences in the levels of power gamma -band between the groups were identified by comparing the set up steps (forming and testing), and frequency-bands. The second important difference is the absence of differences in the dynamics of power patterns gamma2 (41-60 Hz) between groups of subjects depending on the "success" of the job. We present arguments to substantiate the "paradoxical" results in the conditions of use of the plant model.	[Dumenko, V. N.; Kozlov, M. K.; Cheremushkin, E.

A HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor control; force production; motor cortex; sensory cortex	MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; AWAKE MONKEYS; FORCE; ACTIVATION; EXERCISE; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS	Encoding muscular force output during voluntary contractions is widely perceived to result, at least in part, from modulations in neuronal activity within the sensorimotor cortex. However the underlying electrophysiological phenomena associated with increased force output remains unclear. This study directly assessed sensorimotor cortex activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in humans performing isometric knee-extensions at a range of discrete torque levels. Fifteen healthy males (age 24 (s = 5) years) completed one familiarization and one experimental trial. Participants performed a cyclic series of 60 isometric knee-extension contractions with the right leg, including 15 contractions of a 5-s duration at each of four discrete torque levels: 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% of maximal voluntary torque (MVT). Isometric knee-extension torque, quadriceps electromyography and EEG were recorded at rest and throughout all the contractions. EEG (0.5-50 Hz) was collected using a 32-channel active-electrode cap. A voxel-based low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis calculated cortical activation within the sensorimotor cortex (one of 27 MNI coordinates) for the entire 0.5-50-Hz range (cortical current density (CCD)), as well as for each constituent frequency band in this range (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma). Gamma band (30-50 Hz) cortical activity increased with contraction torque (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P = 0.03). Conversely, activity within the other frequency bands was not modulated by torque (P >= 0.09), nor was overall CCD (P = 0.11). Peripheral neuromuscular activation (quadriceps electromyography (EMG) amplitude) demonstrated distinct increases between each torque level (P < 0.01). In conclusion, sensorimotor cortical activity within the gamma band demonstrated an overall increase with contraction torque, whereas both CCD and each of the other constituent frequency bands were not modulated by increments in torque magnitude during isometric knee-extension contractions up to 60%MVT.

Neural synchronization to environmental rhythms (entrainment) is hypothesized to shape human perception, as rhythmic structure acts to temporally organize cortical excitability. In the current human electroencephalography study, we investigated how behavior is influenced by neural oscillatory dynamics when the rhythmic fluctuations in the sensory environment take on a naturalistic degree of complexity. Listeners detected near-threshold gaps in auditory stimuli that were simultaneously modulated in frequency (frequency modulation, 3.1 Hz) and amplitude (amplitude modulation, 5.075 Hz); modulation rates and types were chosen to mimic the complex rhythmic structure of natural speech. Neural oscillations were entrained by both the frequency modulation and amplitude modulation in the stimulation. Critically, listeners' target-detection accuracy depended on the specific phase-phase relationship between entrained neural oscillations in both the 3.1-Hz and 5.075-Hz frequency bands, with the best performance occurring when the respective troughs in both neural oscillations coincided. Neural-phase effects were specific to the frequency bands entrained by the rhythmic stimulation. Moreover, the degree of behavioral comodulation by neural phase in both frequency bands exceeded the degree of behavioral modulation by either frequency band alone. Our results elucidate how fluctuating excitability, within and across multiple entrained frequency bands, shapes the effective neural processing of environmental stimuli. More generally, the frequency-specific nature of behavioral comodulation effects suggests that environmental rhythms act to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional neural states.

In addition to ERP measures, reduced modulations of EEG alpha, reflecting top-down control required to inhibit irrelevant information, have revealed attentional deficits in schizophrenia and its prodromal stage. Employing a three-stimulus novelty oddball task, nose-referenced 48-channel ERPs were recorded from 22 clinical high-risk (CHR) patients and 20 healthy controls detecting target tones (12% probability, 500 Hz; button press) among nontargets (76%, 350 Hz) and novel sounds (12%). After current source density (CSD) transformation of EEG epochs (-200 to 1000 ms), event-related spectral perturbations were obtained for each site up to 30 Hz and 800 ms after stimulus onset, and simplified by unrestricted time-frequency (TF) principal components analysis (PCA). Alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) as measured by TF factor 610-9 (spectral peak latency at 610 ms and 9 Hz; 31.9% variance) was prominent over right posterior regions for targets, and markedly reduced in CHR patients compared to controls, particularly in three patients who later developed psychosis. In contrast, low-frequency event-related synchronization (ERS) distinctly linked to novels (260-1; 16.0%; mid-frontal) and N1 sink across conditions (130-1; 3A%; centro-temporoparietal) did not differ between groups. Analogous time-domain CSD-ERP measures (temporal PCA), consisting of N1 sink, novelty mismatch negativity (MMN), novelty vertex source, novelty P3, P3b, and frontal response negativity, were robust and closely comparable between groups.

Distinct slow and fast cortical theta dynamics in episodic memory retrieval	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Cortex; Theta oscillations; Episodic memory retrieval; Recollection; Interference	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; OUTPUT INTERFERENCE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG; RECALL; SYNCHRONIZATION; POWER; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PREDICT	Brain oscillations in the theta frequency band (3-8 Hz) have been shown to be critically involved in human episodic memory retrieval. In prior work, both positive and negative relationships between cortical theta power and retrieval success have been reported. This study examined the hypothesis that slow and fast cortical theta oscillations at the edges of the traditional theta frequency band are differentially related to retrieval success. Scalp EEG was recorded in healthy human participants as they performed a cued-recall episodic memory task. Slow (similar to 3 Hz) and fast (similar to 7 Hz) theta oscillations at retrieval were examined as a function of whether an item was recalled or not and as a function of the items' output position attest. Recall success typically declines with output position, due to increases in interference level. The results showed that slow theta power was positively related but fast theta power was negatively related to retrieval success. Concurrent positive and negative episodic memory effects for slow and fast theta oscillations were dissociable in time and space, showing different time courses and different spatial locations on the scalp. Moreover, fast theta power increased from early to late output positions, whereas slow theta power was unaffected by items' output position. Together with prior work, the results suggest that slow and fast theta oscillations have distinct functional roles in episodic memory retrieval, with slow theta oscillations being related to processes of recollection and conscious awareness, and fast theta oscillations being linked to processes of interference and interference resolution.

Although the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) has been widely explored, the importance of induced components and the precise oscillations of EEG signal have been ignored. In the present study, we conducted the event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) of the EEG oscillatory activities relevant to the color change detection mechanisms under unintentional condition. The results showed that the deviant stimuli elicited larger ERS than standards in the delta band. The ERD responses were bigger to deviant stimuli than that to standards in the beta band. These data provided new evidence to unintentional automatic visual change detection.

In the present study we explored the biological origin of MUSO by simultaneous recordings of EEG, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), arterial blood pressure, respiration and Laser Doppler flowmetry. We used a head-up tilt test in order to check whether MUSO might relate to Mayer waves in arterial blood pressure, known to be enhanced by the tilting procedure. MUSO were detected in 8 out of 10 subjects during rest and showed a striking monochromatic spectrum (0.07-0.14 Hz). The spatial topography of MUSO was complex, showing multiple foci variable across subjects. While the head-up tilt test increased the relative power of Mayer waves, it had no effect on MUSO. On the other hand, the relative spectral power of 0.1 Hz oscillations in EEG, NIRS and blood pressure signals were positively correlated across subjects in the tilted condition. Eight subjects showed a coherence between MUSO and NIRS/arterial blood pressure. Moreover, MUSO at different electrode sites demonstrated coherence not reducible to volume conduction, thus indicating that MUSO are unlikely to be generated by one source. We related our experimental findings to known biological phenomena being generated at about 0.1 Hz, i.e.: arterial blood pressure, cerebral and skin vasomotion, respiration and neuronal activity. While no definite conclusion can yet be drawn as to an exact physiological mechanism of MUSO, we suggest that these oscillations might be of a rather extraneuronal origin reflecting cerebral vasomotion.

One possible role of oscillatory activity is to assure the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). Here we review the possibility that rhythmic activity at theta, alpha, and gamma frequencies serve distinct functional roles during WM maintenance. Specifically, we propose that gamma-band oscillations are generically involved in the maintenance of WM information. By contrast, alpha-band activity reflects the active inhibition of task-irrelevant information, whereas theta-band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items. Finally, we address the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in enabling alpha-gamma and theta-gamma codes for distinct WM information.

The focus of our work is to determine through the electroencephalogram (EEG) if such a hypoxic-ischemic insult has occurred such that neuro-protective treatment can be sought within this period. At present, there are no defined biomarkers in the EEG that are currently being used to help classify if a hypoxic ischemia insult has occurred. However, micro-scale transients in the form of spikes, sharps and slow waves exists that could provide precursory information whether a hypoxic-ischemic insult has occurred or not. In our previous studies we have successfully automatically identified spikes with high sensitivity and selectivity in the conventional 64Hz sampled EEG. This paper details the significant advantage that can be obtained in using high frequency 1024Hz sampled EEG for sharp wave detection over the typically employed 64Hz sampled EEG. This advantage is amplified when a combination of wavelet Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (WT-Type-2-FLS) classifiers are used to identify the sharp wave transients. By applying WT-Type-2-FLS to the 1024Hz EEG record and to the same down-sampled 64Hz EEG record we demonstrate, how the sharp wave transients detection increases significantly for high resolution 1024Hz EEG over 64Hz EEG. The WT-Type- 2-FLS algorithm performance was assessed over 3 standardised time periods within the first 8 hours, post occlusion of a fetal sheep, in utero. 1024Hz EEG results demonstrate the algorithm detected sharps with overall performance rates of 85%, 92%, and 87% in the Early/Mid and Late-latent phases of injury, respectively as compared to 25%, 55% and 31% in the 64Hz EEG. These results demonstrate the power of Wavelet Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System at detecting sharp waves in 1024Hz EEG and suggest that there should be a movement toward recording high frequency EEG for analysis of hypoxic ischemic micro-scale transients that does not occur at present.

We conducted cortical EEG and thalamic cellular recordings in freely moving or lightly anesthetized rats to explore the impact of CBZ within the intact corticothalamic (CT)-thalamocortical (TC) network, more specifically on CT 5-9-Hz and TC spindle (10-16-Hz) oscillations. Two to three successive 5-9-Hz waves were followed by a spindle in the cortical EEG. A single systemic injection of CBZ (20mg/kg) induced a significant increase in the power of EEG 5-9-Hz oscillations and spindles. Intracellular recordings of glutamatergic TC neurons revealed 5-9-Hz depolarizing wave-hyperpolarizing wave sequences prolonged by robust, rhythmic spindle-frequency hyperpolarizing waves. This hybrid sequence occurred during a slow hyperpolarizing trough, and was at least 10 times more frequent under the CBZ condition than under the control condition. The hyperpolarizing waves reversed at approximately -70mV, and became depolarizing when recorded with KCl-filled intracellular micropipettes, indicating that they were GABA(A) receptor-mediated potentials. In neurons of the GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus, the principal source of TC GABAergic inputs, CBZ augmented both the number and the duration of sequences of rhythmic spindle-frequency bursts of action potentials. This indicates that these GABAergic neurons are responsible for the generation of at least the spindle-frequency hyperpolarizing waves in TC neurons. In conclusion, CBZ potentiates GABA(A) receptor-mediated TC spindle oscillations. Furthermore, we propose that CT 5-9-Hz waves can trigger TC spindles.

However, the neural basis for these processes in the human hippocampus remains unknown because it is difficult to directly measure neural signals in the human hippocampus. This study investigated hippocampal neural oscillations involved in encoding novel environments during spatial navigation in a virtual environment. Seven epileptic patients with implanted intracranial hippocampal depth electrodes performed three sessions of virtual environment navigation. Each session consisted of a navigation task and a location-recall task. The navigation task consisted of eight blocks, and in each block, the participant navigated to the location of four different objects and was instructed to remember the location of the objects. After the eight blocks were completed, a location-recall task was performed for each of the four objects. Intracranial electroencephalography data were monitored during the navigation tasks. Theta (5-8 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations were lower in the first block (novel environment) than in the eighth block (familiar environment) of the navigation task, and significantly increased from block one to block eight. By contrast, low-gamma (31-50 Hz) oscillations were higher in the first block than in the eighth block of the navigation task, and significantly decreased from block one to block eight. Comparison of sessions with high recall performance (low error between identified and actual object location) and low recall performance revealed that high-gamma (51-100 Hz) oscillations significantly decreased from block one to block eight only in sessions with high recall performance. These findings suggest that delta, theta, and low-gamma oscillations were associated with encoding of environmental novelty and high-gamma oscillations were important for the successful encoding of environmental novelty.

Outward signs are abrupt and repeated interruptions in the flow of conversation or actions while subjective experience is that of a total and uncontrollable emptying of the mind. In the very limited bibliography regarding TB, the phenomenon is thought to be conceptualized as a disturbance of consciousness that can be attributed to stoppages of continuous information processing due to an increase in the volume of information to be processed. In an attempt to investigate potential expression of the phenomenon on the functional properties of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, an EEG study was contacted in schizophrenic patients with persisting auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) who additionally exhibited TBs. In this case, we hypothesized that the persistent and dense AVHs could serve the role of an increased information flow that the brain is unable to process, a condition that is perceived by the person as TB. Phase synchronization analyses performed on EEG segments during the experience of TBs showed that synchrony values exhibited a long-range common mode of coupling (grouped behavior) among the left temporal area and the remaining central and frontal brain areas. These common synchrony-fluctuation schemes were observed for 0.5 to 2 s and were detected in a 4-s window following the estimated initiation of the phenomenon. The observation was frequency specific and detected in the broad alpha band region (6-12 Hz). The introduction of synchrony entropy (SE) analysis applied on the cumulative synchrony distribution showed that TB states were characterized by an explicit preference of the system to be functioned at low values of synchrony, while the synchrony values are broadly distributed during the recovery state. Our results indicate that during TB states, the phase locking of several brain areas were converged uniformly in a narrow band of low synchrony values and in a distinct time window, impeding thus the ability of the system to recruit and to process information during this time window.

Visual scoring of HFOs is tiring, time consuming, highly subjective and requires a great deal of mental concentration. Due to the recent explosion of HFOs research, development of a robust automated detector is expected to play a vital role in studying HFOs and their relationship to epileptogenesis. Therefore, a handful of automated detectors have been introduced in the literature over the past few years. In fact, all the proposed methods have been associated with high false-positive rates, which essentially arising from filtered sharp transients like spikes, sharp waves and artifacts. In order to specifically minimize false positive rates and improve the specificity of HFOs detection, we proposed a new approach, which is a combination of tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), morphological component analysis (MCA) and complex Monet wavelet (CMW). The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: The proposed method results in a sensitivity of 96.77%, a specificity of 85.00% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 07.41%. Compared to this, the classical CMW method applied directly on the signals without pre-processing by TQWT-MCA achieves a sensitivity of 98.71%, a specificity of 18.75%, and an FDR of 29.95%. The proposed method may be considered highly accurate to distinguish between transients with and without HFOs. Consequently, it is remarkably reliable and robust for the detection of HFOs.

Electroencephalogram is brain signal that allows gaining the understanding of the complex inner mechanisms of the brain and abnormal brain waves and plays a vital role in diagnosis of different brain disorders. We have carried out a study for nonlinear feature extracted from epochs of epileptic signal; and classification of EEG signals with feature from various epochs of the signal. The nonlinear properties of the time series are investigated by calculating Hurst exponent values during epileptic seizures, and in the interval between the seizures. During uncontrolled electrical discharges, the long-range correlation effects do appear in EEG signals in all cases, as the Hurst exponent values were above 0.5. It is observed that the proposed method can provide better performance, is much efficient and faster as compared to the time-frequency based techniques while classifying and discriminating seizure activities.

Differences in paracingulate connectivity associated with epileptiform discharges and uncontrolled seizures in genetic generalized epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Cerebellum; Generalized spike and wave discharges; Basal ganglia; Resting-state functional connectivity; Thalamus; Default mode network	JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; WAVE DISCHARGES; EEG-FMRI; PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY; BRAIN; SPIKE	Objective Patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) frequently continue to have seizures despite appropriate clinical management. GGE is associated with changes in the resting-state networks modulated by clinical factors such as duration of disease and response to treatment. However, the effect of generalized spike and wave discharges (GSWDs) and/or seizures on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is not well understood. Methods We investigated the effects of GSWD frequency (in GGE patients), GGE (patients vs. healthy controls), and seizures (uncontrolled vs. controlled) on RSFC using seed-based voxel correlation in simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (EEG/fMRI) data from 72 GGE patients (23 with uncontrolled seizures) and 38 healthy controls. We used seeds in paracingulate cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and posterior cingulate cortex to examine changes in cortical-subcortical resting-state networks and the default mode network (DMN). We excluded from analyses time points surrounding GSWDs to avoid possible contamination of the resting state. Results (1) Higher frequency of GSWDs was associated with an increase in seed-based voxel correlation with cortical and subcortical brain regions associated with executive function, attention, and the DMN; (2) RSFC in patients with GGE, when compared to healthy controls, was increased between paracingulate cortex and anterior, but not posterior, thalamus; and (3) GGE patients with uncontrolled seizures exhibited decreased cerebellar RSFC. Significance Our findings in this large sample of patients with GGE (1) demonstrate an effect of interictal GSWDs on resting-state networks, (2) provide evidence that different thalamic nuclei may be affected differently by GGE, and (3) suggest that cerebellum is a modulator of ictogenic circuits.

The data driven calculation is solely based on the imaginary part of the cross-spectrumas opposed to the imaginary part of coherency. In principle, the method quantifies how strong a synchronization between a distinct pair of brain sources is present in the data. As an input of the method all pairs of pre-defined locations inside the brain can be used which is computationally exhaustive. In contrast to that, reference sources can be used that have been identified by any source reconstruction technique in a prior analysis step. We introduce different variants of the method and evaluate the performance in simulations. As a particular advantage of the proposed methodology, we demonstrate that the novel approach is capable of investigating differences in brain source interactions between experimental conditions or with respect to a certain baseline. For measured data, we first show the application on resting state MEG data where we find locally synchronized sources in the motor-cortex based on the sensorimotor idle rhythms. Finally, we show an example on EEG motor imagery data where we contrast hand and foot movements. Here, we also find local interactions in the expected brain areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Brain electrical activity bears the emotional cues needed for emotion detection, but very modest research has been done to extract those cues. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Packet Transform (DT-CWPT) time-frequency features from electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect emotions together with an analysis of brain activity in different emotional states. Firstly, DT-CWPT is used to extract time-frequency emotional features. Then non-redundant and most discriminating emotional features are selected through singular value decomposition (SVD), QR factorization with column pivoting (QRcp) and F-Ratio based feature selection (FS) method. The reduced emotional feature set is used to classify emotion using support vector machine (SVM) and validated by leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Results confirm the robustness and consistency in classification of emotions from EEG signals and significant correlation between participants' self assessed ratings with emotional features. It also gives an analysis of activities in brain region during different emotional states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Spencer, KM; Ghorashi, S				Spencer, Kevin M.; Ghorashi, Shahab			Oscillatory dynamics of Gestalt perception in schizophrenia revisited	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; visual perception; Gestalt; gamma oscillation; event-related potential	NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; EEG; ORGANIZATION; STIMULATION; ABNORMALITIES; DYSFUNCTION; COGNITION	Background: Abnormalities in gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) have been proposed to reflect neural circuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia. Oscillations in the gamma band are thought to play an important role in visual perception, mediating the binding of visual features into coherent objects. However, there is relatively little evidence to date of deficits in gamma-mediated processes associated with Gestalt perception in schizophrenia. Methods: Fourteen healthy control subjects (HC) and 17 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) discriminated between illusory Kanisza Squares and No-Square control stimuli, indicating their judgment with a manual button press. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG was computed with the Morlet wavelet transform. Time-frequency maps of phase locking factor (PLF) values were calculated for stimulus- and response-locked oscillations. Results: HC and SZ did not differ in reaction time, error rate, an early ERR effect associated with Gestalt processing, nor an early visual-evoked gamma oscillation. Two response-locked high gamma effects had greater PLF for Square than No-Square stimuli in HC, and the reverse pattern in SZ. One of these effects was correlated with thought disorder symptom ratings in SZ. Conclusions: SZ demonstrated abnormalities in gamma oscillations associated with the perception of Gestalt objects, while their early visual-evoked gamma activity was mostly normal, contrary to previous results. This study supports the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillations are sensitive to aspects of psychosis.

The present study consists of a comprehensive behavioral- and molecular-genetic analysis of such parameters in a large community sample (N=4,026) of adolescent twins and their parents, genotyped for 527,829 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Biometric heritability estimates ranged from .49 to .85, with a median of .78. The additive effect of all SNPs (SNP heritability) varied across electrodes. Although individual SNPs were not significantly associated with EEG parameters, several genes were associated with delta power. We also obtained an association between the GABRA2 gene and beta power (p<.014), consistent with findings reported by others, although this did not survive Bonferroni correction. If EEG parameters conform to a largely polygenic model of inheritance, larger sample sizes will be required to detect individual variants reliably.

EEG Analysis in Resting State and during a Memorization Task in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Subjective Cognitive Impairment	VI LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (CLAIB 2014)	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Latin American Biomedical Engineering Conference (CLAIB)	OCT 29-31, 2014	Parana, ARGENTINA	Reg Council Biomed Engn Latin America, Argentine Soc Bioengineering, Nacl Univ Entre Rios, Engn Sch, Int Federat Med & Biol Engn, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc		EEG; Alzheimer's disease; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Subjective Cognitive Impairment; Principal Component Analysis	TIME	Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI) are brain disorders with a high risk to progress to Alzheimer's disease. This work investigates the possible EEG differences in MCI and SMC subjects, with respect to control subjects (CS), both during rest and cognitive stimulation. EEG data were analyzed by decomposing the power spectral density into frequency sub-bands and by calculating the power-law beta exponent parameter. Moreover, from a nonlinear point of view, also Higuchi's fractal dimension and Poincare plot indexes were estimated. Feature extraction was performed by using the Principal Component Analysis method, in an effort to distinguish CS, MCI and SCI patients. Results show that some parameters present statistically significant differences between SCI and control subjects, whereas MCI patients present intermediate values between the other two groups. The use of the principal component analysis allows a preliminary visual separation of CS and SCI, even if the difficulty in distinguishing MCI subjects persists.

Localizing Movement-Related Primary Sensorimotor Cortices with Multi-Band EEG Frequency Changes and Functional MRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; FINGER MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATIONS; FMRI; RHYTHMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; LOCALIZATION; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION	Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in multiple frequency bands can be observed during functional activity of the cerebral cortex. An important question is whether activity of focal areas of cortex, such as during finger movements, is tracked by focal oscillatory EEG changes. Although a number of studies have compared EEG changes to functional MRI hemodynamic responses, we can find no previous research that relates the fMRI hemodynamic activity to localization of the multiple EEG frequency changes observed in motor tasks. In the present study, five participants performed similar thumb and finger movement tasks in parallel EEG and functional MRI studies. We examined changes in five frequency bands (from 5-120 Hz) and localized them using 256 dense-array EEG (dEEG) recordings and high-resolution individual head models. These localizations were compared with fMRI localizations in the same participants. Results showed that beta-band (14-30 Hz) desynchronizations (power decreases) were the most robust effects, appearing in all individuals, consistently localized to the hand region of the primary motor cortex, and consistently aligned with fMRI localizations.

Twenty-two healthy subjects were assessed for their psychosomatic states using the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) and were divided into two groups: normal (I) and preneurotic (II-IV). The EEG was measured during emotional tasks (relaxed, pleasant, and unpleasant sessions) using audio-visual stimuli and was analyzed using coherence analysis. The coherence values of the preneurotic group in the theta band in 120 s to 150 s of the pleasant and unpleasant sessions and in the beta band in the relaxed session were significantly larger than the values of the normal group. The coherence values of the normal and preneurotic groups in the alpha 2 band in 30 s to 60 s and 90 s to 120 s in the unpleasant sessions were significantly larger than the values in the relaxed session. The increase in theta activity suggests that an intuitive and irrational response to the emotional situation would appear, and the beta activity indicates that attention would be paid more to external than to internal situations in the preneurotic group. The alpha activity shows that the mentally internal response to the unpleasant situation would be prompt in the normal group, while in contrast the response would be delayed in the preneurotic group. These results suggest that the information processing of emotional stimuli in the brain differ depending on the mental state. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is certainly a source of basic and interesting information to be extracted using specific and appropriate techniques. The most important aspect in processing EEG signals is to use less co-lateral assets and instrumentation in order to carried out a possible diagnosis; this is the approach of early diagnosis. Advanced estimate spectral analysis can reveal new information encompassed in EEG signals by means of specific parameters or indices. The research proposes a multidimensional approach with a combined use of decimated signal diagonalization (DSD) as basis from which it is possible to work by finding appropriate signal windows for revealing expected information and overcoming signal processing limitations encountered in quantitative EEG. Important information, about the state of the patient under observation, must be extracted from calculated DSD bispectrum. For this aim, it is useful to define an assessment index about the dynamic process associated with the analyzed signal. This information is measured by means of entropy, since the degree of order/disorder of the recorded EEG signal will be reflected in the obtained DSD bispectrum. The general advantage of multidimensional approach is to reveal eventual stealth frequencies "in space and in time" giving a topological vision to be correlated to physical areas which these frequencies emerge from. Long term and sleeping EEG recorded are analyzed, and the results obtained are of interest for an accurate diagnosis of the patient's clinical condition.

Methods: The time course of EEG power density (1-40 Hz) during the SOP was examined in thirty subjects (SOI patients: N = 10, SMI patients: N = 10, GS: N = 10). Results: The EEG power of the beta2 frequency band (18-29.75 Hz) was significantly lower in SOI than in SMI in the period preceding sleep onset. The alpha power was significantly higher for the SMI group compared to GS before sleep onset. Despite the lack of statistical significance, several differences in EEG dynamics were observed in SOI compared to two other groups: delta power increased slower after sleep onset; beta2 and 3 (18-29.75 and 30-39.75 Hz) power decrease less abruptly before sleep onset; beta1 (15-17.75 Hz) power increase through the whole SOP. Conclusions: The lower level of beta2 frequency band in SOI and the differences in dynamics in delta and beta bands may suggest that a mechanism other than hyperarousal participates in etiology of SOI. Significance: SOI and SMI patients have different spectral characteristics in SOP, thus future studies should avoid the inclusion of mixed insomnia samples.

Pattern changes of EEG oscillations and BOLD signals associated with temporal lobe epilepsy as revealed by a working memory task	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Alpha and theta rhythms; Working memory; Temporal lobe epilepsy	FUNCTIONAL MRI; MOTOR CORTEX; DEFAULT MODE; 3 T; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; ALPHA	Background: It is known that the abnormal neural activity in epilepsy may be associated to the reorganization of neural circuits and brain plasticity in various ways. On that basis, we hypothesized that changes in neuronal circuitry due to epilepsy could lead to measurable variations in patterns of both EEG and BOLD signals in patients performing some cognitive task as compared to what would be obtained in normal condition. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the cerebral areas involved in EEG oscillations versus fMRI signal patterns during a working memory (WM) task in normal controls and patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). The study included six patients with left MTLE-HS (left-HS group) and seven normal controls (control group) matched to the patients by age and educational level, both groups undergoing a blocked design paradigm based on Sternberg test during separated EEG and fMRI sessions. This test consisted of encoding and maintenance of a variable number of consonant letters on WM. Results: EEG analysis for the encoding period revealed the presence of theta and alpha oscillations in the frontal and parietal areas, respectively. Likewise, fMRI showed the co-occurrence of positive and negative BOLD signals in both brain regions. As for the maintenance period, whereas EEG analysis revealed disappearance of theta oscillation, fMRI showed decrease of positive BOLD in frontal area and increase of negative BOLD in the posterior part of the brain. Conclusions: Generally speaking, these patterns of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals were observed for both control and left-HS groups. However, the data also revealed remarkable differences between these groups that are consistent with the hypothesis of reorganization of brain circuitry associated with epilepsy.	[Ozelo, Helka F.

EEG extended source localization: Tensor-based vs. conventional methods	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Tensor decomposition; Space-time-frequency analysis; Space-time-wave-vector analysis; Distributed source localization	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MEG; RESOLUTION; DECOMPOSITIONS; SCALP; DISCHARGES; ALGORITHMS; COMPLEXITY; ELECTRODES	The localization of brain sources based on EEG measurements is a topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the last decades and many different source localization algorithms have been proposed. However, their performance is limited in the case of several simultaneously active brain regions and low signal-to-noise ratios. To overcome these problems, tensor-based preprocessing can be applied, which consists in constructing a space-time-frequency (STF) or space-time-wave-vector (STWV) tensor and decomposing it using the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the accurate localization of extended sources based on the results of the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed study of the tensor-based preprocessing methods, including an analysis of their theoretical foundation, their computational complexity, and their performance for realistic simulated data in comparison to conventional source localization algorithms such as sLORETA, cortical LORETA (cLORETA), and 4-ExSo-MUSIC. Our objective consists, on the one hand, in demonstrating the gain in performance that can be achieved by tensor-based preprocessing, and, on the other hand, in pointing out the limits and drawbacks of this method. Finally, we validate the STF and STWV techniques on real measurements to demonstrate their usefulness for practical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG/MEG studies do lack the resolution or coverage to address the highly debated question whether single gamma activity patterns are linked with multiple cognitive modules or alternatively each pattern associates with a specific cognitive module, within the same coherent perceptual task. One way to disentangle these issues would be to provide direct identification of their sources, by combining different techniques. Here, we directly examined these questions by performing simultaneous EEG/fMRI using an ambiguous perception paradigm requiring holistic integration. We found that distinct gamma frequency sub-bands reflect different neural substrates and cognitive mechanisms when comparing object perception states vs. no categorical perception. A low gamma sub-band (near 40 Hz) activity was tightly related to the decision making network, and in particular the anterior insula. A high gamma sub-band (approximate to 60 Hz) could be linked to early visual processing regions. The demonstration of a clear functional topography for distinct gamma sub-bands within the same task shows that distinct gamma-band modulations underlie sensory processing and perceptual decision mechanisms.

Several retrospective studies reported that surgical removal of areas generating HFOs was associated with a good seizure outcome. Recent reports suggested that ripple (80-200 Hz) HFO patterns co-existed with different background EEG activities. We hypothesized that the coexisting background EEG pattern may distinguish physiological from epileptic ripples. Methods: Rates of HFOs were analyzed in intracranial EEG recordings of 22 patients. Additionally, ripple patterns were classified for each channel depending either as coexisting with a flat or oscillatory background activity. A multi-variate analysis was performed to determine whether removal of areas showing the above EEG markers correlated with seizure outcome. Results: Removal of areas generating high rates of 'fast ripples (>200 Hz)' and ' ripples on a flat background activity' showed a significant correlation with a seizure-free outcome. In contrast, removal of high rates of 'ripples' or 'ripple patterns in a continuously oscillating background' was not significantly associated with seizure outcome. Conclusion: Ripples occurring in an oscillatory background activity may be suggestive of physiological activity, while those on a flat background reflect epileptic activity. Significance: Consideration of coexisting background patterns may improve the delineation of the epileptogenic areas using ripple oscillations.

We used time-frequency single-trial EEG analyses (i.e., inter-trial coherence; ITC), to examine cortical phase synchrony in children with normal hearing (NH), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and ANSD. Methods: Single trial time-frequency analyses were performed on cortical auditory evoked responses from 41 NH children, 91 children with ANSD and 50 children with SNHL. The latter two groups included children who received intervention via hearing aids and cochlear implants. ITC measures were compared between groups as a function of hearing loss, intervention type, and cortical maturational status. Results: In children with SNHL, ITC decreased as severity of hearing loss increased. Children with ANSD revealed lower levels of ITC relative to children with NH or SNHL, regardless of intervention. Children with ANSD who received cochlear implants showed significant improvements in ITC with increasing experience with their implants. Conclusions: Cortical phase coherence is significantly reduced as a result of both severe-to-profound SNHL and ANSD. Significance: ITC provides a window into the brain oscillations underlying the averaged cortical auditory evoked response. Our results provide a first description of deficits in cortical phase synchrony in children with SNHL and ANSD. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This kind of stimulus-dependent activity has been observed across different sensory modalities, suggesting a generalized role of prefrontal beta during abstract WM processing of quantitative magnitude information. However, until now the available empirical evidence for such quantitative WM representation remains critically limited to the retention of periodic stimulus frequencies. In the present experiment, we used retrospective cueing to examine the quantitative WM processing of stationary (intensity) and temporal (duration) attributes of a previously presented tactile stimulus. We found parametric modulations of prefrontal beta activity during cued WM processing of each type of quantitative information, in a very similar manner as had before been observed only for periodic frequency information. In particular, delayed prefrontal beta modulations systematically reflected the magnitude of the retrospectively selected stimulus attribute and were functionally linked to successful behavioral task performance. Together, these findings converge on a generalized role of stimulus-dependent prefrontal beta-band oscillations during abstract scaling of analog quantity information in human WM.

In this interdisciplinary study, we have outlined some general fundamental design principles of the field-theoretical view of the oscillating agent as well as of coherent social systems. From the systems point of view, ordered social systems by their own intrinsic nature are interpreted as coherent activations via the mind-field medium of social agents. Consequently, this study not only provides the major conceptual assumptions of the proposed (Oscillation-Based Multi-Agent System [OSIMAS]) paradigm but also presents an electroencephalography-based inductive experimental validation framework and some empirical results to validate major OSIMAS assumptions. Based on the conceptual and experimental findings, we constructed modelling framework and presented oscillations-based micro (coupled oscillator energy exchange model) and macro (MEPSM1) simulation models. We also systemized some other studies and applications, which are most relevant to the work presented here.

However, the neural oscillatory correlates of this modulation effect of WM on the Stroop task are still largely unknown. In the present study, behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 32 healthy participants during their performance of the single Stroop task and the same task with a concurrent WM task. We observed that the Stroop interference effect represented in both response times (RTs) and theta-band event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) magnitude reduced under the dual-task condition compared with the single-task condition. The reduction of interference in theta-band ERSP was further positively correlated with interference reduction in RTs, and was mainly explained by the source in the left middle frontal gyrus. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the effect of concurrent WM tasks on the reduction of the Stroop interference effect can be indexed by EEG oscillations in theta-band rhythm in the centro-frontal regions and this modulation was mediated by the reduced cognitive control under the concurrent WM task.

Characterizing motif dynamics is therefore key to understanding the functioning of such systems. Here we propose a method to define and quantify the temporal variability and time scales of electroencephalogram ( EEG) motifs of resting brain activity. Given a triplet of EEG sensors, links between them are calculated by means of linear correlation; each pattern of links (i.e., each motif) is then associated to a symbol, and its appearance frequency is analyzed by means of Shannon entropy. Our results show that each motif becomes observable with different coupling thresholds and evolves at its own time scale, with fronto-temporal sensors emerging at high thresholds and changing at fast time scales, and parietal ones at low thresholds and changing at slower rates. Finally, while motif dynamics differed across individuals, for each subject, it showed robustness across experimental conditions, indicating that it could represent an individual dynamical signature.

Three subjects (two males and one woman) were volunteered to participate in this experiment. The human brain is a complex and nonlinear system; for this reason we have to try like one. We used some complexity measure techniques based on Fractal Dimension in time and frequency to extract the features patterns in EEG signal Motor Imagery. The algorithms that were selected to get the Fractal Dimension (features extraction) on time Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Higuchis Method and on frequency was used Power Spectral Density method. Based on these algorithms we can distinguish between three states relaxing, imagination of right and left hand. After this, these features are classified with two different methods Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, the experimental results are considered to apply in a BCI application to move two robotics hands (left and right hand).

Identification of Visual Evoked Potentials in EEG detection by Emprical Mode Decomposition	2014 11TH INTERNATIONAL MULTI-CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, SIGNALS & DEVICES (SSD)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices (SSD)	FEB 11-14, 2014	Barcelona, SPAIN	Univ Politecnica Catalunya, BarcelonaTECH, IEEE, Philadelphia Univ, Chemnitz Univ Technol, Ajuntament Castelldefels		Evoked Potentials; EEG; Empirical Mode Decomposition		Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) are referred to electrical potentials due to brief visual stimuli which can be recorded from scalp overlying visual cortex. A way to measure VEPs is through encephalogram (EEG). VEPs are very important because they can quantify functional integrity of the optic pathway. Their study allows to detect abnormalities that affect the visual pathways or visual cortex in the brain, and so methods that permit to identify VEPs components in EEG signals must be defined. However, the background activity measured from EEG hides VEPs components because they have a low voltage. So it is necessary to define a robust method to extract features, which best describe these potentials of interest. In this work Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is used to separate the EEG components and to detect VEPs. EMD decomposes a signal into components named Intrinsic Mode Functions (IFM). The results, obtained from the study of EEG records of a normal person, suggest that IMFs may be used to determine VEPs in EEG and to obtain important information related to brain activity by a time and frequency analysis of IMF components. It is well comparable with the known Wavelet Transform method, but it is characterized from a greater simplicity of implementation because the basis used in the analysis is generated by the same analyzed signal.

Study design OERPs to phenylethyl alcohol were measured in 13 infants, between 23 and 41 days of age. The odor was delivered with a computer-controlled olfactometer. Recording electrodes were applied using the 10-20 system. Data from electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, and C4 were analyzed by MatLab's Letswave toolbox (Andre Mouraux, Brussels, Belgium) using the canonical time-domain averaging as well as the time-frequency analyzing method. Results Ten of 13 infants finished the recording session. We observed OERPs in 7 of these 10 infants. Recordings were best in electrodes Fz and Cz. The N1 peak was visible at 328 ms followed by P2 at 505 ms. In addition, the time-frequency analysis had an increase in low frequencies (4-7 Hz) around 550 ms after odor presentation. Conclusions We were able to record OERPs in infants. The time-domain averaging as well as the time-frequency analysis was of value for data analysis.

Certain features of the resting EEG are altered in chronic alcoholics and their offspring, and have been proposed as biomarkers for alcoholism. Spontaneous brain oscillations are also affected by pharmacological manipulations, but the spectral and spatial characteristics of these changes are not clear. This study examined effects of the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting paradigm and alcohol challenge on the spatial profile of spontaneous MEG and EEG oscillations. Whole-head MEG and scalp EEG signals were acquired simultaneously from healthy social drinkers (n = 17) who participated in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Power of the signal was calculated with Fast Fourier Transform and was decomposed into its constituent theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8 12 Hz), and beta (15-20 Hz) frequency bands. High-resolution structural MRI images were additionally obtained from all participants and used to constrain distributed minimum norm inverse source power estimates. The spatial estimates of the main generator nodes were in agreement with studies using a combined fMRI-EEG approach. Alpha band oscillations dominated the spectral profile and their source was estimated to the medial parieto-occipital area. Power in theta and beta bands was weaker overall and their sources were estimated to a more focal medial prefrontal area. EO and EC manipulation most strongly modulated power in the alpha band, but a wide-band power increase was observed during the EC condition. Alcohol intoxication increased alpha power, particularly during the EC condition. Application of this methodology to cohorts of chronic alcoholics or individuals at risk could potentially provide insight into the neural basis of oscillatory differences that may be predictive of the vulnerability to alcoholism.

Frequency characteristics of cortical activity associated with perturbations to upright stability	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Phase resetting; Perturbation-evoked potential; Balance	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; BALANCE REACTIONS; EEG; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; THETA; GENERATION; DYNAMICS; RESET	Cortical evoked potentials are evident in the control of whole-body balance reactions in response to transient instability. The focus of this work is VS continue to advance understanding of the potential cortical contributions to bipedal balance control. Temporally unpredictable postural perturbations evoke a negative potential (N1), which has drawn parallels to error-related negativity (ERN) as well as visual and auditory evoked N1 responses. The mechanism underlying the generation of event-related potentials (ERPs) has been a matter of debate for the past few decades. While the evoked model proposes that ERPs are generated by the addition of fixed latency and fixed polarity responses, the phase reorganization model suggests that ERPs are the result of stimulus-induced phase reorganization of the ongoing oscillations. Previous studies have suggested phase reorganization as a possible mechanism in auditory N1, visual N1 and error-related negativity (ERN). The purpose of the current study was to explore the frequency characteristics of the cortical responses to whole-body balance perturbations. Perturbations were evoked using a lean and release protocol. The results revealed a significant power increase and phase-locking of delta, theta, alpha, and beta band activity during perturbation-evoked NI. This may suggest that the stimulus-induced phase reorganization of the ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could account for the features of cortical ERPs in response to perturbation of upright stability.

Spatio-temporal images of absorption and scattering coefficients were recovered from PTZ- and saline-treated rats' brains using a finite element-based DOT image reconstruction algorithm. After pulse artifacts were eliminated, an independent component (IC) analysis was conducted for blind-source separation of the optical signals. The retrieved ICs were compared with concurrently measured EEG signals, and the selected components were further refined using K-means clustering and spectrum analysis tools. The results revealed that changes in absorption and scattering coefficients emerge sooner than changes in the EEG signal and a low frequency peak signal of 0.3 Hz in the spectra of light scattering images after PTZ injection. This low frequency caused by slow volume changes in CNS cells was not detected in control animals. Brain regions that we detected early changes in optical signals and activation maps were confirmed in an additional 3 PTZ-treated rats using the DOT system and concurrent EEG recordings obtained from multiple brain regions. Our results show that the analysis of scattered diffuse light is a sensitive and reliable modality for detecting changes in neural activity associated with generalized seizure and other CNS disorders with the additional benefit of providing access to physiological parameters that other modalities cannot access.

However, vasomotor waves and cardiorespiratory pulsations influence indirect measures of brain function, such as the functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. How strongly physiological oscillations correlate with spontaneous BOLD signals is not known, partially due to differences in the data-sampling rates of different methods. Recent ultrafast inverse imaging sequences, including magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), enable critical sampling of these signals. In this study, we describe a multimodal concept, referred to as Hepta-scan, which incorporates synchronous MREG with scalp electroencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, noninvasive blood pressure, and anesthesia monitoring. Our preliminary results support the idea that, in the absence of aliased cardiorespiratory signals, VLFFs in the BOLD signal are affected by vasomotor and electrophysiological sources. Further, MREG signals showed a high correlation coefficient between the ventromedial default mode network (DMNvmpf) and electrophysiological signals, especially in the VLF range. Also, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and vasomotor waves were found to correlate with DMNvmpf. Intriguingly, usage of shorter time windows in these correlation measurements produced significantly (p < 0.05) higher positive and negative correlation coefficients, suggesting temporal nonstationary behavior between the measurements. Focus on the VLF range strongly increased correlation strength.

A combination of oscillatory rhythms has also been described for specific functions, with or without predominance of one specific frequency-band. In a simultaneous fMRI-EEG study at 3 T we studied the relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and the power of EEG frequency bands. As a methodological approach, we applied Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) and dual regression analysis for fMRI resting state data. EEG power for the alpha, beta, delta and theta-bands were extracted from the structures forming the DMN in a region-of-interest approach by applying Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). A strong link between the spontaneous BOLD response of the left parahippocampal gyrus and the delta-band extracted from the anterior cingulate cortex was found. A positive correlation between the beta-1 frequency power extracted from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the spontaneous BOLD response of the right supplementary motor cortex was also established. The beta-2 frequency power extracted from the PCC and the precuneus showed a positive correlation with the BOLD response of the right frontal cortex. Our results support the notion of beta-band activity governing the "status quo" in cognitive and motor setup. The highly significant correlation found between the delta power within the DMN and the parahippocampal gyrus is in line with the association of delta frequencies with memory processes. We assumed "ongoing activity" during "resting state" in bringing events from the past to the mind, in which the parahippocampal gyrus is a relevant structure. Our data demonstrate that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations within the DMN are associated with different EEG-bands and strengthen the conclusion that this network is characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature created by combination of different brain rhythms subserving different putative functions.

The goal of this work was to analyze the stress level of a human player during gaming session. It analyzes certain human states recorded by Electroencephalograhy (EEG) during playing computer games activity. However, the classification procedure was offline, thus the recording and analysis will not interfere/disturb the game player. From that recording, it was possible to differentiate certain player states. The games used for the experiment were different challenges in racing games and first person shooter with different types of difficulty levels. The acquired data was preprocessed to remove mostly eye movement artifacts. Then, several features were extracted mostly related to the time and frequency domain of the signal. In this experiment, EEG analysis was done in which two stress levels were compared viz., excited state and relaxed state.	[Abhishek, Appaji M.; Suma, H.

Following his suggestion, Beck started experimental studies on the electrical brain activity of animals, especially in response to sensory stimulation. Beck placed electrodes directly on the surface of brain to localize brain potentials that were evoked by sensory stimuli. He observed spontaneous fluctuations in the electrical brain activity and noted that these oscillations ceased after sensory stimulation. He published these findings concerning the electrical brain activity, such as spontaneous fluctuations, evoked potentials, and desynchronization of brain waves, in 1890 in the German language Centralblatt fur Physiologie. Moreover, an intense polemic arose between physiologists of that era on the question of who should claim being the founder of electroencephalography. Ultimately, Richard Caton from Liverpool showed that he had performed similar experiments in monkeys years earlier. Nevertheless, Beck added new elements to the nature of electrical brain activity. In retrospect, next to Richard Caton, Adolf Beck can be regarded, together with Hans Berger who later introduced the method to humans, as one of the founders of electroencephalography. Soon after his success, Beck got a chair at the Department of Physiology of the University at Lemberg, now Lviv National Medical University.

It is necessary to achieve a better relationship between human and vehicle. A driver's information, which can be obtained from steering operation, pedal operation, camera images and physiological information, particularly is crucial to find a method to determine a driver's operational intention. It is beneficial to find a method to determine a driver's operational intention. Therefore, we have focused on the brain activities in the biological information. The time frequency analysis such as FFT has been used in the traditional decomposition of the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, these conventional methods can only use two-dimensional data. In this paper, we described that the driver's EEG during car following was decomposed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and we investigated the feature factor of longitudinal behavior for recognize and judgment from that decomposition result. PARAFAC analysis has known as a mu EEG analysis of multi-dimensional data. In previous research [1], we investigated the driver's EEG of during lane change maneuver using the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Consequently, all subjects have two common factors of the frequency component which exist in the 5-7 Hz and 8-13 Hz region. Those factors were located at the right frontpolar cortex and the precuneus posterior cingulate cortex, and this factor was changed by the driver's mental state during visual recognition and judgment. In this paper, we estimated the driver's intention from a driver's EEG using source current distribution estimation with Hierarchical Bayesian method and the sparse logistic regression. From the estimation results, the estimation accuracy of driver's intention was higher than about 70 % of three subject's in the lateral operation.

Early identification of patients whose seizures are refractory to antiepileptic drugs is important in considering the use of alternative treatments. Although idiopathic epilepsy is regarded as having a significantly lower risk factor of developing refractory epilepsy, still a subset of patients with idiopathic epilepsy might be refractory to medical treatment. In this study, we developed an effective method to predict the refractoriness of idiopathic epilepsy. Sixteen EEG segments from 12 well-controlled patients and 14 EEG segments from 11 refractory patients were analyzed at the time of first EEG recordings before antiepileptic drug treatment. Ten crucial EEG feature descriptors were selected for classification. Three of 10 were related to decorrelation time, and four of 10 were related to relative power of delta/gamma. There were significantly higher values in these seven feature descriptors in the well-controlled group as compared to the refractory group. On the contrary, the remaining three feature descriptors related to spectral edge frequency, kurtosis, and energy of wavelet coefficients demonstrated significantly lower values in the well-controlled group as compared to the refractory group. The analyses yielded a weighted precision rate of 94.2%, and a 93.3% recall rate. Therefore, the developed method is a useful tool in identifying the possibility of developing refractory epilepsy in patients with idiopathic epilepsy.

Because this network is supposed to be engaged in tasks which require agent identification, it has been labeled the evaluation network (e-network). The present study used self-versus other-generated movement sounds (long jumps) and electroencephalography (EEG) in order to unravel the neural dynamics of agent identification for complex auditory information. Participants (N= 14) performed an auditory selfother identification task with EEG. Data was then subjected to a subsequent standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analysis (source localization analysis). Differences between conditions were assessed using t-statistics (corrected for multiple testing) on the normalized and log-transformed current density values of the sLORETA images. Three-dimensional sLORETA source localization analysis revealed cortical activations in brain regions mostly associated with the e-network, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex (bilaterally in the alpha-1-band and right-lateralized in the gamma-band) and the temporo-parietal junction (right hemisphere in the alpha-1-band). Taken together, the findings are partly consistent with previous functional neuroimaging studies investigating unimodal visual or multimodal agent identification tasks (cf. e-network) and extent them to the auditory domain. Cortical activations in brain regions of the e-network seem to have functional relevance, especially the significantly higher cortical activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Total Power (Ptot), Median Frequency (F50), Spectral Edge Frequency (F95) and Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR) were calculated at each volume concentration. BSR data were analyzed using doubly repeated measures anova. Neither isoflurane nor sevoflurane could be included in analysis of F50, F95 and Ptot because of extensive burst suppression; Methoxyflurane data were analyzed using RM anova. ResultsThere was a significant interaction between anaesthetic and concentration on BSR [F(4,22)=10.65, p<0.0001]. For both isoflurane and sevoflurane, BSR increased with concentration. Isoflurane caused less suppression than sevoflurane at 1.5 MAC and at final 1 MAC while methoxyflurane caused virtually no burst suppression. Methoxyflurane concentration had a significant effect on F50 [F(2,20)=3.83, p=0.04], F95 [F(2,20)=4.03, p=0.03] and Ptot [F(2,20)=5.22, p=0.02]. Decreasing methoxyflurane from 2 to 1 MAC increased F50 and F95. Ptot increased when concentration decreased from 1.5 to 1 MAC and tended to be higher at 1 MAC than at 2 MAC. Conclusions and Clinical relevanceIsoflurane and sevoflurane suppressed chicken EEG in a dose-dependent manner. Higher concentrations of methoxyflurane caused an increasing degree of synchronization of EEG. Isoflurane and sevoflurane suppressed EEG activity to a greater extent than did methoxyflurane at equivalent MAC multiples. Isoflurane caused less suppression than sevoflurane at intermediate concentrations. These results indicate the similarity between avian and mammalian EEG responses to inhalant anaesthetics and reinforce the difference between MAC and anaesthetic effects on brain activity in birds.

The time courses of ERD/ERS during motor imagery were investigated by calculating multiple autocorrelation before power spectrum analysis. Then the averaged power spectrums on specific frequency bands were sent to a K-nearest classifier to validate the separability between different classes. Compared with the result of power spectrum, the multiple autocorrelation performed better in attenuating noise and enhancing the separability between different classes with a small quantity of electrodes (C3 and C4).

Recent findings indicate, however, that, in turn, the efficacy of TMS depends on the state of ongoing cortical oscillations. Whereas power and phase of electro-myographic (EMG) activity recorded from the hand muscles as well as neural synchrony between cortex and hand muscles are known to influence the effect of TMS, to date, no study has shown an influence of the phase of cortical oscillations during wakefulness. We applied single-pulse TMS over the motor cortex and recorded motor-evoked potentials along with the electroencephalogram (EEG) and EMG. We correlated phase and power of ongoing EEG and EMG signals with the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. We also investigated the functional connectivity between cortical and hand muscle activity (corticomuscular coherence) with the MEP amplitude. EEG and EMG power and phase in a frequency band around 18 Hz correlated with the MEP amplitude. High beta-band (similar to 34 Hz) corticomuscular coherence exhibited a positive linear relationship with the MEP amplitude, indicating that strong synchrony between cortex and hand muscles at the moment when TMS is applied entails large MEPs. Improving upon previous studies, we demonstrate a clear dependence of TMS-induced motor effects on the state of ongoing EEG phase and power fluctuations. We conclude that not only the sampling of incoming information but also the susceptibility of cortical communication flow depends cyclically on neural phase.

This paper discusses on the changes in the electrical activity of the human brain related to distinct sleep disorders. The EEG data has been collected from PhysioNet database. The purpose of the research is to detect the different human sleep disorders through Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal with time-frequency analysis by receiving information from the internal changes of brain state. The paper presents the detection of sleep disorders based on some salient features of EEG signal. For this purpose seven different disorders have been specified such as sleep breathing disorder, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, periodic leg movement disorder, insomnia disorder, narcolepsy disorder, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy disorder, bruxism disorder and with them one healthy subject. Several EEG records have been collected for these sleep disorders and analyzed using discrete wavelet transform. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract different significant features from the analyzed signal by computing the subband coefficients and evaluating statistical measures like energy, variance, waveform length and standard deviation which are used to detect different sleep disorders.

Setting of ICA Parameters for Marking Artefactual Components: Application to Resting-State Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACTS; TASK DEMANDS; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI DATA; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; SCANNER; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION	Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow for a non-invasive investigation of cerebral functions with high temporal and spatial resolution. The main challenge of such integration is the removal of the pulse artefact (PA) that affects EEG signals recorded in the magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Often applied techniques for this purpose are Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The combination of OBS and ICA is increasingly used, since it can potentially improve the correction performed by each technique separately. The present study is focused on the OBS-ICA combination and is aimed at providing the optimal ICA parameters for PA correction in resting-state EEG data, where the information of interest is not specified in latency and amplitude as in, for example, evoked potential. A comparison between two intervals for ICA calculation and four methods for marking artefactual components was performed. The performance of the methods was discussed in terms of their capability to 1) remove the artefact and 2) preserve the information of interest. The analysis included 12 subjects and two resting-state datasets for each of them. The results showed that none of the signal lengths for the ICA calculation was highly preferable to the other. Among the methods for the identification of PA-related components, the one based on the wavelets transform of each component emerged as the best compromise between the effectiveness in removing PA and the conservation of the physiological neuronal content.

J	Rey, HG; Fried, I; Quiroga, RQ				Rey, Hernan Gonzalo; Fried, Itzhak; Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian			Timing of Single-Neuron and Local Field Potential Responses in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; INFORMATION; OBJECT; SELECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; FREQUENCY; SPIKES; EEG	The relationship between the firing of single cells and local field potentials (LFPs) has received increasing attention, with studies in animals [1-11] and humans [12-14]. Recordings in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) have demonstrated the existence of neurons with selective and invariant responses [15], with a relatively late but precise response onset around 300 ms after stimulus presentation [16-18] and firing only upon conscious recognition of the stimulus [19]. This represents a much later onset than expected from direct projections from inferotemporal cortex [16, 18]. The neural mechanisms underlying this onset remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed a joint analysis of single-cell and LFP responses during a visual recognition task. Single-neuron responses were preceded by a global LFP deflection in the theta range. In addition, there was a local and stimulus-specific increase in the single-trial gamma power. These LFP responses correlated with conscious recognition. The timing of the neurons' firing was phase locked to these LFP responses. We propose that whereas the gamma phase locking reflects the activation of local networks encoding particular recognized stimuli, the theta phase locking reflects a global activation that provides a temporal window for processing consciously perceived stimuli in the MTL.

This might be related to a decline of awareness, to episodes of low arousal and disturbed sleep patterns, and/or to distorting and attenuating effects of the skull and intermediate tissue on the recorded brain signals. Novel approaches are required to overcome these limitations. We introduced epidural electrocorticography (ECoG) for monitoring of cortical physiology in a late-stage amytrophic lateral sclerosis patient in completely locked-in state (CLIS) Despite long-term application for a period of six months, no implant related complications occurred. Recordings from the left frontal cortex were sufficient to identify three arousal states. Spectral analysis of the intrinsic oscillatory activity enabled us to extract state-dependent dominant frequencies at <4, similar to 7 and similar to 20 Hz, representing sleep-like periods, and phases of low and elevated arousal, respectively. In the absence of other biomarkers, ECoG proved to be a reliable tool for monitoring circadian rhythmicity, i.e., avoiding interference with the patient when he was sleeping and exploiting time windows of responsiveness. Moreover, the effects of interventions addressing the patient's arousal, e.g., amantadine medication, could be evaluated objectively on the basis of physiological markers, even in the absence of behavioral parameters. Epidural ECoG constitutes a feasible trade-off between surgical risk and quality of recorded brain signals to gain information on the patient's present level of arousal. This approach enables us to optimize the timing of interactions and medical interventions, all of which should take place when the patient is in a phase of high arousal. Furthermore, avoiding low responsiveness periods will facilitate measures to implement alternative communication pathways involving brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

Semantic and syntactic violations embedded in sentences evoke well-known ERPs, but little is known about the oscillatory responses to these violations. We investigated oscillatory responses to both kinds of violations, while monolingual and bilingual participants performed an acceptability judgment task. Both violations elicited power decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the 8-30 Hz frequency range, but with different scalp topographies. In addition, semantic anomalies elicited power increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the 1-5 Hz frequency band. The 1-5 Hz ERS was strongly phase-locked to stimulus onset and highly correlated with time domain averages, whereas the 8-30 Hz ERD response varied independently of these. In addition, the results showed that language expertise modulated 8-30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations as a function of the executive demands of the task. When the executive function demands were increased using a grammaticality judgment task, bilinguals but not monolinguals demonstrated reduced 8-30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations. These findings suggest a putative role of the 8-30 Hz ERD response as a marker of linguistic processing that likely represents a separate neural process from those underlying ERPs.

Robust spectrotemporal decomposition by iteratively reweighted least squares	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						structured sparsity; spectral decomposition; dynamics; recursive estimation; neural signal processing	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; CONVERGENCE; REGRESSION; SELECTION; NETWORKS; ENSEMBLE; SPECTRUM	Classical nonparametric spectral analysis uses sliding windows to capture the dynamic nature of most real-world time series. This universally accepted approach fails to exploit the temporal continuity in the data and is not well-suited for signals with highly structured time-frequency representations. For a time series whose time-varying mean is the superposition of a small number of oscillatory components, we formulate nonparametric batch spectral analysis as a Bayesian estimation problem. We introduce prior distributions on the time-frequency plane that yield maximum a posteriori (MAP) spectral estimates that are continuous in time yet sparse in frequency. Our spectral decomposition procedure, termed spectrotemporal pursuit, can be efficiently computed using an iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm and scales well with typical data lengths. We show that spectrotemporal pursuit works by applying to the time series a set of data-derived filters. Using a link between Gaussian mixture models, l(1) minimization, and the expectation-maximization algorithm, we prove that spectrotemporal pursuit converges to the global MAP estimate. We illustrate our technique on simulated and real human EEG data as well as on human neural spiking activity recorded during loss of consciousness induced by the anesthetic propofol. For the EEG data, our technique yields significantly denoised spectral estimates that have significantly higher time and frequency resolution than multitaper spectral estimates. For the neural spiking data, we obtain a new spectral representation of neuronal firing rates. Spectrotemporal pursuit offers a robust spectral decomposition framework that is a principled alternative to existing methods for decomposing time series into a small number of smooth oscillatory components.

Avian reflex and electroencephalogram responses in different states of consciousness	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						EEG; Cranial reflexes; Anaesthesia; FFT power analysis; Consciousness; Avian	PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; BRAIN; DEXMEDETOMIDINE; MEDETOMIDINE; INDEX	Defining states of clinical consciousness in animals is important in veterinary anaesthesia and in studies of euthanasia and welfare assessment at slaughter. The aim of this study was to validate readily observable reflex responses in relation to different conscious states, as confirmed by EEG analysis, in two species of birds under laboratory conditions (35-week-old layer hens (n = 12) and 11-week-old turkeys (n = 10)). We evaluated clinical reflexes and characterised electroencephalograph (EEG) activity (as a measure of brain function) using spectral analyses in four different clinical states of consciousness: conscious (fully awake), semi-conscious (sedated), unconscious-optimal (general anaesthesia), unconscious-sub optimal (deep hypnotic state), as well as assessment immediately following euthanasia. Jaw or neck muscle tone was the most reliable reflex measure distinguishing between conscious and unconscious states. Pupillary reflex was consistently observed until respiratory arrest. Nictitating membrane reflex persisted for a short time (<1 min) after respiratory arrest and brain death (isoelectric EEG). The results confirm that the nictitating membrane reflex is a conservative measure of death in poultry. Using spectral analyses of the EEG waveforms it was possible to readily distinguish between the different states of clinical consciousness. In all cases, when birds progressed from a conscious to unconscious state; total spectral power (PTOT) significantly increased, whereas median (F50) and spectral edge (F95) frequencies significantly decreased. This study demonstrates that EEG analysis can differentiate between clinical states (and loss of brain function at death) in birds and provides a unique integration of reflex responses and EEG activity.

The impact of melancholia versus non-melancholia on resting-state, EEG alpha asymmetry: Electrophysiological evidence for depression heterogeneity	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Depression; Melancholia; Non-melancholia; Electroencephalography; EEG; Alpha asymmetry	REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; ANXIETY; OSCILLATIONS; SPECIFICITY; LOST	While depression has been associated with relatively greater right than left frontal cortical activity - a neurophysiological marker reflecting greater activation of the withdrawal system - contradictory findings have been reported. It was hypothesised that melancholia would be associated with relative right frontal activation, in comparison to non-melancholia and controls. We collected 2-min of resting-state, eyes closed, electroencephalographic activity from a total of 237 participants including 117 patients with major depressive disorder (57 with melancholia, 60 with non-melancholia) and 120 healthy controls. In contrast to hypotheses, patients with non-melancholia displayed relative left frontal activation in comparison to controls and those with melancholia. These findings were associated with a small to moderate effect size (Cohen's d=030-0.34). Critically, patients with melancholic subtype did not differ from controls despite increased severity - relative to those with non-melancholia - on clinical measures. These results may reflect an increase in approach tendencies in patients with non-melancholia including reassurance seeking, anger or irritable aggression. Findings highlight the need for further research on the heterogeneity MDD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Quinn, Candice R.; Harris, Anthony W.

EEG slow-wave coherence changes in propofol-induced general anesthesia: experiment and theory	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						slow-wave sleep; phase-coherence measure; mean-field cortical model; gap-junction; Turing-Hopf instabilities	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; GAP-JUNCTIONS; SLEEP; CONSCIOUSNESS; TRANSITION; BRAIN; MODE; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATION; POTENTIALS	The electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns recorded during general anesthetic-induced coma are closely similar to those seen during slow-wave sleep, the deepest stage of natural sleep; both states show patterns dominated by large amplitude slow waves. Slow oscillations are believed to be important for memory consolidation during natural sleep. Tracking the emergence of slow-wave oscillations during transition to unconsciousness may help us to identify drug-induced alterations of the underlying brain state, and provide insight into the mechanisms of general anesthesia. Although cellular-based mechanisms have been proposed, the origin of the slow oscillation has not yet been unambiguously established. A recent theoretical study by Steyn-Ross et al. (2013) proposes that the slow oscillation is a network, rather than cellular phenomenon. Modeling anesthesia as a moderate reduction in gap-junction interneuronal coupling, they predict an unconscious state signposted by emergent low-frequency oscillations with chaotic dynamics in space and time. They suggest that anesthetic slow-waves arise from a competitive interaction between symmetry-breaking instabilities in space (Turing) and time (Hopf), modulated by gap-junction coupling strength. A significant prediction of their model is that EEG phase coherence will decrease as the cortex transits from Turing Hopf balance (wake) to Hopf-dominated chaotic slow-waves (unconsciousness). Here, we investigate changes in phase coherence during induction of general anesthesia. After examining 128-channel EEG traces recorded from five volunteers undergoing propofol anesthesia, we report a significant drop in sub-delta band (0.05-1.5 Hz) slow-wave coherence between frontal, occipital, and frontal occipital electrode pairs, with the most pronounced wake-vs.-unconscious coherence changes occurring at the frontal cortex.

Previously, we found that the alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, medetomidine, suppressed the rsMRI correlation dose-dependently but not the stimulus evoked activation. To understand the underlying electrophysiology and neurovascular coupling, which might be altered due to the vasoconstrictive nature of medetomidine, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and resting electroencephalography (EEG) were measured and correlated with corresponding BOLD signals in rat brains under three dosages of medetomidine. The SEP elicited by electrical stimulation to both forepaws was unchanged regardless of medetomidine dosage, which was consistent with the BOLD activation. Identical relationship between the SEP and BOLD signal under different medetomidine dosages indicates that the neurovascular coupling was not affected. Under resting state, EEG power was the same but a depression of inter-hemispheric EEG coherence in the gamma band was observed at higher medetomidine dosage. Different from medetomidine, both resting EEG power and BOLD power and coherence were significantly suppressed with increased isoflurane level. Such reduction was likely due to suppressed neural activity as shown by diminished SEP and BOLD activation under isoflurane, suggesting different mechanisms of losing synchrony at resting-state. Even though, similarity between electrophysiology and BOLD under stimulation and resting-state implicates a tight neurovascular coupling in both medetomidine and isoflurane. Our results confirm that medetomidine does not suppress neural activity but dissociates connectivity in the somatosensory cortex. The differential effect of medetomidine and its receptor specific action supports the neuronal origin of functional connectivity and implicates the mechanism of its sedative effect.

Acute exercise induces cortical inhibition and reduces arousal in response to visual stimulation in young children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain; Physical activity; Childhood; EEG; Alpha; Beta	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; BRAIN; BAND; EEG; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; COGNITION; INTELLIGENCE	Physical exercise is known to induce a range of transient or sustained psychophysiological effects including stress reduction and improvements in cognitive performance. Previous studies in the area have focused on adults and there has been little research on the relationship between physical exercise and brain function in young children. This study examined the relationship between cortical oscillations, arousal and cognitive performance following physical exercise in 5/6-year preschoolers. Participants completed two counterbalanced sessions of 45 min exercise or a control condition. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured at rest with the eyes closed and the eyes open, as well as during cognitive performance in a task requiring attention and reaction speed. This was done before (PRE) and after (POST) each session once the participants' heart rate returned to within 10% of pre-exercise values. The percentage change in spectral power from PRE to POST (Delta) differed significantly between conditions. Specifically, Delta alpha-1 power differed significantly between exercise (+5%) and the control condition (-5.9%) with the eyes-open, but not with the eyes-closed. This effect did not significantly differ between cortical regions (i.e., it was global). Further, Delta beta-1 and Delta beta-2 power differed significantly between exercise (beta-1: -10.8%, beta-2: -23.8%) and the control condition (beta-1: -4.3%, beta-2: -5.3%) at frontal sites independent of visual input. Despite significant changes in resting state EEG, cognitive performance and task-related EEG remained unaffected by exercise. The results were interpreted to indicate cortical inhibition and attenuation of arousal in response to visual stimulation following exercise in young children. (C) 2014 ISDN.

Modeling the dynamical effects of anesthesia on brain circuits	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							INDUCED ALPHA-RHYTHM; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BURST-SUPPRESSION; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; THALAMOCORTICAL MODEL; SPINDLE OSCILLATIONS; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	General anesthesia is a neurophysiological state that consists of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility along with maintenance of physiological stability. General anesthesia has been used in the United States for more than 167 years. Now, using systems neuroscience paradigms how anesthetics act in the brain and central nervous system to create the states of general anesthesia is being understood. Propofol is one of the most widely used and the most widely studied anesthetics. When administered for general anesthesia or sedation, the electroencephalogram (EEG) under propofol shows highly structured, rhythmic activity that is strongly associated with changes in the patient's level of arousal. These highly structured oscillations lend themselves readily to mathematical descriptions using dynamical systems models. We review recent model descriptions of the commonly observed EEG patterns associated with propofol: paradoxical excitation, strong frontal alpha oscillations, anteriorization and burst suppression. Our analysis suggests that propofol's actions at GABAergic networks in the cortex, thalamus and brainstem induce profound brain dynamics that are one of the likely mechanisms through which this anesthetic induces altered arousal states from sedation to unconsciousness. Because these dynamical effects are readily observed in the EEG, the mathematical descriptions of how propofol's EEG signatures relate to its mechanisms of action in neural circuits provide anesthesiologists with a neurophysiologically based approach to monitoring the brain states of patients receiving anesthesia care.

Automatic detection of prominent interictal spikes in intracranial EEG: Validation of an algorithm and relationsip to the seizure onset zone	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Interictal spike detection; Intracranial EEG; Automatic detection; Mahalanobis distance; General extreme value statistics; Localization of the seizure onset zone	EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; TIME	Objective: To develop an algorithm for the automatic quantitative description and detection of spikes in the intracranial EEG and quantify the relationship between prominent spikes and the seizure onset zone. Methods: An algorithm was developed for the quantification of time-frequency properties of spikes (upslope, instantaneous energy, downslope) and their statistical representation in a univariate generalized extreme value distribution. Its performance was evaluated in comparison to expert detection of spikes in intracranial EEG recordings from 10 patients. It was subsequently used in 18 patients to detect prominent spikes and quantify their spatial relationship to the seizure onset area. Results: The algorithm displayed an average sensitivity of 63.4% with a false detection rate of 3.2 per minute for the detection of individual spikes and an average sensitivity of 88.6% with a false detection rate of 1.4% for the detection of intracranial EEG contacts containing the most prominent spikes. Prominent spikes occurred closer to the seizure onset area than less prominent spikes but they overlapped with it only in a minority of cases (3/18). Conclusions: Automatic detection and quantification of the morphology of spikes increases their utility to localize the seizure onset area. Prominent spikes tend to originate mostly from contacts located in the close vicinity of the seizure onset area rather than from within it. Significance: Quantitative analysis of time-frequency characteristics and spatial distribution of intracranial spikes provides complementary information that may be useful for the localization of the seizure-onset zone.

ORICA is appropriate to be used in real-time EEG system to separate artifacts because of its highly efficient and real-time process features. The proposed ORICA processor is composed of an ORICA processing unit and a singular value decomposition (SVD) processing unit. Compared with previous work [1], this proposed ORICA processor has enhanced effectiveness and reduced hardware complexity by utilizing a deeper pipeline architecture, shared arithmetic processing unit, and shared registers. The 16-channel random signals which contain 8-channel super-Gaussian and 8-channel sub-Gaussian components are used to analyze the dependence of the source components, and the average correlation coefficient is 0.95452 between the original source signals and extracted ORICA signals. Finally, the proposed ORICA processor ASIC is implemented with TSMC 40 nm CMOS technology, and it consumes 15.72 mW at 100 MHz operating frequency.

Depending on a subjective estimate of the smell of isoamyl acetate, its presence per se caused increases in the mean levels of coherence of high-frequency a-subrange oscillations in all tested persons, which can be indicative of intensification of internal mental activity and increase in readiness to react. In the tested persons estimating the used olfactory stimulus as negative, the coherence of alpha 2- and beta 1-oscillations in the central cortical areas and in the frontal and occipital zones decreased. In the tested persons with the positive subjective estimate of the isoamyl acetate smell, the coherence increased also in the a1-subrange during the action of this olfactory stimulus. Therefore, we obtained indications that activation of the olfactory analyzer is capable of changing the functioning of neuronal networks of the human brain in the resting state, and the pattern of these alterations partly depends on a subjective hedonic estimate of one smell or another.

A practical problem in stroke rehabilitation systems is that how to separate motor imagery patterns from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. There is a sharp decline in performance of these systems when classical algorithms, such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), are directly applied on stroke patients. New method: We propose a tensor-based scheme to detect motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain directly from multidimensional EEG constructed by wavelet transform method. Discriminative motor imagery EEG patterns are obtained by Fisher score strategy. Furthermore, the most contributed channel groups and frequency bands are selected from these patterns and utilized as prior knowledge for the following motor imagery tasks. Results: We evaluate our scheme based on EEG datasets recorded from stroke patients. The results show that our method outperforms five other traditional methods in both online and offline recognition performance. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike the existing methods, motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are simultaneously obtained by our method, preserving the structural information of the multi-channel time-varying EEG. Conclusions: Our scheme is encouraged to be transferred to some other practical rehabilitation applications for its better performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Background EEG activity in children with visual dysfunctions was characterized by lower ASPs of all EEG frequency ranges (maximally, of the alpha rhythm), a lower RSP of alpha oscillations against the background of a higher RSP of the delta range (and that of beta2 subrange in boys), and also by higher MFs of slow-wave activity and of beta oscillations (beta2 and beta1 subranges in girls and boys, respectively); the MF of alpha activity in most cortical regions was unchanged. The data obtained are probably indicative of increased activity of the caudal brainstem regions related to the existence of visual dysfunctions; this results in changes in the pattern of interaction between activating and deactivating cerebral systems. Possible compensatory mechanisms influencing integrative activity of the brain under conditions of visual dysfunctions are discussed.	[Red'ka, I. V.; Mayorov, O.

The peak point can be detected using several approaches, including time, frequency, time-frequency, and nonlinear domains depending on various peak features from several models. However, there is no study that provides the importance of every peak feature in contributing to a good and generalized model. In this study, feature selection and classifier parameters estimation based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) are proposed as a framework for peak detection on EEG signals in time domain analysis. Two versions of PSO are used in the study: (1) standard PSO and (2) random asynchronous particle swarm optimization (RA-PSO). The proposed framework tries to find the best combination of all the available features that offers good peak detection and a high classification rate from the results in the conducted experiments. The evaluation results indicate that the accuracy of the peak detection can be improved up to 99.90% and 98.59% for training and testing, respectively, as compared to the framework without feature selection adaptation. Additionally, the proposed framework based on RA-PSO offers a better and reliable classification rate as compared to standard PSO as it produces low variance model.

A great deal of research has focused on the electrophysiological correlates of feedback processing and how they relate to good learning. In this paper, studies on the EEG correlates of learning from feedback are reviewed. The main objective is to discuss these findings whilst also considering some key theoretical aspects of learning. The learning processes, its operational definition and the feedback characteristics are discussed and used as reference for integrating the findings in the literature. The EEG correlates of feedback processing for learning using various analytical approaches are discussed, including ERPs, oscillations and inter-site synchronization. How these EEG responses to feedback are related to learning is discussed, highlighting the gaps in the literature and suggesting future directions for understanding the neural underpinnings of learning from feedback.

Recently, we proposed a method (Common Waveform Estimation, CWE) that could extract such brain activities from magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. CWE estimates spatiotemporal MEG/EEG patterns occurring with unknown and variable delays, referred to here as unlocked waveforms, without hypotheses about their shapes. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of CWE for cognitive neuroscience. For this purpose, we show procedures to estimate unlocked waveforms using CWE and to examine their role. We applied CWE to the MEG epochs during Go trials of a visual Go/NoGo task. This revealed unlocked waveforms with interesting properties, specifically large alpha oscillations around the temporal areas. To examine the role of the unlocked waveform, we attempted to estimate the strength of the brain activity of the unlocked waveform in various conditions. We made a spatial filter to extract the component reflecting the brain activity of the unlocked waveform, applied this spatial filter to MEG data under different conditions (a passive viewing, a simple reaction time, and Go/NoGo tasks), and calculated the powers of the extracted components. Comparing the powers across these conditions suggests that the unlocked waveforms may reflect the inhibition of the task-irrelevant activities in the temporal regions while the subject attends to the visual stimulus. Our results demonstrate that CWE is a potential tool for revealing new findings of cognitive brain functions without any hypothesis in advance.

We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1 by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual stimulation and rest periods. Methods: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow. Results: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in both groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations, visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention observed in individuals with NF1.

In the human brain, these spontaneous fluctuations are salient in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals and correlated within specific brain systems or "intrinsic-connectivity networks." In electrophysiological recordings, both the amplitude dynamics of fast (1-100 Hz) oscillations and the scalp potentials per se exhibit fluctuations in the same infra-slow (0.01-0.1 Hz) frequency range where the BOLD fluctuations are conspicuous. While several lines of evidence show that the BOLD fluctuations are correlated with fast-amplitude dynamics, it has remained unclear whether the infra-slow scalp potential fluctuations in full-band electroencephalography (fbEEG) are related to the resting-state BOLD signals. We used concurrent fbEEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings to address the relationship of infra-slow fluctuations (ISFs) in scalp potentials and BOLD signals. We show here that independent components of fbEEG recordings are selectively correlated with subsets of cortical BOLD signals in specific task-positive and task-negative, fMRI-defined resting-state networks. This brain system-specific association indicates that infra-slow scalp potentials are directly associated with the endogenous fluctuations in neuronal activity levels. fbEEG thus yields a noninvasive, high-temporal resolution window into the dynamics of intrinsic connectivity networks. These results support the view that the slow potentials reflect changes in cortical excitability and shed light on neuronal substrates underlying both electrophysiological and behavioral ISFs.

Then whereas Parts I and II reviewed the considerable behavioural outcome gains and evidence for their feedback causation, part III lays bare the not inconsiderable methodological and theoretical conundrums. Cardinal assumptions amongst practitioners about specificity of topography, behavioural outcome and frequency bands are critically examined. The hitherto mostly neglected nature of feedback learning is reviewed including evidence of within- and between-session and successive baseline learning; the enduring impact on the tonic EEG; implications for experimental design, individual differences and the trainer-participant interface; distinguishing between the learning and mastery of self-regulation; connectivity, ratio, unidirectional and multimodal feedback protocols. A thorough grounding in human neuroscience plus interpersonal skills are considered prerequisites for scientific advancement and ethically sound practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, publications that discuss relevant topics are written for divergent audiences with specific levels of expertise: explanations are either at an abstract level that leaves readers with a fuzzy understanding of the electrophysiology involved, or are at a technical level that requires mastery of the relevant physics to understand. A clear, comprehensive review of the origin and measurement of EEG that bridges these high and low levels of explanation fills a critical gap in the literature and is necessary for promoting better research practices and peer review. The present paper addresses the neurophysiological source of EEG, propagation of the EEG signal, technical aspects of EEG measurement, and implications for interpretation of EEG data.

In this study, we investigated oscillatory activity associated with motion-induced blindness' (MIB), which denotes the perceptual disappearance of salient target stimuli when a moving pattern is superimposed on them (Bonneh etal., ). We applied an MIB paradigm in which illusory target disappearances would occur independently in the left and right hemifields. Both illusory and real target disappearance were followed by an alpha lateralization with weaker contralateral than ipsilateral alpha activity (similar to 10Hz). However, only the illusion showed early alpha lateralization in the opposite direction, which preceded the alpha effect present for both conditions and coincided with the estimated onset of the illusion. The duration of the illusory disappearance was further predicted by the magnitude of this early lateralization when considered over subjects. In the gamma band (60-80Hz), we found an increase in activity contralateral relative to ipsilateral only after a real disappearance. Whereas early alpha activity was predictive of onset and length of the illusory percept, gamma activity showed no modulation in relation to the illusion. Our study demonstrates that the spontaneous changes in visual alpha activity have perceptual consequences.

The analysis is carried out by decomposing the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, collected from a publicly available EEG database, into the dual tree complex wavelet transform(DT-CWT) domain. An Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is employed as a classifier where the maximum cross-correlation among the DT-CWT sub-bands are utilized as the features. Studies are conducted using EEG signals for four clinically relevant classification cases which include healthy vs seizure, non-seizure vs seizure, ictal vs inter-ictal and finally, healthy vs inter-ictal vs ictal recordings. The ANN-based proposed method provides 100% accuracy with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the first three cases and also a high accuracy for the fourth case. In addition, the proposed method is computationally fast in comparison to the several time-frequency and EMD-based algorithms available in the EEG literature.

The study involves recording of resting EEG from 40 healthy university students. Initially, the EEG is pre-processed for noise removal and filtered into delta, theta, alpha and beta waves using band-pass filters. Next, the sub-band power spectral densities are estimated via Welch method. Subsequently, spectral centroid amplitude and band power features are then computed from the power spectral density of the respective sub-bands. Correlation analysis between the two features is performed for each scalp location to ascertain its relationship. Findings have revealed that the EEG sub-band spectral centroid amplitude is highly correlated with the band power features for all scalp locations.	[Ali, M. S. A. Megat; Taib, M. N.; Tahir, N.

One key mechanism of suppression is through the deployment of anticipatory alpha-band (similar to 10 Hz) oscillatory activity, with greater alpha-band power observed in cortical regions that will ultimately process the distracting stream. Atypical attention has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including greater interference by distracting task-irrelevant inputs. Here we tested the integrity of these alpha-band mechanisms in ASD using an intersensory attention task. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants were cued on a trial-by-trial basis to selectively deploy attention to the visual or auditory modality in anticipation of a target within the cued modality. Whereas typically developing (TD) children showed the predicted alpha-band modulation, with increased alpha-band power over parieto-occipital scalp when attention was deployed to the auditory compared with the visual modality, this differential pattern was entirely absent at the group level in the ASD cohort. Further, only the ASD group showed impaired performance due to the presence of task-irrelevant sensory information. These data suggest that impaired modulation of alpha-band activity plays a role in increased distraction from extraneous sensory inputs in ASD.

Efforts to automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross-validation with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open-access database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole-night recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 +/- 19.8years) and 103 females (aged 38.3 +/- 18.9years); age range: 18-76years] were pooled from eight different research protocols performed in three different hospital-based sleep laboratories. All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256Hz and an electroencephalography (EEG) montage of 4-20 channels plus standard electro-oculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG) and respiratory signals. Access to the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) website (), and requires only affiliation with a research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep database is expected to facilitate the development and cross-validation of sleep analysis automation systems. It is also expected that such a shared resource will be a catalyst for cross-centre collaborations on difficult topics such as improving inter-rater agreement on sleep stage scoring.

Optimal set of EEG features for emotional state classification and trajectory visualization in Parkinson's disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion classification; Feature reduction; Manifold learning; Parkinson's disease	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; MUSIC; VALENCE; SOUND	In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by emotional deficits. Ongoing brain activity can be recorded by electroencephalograph (EEG) to discover the links between emotional states and brain activity. This study utilized machine-learning algorithms to categorize emotional states in PD patients compared with healthy controls (HC) using EEG. Twenty non-demented PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender-, and education level-matched controls viewed happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust emotional stimuli while fourteen-channel EEG was being recorded. Multimodal stimulus (combination of audio and visual) was used to evoke the emotions. To classify the EEG-based emotional states and visualize the changes of emotional states overtime, this paper compares four kinds of EEG features for emotional state classification and proposes an approach to track the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. From the experimental results using our EEG data set, we found that (a) bispectrum feature is superior to other three kinds of features, namely power spectrum, wavelet packet and nonlinear dynamical analysis; (b) higher frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) play a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency bands (delta and theta) in both groups and; (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning. This provides a promising way of implementing visualization of patient's emotional state in real time and leads to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

EEG study on affective valence elicited by novel and familiar pictures using ERD/ERS and SVM-RFE	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Affective valence; EEG; ERD/ERS; Habituation; SVM-RFE	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; HABITUATION; EMOTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPETITION; AROUSAL; REFLEX; THETA	EEG signals have been widely explored in emotional processing analyses, both in time and frequency domains. However, in such studies, habituation phenomenon is barely considered in the discrimination of different emotional responses. In this work, spectral features of the event-related potentials (ERPs) are studied by means of event-related desynchronization/synchronization computation. In order to determine the most relevant ERP features for distinguishing how positive and negative affective valences are processed within the brain, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination is employed. The proposed approach was applied for investigating in which way the familiarity of stimuli affects the affective valence processing as well as which frequency bands and scalp regions are more involved in this process. In a group composed of young adult women, results prove that parietooccipital region and theta band are especially involved in the processing of novelty in emotional stimuli. Furthermore, the proposed method has shown to perform successfully using a moderated number of trials.	[Hidalgo-Munoz, A.

Astrocytes contribute to gamma oscillations and recognition memory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						glia; electroencephalogram; network oscillation; gliotransmitter; glial fibrillary acidic protein	DEPENDENT GLUTAMATE RELEASE; SYNAPTIC-LIKE MICROVESICLES; TRIAL OBJECT RECOGNITION; IN-VIVO; CHOLINERGIC INDUCTION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; LENTIVIRUS VECTOR; CRE RECOMBINASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; D-SERINE	Glial cells are an integral part of functional communication in the brain. Here we show that astrocytes contribute to the fast dynamics of neural circuits that underlie normal cognitive behaviors. In particular, we found that the selective expression of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) in astrocytes significantly reduced the duration of carbachol-induced gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices. These data prompted us to develop a novel transgenic mouse model, specifically with inducible tetanus toxin expression in astrocytes. In this in vivo model, we found evidence of a marked decrease in electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the gamma frequency range in awake-behaving mice, whereas neuronal synaptic activity remained intact. The reduction in cortical gamma oscillations was accompanied by impaired behavioral performance in the novel object recognition test, whereas other forms of memory, including working memory and fear conditioning, remained unchanged. These results support a key role for gamma oscillations in recognition memory. Both EEG alterations and behavioral deficits in novel object recognition were reversed by suppression of tetanus toxin expression. These data reveal an unexpected role for astrocytes as essential contributors to information processing and cognitive behavior.

The current study determines the inter-subject-variability using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and long-term test-retest-reliability (TRT) using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) in 44 healthy subjects with 35 having a follow-up at years 1 and 2. FC was estimated from 256-channel-EEG by the phase-lag-index (PLI) and weighted PLI (wPLI) during an eyes-closed resting state condition. PLI quantifies the asymmetry of the distribution of instantaneous phase differences of two time-series and signifies, whether a consistent non-zero phase lag exists. WPLI extends the PLI by additionally accounting for the magnitude of the phase difference. Signal-space global and regional PLI/wPLI and weighted first-order graph measures, i.e. normalized clustering coefficient (gamma), normalized average path length (lambda), and the small-world-index (SWI) were calculated for theta-, alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-frequency bands. Inter-subject variability of global PLI was low to moderate over frequency bands (0.12<CoV<0.28), higher for wPLI (0.25<CoV<0.55) and very low for gamma, lambda and SWI (CoV<0.048). TRT was good to excellent for global PLI/wPLI (0.68<ICC<0.80), regional PLI/wPLI (0.58<ICC<0.77), and fair to good for graph measures (0.32<ICC<0.73) except wPLI-based lambda in alpha1 (ICC = 0.12). Inter-electrode distance correlated very weakly with inter-electrode PLI (-0.06<rho<0) and weakly with inter-electrode wPLI (-0.22<rho<-0.18). Global PLI/wPLI and topographic connectivity patterns differed between frequency bands, and all individual networks showed a small-world-configuration. PLI/wPLI based network characterization derived from high-resolution EEG has apparently good reliability, which is one important requirement for longitudinal studies exploring the effects of chronic brain diseases over several years.

At present, the search for functional correlates of brain oscillations is an important trend in neuroscience. Furthermore, analyses of oscillatory responses provide key knowledge on the physiology of brain dynamics. Studies analysing oscillatory dynamics in face perception and emotional pictures have increased in recent years; however, the literature lacks a review of the current state of the art. This study provides a comprehensive review of the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillatory responses on presentation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures (International Affective Picture System, IAPS). The reviewed literature revealed that the brain is more sensitive to emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli. A common and reliable finding from all reviewed studies was the increased brain responsiveness towards negative emotional pictures (face expression or IAPS). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

By extrinsically manipulating the phase of alpha before stimulus presentation, we provide direct evidence that the neural circuitry in the parietal cortex involved with generating alpha oscillations plays a causal role in determining whether or not a visual stimulus is successfully perceived.

Recent studies suggested that the OCD is caused by dysfunction in brain's frontal lobe. The GFS that was developed as a novel synchronization criteria, computes phase difference between neural oscillations in the brain. Studies were published that indicates fall of GFS values. In this study, it was investigated how OCD effect phase difference between neuronal oscillations. For this purpose, results of the GFS method was applied to 19 channels EEG, indicates OCD decrease of neural synchronization in brain's frontal lobe at Delta and Beta 3 frequency bands..

A Robust 'Rule Based Denoising Scheme' Using Wavelets	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Wavelet Transforms; Universal Threshold; Shannon Entropy; EEG and ECG	SIGNALS	Retrieval of information from contaminated signals is a challenging and demanding research problem. Especially, the measurand brings lot of noise, when high frequency band is involved. Wavelet transform has revolutionized the field of denoising with its well defined properties. It is a global technique and the quality of outcome depends on threshold and the thresholding rules utilized. Soft, hard, semi-soft and Garrotte are the popularly available thresholding rules. While soft thresholding rule is generally preferred for low frequency (low variance) problems, it may not be ideal for high frequency (high variance) signals. But practically a real time signal is a mix of several frequencies ranging from low to high. This questions the credibility of using a global technique for a problem, which involves various bands of frequencies. This article aims in proposing a region/local (frequency/variance) based thresholding scheme, which analyses the characteristics of signal, before deciding the appropriate scheme targeting those band structures only. This effectively means, a hard thresholding scheme would not be preferred for the low frequency coefficients, and so on. The feasibility of proposed rule based denoising algorithm is evaluated on medical signals (EEG and ECG). We have analysed the efficacy of the proposal on two different signals, namely EEG and ECG. For the non-stationary signal with 0.05 added variance the proposed denoising technique has produced the signal to noise ratio of 23.62 whereas the universal, normal and Shannon thresholds has produced 19.03, 22.08 and 23.31 respectively.

More specifically, the allocation and focusing of attention become less efficient with time on task. Additionally, the selection of even simple responses becomes more error prone. With respect to the recorded EEG, mental fatigue has been reported to be associated with an increase in frontal theta and frontal and occipital alpha activity. The present study focused on the time course of changes in behavior and in the EEG to characterize fatigue-related processes. Participants performed a spatial stimulus-response-compatibility task in eight blocks for an overall duration of 4 h. Error rates increased continuously with time on task. Total alpha power was larger at the end compared to the beginning of the experiment. However, alpha power increased rapidly and reached its maximal amplitude already after 1 h, whereas frontal theta showed a continuous increase with time on task, possibly related to increased effort to keep the performance level high. Time frequency analyses revealed power changes in the theta band induced by task relevant information that might be assigned to a drain of executive control capacities. Thus, frontal theta turned out to be a reliable marker of distinct changes in cognitive processing with increasing fatigue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to use mutual information analysis in the multichannel EEG to predict the probability of AD disease. Considering the correlation between AD disease and ageing effect, the participants were 9 AD patients and 45 normal cases involving teenagers, young people and elders. This data revealed that both right frontal and temporo-parietal are differences between normal and AD participants. Besides, this study found the theta band is the main frequency to separate AD patients from all participants. Furthermore, this study suggested a higher distinguishable method by mutual information to predict the possibility AD patients.

While, previously, amplitude-to-amplitude correlations were studied primarily on the sensor level, we present a source separation approach using spatial filters which maximize the correlation between the envelopes of brain oscillations recorded with electro/magnetencephalography (EEG/MEG) or intracranial multichannel recordings. Our approach, which is called canonical source power correlation analysis (cSPoC), is thereby capable of extracting genuine brain oscillations solely based on their assumed coupling behavior even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals is low.

Method: BECTS patients receiving oxcarbazepine monotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Changes in current-source density (CSD) of the maximum negative points of interictal spikes prior to the start of oxcarbazepine treatment were compared with CSD following oxcarbazepine treatment for 6-12 months. CSD was measured using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Patients were divided into two groups based on the change in CSD: increased-extent or decreased-extent. Comparisons were made between the groups based on the age of onset, seizure frequency before treatment, time interval between seizure onset and treatment start, time interval between the two EEGs, oxcarbazepine dosage at the follow-up electroencephalography, occurrence of daytime seizures, and seizure control. Results: Fourteen patients were enrolled. Seven patients were in the decreased-extent group and six in the increased-extent group; one patient was excluded because she did not demonstrate any change in CSD. We found that seizure control differed significantly between the two groups: seizures were well-controlled in six out of seven patients in the decreased-extent group (85.7%), but in only one of six patients (16.7%) in the increased-extent group (p = 0.03). The other variables did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Seizure control may be associated with the extent of changes in the neuronal irritative zones of SECTS patients. We suggest that changes of CSD extent may be used as an imaging modality to evaluate clinical improvement in BECTS patients. (C) 2014 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unclear whether prior comparative studies have been confounded by the captive recording environment. Herein we examine the effect of predation pressure on sleep in sloths living in the wild. Design: Comparison of two closely related sloth species, one exposed to predation and one free from predation. Setting: Panamanian mainland rainforest (predators present) and island mangrove (predators absent). Participants: Mainland (Bradypus variegatus, five males and four females) and island (Bradypus pygmaeus, six males) sloths. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded using a miniature data logger. Although both species spent between 9 and 10 h per day sleeping, the mainland sloths showed a preference for sleeping at night, whereas island sloths showed no preference for sleeping during the day or night. Standardized EEG activity during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep showed lower low-frequency power, and increased spindle and higher frequency power in island sloths when compared to mainland sloths. Conclusions: In sloths sleeping in the wild, predation pressure influenced the timing of sleep, but not the amount of time spent asleep. The preference for sleeping at night in mainland sloths may be a strategy to avoid detection by nocturnal cats. The pronounced differences in the NREM sleep EEG spectrum remain unexplained, but might be related to genetic or environmental factors.

To our knowledge this is the first implementation of the CFC algorithm in hardware. The advantage of directly computing the modulation index on chip is that the raw EEG data does not have to be stored in memory and the mobility of the device will allow for more modulation index data to be recorded. The chip is designed on IBM 0.18 micron process. The chip size is 3mm x 3mm with 191mW power consumption.

Since EEG recording and analysis is one of the fundamental tools in diagnosing and identifying disorders in neurophysiology, researchers strive to use the EEG signals for diagnosing individuals with ASD. We found that studies on ASD diagnosis using EEG techniques could be divided into two groups in which where analysis was based on either comparison techniques or pattern recognition techniques. In this paper, we try to explain these two sets of algorithms along with their applied methods and results. Lastly, evaluation measures of diagnosis algorithms are discussed.

Analysing sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra may be useful to study cortical organisation in individuals with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF), as seen in other disturbances even if it is not considered a disease. The aim of this study was to determine if the sleep EEG power spectra in children with BIF could be different from typically developing children. Methods Eighteen BIF (12 males) (mean age 11.04; SD +/- 1.07) and 24 typical developing children (14 men) (mean age 10.98; SD +/- 1.76; P = 0.899) underwent an overnight polysomnography (PSG) recording in the Sleep Laboratory of the Clinic of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, after one adaptation night. Sleep was subdivided into 30-s epochs and sleep stages were scored according to the standard criteria and the power spectra were calculated for the Cz-A2 channel using the sleep analysis software Hypnolab 1.2 (SWS Soft, Italy) by means of the Fast Fourier Transform and the power spectrum was calculated for frequencies between 0.5 and 60 Hz with a frequency step of 1 Hz and then averaged across the following bands delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), sigma (11-15 Hz), and beta (16-30 Hz), gamma (30-60 Hz) for S2, SWS and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep stages. Results BIF have a reduced sleep duration (total sleep time; P < 0.001), and an increased rate of stage shifts (P < 0.001) and awakenings (P < 0.001) and WASO (wakefulness after sleep onset) % (P < 0.001); the stage 2% (P < 0.001), and REM% (P < 0.001) were lower and slow-wave sleep percentage was slightly higher (P < 0.001). All children with BIF had an AHI (apnoea-hypopnea index) less than 1 (mean AHI = 0.691 +/- 0.236) with a mean oxygen saturation of 97. 6% and a periodic leg movement index (PLMI) less than 5 (mean PLMI = 2.94 +/- 1.56). All sleep stages had a significant reduction in gamma frequency (30-60 Hz) (P < 0.001) and an increased delta frequency (0.5-4.0 Hz) (P < 0.001) power in BIF subjects compared with typically developing children. Conclusion Our findings shed light on the importance of sleep for cognition processes particularly in cognitive borderline dysfunction and the role of EEG spectral power analysis to recognize sleep characteristics in BIF children.

Participants completed a computerized task in which they pressed a button followed by one of two color words (red or blue) and rated their experienced agency over producing the color. Before executing the action, a matching or mismatching color word was pre-activated by explicitly instructing participants to produce the color (goal condition) or by briefly presenting the color word (prime condition). In both conditions, experienced agency was higher in matching vs. mismatching trials. Furthermore, increased electroencephalography (EEG)-based connectivity strength was observed between parietal and frontal nodes and within the (pre)frontal cortex when color-outcomes matched with goals and participants reported high agency. This pattern of increased connectivity was not identified in trials where outcomes were pre-activated through primes. These results suggest that different connections are involved in the experience and in the loss of agency, as well as in inferences of agency resulting from different types of pre-activation. Moreover, the findings provide novel support for the involvement of a fronto-parietal network in agency inferences.

This article presents a novel seizure prediction approach based on graph theory. The early identification of seizure signature allows for various preventive measures to be undertaken. The proposed approach consists of observing a high correlation level between any pair of electrodes along with voltage peaks in the Delta frequencies. Statistical analysis tools were used to determine threshold levels for this frequency sub-band. A graph topology involving IEEG electrodes characterizes seizure signatures for each patient. In order to validate the proposed approach, six patients from both sexes and various age groups with temporal epilepsies originating from the hippocampal area were studied. An average seizure prediction of 30 minutes, a detection accuracy of 72%, and a false positive rate of 0% were accomplished throughout 200 hours of recording time.

It non-linearly separates the raw EEG signal into non-oscillatory transient and sustained rhythmic oscillation components using long and short windows for the short-time Fourier transform. The processor utilizes the fact that sleep spindles can be sparsely represented via the inverse of a short-time Fourier transform. Five sleep spindle detectors were tested on the EEG database with and without the proposed EEG processor. We achieved an improvement of 13.3% in the by-sample F-1 score, and 13.9% in the by-sample Matthews Correlation Coefficient score of these algorithms when the processed EEG was used for spindle detection. The processor was able to improve the scores by reducing the number of false positive spindles and increasing the number of true positive spindles detected.

Neurophysiologic predictors of response to atomoxetine in young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A pilot project	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Atomoxetine; Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG); Thalamocortical circuits and oscillations; Cordance; Biomarker; Treatment response; Quality of life	ONCE-DAILY ATOMOXETINE; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; METHYLPHENIDATE RESPONSE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; DOUBLE-BLIND; EEG; CHILDREN; PLACEBO; ADOLESCENTS; ADHD	Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant medication with sustained benefit throughout the day, and is a useful pharmacologic treatment option for young adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It is difficult to determine, however, those patients for whom atomoxetine will be both effective and advantageous. Patients may need to take the medication for several weeks before therapeutic benefit is apparent, so a biomarker that could predict atomoxetine effectiveness early in the course of treatment could be clinically useful. There has been increased interest in the study of thalamocortical oscillatory activity using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as a biomarker in ADHD. In this study, we investigated qEEG absolute power, relative power, and cordance, which have been shown to predict response to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as potential predictors of response to atomoxetine. Forty-four young adults with ADHD (ages 18-30) enrolled in a multi-site, double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of atomoxetine and underwent serial qEEG recordings at pretreatment baseline and one week after the start of medication. qEEG measures were calculated from a subset of the sample (N = 29) that provided useable qEEG recordings. Left temporoparietal cordance in the theta frequency band after one week of treatment was associated with ADHD symptom improvement and quality of life measured at 12 weeks in atomoxetine-treated subjects, but not in those treated with placebo. Neither absolute nor relative power measures selectively predicted improvement in medication-treated subjects. Measuring theta cordance after one week of treatment could be useful in predicting atomoxetine treatment response in adult ADHD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By comparing 17 tinnitus participants with hyperacusis (T+H+) and 17 without hyperacusis (T+H-), we aimed to explore characteristic resting-state cortical activity of hyperacusis. The T+H+ and T+H- groups, strictly matched for all tinnitus sound characteristics to exclude tinnitus-related cortical changes, were compared using resting-state electroencephalography source-localized activity complemented by functional connectivity analyses. Correlation analysis revealed that hyperacusis questionnaire score was positively correlated with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) beta power, the right auditory cortex (AC) alpha1 power, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) beta1 power. Compared to the T+H- group, the T+H+ group demonstrated increased beta power in the dACC and OFC, and increased alpha power in the right AC. Region of interest analyses including 17 normal controls further confirmed that these differences originated solely from relatively increased power of the T+H+ group, not from a relative power decrease of the T+H- group. Also, the T+H+ group showed increased connectivity between the OFC/dACC and the AC as compared to the T+H- group. The beta power increase in the OFC/dACC may indicate increased resting-state vigilance in tinnitus patients with hyperacusis. In addition, increased alpha power in the AC may reflect an adaptive top-down inhibition against sound stimuli probably mediated by the increased beta power of the OFC. The OFC/dACC, also frequently found to be activated in analogous diseases such as allodynia/hyperalgesia, may compose a hyperresponsiveness network.

A nonlinear causality measure in the frequency domain: Nonlinear partial directed coherence with applications to EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Granger causality; Coherence; Nonlinear systems; Spectral analysis; Epilepsy	NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; TIME-SERIES; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; MEG	Background: Frequency domain Granger causality measures have been proposed and widely applied in analyzing rhythmic neurophysiological and biomedical signals. Almost all these measures are based on linear time domain regression models, and therefore can only detect linear causal effects in the frequency domain. New method: A frequency domain causality measure, the partial directed coherence, is explicitly linked with the frequency response function concept of linear systems. By modeling the nonlinear relationships between time series using nonlinear models and employing corresponding frequency-domain analysis techniques (i.e. generalized frequency response functions), a new nonlinear partial directed coherence method is derived. Results: The advantages of the new method are illustrated via a numerical example of a nonlinear physical system and an application to electroencephalogram signals from a patient with childhood absence epilepsy. Comparison with existing methods: The new method detects both linear and nonlinear casual effects between bivariate signals in the frequency domain, while the existing measures can only detect linear effects. Conclusions: The proposed new method has important advantages over the classical linear measures, because detecting nonlinear dependencies has become more and more important in characterizing functional couplings in neuronal and biological systems.

HFOs are often characterized by variable durations (10-100 ms) and rates of occurrence (17.5 +/- 9.5 / min). The total duration of HFOs is extremely small compared to the entire length of the EEG signals to be analyzed which, in the case of intracerebral recordings, are generally acquired over several days and sometimes up to weeks. As a result, visual marking of HFOs events associated with large amounts of EEG data is extremely tedious, inevitably subjective and requires a great deal of mental concentration. Therefore, automatic detection of HFOs can be very useful to propel the clinical use of HFOs as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue and is crucial when conducting large-scale investigations of HFO activity. As a first step towards robust and reliable automatic detection, we propose in this paper a new method for HFOs detection based on Decision Tree analysis. The performance and added value of the proposed method are evaluated by comparing it with five other previously proposed methods. The HFO detection performances were tested in terms of sensitivity, False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Our results demonstrate that the decision-tree approach yields low false detection (FDR=8.62 %) but that, in its current implementation, it is not highly sensitive to HFO events (sensitivity=66.96 %). Nevertheless some advantages of the method are discussed and paths for further improvements are outlined.

Single trial prediction of self-paced reaching directions from EEG signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stroke; self-paced voluntary movement; movement-related potentials; EEG; movement direction; brain-machine interface	SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; HAND MOVEMENTS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; PARIETAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; PLASTICITY; PHASE; REHABILITATION; REPRESENTATION	Early detection of movement intention could possibly minimize the delays in the activation of neuroprosthetic devices. As yet, single trial analysis using non-invasive approaches for understanding such movement preparation remains a challenging task. We studied the feasibility of predicting movement directions in self-paced upper limb center-out reaching tasks, i.e., spontaneous movements executed without an external cue that can better reflect natural motor behavior in humans. We reported results of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from mild stroke patients and able-bodied participants. Previous studies have shown that low frequency EEG oscillations are modulated by the intent to move and therefore, can be decoded prior to the movement execution. Motivated by these results, we investigated whether slow cortical potentials (SCPs) preceding movement onset can be used to classify reaching directions and evaluated the performance using 5-fold cross-validation. For able-bodied subjects, we obtained an average decoding accuracy of 76% (chance level of 25%) at 62.5 ms before onset using the amplitude of on-going SCPs with above chance level performances between 875 to 437.5 ms prior to onset. The decoding accuracy for the stroke patients was on average 47% with their paretic arms. Comparison of the decoding accuracy across different frequency ranges (i.e., SCPs, delta, theta, alpha, and gamma) yielded the best accuracy using SCPs filtered between 0.1 to 1 Hz. Across all the subjects, including stroke subjects, the best selected features were obtained mostly from the fronto-parietal regions, hence consistent with previous neurophysiological studies on arm reaching tasks. In summary, we concluded that SCPs allow the possibility of single trial decoding of reaching directions at least 312.5 ms before onset of reach.	[Lew, Eileen Y.

J	Jacobs, J				Jacobs, Joshua			Hippocampal theta oscillations are slower in humans than in rodents: implications for models of spatial navigation and memory	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						theta oscillations; navigation; memory; electroencephalography; hippocampus	GRID CELLS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-LOCKING; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL NOVELTY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FREQUENCY; INTERFERENCE	The theta oscillation is a neuroscience enigma. When a rat runs through an environment, large-amplitude theta oscillations (4-10 Hz) reliably appear in the hippocampus's electrical activity. The consistency of this pattern led to theta playing a central role in theories on the neural basis of mammalian spatial navigation and memory. However, in fact, hippocampal oscillations at 4-10 Hz are rare in humans and in some other species. This presents a challenge for theories proposing theta as an essential component of the mammalian brain, including models of place and grid cells. Here, I examine this issue by reviewing recent research on human hippocampal oscillations using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients. This work indicates that the human hippocampus does indeed exhibit rhythms that are functionally similar to theta oscillations found in rodents, but that these signals have a slower frequency of approximately 1-4 Hz. I argue that oscillatory models of navigation and memory derived from rodent data are relevant for humans, but that they should be modified to account for the slower frequency of the human theta rhythm.

Part 2: Experimental characterization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Sleep spindle; Frequency; Duration; Amplitude; Time delay; Propagation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; STATISTICAL EVIDENCE; SLOW OSCILLATION; LIKELIHOOD; ALGORITHM; BRAIN; WAVES	Background: This communication is the second of a two-part series that describes and tests a new methodology for assessing the propagation of EEG sleep spindles. Whereas the first part describes the methodology in detail, this part proposes a thorough evaluation of the approach by applying it to a sample of laboratory sleep recordings. New method: The tested methodology is based on the alignment of time frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels and is used for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive EEG. Results: Spindle propagation displays features that suggest wave displacements of global synaptic potential fields. Propagation patterns that are coherent (as opposed to random), laterally symmetrical, and highly repeatable within and between subjects were observed. Propagation was slower from posterior to anterior and from central to lateral brain regions than in the opposite directions. Propagation speeds varying between 2.3 and 7.0 m/s were obtained. A distinct grouping of propagation properties was noted for a small cluster of frontal electrodes. No propagation between distantly separated scalp locations was observed. The values of spindle characteristics such as average frequency, RMS amplitude, frequency slope, and duration, depend largely on propagation direction but are only mildly correlated with propagation delay. Comparison with existing method(s): Results obtained are in line with many results published in the literature and offer new measures for describing sleep spindle behavior. Conclusions: Propagation properties provide new information about sleep spindle behavior and thus allow more precise automated assessments of spindle-related functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To study the Zolpidem arousing effect in persistent vegetative state (PVS) patients combining clinical evaluation, autonomic assessment by heart rate variability (HRV), and EEG records. Methods. We studied a group of 8 PVS patients and other 8 healthy control subjects, matched by age and gender. The patients and controls received drug or placebo in two experimental sessions, separated by 10-14 days. The first 30 minutes of the session were considered the basal record, and then Zolpidem was administered. All participants were evaluated clinically, by EEG, and by HRV during the basal record, and for 90 minutes after drug intake. Results. We found in all patients, time-related arousing signs after Zolpidem intake: behavioral (yawns and hiccups), activation of EEG cortical activity, and a vagolytic chronotropic effect without a significant increment of the vasomotor sympathetic tone. Conclusions. We demonstrated time-related arousing signs after Zolpidem intake. We discussed possible mechanisms to explain these patho-physiological findings regarding EEG cortical activation and an autonomic vagolytic drug effect. As this autonomic imbalance might induce cardio-circulatory complications, which we didn't find in any of our patients, we suggest developing future trials under control of physiological indices by bedside monitoring. However, considering that this arousing Zolpidem effect might be certainly related to brain function improvement, it should be particularly considered for the development of new neuro-rehabilitation programs in PVS cases. According to the literature review, we claim that this is the first report about the vagolitic effect of Zolpidem in PVS cases.

The quest is to demonstrate that the combined approach gains new insights into specific short-term patterns in HRV during preictal, ictal, and postictal periods in epileptic children. The continuous Morlet-wavelet transform was used to explore the time-frequency characteristics of the HRV using spectrogram, phase-locking, band-power and quadratic phase coupling analyses. These results are completed by time-variant characteristics derived froma signal-adaptive approach. Advanced empirical mode decomposition was utilized to separate out certain HRV components, in particular blood-pressure-related Mayer waves (approximate to 0.1 Hz) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (approximate to 0.3 Hz). Their time-variant nonlinear predictability was analyzed using local estimations of the largest Lyapunov exponent (point prediction error). Approximately 80-100 s before the seizure onset timing and coordination of both HRV components can be observed. A higher degree of synchronization is found and with it a higher predictability of the HRV. All investigated linear and nonlinear analyses contribute with a specific importance to these results.

Preliteracy signatures of poor-reading abilities in resting-state EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						precursors of reading disabilities; resting-state EEG; reading fluency; delta and alpha oscillations	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; BAND POWER CHANGES; DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN MATURATION; FAMILIAL RISK; SCHOOL-AGE; ALPHA	The hereditary character of dyslexia suggests the presence of putative underlying neural anomalies already in preliterate age. Here, we investigated whether early neurophysiological correlates of future reading difficulties-a hallmark of dyslexia-could be identified in the resting-state EEG of preliterate children. The children in this study were recruited at birth and classified on the basis of parents' performance on reading tests to be at-risk of becoming poor readers (n = 48) or not (n = 14). Eyes-open rest EEG was measured at the age of 3 years, and the at-risk children were divided into fluent readers (n = 24) and non-fluent readers (n = 24) after reading assessment at their third grade of school. We found that fluent readers and non-fluent readers differed in normalized spectral amplitude. Non-fluent readers were characterized by lower amplitude in the delta-1 frequency band (0.5-2 Hz) and higher amplitude in the alpha-1 band (6-8 Hz) in multiple scalp regions compared to control and at-risk fluent readers. Interestingly, across groups these EEG biomarkers correlated with several behavioral test scores measured in the third grade. Specifically, the performance on reading fluency, phonological and orthographic tasks and rapid automatized naming task correlated positively with delta-1 and negatively with alpha-1. Together, our results suggest that combining family-risk status, neurophysiological testing and behavioral test scores in a longitudinal setting may help uncover physiological mechanisms implicated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as the predisposition to reading disabilities.

In individuals with schizophrenia, central executive functions are supposed to be heavily impaired. Given that theta phase coupling is causally involved in central executive functions, one would expect that patients with an executive function deficit should display abnormal EEG theta synchronization. We therefore investigated executive functioning in 21 healthy controls and 21 individuals with schizophrenia while they performed a visuospatial delayed match to sample task. The task required either high executive demands (manipulation of content inworking memory [WM]) or low executive demands (retention of WM content). In addition, WM load (one vs. three items) was varied. Results indicated higher frontal theta activity for manipulation processes than for retention processes in patients with schizophrenia, as compared with healthy controls, independently of WM load. Furthermore, individuals with schizophrenia revealed a reduction in theta phase coupling during early stages of the delay period for retention, as well as for manipulation processes at high-WM loads. Deviations in theta phase coupling in individuals with schizophrenia were mainly characterized by aberrant fronto-posterior connections, but also by attenuated posterior connections during manipulation of high-WM load. To conclude, fronto-parietal theta coupling seems to be substantially involved in executive control, whereas frontal theta activity seems to reflect general task demands, such as deployment of attentional resources during WM.

GC analysis was performed by vector autoregressive modeling, and significance of each link in the network was assessed using F-statistics. The whole-night analysis revealed the existence of a fully connected network of brain-heart and brain-brain interactions, with the EEG power acting as a hub which conveys the largest number of GC links between the heart and brain nodes. These links became progressively more weak when assessed during light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep, thus suggesting that brain-heart GC networks are sustained mainly by sleep stage transitions.

Several studies show that endogenous brain rhythms may be enhanced via diverse brain stimulation techniques applying rhythmic stimulation. Here, we investigated in normal hearing participants whether application of rTMS (left auditory cortex) with an individualized alpha frequency was capable of increasing alpha activity in stimulated auditory regions in a sustained manner. Behavioral intensity discrimination performance worsened for the rTMS group as compared to Sham. Electroencephalography (EEG) data, however, clearly show that this functional inhibition is not accompanied by increases of auditory cortical alpha. Even though more pronounced power reductions for the rTMS group were observed at slower frequencies (delta to theta range) at stimulated and other sites of the left hemisphere, they were unrelated to behavioral changes. Our results also strongly suggest that the amount of power modulations at these slower frequencies is strongly dependent on pre-rTMS power, thus supporting current state-dependency notions. Strong relationships to behavioral changes were in particular observed for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) beta power and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) beta connectivity. Moreover, these beta band measures were strongly inter-related and when viewed together specifically sensitive to behavioral changes in the rTMS group. We conclude that currently alpha frequency rTMS is not a promising avenue for the treatment of chronic tinnitus and that beneficial effects could be mediated via nonauditory systems. Our study argues for the value of combined EEG-TMS studies when investigating the impacts of rTMS. Hum Brain Mapp 35:14-29, 2014. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This error arises from the combination of both intrinsic measurement noise of the digitization apparatus and manual coregistration error when selecting corresponding points on anatomical MRI volumes. A common assumption is that such an error would lead only to displacement of localized sources. Here, we measured electrode positions on a 3D-printed full-scale replica head, using three different techniques: a fringe projection 3D scanner, a novel "Flying Triangulation" 3D sensor, and a traditional electromagnetic digitizer. Using highly accurate fringe projection data as ground truth, the Flying Triangulation sensor had a mean error of 1.5 mm while the electromagnetic digitizer had a mean error of 6.8 mm. Then, again using the fringe projection as ground truth, individual EEG simulations were generated, with source locations across the brain space and a range of sensor noise levels. The simulated datasets were then processed using a beamformer in conjunction with the electrode coordinates registered with the Flying Triangulation and electromagnetic digitizer methods. The beamformer's output SNR was severely degraded with the digitizer-based positions but less severely with the Flying Triangulation coordinates. Therefore, the seemingly innocuous error in electrode registration may result in substantial degradation of beamformer performance, with output SNR penalties up to several decibels. In the case of low-SNR signals such as deeper brain structures or gamma band sources, this implies that sensor coregistration accuracy could make the difference between successful detection of such activity or complete failure to resolve the source.

It has been proposed that positive mood facilitates elaborative, relational encoding, whereas negative mood promotes a more careful, stimulus-driven encoding style. Previous electrophysiological studies have linked successful information encoding to power increases in slow (< 8 Hz) delta/theta and fast (> 30 Hz) gamma oscillations, as well as to power decreases in midrange (8-30 Hz) alpha/beta oscillations. Whether different mood states modulate encoding-related oscillations has not been investigated yet. In order to address this question, we used an experimental mood induction procedure and recorded electroencephalograms from 20 healthy participants while they performed a free recall memory task after positive and negative mood induction. We found distinct oscillatory patterns in positive and negative mood. Successful encoding in positive mood was accompanied by widespread power increases in the delta band, whereas encoding success in negative mood was specifically accompanied by frontal power decreases in the beta band. On the behavioral level, memory performance was enhanced in positive mood. Our findings show that mood differentially modulates the neural correlates of successful information encoding and thus contribute to an understanding of how mood shapes different processing styles.

Background: Modern training techniques focus on improving decision-making skills with participative assessment between trainees and subject matter experts primarily through subjective observation. Objective metrics need to be developed. The current proof of concept study explored the potential for psychophysiological metrics in deadly force judgment contexts. Method: Twenty-four participants (novice, expert) were recruited. All wore a wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) device to collect psychophysiological data during high-fidelity simulated deadly force judgment and decision-making simulations using a modified Glock firearm. Participants were exposed to 27 video scenarios, one-third of which would have justified use of deadly force. Pass/fail was determined by whether the participant used deadly force appropriately. Results: Experts had a significantly higher pass rate compared to novices (p < 0.05). Multiple metrics were shown to distinguish novices from experts. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that psychophysiological variables are able to explain 72% of the variability in expert performance, but only 37% in novices. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) using psychophysiological metrics was able to discern between experts and novices with 72.6% accuracy. Conclusion: While limited due to small sample size, the results suggest that psychophysiology may be developed for use as an objective measure of expertise in DFDJM. Specifically, discriminant function measures may have the potential to objectively identify expert skill acquisition. Application: Psychophysiological metrics may create a performance model with the potential to optimize simulator-based DFJDM training. These performance models could be used for trainee feedback, and/or by the instructor to assess performance objectively.

Neurophysiological Analysis of Speech Perception in 2.5 to 3.5-Year-Old Orphans and Children Raised in a Family	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						speech perception; EEG rhythms; orphans; direct and "reversed" speech	THETA OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNITY CHILDREN; EEG ALPHA; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTACHMENT; DYNAMICS; ROMANIA	In 2.5-3.5-year-old orphans (n = 41) and children raised in a family (n = 50), we examined specificities of speech perception-related changes in the spectral power density (SPD) of the EEG rhythms. Changes in the SPDs of the theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-rhythms in 16 EEG leads where estimated at presentation of a meaningful speech fragment record (short poem) and of a reversed record of the same signal (direct and reversed speech, respectively). The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III demonstrated the existence of noticeable delays in the development of speech in orphans. Comparison of background EEGs and EEGs in the course of listening for direct speech showed that the alpha-rhythm is desynchronized, while the theta-, beta-, and, especially, gamma-oscillations are synchronized upon perception of the above stimulus. In this case, children raised in a family demonstrated significant increases in the gamma-rhythm SPD in 13 leads of both hemispheres; in orphans, this was observed only in 8 loci localized mostly in the left hemisphere. In children of both groups, listening for reversed speech induced mostly desynchronization of all EEG rhythms with the greatest drops in the gamma SPD mostly in the frontal and left temporal leads. Comparison of SPDs of the EEG components (rhythms) at listening for direct and reversed speech demonstrated that powers of theta-, beta-, and gamma-oscillations increased at presentation of a direct (comprehended) speech in children of both groups. In children raised in families, greater SPDs of the gamma-rhythm were observed in 13 leads (differences were most significant in the frontal parts of the left hemisphere). In institutionalized children, the number of leads with significant increments of the gamma-rhythm power was significantly smaller (only 9). It is supposed that smaller increases in the SPD of of gamma-range oscillations in orphans are related to deviations in the processing of a semantic component of speech perception. This can result from insufficient development of cerebral neuronal networks responsible for processing of verbal information.	[Belalov, V. V.; Dyagileva, Yu. O.; Pavlenko, V.

Interpreting EEG alpha activity	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Individual alpha peak frequency; Individual alpha bandwidth; Alpha amplitude suppression; Spindle-form segments length; Intra-spindle amplitude variability	TISSUE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES; BLOOD-FLOW VELOCITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; PHASE RESET; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; THALAMOCORTICAL NETWORKS; PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; NEUROFEEDBACK IMPROVES	Exploring EEG alpha oscillations has generated considerable interest, in particular with regards to the role they play in cognitive, psychomotor, psycho-emotional and physiological aspects of human life. However, there is no clearly agreed upon definition of what constitutes 'alpha activity' or which of the many indices should be used to characterize it. To address these issues this review attempts to delineate EEG alpha-activity, its physical, molecular and morphological nature, and examine the following indices: (1) the individual alpha peak frequency; (2) activation magnitude, as measured by alpha amplitude suppression across the individual alpha bandwidth in response to eyes opening, and (3) alpha "auto-rhythmicity" indices: which include intra-spindle amplitude variability, spindle length and steepness. Throughout, the article offers a number of suggestions regarding the mechanism(s) of alpha activity related to inter and intra-individual variability.

The ASSR signals extracted from stimulated electro encephalogram (EEG), explored in search for differentiating and robust to noise features. Choosing appropriate features in time and frequency domain, the performance of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis in classifying signals in different scenarios are studied. While the developed method itself is novel in sleep monitoring, due to similarities between N3 stage of sleep and anesthesia, the method will pave the way for later analysis on monitoring consciousness with 40-Hz ASSR. The 40-Hz ASSR extraction and noise cancellation methods presented in this paper can also be used for extracting 40-Hz ASSR from its background EEG signal in general.

Abnormal patterns of theta frequency oscillations during the temporal evolution of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Freezing of gait; Electroencephalography; Cross talk	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PEDUNCULOPONTINE NUCLEUS; MOTOR; MOVEMENT; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; INHIBITION	Objective: We sought to characterize the electrophysiological signature of Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. Methods: We examined 24 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and significant freezing of gait as they performed a series of timed up-and-go tasks in their 'off' state while electroencephalographic data was collected from four scalp leads. Fast Fourier Transformation was utilized to explore the power spectral density between periods of normal walking and periods of freezing, as well as during the transition between the two states. In addition, Cross Spectrum and Cross Frequency analyses were used to explore the role of impaired temporal and spatial connectivity. Results: When compared to walking, episodes of freezing were associated with a significant increase in theta band power within the central and frontal leads. The transition from normal walking to freezing of gait was also associated with increased theta frequency coupling between the central and frontal leads, along with an increase in cross-frequency coupling in the central lead. Conclusions: Episodes of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease are associated with abnormal oscillatory activity in the brain. Significance: These results provide novel insights into the pattern of spatiotemporal dynamics underlying freezing of gait and may provide a potential means for therapeutic prediction and alleviation of freezing episodes in susceptible patients.

Oscillations of neural excitability shape sensory, motor, and cognitive processes. Intrinsic oscillations also entrain to external rhythms, allowing the brain to optimize the processing of predictable events such as speech. Moreover, selective attention to a particular rhythm in a complex environment entails entrainment of neural oscillations to its temporal structure. Entrainment appears to form one of the core mechanisms of selective attention, which is likely to be relevant to certain psychiatric disorders. Deficient entrainment has been found in schizophrenia and dyslexia and mounting evidence also suggests that it may be abnormal in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Accordingly, we suggest that studying entrainment in selective-attention paradigms is likely to reveal mechanisms underlying deficits across multiple disorders.	[Calderone, Daniel J.; Castellanos, F.

Prestimulus Neural Oscillations Inhibit Visual Perception via Modulation of Response Gain	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MU RHYTHM; ATTENTION; BAND; PERFORMANCE; DISCRIMINATION; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY; CONTRAST; CORTEX	The ongoing state of the brain radically affects how it processes sensory information. How does this ongoing brain activity interact with the processing of external stimuli? Spontaneous oscillations in the alpha range are thought to inhibit sensory processing, but little is known about the psychophysical mechanisms of this inhibition. We recorded ongoing brain activity with EEG while human observers performed a visual detection task with stimuli of different contrast intensities. To move beyond qualitative description, we formally compared psychometric functions obtained under different levels of ongoing alpha power and evaluated the inhibitory effect of ongoing alpha oscillations in terms of contrast or response gain models. This procedure opens the way to understanding the actual functional mechanisms by which ongoing brain activity affects visual performance. We found that strong prestimulus occipital alpha oscillationsbut not more anterior mu oscillationsreduce performance most strongly for stimuli of the highest intensities tested. This inhibitory effect is best explained by a divisive reduction of response gain. Ongoing occipital alpha oscillations thus reflect changes in the visual system's input/output transformation that are independent of the sensory input to the system. They selectively scale the system's response, rather than change its sensitivity to sensory information.

J	Sameni, R; Gouy-Pailler, C				Sameni, Reza; Gouy-Pailler, Cedric			An iterative subspace denoising algorithm for removing electroencephalogram ocular artifacts	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Subspace decomposition; Electroencephalogram denoising; Ocular artifacts; Semi-blind source separation	EIGENVALUE BASED DETECTION; EEG; SIGNALS; DECOMPOSITION; ICA	Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements are always contaminated by non-cerebral signals, which disturb EEG interpretability. Among the different artifacts, ocular artifacts are the most disturbing ones. In previous studies, limited improvement has been obtained using frequency-based methods. Spatial decomposition methods have shown to be more effective for removing ocular artifacts from EEG recordings. Nevertheless, these methods are not able to completely separate cerebral and ocular signals and commonly eliminate important features of the EEG. New method: In a previous study we have shown the applicability of a deflation algorithm based on generalized eigenvalue decomposition for separating desired and undesired signal subspaces. In this work, we extend this idea for the automatic detection and removal of electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts from multichannel EEG recordings. The notion of effective number of identifiable dimensions, is also used to estimate the number of dominant dimensions of the ocular subspace, which enables the precise and fast convergence of the algorithm. Results: The method is applied on real and synthetic data. It is shown that the method enables the separation of cerebral and ocular signals with minimal interference with cerebral signals. Comparison with existing method(s): The proposed approach is compared with two widely used denoising techniques based on independent component analysis (ICA). Conclusions: It is shown that the algorithm outperformed ICA-based approaches. Moreover, the method is computationally efficient and is implemented in real-time. Due to its semi-automatic structure and low computational cost, it has broad applications in real-time EEG monitoring systems and brain-computer interface experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a novel classification model based on independent component analysis (ICA) and Extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to detect lying. Firstly, ICA and its topography information were used to automatically identify the P300 ICs. Then, time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the reconstructed P3 waveforms. Finally, two classes of feature samples were used to train ELM, Back-propagation network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for comparison. The optimal number of P3 ICs and the values of classifier parameter were optimized by the cross-validation procedures. Experimental results show that the presented method (ICA_ELM) achieves the highest training accuracy of 95.40% with extremely less training and testing time on detecting P3 components for the guilty and the innocent subjects. The results indicate that the proposed method can be applied in lie detection.

To address this aspect, for the first time, likelihood ratio test (LRT) was utilized to propose a novel multichannel frequency recognition method for SSVEP data. The essence of this new method is to calculate the association between multichannel EEG signals and the reference signals which were constructed according to the stimulus frequency with LRT. For the simulation and real SSVEP data, the proposed method yielded higher recognition accuracy with shorter time window length and was more robust against noise in comparison with the popular canonical correlation analysis-(CCA-) based method and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-(LASSO-) based method. The recognition accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) obtained by the proposed method was higher than those of the CCA-based method and LASSO-based method. The superior results indicate that the LRT method is a promising candidate for reliable frequency recognition in future SSVEP-BCI.

To validate the microgravity-induced physiological and psychological effects on EEG, quantitative EEG features, cardiovascular indicators, mood state, and cognitive performances data collection was achieved during a 45 day period using a -6A degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR) integrated approach. The results demonstrated significant differences in EEG data, as an increased Theta wave, a decreased Beta wave and a reduced complexity of brain, accompanied with an increased heart rate and pulse rate, decreased positive emotion, and degraded emotion conflict monitoring performance. The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based cardiovascular and cognitive related EEG model showed the cardiovascular effect on EEG mainly affected bilateral temporal region and the cognitive effect impacted parietal-occipital and frontal regions. The results obtained in the study support the use of an approach which combines a multi-factor influential mechanism hypothesis. The changes in the EEG data may be influenced by both cardiovascular and cognitive effects.

Stone Age weapon use can be traced through deep time. Studying aspects thereof might have implications for how we think about the evolution of the human brain and the thinking processes that make us human. A pilot EEG-ERP (electroencephalography, event-related potential) study was conducted to evaluate changes in the volume of neural energy that is required between simple, replicated spear-throwing and arrow-shooting tasks. When participants engaged in the experimental tasks, we recorded consistent, and statistically significant higher levels of activity in delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands across the parietal, frontal midline and orbitofrontal cortices of the human brain. Based on our sample size of only four individuals, these results are considered preliminary, but they indicate the potential for similar studies in the future.	[Williams, Victoria M.

Effects of aberrant gamma frequency oscillations on prepulse inhibition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Animal behaviour; electrophysiology; gamma frequency oscillations; NMDA receptor antagonist; prepulse inhibition; schizophrenia	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONY; KETAMINE; STARTLE; MODEL; RAT; INTERNEURONS	Emerging literature implicates abnormalities in gamma frequency oscillations in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, with hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors implicated as a key factor. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a behavioural measure of sensorimotor gating, which is disrupted in schizophrenia. We studied relationships between ongoing and sensory-evoked gamma oscillations and PPI using pharmacological interventions designed to increase gamma oscillations (ketamine, MK-801); reduce gamma oscillations (LY379268); or disrupt PPI (amphetamine). We predicted that elevating ongoing gamma power would lead to increased 'neural noise' in cortical circuits, dampened sensory-evoked gamma responses and disrupted behaviour. Wistar rats were implanted with EEG recording electrodes. They received ketamine (5 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.16 mg/kg), amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg), LY379268 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle and underwent PPI sessions with concurrent EEG recording. Ketamine and MK-801 increased the power of ongoing gamma oscillations and caused time-matched disruptions of PPI, while amphetamine marginally affected ongoing gamma power. In contrast, LY379268 reduced ongoing gamma power, but had no effect on PPI. The sensory gamma response evoked by the prepulse was reduced following treatment with all psychotomimetics, associating with disruptions in PPI. This was most noticeable following treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists. We found that ketamine and MK-801 increase ongoing gamma power and reduce evoked gamma power, both of which are related to disruptions in sensorimotor gating. This appears to be due to antagonism of NMDA receptors, since amphetamine and LY379268 differentially impacted these outcomes and possess different neuropharmacological substrates. Aberrant gamma frequency oscillations caused by NMDA receptor hypofunction may mediate the sensory processing deficits observed in schizophrenia.

Impact of head modeling and sensor types in localizing human gamma-band oscillations	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY; EEG; RESPONSES	An effective mechanism in neuronal communication is oscillatory neuronal synchronization. The neuronal gamma-band (30-100 Hz) synchronization is associated with attention which is induced by a certain visual stimuli. Numerous studies have shown that the gamma-band activity is observed in the visual cortex. However, impact of different head modeling techniques and sensor types to localize gamma-band activity have not yet been reported. To do this, the brain activity was recorded using 306 magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensors, consisting of 102 magnetometers and 102 pairs of planar gradiometers (one measuring the derivative of the magnetic field along the latitude and the other along the longitude), and the data were analyzed with respect to time, frequency, and location of the strongest response. The spherical head models with a single-shell and overlapping spheres (local sphere) have been used as a forward model for calculating the external magnetic fields generated from the gamma-band activity. For each sensor type, the subject-specific frequency range of the gamma-band activity was obtained from the spectral analysis. The identified frequency range of interest with the highest gamma-band activity is then localized using a spatial-filtering technique known as dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS). The source analysis for all the subjects revealed that the gradiometer sensors which measure the derivative along the longitude, showed sources close to the visual cortex (cuneus) as compared to the other gradiometer sensors which measure the derivative along the latitude. However, using the magnetometer sensors, it was not possible to localize the sources in the region of interest. When comparing the two head models, the localsphere model helps in localizing the source more focally as compared to the single-shell head model.	[Mideksa, K.

J	Khadem, A; Hossein-Zadeh, GA				Khadem, Ali; Hossein-Zadeh, Gholam-Ali			Quantification of the effects of volume conduction on the EEG/MEG connectivity estimates: an index of sensitivity to brain interactions	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG/MEG functional/effective connectivity measures; independent component analysis (ICA); sensitivity index; surrogate data; volume conduction (VC)	EEG ACTIVITY PROPAGATION; PHASE-LAG INDEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; INFORMATION; COHERENCE; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CAUSALITY; DYNAMICS	In the context of EEG/MEG, the term 'volume conduction (VC) effects' refers to the recording of an instantaneous linear mixture of multiple brain source activities by each EEG/MEG channel. VC effects may lead to the detection of spurious functional/effective couplings among EEG/MEG channels that are not caused by brain interactions. It is of importance to determine which detected couplings are indicators of brain interactions and which originate from the VC artefacts. In this paper, a quantitative framework is proposed to explore the origin of detected channel couplings by using two types of surrogate datasets. Also, a sensitivity index (called SI) is proposed to compare the power of different connectivity measures to discriminate between the brain interactions and the instantaneous linear mixing effects. We use seven different functional connectivity estimators to evaluate our method on simulation models and resting state EEG data. The error rate of the proposed framework for simulation data by using each of the connectivity estimators is less than 5.2%. Also, SI ranks these connectivity estimators according to their sensitivity to brain interactions in the presence of VC artefacts. As expected, the connectivity measures which are theoretically robust to VC artefacts yield high SI in simulation models and EEG data. In addition, for EEG data in the alpha frequency band the reproducible functional couplings which are indicators of brain interactions are in the back-front directions. This is consistent with the previous studies in this field.

In the present study, we tested a novel hypothesis about the neural mechanism underlying post-error slowing. Recent research has shown that when task-relevant stimuli occur in a rhythmic stream, neuronal oscillations entrain to the task structure, thereby enhancing reaction speed. We hypothesized that under such circumstances post-error slowing results from an error-induced disturbance of this endogenous brain rhythm. To test this hypothesis, we measured oscillatory EEG dynamics while human subjects performed a demanding discrimination task under time pressure. We found that low-frequency neuronal oscillations entrained to the stimulus presentation rhythm, and that the low-frequency phase at stimulus onset predicted the speed of responding. Importantly, we found that this entrainment was disrupted following errors, and that the degree of phase disturbance was closely related to the degree of post-error slowing on the subsequent trial. These results describe a new mechanism underlying behavioral changes following errors.

However, the functional significance of theta oscillations in human memory processes remains largely unknown. Here, we review studies in human and animals examining how scalp-recorded FMT relates to memory behaviors and also their possible neural generators. We also discuss models of the functional relevance of theta oscillations to memory processes and suggest promising directions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The effect of linear mixing in the EEG on Hurst exponent estimation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; VOLUME CONDUCTION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; FREQUENCY BAND; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; TIME	Although the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal EEG/MEG oscillations is widely acknowledged, the majority of studies to date have been performed in sensor space, disregarding the mixing effects implied by volume conduction and confounding noise. While the effect of mixing on the evaluation of evoked responses and connectivity measures has been extensively studied, there are, to date, no studies reporting on the differences in the values of the estimated Hurst exponents when moving between sensor and source space representations of the multivariate data or on the effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations and in theory that measuring Hurst exponents in sensor space may lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the underlying data and that noise may significantly bias the estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal. Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the resting state from EEG data. By moving either to an independent components representation or to a source representation which maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the alpha frequency range, we observe greater variance, skewness and kurtosis over measured Hurst exponents than in sensor space. We confirm the suitability of conventional source separation methodology by. introducing a novel algorithm HeMax which obtains a source maximizing the Hurst exponent in the amplitude dynamics of narrow band oscillations. Our findings imply that the long-range correlative properties of the EEG should be studied in source space, in such a way that the SNR is maximized, or at least with spatial decomposition techniques approximating source activities, rather than in sensor space.

Event-related oscillations (ERO) reflect cognitive responses of brain whereas sensory-evoked oscillations (SE) inform about sensory responses. For this study, we compared visual SEO and ERO responses in MCI to explore brain dynamics (Background). Forty-three patients with MCI (mean age=74.0 year) and 41 age- and education-matched healthy-elderly controls (HC) (mean age=71.1 year) participated in the study. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-3.0 Hz) were measured from two conditions (simple visual stimulation and classical visual oddball paradigm target stimulation) (Method). Overall, amplitudes of target ERO responses were higher than SEO amplitudes. The preferential location for maximum amplitude values was frontal lobe for ERO and occipital lobe for SEO. The ANOVA for delta responses showed significant results for the group Xparadigm. Post-hoc tests indicated that (1) the difference between groups were significant for target delta responses, but not for SEO, (2) ERO elicited higher responses for HC than MCI patients, and (3) females had higher target ERO than males and this difference was pronounced in the control group (Results). Overall, cognitive responses display almost double the amplitudes of sensory responses over frontal regions. The topography of oscillatory responses differs depending on stimuli: visualsensory responses are highest over occipitals and -cognitive responses over frontal regions. A group effect is observed in MCI indicating that visual sensory and cognitive circuits behave differently indicating preserved visual sensory responses, but decreased cognitive responses (Conclusion).

Test-Retest Reliability of the 40 Hz EEG Auditory Steady-State Response	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; BIPOLAR DISORDER; MODULATED TONES	Auditory evoked steady-state responses are increasingly being used as a marker of brain function and dysfunction in various neuropsychiatric disorders, but research investigating the test-retest reliability of this response is lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the consistency of the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) across sessions. Furthermore, the current study aimed to investigate how the reliability of the ASSR is impacted by stimulus parameters and analysis method employed. The consistency of this response across two sessions spaced approximately 1 week apart was measured in nineteen healthy adults using electroencephalography (EEG). The ASSR was entrained by both 40 Hz amplitude-modulated white noise and click train stimuli. Correlations between sessions were assessed with two separate analytical techniques: a) channel-level analysis across the whole-head array and b) signal-space projection from auditory dipoles. Overall, the ASSR was significantly correlated between sessions 1 and 2 (p < 0.05, multiple comparison corrected), suggesting adequate test-retest reliability of this response. The current study also suggests that measures of inter-trial phase coherence may be more reliable between sessions than measures of evoked power. Results were similar between the two analysis methods, but reliability varied depending on the presented stimulus, with click train stimuli producing more consistent responses than white noise stimuli.

Detrended fluctuation analysis of EEG signals	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN ENGINEERING (INTER-ENG 2013)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Interdisciplinarity in Engineering (INTER-ENG)	OCT 10-11, 2013	Tarqu Mures, ROMANIA	Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures		Nonlinearity; non-stationary signals; Fractal property; DFA - detrended fluctuation analysis	TRENDS	Scaling properties are one of the most important quantifiers of complexity in many events, as time series (TS). To try to have a glimpse how brain is working, we need new methods of analysis. The structural characteristics of biomedical signals are often visually apparent, but not captured by conventional measures (average amplitude, Fourier analysis based methods, up to second order statistics). Biomedical signals (as LFP, ECoG, EEG) could possess a scale invariant structure. Scale invariance means that the structure repeats itself on subintervals of the signal. We know that the time series x(t) are scale invariant when: x[c.n]=c(H).x[n]. The Hurst Exponent (H) is a dimensionless estimator for the self-similarity of a time series. Presence of scaling exponents can point to an inner fractal structure of the series. The constant c represent a scaling coefficient (c > 1 - contraction, c < dilation). The power law exponent H, is the Hurst exponent and represent a particular kind of scale invariant structure in biomedical signals. Fractal analysis or moving average estimates this power law exponent H, characteristic for time series. To compare two time series is a difficult task. For biomedical signals, usually, H is time dependent. The Hurst exponent can be used to compare time series. But a best way to describe the scale invariant structure of biosignals is the use of multifractal characterization. This kind of study for the non-stationary biological signals is based on the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method. Multiple scales can be characterized through various techniques with Multifractal Spectrum (MS). Mutlifractal spectrum is a generalization of the H exponent. This paper is presenting the results of the use of detrended fluctuation analysis of multichannel EEG recordings. The main goal is the comparison of recording's fractal structure and their behavior at low and high frequency ranges. The method is proper to be used in the analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Marton, L. F.; Brassai, S.

While the processing of visual information involves activation of early visual cortices, the recruitment of parietal and frontal cortices has been shown to be crucial for perceptual processes. Yet is it not clear how both cortical and long-range oscillatory activity leads to the integration of visual features into a coherent percept. Here, we will investigate perceptual grouping through the analysis of a contour categorization task, where the local elements that form contour must be linked into a coherent structure, which is then further processed and manipulated to perform the categorization task. The contour formation in our visual stimulus is a dynamic process where, for the first time, visual perception of contours is disentangled from the onset of visual stimulation or from motor preparation, cognitive processes that until now have been behaviorally attached to perceptual processes. Our main finding is that, while local and long-range synchronization at several frequencies seem to be an ongoing phenomena, categorization of a contour could only be predicted through local oscillatory activity within parietal/frontal sources, which in turn, would synchronize at gamma (>30 Hz) frequency. Simultaneously, fronto-parietal beta (13-30 Hz) phase locking forms a network spanning across neural sources that are not category specific. Both long range networks, i.e., the gamma network that is category specific, and the beta network that is not category specific, are functionally distinct but spatially overlapping. Altogether, we show that a critical mechanism underlying contour categorization involves oscillatory activity within parietal/frontal cortices, as well as its synchronization across distal cortical sites.

After implantation, the patient must remain in the hospital until the pathological area of brain is found and possibly resected. During this time, these patients offer a unique opportunity to the research community because any number of behavioral paradigms can be performed to uncover the neural correlates that guide behavior. Here we present a method for recording brain activity from intracranial implants as subjects perform a behavioral task designed to assess decision-making and reward encoding. All electrophysiological data from the intracranial electrodes are recorded during the behavioral task, allowing for the examination of the many brain areas involved in a single function at time scales relevant to behavior. Moreover, and unlike animal studies, human patients can learn a wide variety of behavioral tasks quickly, allowing for the ability to perform more than one task in the same subject or for performing controls. Despite the many advantages of this technique for understanding human brain function, there are also methodological limitations that we discuss, including environmental factors, analgesic effects, time constraints and recordings from diseased tissue. This method may be easily implemented by any institution that performs intracranial assessments; providing the opportunity to directly examine human brain function during behavior.

This article discusses the influence of the Baroque music on learning state from the perspective of electroencephalogram analysis. First electroencephalogram (EEG) data of the n-back experiments are collected before and after listening to the Baroque music. Then its frequency, the energy, a wave distribution, scalp, event related potential and other components are compared. Specially, the brain's memory and attention are analyzed and estimated by extracting useful EEG information in time-domain, frequency-domain and spatial distribution. The experimental results show that Baroque music has a positive influence on improving learning efficiency. So that teachers can use Baroque music to assist teaching as reform means, which will provide an effective way to improve the learning efficiency and teaching quality.

Still it remains largely unknown how brain connectivity within these regions is altered at the level of neuronal oscillations. Therefore, the goal was to analyze prefrontal electroencephalographic phase synchronization in MDD and its changes after antidepressant treatment. In 60 unmedicated patients and 60 healthy controls (HC), a 15-min resting electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in subjects at baseline and in a subgroup of patients after 2 weeks of antidepressant medication. EEG functional connectivity between the SGPFC and the MPFC/DLPFC was assessed with eLORETA (low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) by means of lagged phase synchronization. At baseline, patients revealed increased prefrontal connectivity at the alpha frequency between the SGPFC and the left DLPFC/MPFC. After treatment, an increased connectivity between the SGPFC and the right DLPFC/MPFC at the beta frequency was found for MDD. A positive correlation was found for baseline beta connectivity and reduction in scores on the Hamilton depression rating scale. MDD is characterized by increased EEG functional connectivity within frontal brain areas. These EEG markers of disturbed neuronal communication might have potential value as biomarkers.

Available for non-stationary signal analysis methods, such as the WVD, short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, there are also some problems. For example, the problems are cross-term in WVD method, the frequency resolution of short-time Fourier transform and select the appropriate wavelet in the wavelet transform. Jonathan S. Smith proposed a local mean decomposition (LMD) method on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, and first LMD applied in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal time-frequency analysis. LMD algorithm and EMD algorithm has the following differences: LMD uses the method of moving average instead of using cubic spline interpolation. As the final result of EMD decomposition is a series of IMF. And the end result of LMD decomposition is a series of AM-FM signal. Using inverse cosine function directly obtained the instantaneous frequency. Product function(PF) of LMD than IMF of EMD can save more frequency and envelope information. However, the signal change after LMD will produce some False PF component, especially has the low frequency of false weight. In this paper, based on the problem for False PF component in LMD, using of false component identification of the theory based on stepwise regression. PF component in the decomposition of the original signal a significant impact as a criterion, to identify and remove false weight. Through test the simulation signal and the actual voice signal, this improved method relative to the current method of the correlation coefficient by removing false weight has distinct advantages and reasonable.

Mouse models of AD expressing mutated forms of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), a central protein involved in AD pathology, show cortical hypersynchronicity. We studied hippocampal circuitry in APP23 transgenic mice using telemetric electroencephalography (EEG), at the age of onset of memory deficits. APP23 mice display spontaneous hypersynchronicity in the hippocampus including epileptiform spike trains. Furthermore, spectral contributions of hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations are compromised in APP23 mice, compared to non-transgenic controls. Using cross-frequency coupling analysis, we show that hippocampal gamma amplitude modulation by theta phase is markedly impaired in APP23 mice. Hippocampal hypersynchronicity and waveforms are differentially modulated by injection of riluzole and the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitor MK801, suggesting specific involvement of voltage-gated sodium channels and NMDA receptors in hypersynchronicity thresholds in APP23 mice. Furthermore, APP23 mice show marked activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in hippocampus, and injection of MK801 but not riluzole reduces activation of p38 in the hippocampus. A p38 inhibitor induces hypersynchronicity in APP23 mice to a similar extent as MK801, thus supporting suppression of hypersynchronicity involves NMDA receptors-mediated p38 activity. In summary, we characterize components of hippocampal hypersynchronicity, waveform patterns and cross-frequency coupling in the APP23 mouse model by pharmacological modulation, furthering the understanding of epileptiform brain activity in AD.

Electroencephalogram(EEG) signals can be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of subjects with alcoholism. The neurophysiological interpretation of EEG signals in persons with alcoholism(PWA) is based on observation and interpretation of the frequency and power in their EEGs compared to EEG signals from persons without alcoholism. This paper presents a review of the known features of EEGs obtained from PWA and proposes that the impact of alcoholism on the brain can be determined by computer-aided analysis of EEGs through extracting the minute variations in the EEG signals that can differentiate the EEGs of PWA from those of nonaffected persons. The authors advance the idea of automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of alcoholism by employing the EEG signals. This is achieved through judicious combination of signal processing techniques such as wavelet, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos theory and pattern recognition and classification techniques. A CAD system is cost-effective and efficient and can be used as a decision support system by physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism especially those who do not specialize in alcoholism or neurophysiology. It can also be of great value to rehabilitation centers to assess PWA over time and to monitor the impact of treatment aimed at minimizing or reversing the effects of the disease on the brain. A CAD system can be used to determine the extent of alcoholism-related changes in EEG signals (low, medium, high) and the effectiveness of therapeutic plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Plastic modulation of PTSD resting-state networks and subjective wellbeing by EEG neurofeedback	ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						electroencephalogram; neurofeedback; post-traumatic stress disorder; functional MRI; functional connectivity	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SELF; FMRI; ANXIETY	Objective: Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback training has been shown to produce plastic modulations in salience network and default mode network functional connectivity in healthy individuals. In this study, we investigated whether a single session of neurofeedback training aimed at the voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) amplitude would be related to differences in EEG network oscillations, functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity, and subjective measures of state anxiety and arousal in a group of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Twenty-one individuals with PTSD related to childhood abuse underwent 30 min of EEG neurofeedback training preceded and followed by a resting-state fMRI scan. Results: Alpha desynchronizing neurofeedback was associated with decreased alpha amplitude during training, followed by a significant increase ('rebound') in resting-state alpha synchronization. This rebound was linked to increased calmness, greater salience network connectivity with the right insula, and enhanced default mode network connectivity with bilateral posterior cingulate, right middle frontal gyrus, and left medial prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: Our study represents a first step in elucidating the potential neurobehavioural mechanisms mediating the effects of neurofeedback treatment on regulatory systems in PTSD. Moreover, it documents for the first time a spontaneous EEG 'rebound' after neurofeedback, pointing to homeostatic/compensatory mechanisms operating in the brain.	[Kluetsch, R.

The present study aims to increase our understanding of the functional reshape of the motor system observed in chronic stroke patients during the preparation and the execution of movements. A cohort of 14 chronic stroke patients with a mild-to-moderate hemiparesis and 14 matched healthy controls were included in this study. Participants were asked to perform a bimanual reaction time task synchronizing alternated responses to the presentation of a visual cue. We used Laplacian-transformed EEG activity (LT-EEG) recorded at the locations Cz and C3/C4 to study the response-locked components associated with the motor system activity during the performance of this task. Behaviorally, patients showed larger variable errors than controls in synchronizing the frequency of execution of responses to the interstimulus interval, as well as slower responses compared with controls. LT-EEG analysis showed that whereas control participants increased their supplementary motor area (SMA) activity during the preparation of all responses, patients only showed an increment of activity over this area during their first response of the sequence. More interestingly, patients showed a clear increment of the LT-EEG activity associated with SMA shortly after motor responses as compared to the control participants. Finally, patients showed a hand-dependent inhibitory activity over motor areas ipsilateral to the response hand. Overall, our findings reveal drastic differences in the temporal dynamics of the LT-EEG components associated with the activity over motor and premotor cortices in chronic stroke patients compared with matched control participants during alternated hand responses.

Automatic seizure detection from EEG recording is very important for clinical diagnosis and monitoring and has become an issue of major scientific and technological interest. In this work, we use the spatio-spectral features extracted via multidimensional PARAFAC analysis of the EEG for seizure detection. This is a subject-specific approach which only requires extracting one component explaining a seizure's space-time-frequency pattern. Then, we propose a simple adaptive zero-training technique (AZT) to classify the seizures, with the additional advantages of being fast and able to be used online. Here, we evaluate the performance of this technique and compare its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with those obtained from known pattern recognition methodologies (LDA, SVM, k-Means), on EEG recordings of two epileptic pediatric patients. Results showed that the new method offers the highest sensitivity for different segments' length, although small segments lead to an increase of the false positives rate. The combination of the feature extracted via PARAFAC model and the AZT procedure would therefore be a promising technique for fast zero-training online seizure detection.

Functional connectivity computed as EEG coherence between head-surface data suffers from localization ambiguity, reference dependence, and overestimation due to volume conduction. Lagged coherence between intracortical model sources addresses these criticisms. With this analysis approach, experienced meditators reportedly showed reduced coherence during meditation, meditation-naive participants have not yet been investigated. 58-channel EEG from 23 healthy, right-handed, meditation-naive males during resting [3 runs] and breath counting [2 runs] was computed into sLORETA time series of intracortical electrical activity in 19 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the cortex underlying 19 scalp electrode sites, for each of the eight independent EEG frequency bands covering 1.5-44 Hz. Intracortical lagged coherences and head-surface conventional coherences were computed between the 19 regions/sites. During breath counting compared to resting, paired t-tests corrected for multiple testing revealed four significantly lower intracortical lagged coherences, but four significantly higher head-surface conventional coherences. Lowered intracortical lagged coherences involved left BA 10 and right BAs 3, 10, 17, 40. In conclusion, intracortical lagged coherence can yield results that are inverted to those of head-surface conventional coherence. The lowered functional connectivity between cognitive control areas and sensory perception areas during meditation-type breath counting compared to resting conceivably reflects the attention to a bodily percept without cognitive reasoning. The reductions in functional connectivity were similar but not as widespread as the reductions reported during meditation in experienced meditators.

Juvenile exposure to ketamine causes delayed emergence of EEG abnormalities during adulthood in mice	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						NMDA; Gamma; Oscillations; Schizophrenia; Theta; Drug-abuse	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; POSSIBLE ANIMAL-MODEL; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; APOPTOTIC NEURODEGENERATION; RAT BEHAVIOR; CELL-DEATH; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; MEMORY	Background: Increased susceptibility to cognitive impairment or psychosis in adulthood is associated with adolescent drug abuse. Studies in adults have identified impairments in attention and memory, and changes in EEG, as common consequences of ketamine abuse. In contrast, the effects of ketamine on the juvenile brain have not been extensively tested. This is a significant omission, since abuse of ketamine is often observed within this age group. Objectives: Juvenile mice (4-6 weeks of age) were administered ketamine (20 mg/kg) for 14 days. EEG was assessed in response to auditory stimulation both at one week following ketamine exposure at 7 weeks of age (juvenile) and again at 12 weeks of age (adult). EEG was analyzed for baseline activity, event-related power and event-related potentials (ERPs). Results: While no effects of ketamine exposure were observed during the juvenile period, significant reductions in amplitude of the P20 ERP component and event-related gamma power were seen following ketamine when re-tested as adults. In contrast, reductions in event-related theta were seen in ketamine-exposed mice at both time points. Conclusions: Age related deficits in electrophysiological components such as P20 or event-related gamma may be due to an interruption of normal neural maturation. Reduction of NMDAR signaling during adolescence leads to delayed-onset disruption of gamma oscillations and the P20 component of the ERP. Further, delayed onset of impairment following adolescent ketamine abuse suggests that methods could be developed to detect and treat the early effects of drug exposure prior to the onset of disability.

Time-varying autoregressive model for spectral analysis of microseismic experiments and long-period volcanic events	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Time-series analysis; Fourier analysis; Downhole methods; Volcano seismology; Computational seismology	FLUID-DRIVEN CRACK; EEG SIGNALS; FREQUENCY; TREMOR; FOURIER; DECOMPOSITION; EXCITATION; ALGORITHM	Recent studies show that the frequency content of continuous passive recordings contains useful information for the study of hydraulic fracturing experiments as well as longstanding applications in volcano and global seismology. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is usually used to obtain the time-frequency representation of a seismic trace. Yet, this transform has two main disadvantages, namely its fixed time-frequency resolution and spectral leakage. Here, we describe two methods based on autoregressive (AR) models: the short-time autoregressive method (ST-AR) and the Kalman smoother (KS). These two methods allow for the AR coefficients to vary over time in order to follow time-varying frequency contents. The outcome of AR methods depends mainly on the number of AR coefficients. We use a robust approach to estimate the optimum order of the AR methods that best matches the spectral comparison between Fourier and AR spectra. Comparing the outcomes of the three methods on a synthetic signal, a long-period volcanic event, and microseismic data, we show that the STFT and both AR methods are able to track fast changes in frequency content. The STFT provides reasonable results even for noisy data using a simple and effective algorithm. The coefficients of the AR filter are defined at all time in the case of the KS. However, its better time resolution is slightly offset by a lower frequency resolution and its computational complexity. The ST-AR has a high spectral resolution and the lowest sensitivity to background noises, facilitating the identification of the various frequency components. The estimated AR coefficients can also be used to extract parts of the signal. The study of long-term phenomena, such as resonance frequencies, or transient events, such as long-period events, could help to gain further insight on reservoir deformation during hydraulic fracturing experiments as well as global or volcano seismological signals.

The goal of the current study was to validate an improved algorithm in a much larger group of patients in order to show its general applicability in clinical routine. Methods: For the detection of seizures we developed an algorithm based on Short Time Fourier Transform, calculating the integrated power in the frequency band 2.5-12 Hz for a multi-channel seizure detection montage referenced against the average of Fz-Cz-Pz. For identification of seizures an adaptive thresholding technique was applied. Complete data sets of each patient were used for analyses for a fixed set of parameters. Results: 159 patients (117 temporal-lobe epilepsies (TLE), 35 extra-temporal lobe epilepsies (ETLE), 7 other) were included with a total of 25,278 h of EEG data, 794 seizures were analyzed. The sensitivity was 87.3% and number of false detections per hour (FpH) was 0.22/h. The sensitivity for TLE patients was 89.9% and FpH = 0.19/h; for ETLE patients sensitivity was 77.4% and FpH = 0.25/h. Conclusions: The seizure detection algorithm provided high values for sensitivity and selectivity for unselected large EEG data sets without a priori assumptions of seizure patterns. Significance: The algorithm is a valuable tool for fast and effective screening of long-term scalp EEG recordings. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Genetic variability in the human cannabinoid receptor 1 is associated with resting state EEG theta power in humans	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Cannabinoid receptor 1; rs1049353; rs2180619; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Resting state theta power; Genetics	WORKING-MEMORY; AATN POLYMORPHISM; CNR1 GENE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EFFICIENCY; REVEAL; BRAIN; ALPHA; TASK	It has long been postulated that exogenous cannabinoids have a profound effect on human cognitive functioning. These cannabinoid effects are thought to depend, at least in parts, on alterations of phase-locking of local field potential neuronal firing. The latter can be measured as activity in the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz) by electroencephalogram. Theta oscillations are supposed to serve as a mechanism in neural representations of behaviorally relevant information. However, it remains unknown whether variability in endogenous cannabinoid activity is involved in theta rhythms and therefore, may serve as an individual differences index of human cognitive functioning. To clarify this issue, we recorded resting state EEG activity in 164 healthy human subjects and extracted EEG power across frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). To assess variability in the endocannabinoid system, two genetic polymorphisms (rs1049353, rs2180619) within the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CBI) were determined in all participants. As expected, we observed significant effects of rs1049353 on EEG power in the theta band at frontal, central and parietal electrode regions. Crucially, these effects were specific for the theta band, with no effects on activity in the other frequency bands. Rs2180619 showed no significant associations with theta power after Bonferroni correction. Taken together, we provide novel evidence in humans showing that genetic variability in the cannabinoid receptor 1 is associated with resting state EEG power in the theta frequency band. This extends prior findings of exogenous cannabinoid effects on theta power to the endogenous cannabinoid system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Heitland, I.; Kenemans, J. L.; Baas, J.

Event-related oscillations (ERO) may provide a useful tool for the identification of cognitive deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we investigate peak-to-peak amplitude of auditory eventrelated delta oscillations of MCI subjects. Method. The study included twenty-two consecutive patients with MCI recruited in neurology clinic and 21 age-and education-matched normal elderly controls. A classical auditory oddball paradigm was used in the experiments. EEG was recorded from F-3, F-z, F-4, C-3, C-z, C-4, P-3, P-z, P-4, O-1, O-z, and O-2 locations. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject's averaged delta response (0.5-2.2Hz) weremeasured. Results. The amplitudes between groups differed significantly at the frontal and mid-centroparietal locations. ANOVA on delta responses revealed a significant effect for groups (F-(1.41) = 4.84, P = 0.033), indicating a larger delta response for healthy controls thanMCI subjects. Post hoc comparisons revealed that peak-to-peak delta response was significantly larger for healthy controls than for MCI over electrode sites F-3, F-z, F-4, C-z, C-4, and Pz. Discussion. Event-related delta frequency band seems to be the most affected oscillatory response in cognitive impairment due to AD. Therefore, it deserves to be investigated as a candidate electrophysiological biomarker in further studies.

J	Wang, JS; Xu, Y				Wang Jun-Song; Xu Yao			Spontaneous oscillation analysis of neural mass model using describing function approach	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						neural mass model; sigmoid nonlinear function; describing function; spontaneous oscillation	INHIBITION; MEG/EEG; FMRI	Neural mass model (NMM) can generate spontaneous oscillation even in a resting state. However, it remains little known which mechanism is responsible for NMM's spontaneous oscillation. From dynamical theory, spontaneous oscillation is an intrinsic property of nonlinear system, which means that the sigmoid nonlinear function (S function) of NMM plays a key role in the emergence of its spontaneous oscillation. In this study, describing function approach is employed to analyze the spontaneous oscillation characteristics of a kind of extended NMM. Firstly, the describing function of S function is derived, through which the two S functions in excitatory and inhibitory feedback loop, respectively, are approximated. Secondly, the NMM is transformed into a typical block diagram composed of a nonlinear unit and a linear unit. Thirdly, in the theoretical framework of describing function approach, theoretical analysis of the spontaneous oscillation characteristics of NMM is conducted, and the oscillation frequencies are determined. The simulation results demonstrate that the theoretical results are correct and the employed approach is effective. Since S function exists extensively in neural system, the proposed approach has a potential application in the spontaneous oscillation analysis of other neural model.

We found that current stimulation in the lower gamma band during REM sleep influences ongoing brain activity and induces self-reflective awareness in dreams. Other stimulation frequencies were not effective, suggesting that higher order consciousness is indeed related to synchronous oscillations around 25 and 40 Hz.

This has been commonly studied through the N400 event-related potential (ERP), as a measure of facilitated lexical retrieval. However, the associative relationships in multi-word expressions (MWE) may enable the generation of a categorical expectation, leading to lexical retrieval before target word onset. Processing of the target word would thus reflect a target-identification mechanism, possibly indexed by a P3 ERP component. However, given their time overlap (200-500 ms post-stimulus onset), differentiating between N4001P3 ERP responses (averaged over multiple linguistically variable trials) is problematic. In the present study, we analyzed EEG data from a previous experiment, which compared ERP responses to highly expected words that were placed either in a MWE or a regular non-fixed compositional context, and to low predictability controls. We focused on oscillatory dynamics and regression analyses, in order to dissociate between the two contexts by modeling the electrophysiological response as a function of item-level parameters. A significant interaction between word position and condition was found in the regression model for power in a theta range (similar to 7-9 Hz), providing evidence for the presence of qualitative differences between conditions. Power levels within this band were lower for MWE than compositional contexts when the target word appeared later on in the sentence, confirming that in the former lexical retrieval would have taken place before word onset. On the other hand, gamma-power (similar to 50-70 Hz) was also modulated by predictability of the item in all conditions, which is interpreted as an index of a similar "matching" sub-step for both types of contexts, binding an expected representation and the external input.

An affective picture stimulation task was designed to find out neuro-physiological characteristics of brain waves. Task-related EEG dynamics in power changes were analyzed by independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency. ERSP image results revealed EEG activities in the different emotion responses. Thirty healthy college students volunteered the stimulus experiment with the standard TAPS affective pictures. These affective pictures are classified in five emotion states. They are calm, happy, neutral, sad, and scared. The results show that, there were the differences of stimuli response between the left and right area in the frontal lobes. And there was stronger response of alpha band in the happy and scared states than that in the calm and sad states from the frontal lobe. However, through the central gyri area, stretching the parietal and occipital lobes, suppression of emotion appeared in the sad and scared states. Additionally, based on valence-arousal model, the ERSP maps indicate the stronger responses occur in the low alpha band (8 10 Hz) are indicated in the calm, happy, sad and scared states, while the neutral have the stronger response in the high alpha band (10 13 Hz). In the whole brain region, there were the stronger responses of alpha band in the happy state. The stronger response mostly occurs around the time range of 300 ms and 700 ms.

The question how the brain achieves the task of extracting only relevant information from the mixture of sounds reaching the ear (i.e., "cocktail party problem") is still open. In analogy to recent findings in vision, we propose cortical alpha (similar to 10 Hz) oscillations measurable using M/EEG as a pivotal mechanism to selectively inhibit the processing of noise to improve auditory selective attention to task-relevant signals. We review initial evidence of enhanced alpha activity in selective listening tasks, suggesting a significant role of alpha-modulated noise suppression in speech. We discuss the importance of dissociating between noise interference in the auditory periphery (i.e., energetic masking) and noise interference with more central cognitive aspects of speech processing (i.e., informational masking). Finally, we point out the adverse effects of age-related hearing loss and/or cognitive decline on auditory selective inhibition. With this perspective article, we set the stage for future studies on the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations for speech processing in challenging listening situations.

Transcranial stimulation by 30 weak electric currents oscillating at the endogenous SO frequency (SO-tDCS) during post31 learning sleep was previously shown by us to boost SO activity and improve the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory in human subjects. Here, we aimed at replicating and extending these results to a rodent model. Rats were trained for 12 days at the beginning of their inactive phase in the reference memory version of the radial arm maze. In a between subjects design, animals received SO-tDCS over prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation within a time frame of 1 hour during subsequent non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Applied over multiple daily sessions SO-tDCS impacted cortical network activity as measured by EEG and behavior: At the EEG level, SO-tDCS enhanced post-stimulation upper delta (2-4 Hz) activity whereby the first stimulations of each day were preferentially affected. Furthermore, commencing on day 8, SO-tDCS acutely decreased theta activity indicating long-term effects on cortical networks. Behaviorally, working memory for baited maze arms was enhanced up to day 4, indicating enhanced consolidation of task-inherent rules, while reference memory errors did not differ between groups. Taken together, we could show here for the first time an effect of SO-tDCS during NREM sleep on cognitive functions and on cortical activity in a rodent model.

EEG can reflect both the normal and abnormal activity of the brain and is widely used as a powerful tool in the field of clinical neurophysiology. Being sensitive to decreasing alertness and decline in vigilance, EEG can be used to predict performance degradation due to mental or physical fatigue. This paper studies the variation of fatigue levels in human drivers in a sleep-deprivation experiment by analyzing the synchronization between EEG recorded from brain areas. A Weighted Visibility Graph (WVG) technique has been proposed to quantify the synchronization between brain regions, which is then formulated in terms of a complex network. The change in the parameters of the network is analyzed to find the variation of connectivity and hence to trace the increase in fatigue levels of an individual.

Sound Asleep: Processing and Retention of Slow Oscillation Phase-Targeted Stimuli	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; K-COMPLEX; SLEEP; MEMORY; EEG; SPINDLES; REPETITION; SHIFTS; WAVES	The sleeping brain retains some residual information processing capacity. Although direct evidence is scarce, a substantial literature suggests the phase of slow oscillations during deep sleep to be an important determinant for stimulus processing. Here, we introduce an algorithm for predicting slow oscillations in real-time. Using this approach to present stimuli directed at both oscillatory up and down states, we show neural stimulus processing depends importantly on the slow oscillation phase. During ensuing wakefulness, however, we did not observe differential brain or behavioral responses to these stimulus categories, suggesting no enduring memories were formed. We speculate that while simpler forms of learning may occur during sleep, neocortically based memories are not readily established during deep sleep.

Arousal from sleep is associated with an increase in heart rate (HR). Our objective was to quantify the intensity of arousals in an objective manner using the time and frequency characteristics of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and to determine whether HR response to arousal correlates with arousal intensity so determined. Design: Post hoc analysis of 20 preexisting polysomnography (PSG) files. Setting: Research and Development Laboratory (YRT Limited). Participants: N/A. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Arousals were scored using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. The EEG signals' time and frequency characteristics were determined using wavelet analysis. An automatic algorithm was developed to scale arousal intensity based on the change in wavelet features and data from a training set obtained from 271 arousals visually scaled between zero and nine (most intense). There were 2,695 arousals in 20 PSGs that were scaled. HR response (Delta HR) was defined as the difference between the highest HR in the interval [ arousal-onset to (arousal-end + 8 sec)] and the highest HR between 2 and 12 sec preceding arousal onset. There was a strong correlation between arousal scale and Delta HR within each subject (average r: 0.95 +/- 0.04). The slope of the relationship varied among subjects (0.7-2.4 min(-1)/unit scale). Conclusions: Arousal intensity, quantified by wavelet transform, is strongly associated with arousal-related tachycardia, and the gain of the relationship varies among subjects. Quantifying arousal intensity in PSGs provides additional information that may be clinically relevant.

Alpha oscillations have been viewed for a long time as an "idling" rhythm, purely reflecting inactive sites. Despite earlier evidence from neurophysiology, awareness that alpha oscillations can substantially influence perception and behavior has grown only recently in cognitive neuroscience. Evidence for an active role of alpha for perception comes mainly from several visual, near-threshold experiments. In the current review, we extend this view by summarizing studies showing how alpha-defined brain states relate to illusory perception, i.e. cases of perceptual reports that are not "objectively" verifiable by distinct stimuli or stimulus features. These studies demonstrate that ongoing or prestimulus alpha oscillations substantially influence the perception of auditory, visual or multisensory illusions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Moghim, N; Corne, DW				Moghim, Negin; Corne, David W.			Predicting Epileptic Seizures in Advance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACCUMULATED ENERGY; REAL-TIME; OSCILLATIONS; ALGORITHMS; DYNAMICS; LONG	Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 0.6-0.8% of the world's population. In this neurological disorder, abnormal activity of the brain causes seizures, the nature of which tend to be sudden. Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used as long-term therapeutic solutions that control the condition. Of those treated with AEDs, 35% become resistant to medication. The unpredictable nature of seizures poses risks for the individual with epilepsy. It is clearly desirable to find more effective ways of preventing seizures for such patients. The automatic detection of oncoming seizures, before their actual onset, can facilitate timely intervention and hence minimize these risks. In addition, advance prediction of seizures can enrich our understanding of the epileptic brain. In this study, drawing on the body of work behind automatic seizure detection and prediction from digitised Invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) data, a prediction algorithm, ASPPR (Advance Seizure Prediction via Pre-ictal Relabeling), is described. ASPPR facilitates the learning of predictive models targeted at recognizing patterns in EEG activity that are in a specific time window in advance of a seizure. It then exploits advanced machine learning coupled with the design and selection of appropriate features from EEG signals. Results, from evaluating ASPPR independently on 21 different patients, suggest that seizures for many patients can be predicted up to 20 minutes in advance of their onset. Compared to benchmark performance represented by a mean S1-Score (harmonic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of 90.6% for predicting seizure onset between 0 and 5 minutes in advance, ASPPR achieves mean S1-Scores of: 96.30% for prediction between 1 and 6 minutes in advance, 96.13% for prediction between 8 and 13 minutes in advance, 94.5% for prediction between 14 and 19 minutes in advance, and 94.2% for prediction between 20 and 25 minutes in advance.

Here, using human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings combined with source reconstruction techniques, we study how oscillatory activity functionally organizes different neocortical regions during a tactile discrimination task near the limit of spatial acuity. While undergoing EEG recordings, blindfolded participants felt a linear three-dot array presented electromechanically, under computer control, and reported whether the central dot was offset to the left or right. The average brain response differed significantly for trials with correct and incorrect perceptual responses in the timeframe approximately between 130 and 175 ms. During trials with correct responses, source-level peak activity appeared in the left primary somatosensory cortex (SI) at around 45 ms, in the right lateral occipital complex (LOC) at 130 ms, in the right posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) at 160 ms, and finally in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at 175 ms. Spectral interdependency analysis of activity in these nodes showed two distinct distributed networks, a dominantly feedforward network in the beta band (12-30 Hz) that included all four nodes and a recurrent network in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) that linked SI, pIPS and dIPFC. Measures of network activity in both bands were correlated with the accuracy of task performance. These findings suggest that beta and gamma band oscillatory networks coordinate activity between neocortical regions mediating sensory and cognitive processing to arrive at tactile perceptual decisions.

The processing of polysomnographic (PSG) recordings involves the modelling of Time-Varying Autoregressive Moving Average (TVARMA) processes with recursive particle filtering. The feature set engages the computation of electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands delta, theta, alpha, zeta, beta, mean amplitude of electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This is subsequently transferred to an ensemble classifier to detect Wake (W), non-REM1 (N1) and non-REM2 (N2) sleep stages. As a result, novel contributions in terms of non-Gaussian modelling of biosignal processes, approximation to PSG distributions with particle filtering and time-frequency analysis by complex Morlet wavelets within sleep staging, are discussed. The findings revealed performance metrics achieving in the best cases 93 : 18% accuracy, 6.82% error and 100% sensitivity/ specificity rates.	[Chaparro-Vargas, Ramiro; Dissayanaka, P.

The maturation of cortical sleep rhythms and networks over early development	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Development; Brain rhythms; Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Sleep; EEG	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EEG COHERENCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; SCALE; AGE	Objective: Although neuronal activity drives all aspects of cortical development, how human brain rhythms spontaneously mature remains an active area of research. We sought to systematically evaluate the emergence of human brain rhythms and functional cortical networks over early development. Methods: We examined cortical rhythms and coupling patterns from birth through adolescence in a large cohort of healthy children (n = 384) using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in the sleep state. Results: We found that the emergence of brain rhythms follows a stereotyped sequence over early development. In general, higher frequencies increase in prominence with striking regional specificity throughout development. The coordination of these rhythmic activities across brain regions follows a general pattern of maturation in which broadly distributed networks of low-frequency oscillations increase in density while networks of high frequency oscillations become sparser and more highly clustered. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a predictable program directs the development of key rhythmic components and physiological brain networks over early development. Significance: This work expands our knowledge of normal cortical development. The stereotyped neurophysiological processes observed at the level of rhythms and networks may provide a scaffolding to support critical periods of cognitive growth. Furthermore, these conserved patterns could provide a sensitive biomarker for cortical health across development. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We obtained a sample of spike I wave and non-spike waves for HHT decomposition using a number of intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbert transform (HT) to determine the instantaneous spectrum, marginal spectrum, and Hilbert energy spectrum. We decomposed a number of intrinsic mode functions, the instantaneous spectrum and the Hilbert energy spectrum and compared the differences between spike and non-spike waves. The analysis results showed that the ratios of the normal wave to the referred total energy for IMF1, IMF2, and the residual function exceeded 10%. Furthermore, the ratios of the energy of the energy for IMF1, IMF2, IMF3 and the residual function of Spike I to their total energy also exceeded 10%. The ratios of the energy of IMF3 in the delta band to its referred total energy for the EEG signal without spike wave, and of Spike I waves were 4.72%, and 6.75%, respectively. The ratios of the energy of IMF3 in the d band to its referred total energy for the EEG signal without spike wave is lower than that of the energy of IMF3 in the d band to its referred total energy for the spike I wave.

The Effect of Souvenaid on Functional Brain Network Organisation in Patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomised Controlled Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HYPOTHETICAL MODEL; DYNAMIC BIOMARKERS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; DEMENTIA; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Synaptic loss is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disturbed organisation of large-scale functional brain networks in AD might reflect synaptic loss and disrupted neuronal communication. The medical food Souvenaid, containing the specific nutrient combination Fortasyn Connect, is designed to enhance synapse formation and function and has been shown to improve memory performance in patients with mild AD in two randomised controlled trials. Objective: To explore the effect of Souvenaid compared to control product on brain activity-based networks, as a derivative of underlying synaptic function, in patients with mild AD. Design: A 24-week randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-country study. Participants: 179 drug-naive mild AD patients who participated in the Souvenir II study. Intervention: Patients were randomised 1: 1 to receive Souvenaid or an iso-caloric control product once daily for 24 weeks. Outcome: In a secondary analysis of the Souvenir II study, electroencephalography (EEG) brain networks were constructed and graph theory was used to quantify complex brain structure. Local brain network connectivity (normalised clustering coefficient gamma) and global network integration (normalised characteristic path length lambda) were compared between study groups, and related to memory performance. Results: The network measures in the beta band were significantly different between groups: they decreased in the control group, but remained relatively unchanged in the active group. No consistent relationship was found between these network measures and memory performance. Conclusions: The current results suggest that Souvenaid preserves the organisation of brain networks in patients with mild AD within 24 weeks, hypothetically counteracting the progressive network disruption over time in AD. The results strengthen the hypothesis that Souvenaid affects synaptic integrity and function. Secondly, we conclude that advanced EEG analysis, using the mathematical framework of graph theory, is useful and feasible for assessing the effects of interventions.

Using a contour integration task and EEG source level analyses, we tested the hypothesis that perceptual grouping requires a top-down selection, rather than a passive pooling, of neural information that codes local elements in the visual image. The participants were presented visual displays with or without a hidden contour. Two tasks were performed: a central luminance-change detection task and a peripheral contour detection task. Only in the contour-detection task could we find differential brain activity between contour and non-contour conditions, within a distributed brain network including parietal, lateral occipital and primary visual areas. Contour processing was associated with an inflow of information from lateral occipital into primary visual regions, as revealed from the slope of phase differences between source level oscillations within these areas. The findings suggest that contour integration results from a selection of neural information from lower visual areas, and that this selection is driven by the lateral occipital cortex.

Invisible visual stimuli elicit increases in alpha-band power	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-band; EEG; event-related synchronization; oscillations; subthreshold stimulation	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; FEEDFORWARD; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; RHYTHM; CONSCIOUSNESS; PSYCHOPHYSICS; SUPPRESSION	The cerebral cortex responds to stimuli of a wide range of intensities. Previous studies have demonstrated that undetectably weak somatosensory stimuli cause a functional deactivation or inhibition in somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we tested whether invisible visual stimuli lead to similar responses, indicated by an increase in EEG alpha-band power-an index of cortical excitability. We presented subliminal and supraliminal visual stimuli after estimating each participant's detection threshold. Stimuli consisted of peripherally presented small circular patches that differed in their contrast to a background consisting of a random white noise pattern. We demonstrate that subliminal and supraliminal stimuli each elicit specific neuronal response patterns. Supraliminal stimuli evoked an early, strongly phase-locked lower-frequency response representing the evoked potential and induced a decrease in alpha-band power from 400 ms on. By contrast, subliminal visual stimuli induced an increase of non-phase-locked power around 300 ms that was maximal within the alpha-band. This response might be due to an inhibitory mechanism, which reduces spurious visual activation that is unlikely to result from external stimuli.

Although a number of empirical studies point to higher incidence of abnormal EEGs in children with specific language impairment, only a few studies were found examining electrophysiological characteristics, such as locus of discharges and connections with cognitive functioning in this population of children. The sample included 12 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and abnormal EEG who underwent testing of cognitive functioning using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). The control sample included 13 children with specific language impairment and regular EEG. Results point to lower scores on several subtests of the performance scale for children with abnormal EEG than for the group with regular EEG. Detailed EEG analysis of cortical distribution of the spectral power of different EEG rhythms partially confirms the results of neuropsychological assessment, pointing to abnormal function of frontal and temporal regions. Higher values of spectral power of the delta brain rhythm in frontal regions are associated with lower results on the WISC performance scale. Results are discussed in the context of subgroups of the population of children with SLI.

Typically, the TWL is manually predetermined and then fixed during running of the SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI), which may not give the optimal information transfer rate (ITR). This study proposes an adaptive strategy and integrates it into multivariate synchronization index for SSVEP recognition with the automatically determined TWL. The optimal TWL is adaptively selected according to the estimated synchronization index, which provides the relatively higher ITR for the SSVEP recognition than a fixed TWL does. Experimental results evaluated on nine healthy subjects demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed adaptive strategy for the TWL in SSVEP-based BCI.

The metabolism of alcohol and cognitive functions can vary during the menstrual cycle. Also, both alcohol ingestion and hormonal variations during menstruation have been associated with characteristic changes in electro-encephalographic (EEG) activity. Aim. To determine whether EEG activity during a working memory task is affected by acute alcohol consumption, and if these EEG patterns vary in relation to different phases of the menstrual cycle. Subjects and methods. 24 women who drank a moderate dose of alcohol or placebo during the follicular and early luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The EEG activity was recorded during performance of viso-spatial working memory task. Results. Although the alcohol did not deteriorate the performance of working memory task, it caused in the EEG a decrease of relative theta power and lower right fronto-parietal correlation in theta and alpha2 bands. Only women who drank alcohol in the follicular phase had a higher relative potency of alpha1, which could indicate a lower level of arousal and attention. Conclusions. These results contribute to a better understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive changes with alcohol and its relationship to the menstrual cycle.

There is, however, limited information on the time course of these changes. We recently obtained intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus and from the motor cortex during induction of anesthesia in three patients to study the time course of the alterations of cortical and thalamic function. The patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II males aged 33-57 yr with intractable central pain caused by brachial plexus injury (patient 1 and 2) or insular infarct (patient 3). Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2.5-3.1 mg center dot kg(-1) over 30-45 sec) followed, after loss of consciousness, by rocuronium for tracheal intubation. The data retained for analysis are from one minute before the start of propofol to 110 sec later during ventilation of the patients' lungs before tracheal intubation. Spectral analysis was used to measure absolute EEG power. Propofol caused significant increases of cortical and thalamic power in the delta to beta frequency bands (1-30 Hz). These increases of cortical and thalamic power occurred either concomitantly or within seconds of each other. Propofol also caused a decrease in cortical and thalamic high-gamma (62-200 Hz) power that also followed a similar time course. We conclude that induction of anesthesia with propofol in these patients was associated with concurrent alterations of cortical and sensory thalamic activity.

J	Devergnas, A; Pittard, D; Bliwise, D; Wichmann, T				Devergnas, Annaelle; Pittard, Damien; Bliwise, Donald; Wichmann, Thomas			Relationship between oscillatory activity in the cortico-basal ganglia network and parkinsonism in MPTP-treated monkeys	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Basal ganglia; Local field potential; Motor cortex; Sleep; Wakefulness	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMATE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; PHARMACOLOGICAL MODULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	Parkinsonism is associated with changes in oscillatory activity patterns and increased synchronization of neurons in the basal ganglia and cortex in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease, but the relationship between these changes and the severity of parkinsonian signs remains unclear. We examined this relationship by studying changes in local field potentials (LFPs) in the internal pallidal segment (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and in encephalographic signals (EEG) from the primary motor cortex (M1) in Rhesus monkeys which were rendered progressively parkinsonian by repeated systemic injections of small doses of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Observations during wakefulness and sleep (defined by EEG and video records) were analyzed separately. The severity of parkinsonism correlated with increases in spectral power at frequencies below 15.5 Hz in M1 and GPi and reductions in spectral power at frequencies above 15.6 Hz with little change in STN. The severity of parkinsonism also correlated with increases in the coherence between M1 EEG and basal ganglia LFPs in the low frequency band. Levodopa treatment reduced low-frequency activity and increased high-frequency activity in all three areas, but did not affect coherence. The state of arousal also affected LFP and EEG signals in all three structures, particularly in the STN. These results suggest that parkinsonism-associated changes in alpha and low-beta band oscillatory activity can be detected early in the parkinsonian state in M1 and GPi. Interestingly, oscillations detectable in STN LFP signals (including oscillations in the beta-band) do not appear to correlate strongly with the severity of mild-to-moderate parkinsonism in these animals. Levodopa-induced changes in oscillatory M1 EEG and basal ganglia LFP patterns do not necessarily represent a normalization of abnormalities caused by dopamine depletion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Re-exposure to olfactory cues during sleep triggers this reactivation and improves later recall performance. Here, we tested if the effects of odor-induced memory reactivations are odor-specific, that is, requiring the same odor during learning and subsequent sleep. We also tested whether odor-induced memory reactivation affects oscillatory EEG activity during sleep, as a putative mechanism underlying memory processing during sleep. Participants learned a visuospatial memory task under the presence of an odor. During subsequent SWS, the same odor, a different odor, or an odorless vehicle was presented. We found that odor re-exposure during sleep significantly improves memory only when the same odor was presented again, whereas exposure to a new odor or the odorless vehicle had no effect. The memory-enhancing effect of the congruent odor was accompanied by significant increases in frontal delta (1.5-4.5 Hz) and parietal fast spindle (13.0-15.0 Hz) power as well as by an increased negative-to-positive slope of the frontal slow oscillation. Our results indicate that odor-induced memory reactivations are odor specific and trigger changes in slow-wave and spindle power possibly reflecting a bottom-up influence of hippocampal memory replay on cortical slow oscillations as well as thalamo-cortical sleep spindles.

Recent studies intervening with these oscillations have demonstrated effective modulation of both the oscillations and behavior. In this review, we collect evidence in favor of how hypothesis-driven methods can be used to augment cognition by optimizing cortical oscillations. We elaborate their potential usefulness for three target groups: healthy elderly, patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and healthy young adults. We discuss the relevance of neuronal oscillations in each group and show how each of them can benefit from the manipulation of functionally-related oscillations. Further, we describe methods for manipulation of neuronal oscillations including direct brain stimulation as well as indirect task alterations. We also discuss practical considerations about the proposed techniques. In conclusion, we propose that insights from neuroscience should guide techniques to augment human cognition, which in turn can provide a better understanding of how the human brain works.

Differential Oscillatory Electroencephalogram Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Subtypes and Typically Developing Adolescents	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; connectivity; cue-processing; EEG oscillations; response preparation; top-down control	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; PREDOMINANTLY INATTENTIVE TYPE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ADHD SUBTYPES; VISUAL-ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; EXECUTIVE ATTENTION	Background: A neurobiological-based classification of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes has thus far remained elusive. The aim of this study was to use oscillatory changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) related to informative cue processing, motor preparation, and top-down control to investigate neurophysiological differences between typically developing (TD) adolescents, and those diagnosed with predominantly inattentive (IA) or combined (CB) (associated with symptoms of inattention as well as impulsivity/hyperactivity) subtypes of ADHD. Methods: The EEG was recorded from 57 rigorously screened adolescents (12 to17 years of age; 23 TD, 17 IA, and 17 CB), while they performed a cued flanker task. We examined the oscillatory changes in theta (3-5 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (22-25 Hz) EEG bands after cues that informed participants with which hand they would subsequently be required to respond. Results: Relative to TD adolescents, the IA group showed significantly less postcue alpha suppression, suggesting diminished processing of the cue in the visual cortex, whereas the CB group showed significantly less beta suppression at the electrode contralateral to the cued response hand, suggesting poor motor planning. Finally, both ADHD subtypes showed weak functional connectivity between frontal theta and posterior alpha, suggesting common top-down control impairment. Conclusions: We found both distinct and common task-related neurophysiological impairments in ADHD subtypes. Our results suggest that task-induced changes in EEG oscillations provide an objective measure, which in conjunction with other sources of information might help distinguish between ADHD subtypes and therefore aid in diagnoses and evaluation of treatment.

Actually, CSP only extracts the linear correlation between each pair of channels. The performance of CSP severely depends on the preprocessing. Moreover, CSP and the subsequent classifier are not optimized by the same criteria. In this paper, we investigated the nonlinear correlation between channels with kernel technique, and proposed a unified prediction framework based on linear ridge regression model. This prediction framework integrates preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, can automatically select the time windows, frequency bands and regularization parameter by minimizing leave-one-out cross-validation error through gradient descent. Experimental results on the dataset IV, BCI competition II show the effectiveness of our approach.

The present study (N = 136) manipulated emotion-regulation strategy during viewing of a fear-inducing film clip. EEG response was assessed across five frequency bands in reappraisal, suppression and control conditions. The TMMS predicted higher power in theta and gamma bands, a pattern of response that may represent directed attention to emotional processing. Gender differences included elevated theta in females in the reappraisal condition, but effects of gender and Trait Meta-Mood appeared to be dissociable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In line with this hypothesis, we show that the spatial distribution of power in the alpha frequency band (8 -12 Hz) can be used to decode the content and quality of the representations stored in visual WM. We acquired EEG data during an orientation WM task, and used a forward encoding model of orientation selectivity to reconstruct orientation-specific response profiles (termed channel tuning functions, or CTFs) that tracked the orientation of the memorandum during both encoding and delay periods of the trial. Critically, these EEG-based CTFs were robust predictors of both between-and within-subject differences in mnemonic precision, showing that EEG-based CTFs provide a sensitive measure of the quality of sensory population codes. Experiments 2 and 3 established that these EEG-based CTFs are contingent on the voluntary storage goals of the observer. When observers were given a postsample cue to store or drop the memorandum, the resulting CTF was sustained in the "store" condition and rapidly eliminated following the "drop" cue. When observers were instructed to store one of two simultaneously presented stimuli, only the stored item was represented in a sustained fashion throughout the delay period. These findings suggest that the oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency band plays a central role in the active storage of information in visual WM, and demonstrate a powerful approach for tracking the precision of on-line memories with high temporal resolution.

When holding your horses meets the deer in the headlights: time-frequency characteristics of global and selective stopping under conditions of proactive and reactive control	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stop-signal task; inhibition; selectivity; reactive inhibition; proactive inhibition; EEG; time-frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; MOTOR CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; EEG; COMPONENT; REVEALS; THETA	The ability to inhibit unwanted thoughts or actions is crucial for successful functioning in daily life; however, this ability is often impaired in a number of psychiatric disorders. Despite the relevance of inhibition in everyday situations, current models of inhibition are rather simplistic and provide little generalizability especially in the face of clinical disorders. Thus, given the importance of inhibition for proper cognitive functioning, the need for a paradigm, which incorporates factors that will subsequently improve the current model for understanding inhibition, is of high demand. A popular paradigm used to assess motor inhibition, the stop signal paradigm, can be modified to further advance the current conceptual model of inhibitory control and thus provide a basis for better understanding different facets of inhibition. Namely, in this study, we have developed a novel version of the stop-signal task to assess how preparation (that is, whether reactive or proactive) and selectivity of the stopping behavior effect well-known time-frequency characteristics associated with successful inhibition and concomitant behavioral measures. With this innovative paradigm, we demonstrate that the selective nature of the stopping task modulates theta and motoric beta activity and we further provide the first account of delta activity as an electrophysiological feature sensitive to both manipulations of selectivity and preparatory control.

Among proven devices such as fmgerprint readers and cameras that can sense the human eye's iris pattern, we introduced a number of users to a sequence of 'grandmother images', or emotionally evoked stimuli-response images from other users, as well as one of their own, for the purpose of authentication. We performed testing and evaluation of the Authenticity Privacy and Security (APS) brainwave biometrics, similar to the internal organ of the human eye's iris which cannot easily be altered. 'Aha' recognition through stimulus-response habituation can serve as a biomarker, similar to keystroke dynamics analysis for inter and intra key fluctuation time of a memorized PIN number (FIST). Using a non-tethered Electroencephalogram (EEG) wireless smartphone/pc monitor interface, we explore the appropriate stimuli-response biomarker present in DTAB low frequency group waves. Prior to login, the user is shown a series of images on a computer display. They have been primed to click their mouse when the image is presented. DTAB waves are collected with a wireless EEG and are sent via Smartphone to a cloud based processing infrastructure. There, we measure fluctuations in DTAB waves from a wireless, non-tethered, single node EEG device between the Personal Graphic Image Number (PGIN) stimulus image and the response time from an individual's mental performance baseline. We hope Higher Order Statistics (HOS) in typing and PGIN can reveal intrinsic personal traits/habits and increase EEG specificity through stimulus-response neuro-biomarkers. Towards that goal, we describe an infrastructure that supports distributed verification for web-based EEG authentication. The performance of machine learning on the relative Power Spectral Density EEG data may uncover features required for subsequent access to web or media content. Our approach provides a scalable framework wrapped into a robust Neuro-Informatics toolkit, viable for use in the Biomedical and mental health communities, as well as numerous consumer applications.

Learning by habituation implies a gradual diminution of the organism's responses to non-relevant stimuli. These responses, resulting from electrical oscillations of the brain, can be analyzed through quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Objective. To characterize the absolute power (AP) in the range of delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta) in cortical parasagittal regions during habituation to photostimulation (RPh). Material and methods. We studied 81 undergraduate students. The EEG was recorded in a Nicolet; awake subjects with closed eyes were photostimulated (5 Hz for 2 s, 20 times, RPh). The UAMI/Yanez program identifies the RPh signal, chooses and collects 2-sec samples before (Pre) and during RPh, and instruments the Welch periodogram, which integrates the absolute power (AP) of delta, theta, alpha, and beta. We calculated the average AP (AAP) in Pre and RPh per frequency and lead. AAP differences were assessed with non-parametric tests. Linear regression was used to plot the AAPs of each Pre and each RPh sample, representing the resulting slope with its statistical significance. Results. RPh increased the AAP of delta in frontal and fronto-central leads of both hemispheres, and its slopes were ascendant. AAP of beta increased in fronto-frontal and diminished in the other three leads, its slopes were ascendant in right central parietal and parieto-occipital leads. AAP of alpha increased in fronto-frontal leads, did not change in fronto-central, and diminished in the other leads; its slopes were descendent in Pre and ascendant in RPh in both hemispheres. AAP of beta increased in the four leads; in Pre, beta slopes were descendent in parieto-occipital leads of both hemispheres. During RPh, delta slopes were ascendant in right parieto-central and in both parieto-occipital leads. Conclusion. The progressive diminution of alpha's desynchronization, which ends in synchronization, is probably due to hyperpolarization of neuronal membranes and represents habituation. This is complemented with synchronization of the delta rhythm in anterior cortical areas and of theta and beta in areas of the right hemisphere.

Incorporated within the model are various types of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, recurrently connected to thalamic and reticular thalamic regions with the ratios and distances derived from the mammalian thalamocortical system. The model is utilized to study the impacts of four types of connectivity loss on the model's spectral dynamics. The study focuses on investigating degeneration of corticocortical, thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and corticoreticular couplings, with an emphasis on the influence of each modeled case on the spectral output of the model. Synaptic compensation has been included in each model to examine the interplay between synaptic deletion and compensation mechanisms, and the oscillatory activity of the network. The results of power spectra and event related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) analyses show that the dynamics of the thalamic and cortical oscillations are significantly influenced by corticocortical synaptic loss. Interestingly, the patterns of changes in thalamic spectral activity are correlated with those in the cortical model. Similarly, the thalamic oscillatory activity is diminished after partial corticothalamic denervation. The results suggest that thalamic atrophy is a secondary pathology to cortical shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, this study finds that the inhibition from neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) to thalamic relay (TCR) neurons plays a key role in regulating thalamic oscillations; disinhibition disrupts thalamic oscillatory activity even though TCR neurons are more depolarized after being released from RTN inhibition. This study provides information that can be explored experimentally to further our understanding on the neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology.

Compared with the average-ability subjects, the math-gifted adolescents show a highly integrated fronto-parietal network due to distant gamma phase-locking oscillations, which is indicated by lower modularity of the global network topology, more "connector bridges" between the frontal and parietal cortices and less "connector hubs" in the sensorimotor cortex. The time domain analysis finds that, while maintaining more stable phase dynamics of the fronto-parietal coupling, the math-gifted adolescents are characterized by more extensive fronto-parietal connection reconfiguration. The results from sample fitting in the power-law model further find that the phase-locking durations in the math-gifted brain abides by a wider interval of the power-law distribution. This phase-lock distribution mechanism could represent a relatively optimized pattern for the functional binding of frontal parietal network, which underlies stable fronto-parietal connectivity and increases flexibility of timely network reconfiguration.

In contrast, we suggest here that response inhibition is achieved automatically, nonselectively, within very short delays in uncertain environments. We modified a classical go/nogo protocol to probe context-dependent inhibitory mechanisms. Because no single neuroimaging method can definitely disentangle neural excitation and inhibition, we combined fMRI and EEG recordings in healthy humans. Any stimulus (go or nogo) presented in an uncertain context requiring action restraint was found to evoke activity changes in the supplementary motor complex (SMC) with respect to a control condition in which no response inhibition was required. These changes included: (1) An increase in event-related BOLD activity, (2) an attenuation of the early (170 ms) event related potential generated by a single, consistent source isolated by advanced blind source separation, and (3) an increase in the evoked-EEG Alpha power of this source. Considered together, these results suggest that the BOLD signal evoked by any stimulus in the SMC when the situation is unpredictable can be driven by automatic, nonselective, context-dependent inhibitory activities. This finding reveals the paradoxical mechanisms by which voluntary control of action may be achieved. The ability to provide controlled responses in unpredictable environments would require setting-up the automatic self-inhibitory circuitry within the SMC. Conversely, enabling automatic behavior when the environment becomes predictable would require top-down control to deactivate anticipatorily and temporarily the inhibitory set.

Dentate granule cells, the first relay in the trisynaptic circuit through the hippocampus, exhibit low spontaneous firing rates even during locomotion. Using intracellular recordings from dentate neurons in awake mice operating a levitated spherical treadmill, we found a transient membrane potential alpha-band oscillation associated with the onset of spontaneous motion, especially forward walking movements. While often subthreshold, alpha oscillations could regulate spike timing during locomotion and may enable dentate gyrus neurons to respond to specific cortical afferent pathways while maintaining low average firing rates.

The 64-channel EEG and cardiovascular reactivity (beat-by-beat technology) were simultaneously recorded. At rest, hypertensive patients had significantly reduced platelet serotonin concentrations in comparison with healthy individuals. The patients experiencing emotional activation were characterized by significantly lower intensity of positive emotions associated with more pronounced suppression of EEG activity in the delta (2-4 Hz) and theta (ranges of frequency 4-6 and 6-8 Hz) oscillators in the parieto-occipital cortex (zones P and PO) in both hemispheres of the brain. The findings attest to insufficient function of the brain serotonin system and hypoactivation of the reward/reinforcement system in patients with primary hypertension.	[Aftanas, L. I.; Brak, I.

A neural MFC microcircuit model is proposed for processing conflict and generating theta oscillations. The model makes several novel predictions for the causes and consequences of MFC theta and conflict processing, and may be relevant for understanding the neural implementations of related cognitive processes.

The system is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Through six frequency bands (9Hz, 10Hz, 11Hz, 12Hz, 13 Hz, 14Hz) displayed on the screen, subjects can choose a phone number by gazing at the display interface. This proposed EEG system has been implemented in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and shows high accuracy, high integration density, and low cost. These features are meaningful for implementing a real-time SSVEP-based BCI.

Multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine increases frontal cortical oscillations unlike escitalopram and duloxetine - a quantitative EEG study in rats	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review							MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM; SLEEP-WAKE BEHAVIOR; LU AA21004; DOUBLE-BLIND; TRANSPORTER OCCUPANCY	Background and Purpose EEG studies show that 5-HT is involved in regulation of sleep-wake state and modulates cortical oscillations. Vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B partial agonist, 5-HT1A agonist, and 5-HT transporter inhibitor. Preclinical (animal) and clinical studies with vortioxetine show positive impact on cognitive metrics involving cortical function. Here we assess vortioxetine's effect on cortical neuronal oscillations in actively awake rats. Experimental Approach Telemetric EEG recordings were obtained with the following treatments (mg center dot kg-1, s.c.): vehicle, vortioxetine (0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 10), 5-HT1A agonist flesinoxan (2.5), 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron (0.30), 5-HT7 antagonist SB-269970-A (10), escitalopram (2.0), duloxetine (10) and vortioxetine plus flesinoxan. Target occupancies were determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Key Results Vortioxetine dose-dependently increased wakefulness. Flesinoxan, duloxetine, ondansetron, but not escitalopram or SB-269970-A increased wakefulness. Quantitative spectral analyses showed vortioxetine alone and with flesinoxan increased (4-8Hz), (8-12Hz) and (30-50Hz) power. Duloxetine had no effect on and , but decreased power, while escitalopram produced no changes. Ondansetron and SB-269970 (approximate to 31-35% occupancy) increased power. Flesinoxan (approximate to 41% occupancy) increased and power. Conclusions and Implications Vortioxetine increased wakefulness and increased frontal cortical activity, most likely because of its 5-HT7 and 5-HT3 antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism. Vortioxetine differs from escitalopram and duloxetine by increasing cortical , and oscillations. These preclinical findings suggest a role of vortioxetine in modulating cortical circuits known to be recruited during cognitive behaviours and warrant further investigation as to their clinical impact.

At the neurophysiological level, the prefrontal cortex may engage electrophysiological oscillatory synchronization to coordinate other brain systems during learning. We recorded scalp EEG from 21 older (mean age 69 years) and 20 young (mean age 22 years) healthy human adults while they learned stimulus-response mappings by trial-and-error using feedback. In young adults, theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillatory power over medial frontal and anterior frontal cortex predicted learning after errors. Older adults demonstrated a decrease in the theta-band learning-predictive signals over medial frontal but not anterior frontal cortex. This age-related decrease in task-relevant medial frontal theta power may be related to the more general decrease in medial frontal theta power that we observed during rest. These results demonstrate a shift in cortical networks that support reinforcement learning in older adults, and shed new light on the changes in neurophysiological (oscillatory) mechanisms with neurocognitive aging.

Hippocampal formation is involved in the acquisition of declarative memories and particularly of spatial memories. Nevertheless, although largely investigated in rodents, the relations between spatial memory and hippocampal EEG activity have been scarcely studied in humans. Aimed to evaluate the effects of spatial learning on human hippocampal sleep EEG activity, we recorded hippocampal Stereo-EEG (SEEG) in a group of refractory epilepsy patients undergoing presurgical clinical evaluation, after a training on a spatial navigation task. We observed that hippocampal high-delta (2-4 Hz range) activity increases during the first NREM episode after learning compared to the baseline night. Moreover, the amount of hippocampal NREM high-delta power was correlated with task performance at retest. The effect involved only the hippocampal EEG frequencies inasmuch no differences were observed at the neocortical electrodes and in the traditional polysomnographic measures. The present findings support the crucial role of hippocampal slow EEG frequencies during sleep in the memory consolidation processes. More generally, together with previous results, they suggest that slow frequency rhythms are a fundamental characteristic of human hippocampal EEG during both sleep and wakefulness, and are related to the consolidation of different types of memories.

Existing JBSS approaches are designed to handle multidimensional datasets, yet to our knowledge, there is no existing means to examine common components that may be found across a unidimensional dataset and a multidimensional one. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method to achieve the goal of JBSS when concurrent multidimensional EEG and unidimensional kinematic datasets are available, by combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with independent vector analysis (IVA). We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through numerical simulations and application to data collected from reaching movements in Parkinson's disease. The proposed method is a promising JBSS tool for real-world biomedical signal processing applications.

The 64-channal electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from 12 healthy volunteers were recorded including baseline stage, during stimulation and after stimulation. Autoregressive (AR) Burg method was used to estimate the power spectrum. Then power variation rate (PVR) was calculated to quantify the effects compared with the baseline in Delta band. The results showed that MTENS at ST36 on right side led to increased Delta band power in left frontal.

Network dynamics predict improvement in working memory performance following donepezil administration in healthy young adults	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						BNA; Donepezil; Working memory; Cognitive enhancement; EEG	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CHOLINERGIC ENHANCEMENT; ALPHA SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTIONAL FUNCTIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE	Attentional selection in the context of goal-directed behavior involves top-down modulation to enhance the contrast between relevant and irrelevant stimuli via enhancement and suppression of sensory cortical activity. Acetylcholine (ACh) is believed to be involved mechanistically in such attention processes. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic levels of ACh, on the relationship between performance and network dynamics during a visual working memory (WM) task involving relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded in 14 healthy young adults while they performed a selective face/scene working memory task. Each participant received either placebo or donepezil (5 mg, orally) on two different visits in a double-blinded study. To investigate the effects of donepezil on brain network dynamics we utilized a novel EEG-based Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis method that isolates location-time-frequency interrelations among event-related potential (ERP) peaks and extracts condition-specific networks. The activation level of the network modulated by donepezil, reflected in terms of the degree of its dynamical organization, was positively correlated with WM performance. Further analyses revealed that the frontal-posterior theta-alpha sub-network comprised the critical regions whose activation level correlated with beneficial effects on cognitive performance. These results indicate that condition-specific EEG network analysis could potentially serve to predict beneficial effects of therapeutic treatment in working memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions have been implicated, converging evidence suggests that activation of right inferior frontal gyrus (r-IFG) and right presupplementary motor area (r-preSMA) is crucial for successful response inhibition [2, 3]. However, it is still unknown how these prefrontal areas convey the necessary signal to the primary motor cortex (M1), the cortical site where the final motor plan eventually has to be inhibited or executed. On the basis of the widely accepted view that brain oscillations are fundamental for communication between neuronal network elements [4-6], one would predict that the transmission of these inhibitory signals within the prefrontal-central networks (i.e., r-IFG/M1 and/or r-preSMA/M1) is realized in rapid, periodic bursts coinciding with oscillatory brain activity at a distinct frequency. However, the dynamics of corticocortical effective connectivity has never been directly tested on such timescales. By using double-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) [7, 8], we assessed instantaneous prefrontal-to-motor cortex connectivity in a Go/NoGo paradigm as a function of delay from (Go/NoGo) cue onset. In NoGo trials only, the effects of a conditioning prefrontal TMS pulse on motor cortex excitability cycled at beta frequency, coinciding with a frontocentral beta signature in EEG. This establishes, for the first time, a tight link between effective cortical connectivity and related cortical oscillatory activity, leading to the conclusion that endogenous (top-down) inhibitory motor signals are transmitted in beta bursts in large-scale cortical networks for inhibitory motor control.

Previous studies suggest that the tremor activity originates in the cerebello-thalamocortical pathways. Alprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that attenuates tremors in ET. The mechanisms that mediate the therapeutic action of alprazolam are unknown; however, in healthy subjects, benzodiazepines increase cortical beta activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of alprazolam both on beta and tremor-related cortical activity and on alterations in tremor presentation in ET patients. Therefore, we characterised the dynamics of tremor and cortical activity in ET patients after alprazolam intake. Methods: We recorded hand tremors and contralateral cortical activity in four recordings before and after a single dose of alprazolam. We then computed the changes in tremors, cortico-muscular coherence, and cortical activity at the tremor frequency and in the beta band. Results: Alprazolam significantly attenuated tremors (EMG: 76.2 +/- 22.68%), decreased cortical activity in the tremor frequency range and increased cortical beta activity in all patients (P<0.05). At the same time, the cortico-muscular coherence at the tremor frequency became non-significant (P<0.05). We also found a significant correlation (r = 0.757, P<0.001) between the reduction in tremor severity and the increased ratio of cortical activity in the beta band to the activity observed in the tremor frequency range. Conclusions: This study provides the first quantitative analysis of tremor reduction following alprazolam intake. We observed that the tremor severity decreased in association with an increased ratio of beta to tremor-related cortical activity. We hypothesise that the increase in cortical beta activity may act as a blocking mechanism and may dampen the pathological oscillatory activity, which in turn attenuates the observed tremor.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are often based on motor- and/or sensory processes that are known to be impaired in late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS that only requires high-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. Approach. We trained subjects via EEG-based neurofeedback to self-regulate the amplitude of gamma-oscillations in the superior parietal cortex (SPC). We argue that parietal gamma-oscillations are likely to be associated with high-level attentional processes, thereby providing a communication channel that does not rely on the integrity of sensory- and/or motor-pathways impaired in late stages of ALS. Main results. Healthy subjects quickly learned to self-regulate gamma-power in the SPC by alternating between states of focused attention and relaxed wakefulness, resulting in an average decoding accuracy of 70.2%. One locked-in ALS patient (ALS-FRS-R score of zero) achieved an average decoding accuracy significantly above chance-level though insufficient for communication (55.8%). Significance. Self-regulation of gamma-power in the SPC is a feasible paradigm for brain-computer interfacing and may be preserved in late stages of ALS. This provides a novel approach to testing whether completely locked-in ALS patients retain the capacity for goal-directed thinking.

Dopaminergic Contributions to Hippocampal Pathophysiology in Schizophrenia: A Computational Study	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						dopamine; hippocampus; schizophrenia; computational modeling; gamma band; systems biology	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PROTEIN-KINASE; HUMAN BRAIN; RECEPTOR; NEURONS; RAT; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONY; CURRENTS; MODULATION	Since the original formulation of the dopamine hypothesis, a number of other cellular-level abnormalities eg, NMDA receptor hypofunction, GABA system dysfunction, neural connectivity disturbances have been identified in schizophrenia, but the manner in which these potentially interact with hyperdopaminergia to lead to schizophrenic symptomatology remains uncertain. Previously, we created a neuroanatomically detailed, biophysically realistic computational model of hippocampus in the control (unaffected) and schizophrenic conditions, implemented on a 72-processor supercomputer platform. In the current study, we apply the effects of dopamine (DA), dose-dependently, to both models on the basis of an exhaustive review of the neurophysiologic literature on DA's ion channel and synaptic level effects. To index schizophrenic behavior, we use the specific inability of the model to attune to the 40 Hz (gamma band) frequency, a finding that has been well replicated in the clinical electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography literature. In trials using 20 'simulated patients', we find that DA applied to the control model produces modest increases in 40 Hz activity, similar to experimental studies. However, in the schizophrenic model, increasing DA induces a decrement in 40 Hz resonance. This modeling work is significant in that it suggests that DA's effects may vary based on the neural substrate on which it acts, and via simulated EEG recordings points to the neurophysiologic mechanisms by which this may occur. We also feel that it makes a methodological contribution, as it exhibits a process by which a large amount of neurobiological data can be integrated to run pharmacologically relevant in silica experiments, using a systems biology approach.

Previously, the application of transcranial direct current stimulation, oscillating at the frequency of endogenous slow oscillations, during SWS enhanced memory consolidation for a hippocampus dependent task in humans suggesting a causal role of slowly oscillating electric fields for sleep dependent memory consolidation. Objective: Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings to a rodent model. Methods: Slow oscillatory direct transcranial current stimulation (SO-tDCS) was applied over the frontal cortex of rats during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and its effects on memory consolidation in the one-trial object-place recognition task were examined. A retention interval of 24 h was used to investigate the effects of SO-tDCS on long-term memory. Results: Animals' preference for the displaced object was significantly greater than chance only when animals received SO-tDCS. EEG spectral power indicated a trend toward a transient enhancement of endogenous SO activity in the SO-tDCS condition. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that slowly oscillating electric fields causal affect sleep dependent memory consolidation, and demonstrate that oscillatory tDCS can be a valuable tool to investigate the function of endogenous cortical network activity.

In models of temporal lobe epilepsy and in patients with this pathology, high frequency oscillations called fast ripples (FRs, 250-600 Hz) can be observed. FRs are considered potential biomarkers for epilepsy and, in the light of many in vitro and in silico studies, we thought that electrical synapsesmediated by gap junctions might possibly modulate FRs in vivo. Methods. Animals with spontaneous recurrent seizures induced by pilocarpine administration were implanted with movable microelectrodes in the right anterior and posterior hippocampus to evaluate the effects of gap junction blockers administered in the entorhinal cortex. The effects of carbenoxolone (50 nmoles) and quinine (35 pmoles) on the mean number of spontaneous FR events (occurrence of FRs), as well as on the mean number of oscillation cycles per FR event and their frequency, were assessed using a specific algorithm to analyze FRs in intracranial EEG recordings. Results. We found that these gap junction blockers decreased the mean number of FRs and the mean number of oscillation cycles per FR event in the hippocampus, both during and at different times after carbenoxolone and quinine administration. Conclusion. These data suggest that FRs may be modulated by gap junctions, although additional experiments in vivo will be necessary to determine the precise role of gap junctions in this pathological activity associated with epileptogenesis.

In this study, we recorded the electroencephlography (EEG) signals of thirteen subjects recruited for the natural auditory memory retrieval task. EEGs were recorded using an electrode cap with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) computed. For evaluating the interaction between distinct brain regions, phase-locking value (PLV) was calculated to determine the functional connectivity for distinct frequency bands. The results of ERSPs show that there is larger delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (5-8 Hz) synchronization in the left-and midline-frontal areas for subjects when they attend to the music segments with main theme. For the desynchronization of the alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz) in the midline-occipital and parietal region, the local suppression may indicate the engagement of specific cortical areas in sensory or cognitive functions. There is also strong beta synchronization when the subjects were attending to melody similar to the main theme which may indicate the active inhibition of motor cortices. The functional connectivity is shown by calculating the phase synchronization. Since the task is mainly related to the retrieval of working memory, the phase-locking value for the theta band is significantly larger when the subjects heard the melody similar to the main theme than the condition without main-theme recognition. However, the difference of phase synchronization between main-theme condition and other sound segments is not significant. The phase synchronization is significantly larger for the condition of similar melody in the frontal-parietal, frontal-temporal, and temporal-parietal regions which may indicate the processing of memory information.

With this approach, the time series of cardiac vagal autonomic activity and brain wave activities measured respectively as the normalized high frequency component of heart rate variability and the EEG power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands, are considered as realizations of the stochastic processes describing the dynamics of the heart system and of different brain sub-systems. Entropy-based measures are exploited to quantify the predictive information carried by each (sub) system, and to dissect this information into a part actively stored in the system and a part transferred to it from the other connected systems. The application of this approach to polysomnographic recordings of ten healthy subjects led us to identify a structured network of sleep brain-brain and brain-heart interactions, with the node described by the beta EEG power acting as a hub which conveys the largest amount of information flowing between the heart and brain nodes. This network was found to be sustained mostly by the transitions across different sleep stages, as the information transfer was weaker during specific stages than during the whole night, and vanished progressively when moving from light sleep to deep sleep and to REM sleep.

The brain zones with the strongest activity are expressed at a macro level by a few number of active brain dipoles. Normally, for solving the EEG inverse problem, fixed dipole locations are assumed, independently of the different stimuli that excite the brain. The proposed particle filter (PF) framework presents a shift in the current paradigm by estimating dynamic brain dipoles, which may vary from one location to another in the brain depending on internal/external stimuli that may affect the brain. Also, in contrast to previous solutions, the proposed PF algorithm estimates simultaneously, the number of the active dipoles, their moving locations and their respective oscillations in the three dimensional head geometry.

Although the after-effects of rTMS over motor cortex are well documented in healthy individuals, less is known about the stimulation of dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we studied in 20 healthy subjects how cortical oscillations are modulated by four different active rTMS protocols (1 Hz, 10 Hz, continuous and intermittent theta bursts cTBS and iTBS) of the left DLPFC, and by a sham protocol used as a control condition, by comparing the spectral power of pre- and post-rTMS electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 15 mm duration. EEG spectrum was estimated with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and partitioned using the common physiological frequency bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (3.5-7 Hz), alpha (7.5-13 Hz), low beta (14-22 Hz), high beta (22-30 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz). Statistical analyses of EEG changes induced by rTMS were computed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) for EEG, in every frequency band, at the scalp level and at the cortex level. We found for every active protocol a significant decrease of delta and theta power on left prefrontal electrodes, mainly localised in the left DLPFC. In higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), the decrease of power in the DLPFC was also observed contralaterally. Protocol-specific amplitude effects were found in the prefrontal cortex bilaterally in all frequency bands, but also in parietal and temporal regions in low EEG frequencies. In high frequencies, EEG power in the prefrontal cortex increased after rTMS for 10 Hz and iTBS protocols, but this effect did not survive the comparison to Sham responses. Because large delta and theta activity is usually associated with cortical inhibition, observed rTMS-induced EEG changes in low frequencies suggest that rTMS of DLPFC transiently decreases local cortical inhibition. Importantly, local responses take place in association with other unknown mechanisms that modulate inter-hemispheric connectivity between homologous regions, resulting in the increase or decrease of fast activity in each prefrontal lobe, depending on the stimulation protocol. Only decreases of fast activity following active rTMS could be detected as significant when compared to Sham stimulation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

In this review article, we aim to provide an overview about altered network compositions in epilepsy, as measured with current advanced neuroimaging techniques to characterize the initiation and spread of epileptic activity in the brain with multimodal noninvasive imaging techniques. We focus on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and simultaneous electroencephalography/fMRI, and oppose the findings in idiopathic generalized versus focal epilepsies. These data indicate that circumscribed epileptogenic lesions can have extended effects on many brain systems. Although epileptic seizures may involve various brain areas, seizure activity does not spread diffusely throughout the brain but propagates along specific anatomic pathways that characterize the underlying epilepsy syndrome. Such a functionally oriented approach may help to better understand a range of clinical phenomena such as the type of cognitive impairment, the development of pharmacoresistance, the propagation pathways of seizures, or the success of epilepsy surgery.

The method utilizes wavelet feature extraction from ECoG data, generation of compact binary vectors from these features, and binary vector hierarchical clustering. The potential utility of this method in the discovery of recurring neural patterns is demonstrated in an example showing clustering of ictal and post-ictal gamma activity patterns. The method allows for the efficient and scalable retrieval and clustering of neural motifs occurring in massive amounts of neural data, such as in prolonged EEG/ECoG recordings and in brain computer interfaces.

Feasibility of eyes open alpha power training for mental enhancement in elite gymnasts	JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						mental capacities; athletes; focus; eyes open alpha power training; neurofeedback	SLEEP QUALITY INDEX; PERFORMANCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; TOUGHNESS; PATTERNS; STRESS; SKILLS; MUSIC	This study focuses on a novel, easy to use and instruction-less method for mental training in athletes. Previous findings suggest that particular mental capacities are needed for achieving peak performance; including attentional control, focus, relaxation and positive affect. Electroencephalography (EEG) alpha brain activity has been associated with neural inhibition during processes of selective attention, for improving efficiency in information processing. Here we hypothesised that eyes open alpha power training by music teaches athletes to (1) learn to self-regulate their brain activity, and (2) learn to increase their baseline alpha power, herewith improving mental capacities such as focusing the allocation of attention. The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Twelve elite gymnasts were either given eyes open alpha power training or random beta power training (controls). Results indicate small improvements in sleep quality, mental and physical shape. In our first attempt at getting a grip on mental capacities in athletes, we think this novel training method can be promising. Because gymnastics is one of the most mentally demanding sports, we value even small benefits for the athlete and consider them indicative for future research.	[Dekker, Marian K.

Temporally synchronized neural firing patterns are advantageous for efficiently representing and transmitting information within and between assemblies. Computational, empirical, and conceptual considerations all lead to the expectation that the informational redundancy of neural firing rates is positively related to their synchronization. Recent theorizing and initial evidence also suggest that the coding of stimulus characteristics and their integration with behavioral goal states require neural interactions across a hierarchy of timescales. However, most studies thus have focused on neural activity in a single frequency range or on a restricted set of brain regions. Here we provide evidence for cooperative spatiotemporal dynamics of slow and fast EEG signals during perceptual decision making at the single-trial level. Participants performed three masked two-choice decision tasks, one each with numerical, verbal, or figural content. Decrements in posterior alpha power (8 - 14 Hz) were paralleled by increments in high-frequency (>30 Hz) signal entropy in trials demanding active sensory processing. Simultaneously, frontocentral theta power (4 - 7 Hz) increased, indicating evidence integration. The coordinated alpha/theta dynamics were tightly linked to decision speed and remarkably similar across tasks, suggesting a domain-general mechanism. In sum, we demonstrate an inverse association between decision-related changes in widespread low-frequency power and local high-frequency entropy. The cooperation among mechanisms captured by these changes enhances the informational density of neural response patterns and qualifies as a neural coding system in the service of perceptual decision making.

This study investigated neural control of a postural-suprapostural procedure when postural focus strategy varied. Twelve adults concurrently conducted force-matching and maintained stabilometer stance with visual feedback on ankle movement (visual internal focus, VIF) and on stabilometer movement (visual external focus, VEF). Force-matching error, dynamics of ankle and stabilometer movements, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were registered. Postural control with VEF caused superior force-matching performance, more complex ankle movement, and stronger kinematic coupling between the ankle and stabilometer movements than postural control with VIF. The postural focus strategy also altered ERP temporal-spatial patterns. Postural control with VEF resulted in later N1 with less negativity around the bilateral fronto-central and contralateral sensorimotor areas, earlier P2 deflection with more positivity around the bilateral fronto-central and ipsilateral temporal areas, and late movement-related potential commencing in the left frontal-central area, as compared with postural control with VIF. The time-frequency distribution of the ERP principal component revealed phase-locked neural oscillations in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) rhythms. The delta and theta rhythms were more pronounced prior to the timing of P2 positive deflection, and beta rebound was greater after the completion of force-matching in VEF condition than VIF condition. This study is the first to reveal the neural correlation of postural focusing effect on a postural-suprapostural task. Postural control with VEF takes advantage of efficient task-switching to facilitate autonomous postural response, in agreement with the "constrained-action" hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To compare performance against cross-correlation and coherence with phase measures. Methods: A simulation example was used as a gold standard to assess the performance of ERR-causality, against cross-correlation and coherence. The methods were then applied to real EEG data. Results: Analysis of both simulated and real EEG data demonstrates that ERR-causality successfully detects dynamically evolving changes between two signals, with very high time resolution, dependent on the sampling rate of the data. Our method can properly detect both linear and non-linear effects, encountered during analysis of focal and generalised seizures. Conclusions: We introduce a new quantitative EEG method of analysis. It detects real time levels of synchronisation in the linear and non-linear domains. It computes directionality of information flow with corresponding time lags. Significance: This novel dynamic real time EEG signal analysis unveils hidden neural network interactions with a very high time resolution. These interactions cannot be adequately resolved by the traditional methods of coherence and cross-correlation, which provide limited results in the presence of non-linear effects and lack fidelity for changes appearing over small periods of time.

Methods: We examined 24 right-handed patients diagnosed as uncomplicated probable Parkinson's disease (PD). Each patient underwent Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-part-III evaluation before and 60 min after an oral load of L-dopa-methyl-ester/carbidopa 250/25 mg. Resting condition eyes-closed EEG data were recorded both pre- and post L-dopa load. Absolute EEG power values were calculated at each scalp derivation for Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta frequency bands. UPDRS scores (both global and subscale scores) and EEG data (power values of different frequency bands for each scalp derivation) were submitted to a statistical analysis to compare Pre and Post L-Dopa conditions. Finally, a correlation analysis was carried out between EEG spectral content and UPDRS scores. Results: Considering EEG power spectral analysis, no statistically significant differences arose on Delta and Theta bands after L-dopa intake. Conversely, Alpha and Beta rhythms significantly increased on centro-parietal scalp derivations, as a function of L-dopa administration. Correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between Beta power increase on centro-parietal areas and UPDRS subscores (Rigidity of arms and Bradykinesia). A minor significant negative correlation was also found between Alpha band increase and resting tremor. Conclusions: Assuming that a significant change in EEG power spectrum after L-dopa intake may be related to dopaminergic mechanisms, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dopaminergic defective networks are implicated in cortical oscillatory abnormalities at rest in non-demented PD patients.

Identification of genes contributing to EEG variability during anaesthesia is important to the clinical application of anaesthesia monitoring and may provide an avenue to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and regulation of brain oscillations. Central immune signalling can impact neuronal activity in the brain and accumulating evidence suggests an important role for cytokines as neuronal modulators. We tested 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-related genes for associations with three anaesthesia-induced EEG patterns; spindle amplitude, delta power and alpha power, during general anaesthesia with desflurane in 111 patients undergoing general, gynaecological or orthopaedic surgery. Wide inter-patient variability was observed for all EEG variables. MYD88 rs6853 (p = 6.7 x 10(-4)) and IL-1 beta rs1143627 in conjunction with rs6853 (p = 1.5 x 10(-3)) were associated with spindle amplitude, and IL-10 rs1800896 was associated with delta power (p = 1.3 x 10(-2)) suggesting involvement of cytokine signalling in modulation of EEG patterns during desflurane anaesthesia. BDNF rs6265 was associated with alpha power (p = 3.9 x 10(-3)), suggesting differences in neuronal plasticity might also influence EEG patterns during desflurane anaesthesia. This is the first study we are aware of that has investigated genetic polymorphisms that may influence the EEG during general anaesthesia.

Regulating Cortical Oscillations in an Inhibition-Stabilized Network	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Brain rhythms; coherence; communication; electroencephalogram (EEG); gamma; Hopf bifurcation; inhibition-stabilized network (ISN); inhibitory neuron-network-gamma (ING); limit cycle; nonlinear system; oscillations; phase code; pyramidal neuron-inhibitory neuron-network-gamma (PING); synchrony; vision	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPIKING ACTIVITY; HIGH-FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; DRIVEN; SELECTIVITY	Understanding the anatomical and functional architecture of the brain is essential for designing neurally inspired intelligent systems. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest a role for narrowband oscillations in shaping the functional architecture of the brain through their role in coding and communication of information. Such oscillations are ubiquitous signals in the electrical activity recorded from the brain. In the cortex, oscillations detected in the gamma range (30-80 Hz) are modulated by behavioral states and sensory features in complex ways. How is this regulation achieved? Although several underlying principles for the genesis of these oscillations have been proposed, a unifying account for their regulation has remained elusive. In a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons operating in an inhibition-stabilized regime, we show that strongly superlinear responses of inhibitory neurons facilitate bidirectional regulation of oscillation frequency and power. In such a network, the balance of drives to the excitatory and inhibitory populations determines how the power and frequency of oscillations are modulated. The model accounts for the puzzling increase in their frequency with the salience of visual stimuli, and a decrease with their size. Oscillations in our model grow stronger as the mean firing level is reduced, accounting for the size dependence of visually evoked gamma rhythms, and suggesting a role for oscillations in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of signals in the brain. Empirically testing such predictions is still challenging, and implementing the proposed coding and communication strategies in neuromorphic systems could assist in our understanding of the biological system.

Performance evaluation of an automated single-channel sleep-wake detection algorithm	NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP			English	Article						EEG; sleep-wake detection; algorithm; Zmachine; automatic sleep scoring; single channel		Background: A need exists, from both a clinical and a research standpoint, for objective sleep measurement systems that are both easy to use and can accurately assess sleep and wake. This study evaluates the output of an automated sleep-wake detection algorithm (Z-ALG) used in the Zmachine (a portable, single-channel, electroencephalographic [EEG] acquisition and analysis system) against laboratory polysomnography (PSG) using a consensus of expert visual scorers. Methods: Overnight laboratory PSG studies from 99 subjects (52 females/47 males, 18-60 years, median age 32.7 years), including both normal sleepers and those with a variety of sleep disorders, were assessed. PSG data obtained from the differential mastoids (A(1)-A(2)) were assessed by Z-ALG, which determines sleep versus wake every 30 seconds using low-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and high-frequency and time domain EEG features. PSG data were independently scored by two to four certified PSG technologists, using standard Rechtschaffen and Kales guidelines, and these score files were combined on an epoch-by-epoch basis, using a majority voting rule, to generate a single score file per subject to compare against the Z-ALG output. Both epoch-by-epoch and standard sleep indices (eg, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, latency to persistent sleep, and wake after sleep onset) were compared between the Z-ALG output and the technologist consensus score files. Results: Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting sleep using the Z-ALG as compared to the technologist consensus are 95.5% and 92.5%, respectively, across all subjects, and the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value for detecting sleep are 98.0% and 84.2%, respectively. Overall k agreement is 0.85 (approaching the level of agreement observed among sleep technologists). These results persist when the sleep disorder subgroups are analyzed separately. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the Z-ALG automated sleep-wake detection algorithm, using the single A(1)-A(2) EEG channel, has a level of accuracy that is similar to PSG technologists in the scoring of sleep and wake, thereby making it suitable for a variety of in-home monitoring applications, such as in conjunction with the Zmachine system.

Self-regulation of frontal-midline theta facilitates memory updating and mental set shifting	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						frontal-midline theta; neurofeedback; cognitive enhancement; executive functions; EEG; proactive and reactive control	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INHIBITORY CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CINGULATE CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS	Frontal-midline (fm) theta oscillations as measured via the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been suggested as neural "working language" of executive functioning. Their power has been shown to increase when cognitive processing or task performance is enhanced. Thus, the question arises whether learning to increase fm-theta amplitudes would functionally impact the behavioral performance in tasks probing executive functions (EFs). Here, the effects of neurofeedback (NH, a learning method to self-up-regulate fm theta over fm electrodes, on the four most representative EFs, memory updating, set shifting, conflict monitoring, and motor inhibition are presented. Before beginning and after completing an individualized, eight-session gap-spaced NF intervention, the three-back, letter/number task switching, Stroop, and stop signal tasks were tested while measuring the EEG. Self determined up regulation of fm theta and its putative role for executive functioning were compared to an active control group, the so-called pseudo-neurofeedback group. Task-related fm-theta activity after training differed significantly between groups. More importantly, though, after NF significantly enhanced behavioral performance was observed. The training group showed higher accuracy scores in the three back task and reduced mixing and shifting costs in letter/number task-switching. However, this specific protocol type did not affect performance in tasks probing conflict monitoring and motor inhibition. Thus, our results suggest a modulation of proactive but not reactive mechanisms of cognitive control. Furthermore, task related EEG changes show a distinct pattern for fm theta after training between the NF and the pseudo-neurofeedback group, which indicates that NF training indeed tackles EFs-networks. In sum, the modulation of fm-theta via NF may serve as potent treatment approach for executive dysfunctions.

Our study aimed at identifying neural markers of social interaction and goal variations in a non-verbal task. For this, we recorded simultaneously the electroencephalogram from two participants (dual-EEG), an actor and an observer, and their arm/hand kinematics in a real face-to-face paradigm. The observer watched "biological actions" performed by the human actor and "non-biological actions" performed by a robot. All actions occurred within an interactive or non-interactive context depending on whether the observer had to perform a complementary action or not (e.g., the actor presents a saucer and the observer either places the corresponding cup or does nothing). We analysed the EEG signals of both participants (i.e., beta (similar to 20 Hz) oscillations as an index of cortical motor activity and motor related potentials (MRPs)). We identified markers of social interactions by synchronising EEG to the onset of the actor's movement. Movement kinematics did not differ in the two context conditions and the MRPs of the actor were similar in the two conditions. For the observer, however, an observation-related MRP was measured in all conditions but was more negative in the interactive context over frontocentral electrodes. Moreover, this feature was specific to biological actions. Concurrently, the suppression of beta oscillations was observed in the actor's EEG and the observer's EEG rapidly after the onset of the actor's movement. Critically, this suppression was stronger in the interactive than in the non-interactive context despite the fact that movement kinematics did not differ in the two context conditions. For the observer, this modulation was observed independently of whether the actor was a human or a robot. Our results suggest that acting in a social context induced analogous modulations of motor and sensorimotor regions in observer and actor. Sharing a common goal during an interaction seems thus to evoke a common representation of the global action that includes both actor and observer movements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have therefore addressed the detection of emotion from individuals' heart rate, skin conductance, pupil dilation, tone of voice, facial expression and electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper presents an algorithm for classifying positive and negative emotions from EEG. Unlike other algorithms that extract fuzzy rules from the data, the fuzzy rules used in this paper are obtained from emotion classification research reported in the literature and the classification output indicates both the type of emotion and its strength. The results show that the algorithm is more than 90 times faster than the widely used LIBSVM and the obtained average accuracy of 63.52 % is higher than previously reported using the same EEG dataset. This makes this algorithm attractive for real time emotion classification. In addition, the paper introduces a new oscillation feature computed from local minima and local maxima of the signal.

It was considered relevance to different aspects of teaching and learning such as achievement and motivation. On the other hand, Openness has been interpreted as a major trait which linked to knowledge and skill acquisition which linked to learner differences. In this research the relation between LS and Openness is studied as to underline a substantive learners' profile. Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (KLSI) had been employed to determined participants' (N=131) LS of Diverger, Assimilator, Converger or Accommodator. Then, Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology was utilized to gather their brain signals. The signals dataset of Alpha band is selected, processed and classified towards the corresponding LS using SPSS 2-Step Cluster Analysis.

Combining and comparing EEG, peripheral physiology and eye-related measures for the assessment of mental workload	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; physiology; eye; workload; classification; combination; ECG; skin conductance	WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; ALPHA-BAND; HEART-RATE; COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EMOTION ASSESSMENT; TASK-DIFFICULTY; DUAL-TASK; P300; PERFORMANCE	While studies exist that compare different physiological variables with respect to their association with mental workload, it is still largely unclear which variables supply the best information about momentary workload of an individual and what is the benefit of combining them. We investigated workload using the n-back task, controlling for body movements and visual input. We recorded EEG, skin conductance, respiration, ECG, pupil size and eye blinks of 14 subjects. Various variables were extracted from these recordings and used as features in individually tuned classification models. Online classification was simulated by using the first part of the data as training set and the last part of the data for testing the models. The results indicate that EEG performs best, followed by eye related measures and peripheral physiology. Combining variables from different sensors did not significantly improve workload assessment over the best performing sensor alone. Best classification accuracy, a little over 90%, was reached for distinguishing between high and low workload on the basis of 2 min segments of EEG and eye related variables. A similar and not significantly different performance of 86% was reached using only EEG from single electrode location Pz.	[Hogervorst, Maarten A.; Brouwer, Anne-Marie; van Erp, Jan B.

EEG Power Asymmetry and Functional Connectivity as a Marker of Treatment Effectiveness in DBS Surgery for Depression	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; major depressive disorder; electroencephalography; synchronization; functional connectivity	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; RAPID ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; DSM-IV DISORDERS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL	Recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been evaluated as an experimental therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Although there have been encouraging results in open-label trials, about half of the patients fail to achieve meaningful benefit Although progress has been made in understanding the neurobiology of MDD, the ability to characterize differences in brain dynamics between those who do and do not benefit from DBS is lacking. In this study, we investigated EEG resting-state data recorded from 12 patients that have undergone DBS surgery. Of those, six patients were classified as responders to DBS, defined as an improvement of 50% or more on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17). We compared hemispheric frontal theta and parietal alpha power asymmetry and synchronization asymmetry between responders and non-responders. Hemispheric power asymmetry showed statistically significant differences between responders and non-responders with healthy controls showing an asymmetry similar to responders but opposite to non-responders. This asymmetry was characterized by an increase in frontal theta in the right hemisphere relative to the left combined with an increase in parietal alpha in the left hemisphere relative to the right in non-responders compared with responders. Hemispheric mean synchronization asymmetry showed a statistically significant difference between responders and non-responders in the theta band, with healthy controls showing an asymmetry similar to responders but opposite to non-responders. This asymmetry resulted from an increase in frontal synchronization in the right hemisphere relative to the left combined with an increase in parietal synchronization in the left hemisphere relative to the right in non-responders compared with responders. Connectivity diagrams revealed long-range differences in frontal/central-parietal connectivity between the two groups in the theta band. This pattern was observed irrespective of whether EEG data were collected with active DBS or with the DBS stimulation turned off, suggesting stable functional and possibly structural modifications that may be attributed to plasticity.

Infraslow EEG Changes in Infantile Spasms	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Infantile spasms; Infraslow oscillations; Epileptic encephalopathy; thalamus	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; WEST SYNDROME; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SEIZURES; SLEEP; CAP	Purpose: Infantile spasms (IS) are a devastating epileptic encephalopathy syndrome of infancy. Analysis of infraslow EEG activity (ISA) has shown potential in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy and in differentiating between focal and generalized epilepsy syndromes. Infraslow EEG activity analysis may provide insights into the pathophysiology of some difficult-to-treat epilepsy syndromes, such as IS. To our knowledge, there are no published reports describing ISA in patients with IS. The purpose of this study was to describe ictal patterns of ISA in patients with IS and to correlate with clinical data. Methods: EEG recordings of all cases of IS in the past 10 years at the Alberta Children's Hospital were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were a technically adequate video EEG recording that captured at least one spasm. For each patient, the first 10 confirmed spasms were examined. Spasms were evaluated for changes in ISA, which were either generalized, lateralized, or absent ISA (g-ISA, l-ISA, or n-ISA, respectively). Results were correlated with treatments, clinical course, and information pertinent to likely etiology of the IS. Results: A total of 77% of spasms were associated with ISA; 57% with g-ISA, 20% l-ISA, and 21% n-ISA. All patients with exclusively g-ISA showed at least a partial response to initial therapy, while this was the case in 66.7% of those with at least some l-ISA and 50% of those with exclusively n-ISA. Other seizure types occurred in 60% of patients with exclusively g-ISA versus 83% with some l-ISA and all patients with exclusively n-ISA. Conclusions: Ictal ISA was observed in the majority of IS. Trends were observed suggesting that the presence of exclusive g-ISA changes may be a positive prognostic factor in IS.

A test group consisting of 104 healthy men from the ages of 19 to 21 was divided into two groups according to the magnitude of their individual alpha-frequency (IAF) median - groups with high (n = 53, IAF >= 10,04 Hz) and low (n = 51, IAF <= 10,03 Hz) levels of IAF. Changes in power and the coherence of the EEG oscillations during the alternate finger movements as well as intergroup differences were evaluated. Men with high a IAF are distinguished by higher rates of speed and accuracy in terms of their sensory-motor response. The role of inhibitory neural processes increases in the case of men whose frequencies are low. The implementation of alternating finger movements in male groups is accompanied by a decrease in the coherence of theta-, alpha 1-, alpha 3- EEG oscillations in the cortex in general, beta- and gamma- activity - in the rear temporal and occipital areas. In the frontal and central lobes of alpha 2-, beta- and gamma- ranges an increase in EEG coherence fluctuations was observed. The power of theta-, alpha- and beta 1- waves, especially in the posterior cortex areas, decreases. A larger degree of low-frequency fluctuations in EEG power can be observed in the frontal area. Thus, more economical brain processes providing the processing of any sensory or motor information in men with a high IAF determine higher levels of the speed and accuracy of their sensorimotor responses. Men with a low IAF have lower ductility but a higher voltage of brain processes correlated with a decrease in the sensorimotor response of speed capabilities increasing the role of inhibitory effects.

Using this metric, we studied the intrahemispheric EEG synchronization in the lower gamma band (30-40 Hz) during 1229 single trials of an audio-visual integration cross modal task (CMT) recorded from five patients with schizophrenia and five healthy control subjects. Using ensemble synchronization measure and response latency of single trials recorded during the CMT as features for logistic regression, we could classify each single trial of EEG as belonging to a patient with schizophrenia or a healthy control subject with 73% accuracy, with an area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.83. We also propose a likelihood rating to denote the possibility of a subject belonging to the schizophrenia group.

Twenty-three healthy subjects were assessed for their anxiety states using CMI and divided to two groups: low CMI score ( I) or high CMI score ( II, III and IV) group. EEG was measured under emotionally stimuli ( relaxed and pleasant, unpleasant and unpleasant sentence sessions) stimuli and analyzed using propagation speed analysis. The propagation speed for all session in the high CMI score group had a significantly region at left and right temporal and occipital regions. And the propagation speed for all session in the low CMI score group had a significantly region at frontal region. Especially, all stimuli of the low CMI score group were propagated in a longitudinal direction. The propagation speed for all session in the low CMI score group had a significantly higher than propagation speed in the high CMI score group. These processes in the brain would affect the event that stresses on human relationships that often cause people to suffer from mental disorders.

For this purpose, multiple time series of electric cortical activity can be used for assessing the properties of a network: the strength, directionality, and spectral characteristics (i.e., which oscillations are preferentially transmitted) of the connections. The partial directed coherence (PDC) of Baccala and Sameshima (2001) is a widely used method for this problem. The three aims of this study are: (1) To show that the PDC can misrepresent the frequency response under plausible realistic conditions, thus defeating the main purpose for which the measure was developed; (2) To provide a solution to this problem, namely the "isolated effective coherence" (iCoh), which consists of estimating the partial coherence under a multivariate autoregressive model, followed by setting all irrelevant associations to zero, other than the particular directional association of interest; and (3) To show that adequate iCoh estimators can be obtained from non-invasively computed cortical signals based on exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) applied to scalp EEG recordings. To illustrate the severity of the problem with the PDC, and the solution achieved by the iCoh, three examples are given, based on: (1) Simulated time series with known dynamics; (2) Simulated cortical sources with known dynamics, used for generating EEG recordings, which are then used for estimating (with eLORETA) the source signals for the final connectivity assessment; and (3) EEG recordings in rats. Lastly, real human recordings are analyzed, where the iCoh between six cortical regions of interest are calculated and compared under eyes open and closed conditions, using 61-channel EEG recordings from 109 subjects. During eyes closed, the posterior cingulate sends alpha activity to all other regions. During eyes open, the anterior cingulate sends theta-alpha activity to other frontal regions.

The experiments were carried out on a group of 14 healthy volunteers exposed to 450 MHz microwave radiation modulated at 40 Hz frequency. The applied microwave power was 1 W and the field power density near the head was 0.16 mW/cm(2). The EEG signal was recorded from 8 channels: frontal - FP1, FP2; temporal - T3, T4; parietal - P3, P4; and occipital - O1, O2; with the common recording reference Cz. Microwave exposure increased the group averaged SASI value about 64%. However, the alteration was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). The HFD method detected small (about 1.7%) but statistically significant (p = 0.008) enhancement of its value with microwave exposure.

The extent of these interactions can be examined by means of a mathematical algorithm called "coherence", which reflects the "strength" of functional interactions between cortical areas. As a continuation of a previous study of our group, the present study was conducted to analyze the inter-hemispheric coherence of the EEG gamma frequency band in the cat during alert wakefulness (AW), quiet wakefulness (QW), non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. Cats were implanted with electrodes in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices to monitor EEG activity. The degree of coherence in the low (30-45 Hz) and high (60-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands from pairs of EEG recordings was analyzed. A large increase in coherence between all inter-hemispheric cortical regions in the low gamma bands during AW was present compared to the other behavioral states. Furthermore, both low and high gamma coherence between inter-hemispheric heterotopic cortices (different cortical areas of both hemispheres) decreased during REM sleep; this is a pattern that we previously reported between the cortical areas of the same hemisphere (intrahemispheric coherence). In the high gamma band, coherence during REM sleep also decreased compared to the other behavioral states. In contrast, between most of the interhemispheric homotopic cortical areas (equivalent or mirror areas of both hemispheres), low gamma coherence was similar during NREM compared to REM sleep. We conclude that in spite of subtle differences between homotopic and heterotopic inter-hemispheric cortices, functional interactions at high frequency decrease during REM sleep.

Such critical situations drive the collaborative work into poor continuity. Remote collaboration is even harder to stay active due to communication difficulty in decision-making This study argues an effective visualization method for monitoring causal factors of conversational situation by multimodal dialogue analysis from turn-taking and mental workload for collaborative working and communication use. Our approach to Follow Awareness visualizes frequency of turn-taking and changing mental workload by the analysis of an EEC (electroencephalogram) based index. Mental workloads of two team members are compared as difference in their changes within a predetermined amount of times for the analysis of follows between the team members. Frequency of turn-taking and changes in mental workload are then displayed by a mobile device during their collaborative work for validation in real-time. Evaluation results from a case study of collaborative work in pair programming presented large difference of changes in mental workload at the point their active communication turned to silence by a small setback.

Such differences are stable and trait-like, but it is not clear whether these findings generalize to physiologic responses to sleep loss. Here, we analyzed individual differences in behavioral and physiologic measures in healthy ethnic-Chinese male volunteers (n = 12; aged 22-30 years) who were kept awake for at least 26 h in a controlled laboratory environment on two separate occasions. Every 2 h, sustained attention performance was assessed using a 10-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and sleepiness was estimated objectively by determining percentage eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS) and blink rate. Between-subject differences in heart rate and its variability, and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power were also analyzed during each PVT. To assess stability of individual differences, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were determined using variance components analysis. Consistent with previous work, individual differences in PVT performance were reproducible across study visits, as were baseline sleep measures prior to sleep deprivation. In addition, stable individual differences were observed during sleep deprivation for PERCLOS, blink rate, heart rate and its variability, and EEG spectral power in the alpha frequency band, even after adjusting for baseline differences in these measures (range, ICC = 0.67-0.91). These findings establish that changes in ocular, ECG, and EEG signals are highly reproducible across a night of sleep deprivation, hence raising the possibility that, similar to behavioral measures, physiologic responses to sleep loss are trait-like.

This study was aimed to determine whether resting EEG is altered in predinical HD mutations carriers (pre-HD). Methods: We examined relative power of broad traditional EEG bands as well as 1-Hz sub-bands of theta and alpha from the resting-state EEG of 29 pre-HD individuals and of 29 age-matched normal controls. Results: The relative power of the narrow sub-band in the border of theta-alpha (7-8 Hz) was significantly reduced in pre-HD subjects as compared to normal controls, while the alterations in relative power of the broad frequency bands were not significant. In pre-HD subjects, the number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene as well as the disease burden score (DBS) showed a positive correlation with relative power of the delta and theta frequency bands and their sub-bands and a negative correlation with alpha band relative power and the differences of relative power of the 7-8 Hz and 4-5 Hz frequency sub-bands. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that EEG alterations in pre-HD individuals may be related to the course of the pathological process and to HD endophenotype. Analysis of the narrow EEG bands was found to be more useful for assessing EEG alterations in pre-HD individuals than a more traditional approach using broad bandwidths. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However what the ERD really reflects and its frequency band specific role have not been agreed and are under investigation. Understanding the underlying mechanism which causes a significant ERD would be crucial to improve the reliability of the ERD-based BCI. We systematically investigated the relationship between conditions of actual repetitive hand movements and resulting ERD. Methods: Eleven healthy young participants were asked to close/open their right hand repetitively at three different speeds (Hold, 1/3 Hz, and 1 Hz) and four distinct motor loads (0, 2, 10, and 15 kgf). In each condition, participants repeated 20 experimental trials, each of which consisted of rest (8-10 s), preparation (1 s) and task (6 s) periods. Under the Hold condition, participants were instructed to keep clenching their hand (i.e., isometric contraction) during the task period. Throughout the experiment, EEG signals were recorded from left and right motor areas for offline data analysis. We obtained time courses of EEG power spectrum to discuss the modulation of mu and beta-ERD/ERS due to the task conditions. Results: We confirmed salient mu-ERD (8-13 Hz) and slightly weak beta-ERD (14-30 Hz) on both hemispheres during repetitive hand grasping movements. According to a 3 x 4 ANOVA (speed x motor load), both mu and beta-ERD during the task period were significantly weakened under the Hold condition, whereas no significant difference in the kinetics levels and interaction effect was observed. Conclusions: This study investigates the effect of changes in kinematics and kinetics on resulting ERD during repetitive hand grasping movements. The experimental results suggest that the strength of ERD may reflect the time differentiation of hand postures in motor planning process or the variation of proprioception resulting from hand movements, rather than the motor command generated in the down stream, which recruits a group of motor neurons.

Recent studies have shown that auditory cortex better encodes the envelope of attended speech than that of unattended speech during multi-speaker ('cocktail party') situations. We investigated whether these differences were sufficiently robust within single-trial electroencephalographic (EEG) data to accurately determine where subjects attended. Additionally, we compared this measure to other established EEG markers of attention. Approach. High-resolution EEG was recorded while subjects engaged in a two-speaker 'cocktail party' task. Cortical responses to speech envelopes were extracted by cross-correlating the envelopes with each EEG channel. We also measured steady-state responses (elicited via high-frequency amplitude modulation of the speech) and alpha-band power, both of which have been sensitive to attention in previous studies. Using linear classifiers, we then examined how well each of these features could be used to predict the subjects' side of attention at various epoch lengths. Main results. We found that the attended speaker could be determined reliably from the envelope responses calculated from short periods of EEG, with accuracy improving as a function of sample length. Furthermore, envelope responses were far better indicators of attention than changes in either alpha power or steady-state responses. Significance. These results suggest that envelope-related signals recorded in EEG data can be used to form robust auditory BCI's that do not require artificial manipulation (e. g., amplitude modulation) of stimuli to function.

Frontal alpha oscillations distinguish leaders from followers: Multivariate decoding of mutually interacting brains	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Social interaction; Dual EEG; Interpersonal coordination; Multivariate decoding; Leader-follower dynamics	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; COORDINATION; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; STRATEGIES; IMITATION; ARTIFACTS	Successful social interactions rely upon the abilities of two or more people to mutually exchange information in real-time, while simultaneously adapting to one another. The neural basis of social cognition has mostly been investigated in isolated individuals, and more recently using two-person paradigms to quantify the neuronal dynamics underlying social interaction. While several studies have shown the relevance of understanding complementary and mutually adaptive processes, the neural mechanisms underlying such coordinative behavioral patterns during joint action remain largely unknown. Here, we employed a synchronized finger-tapping task while measuring dual-EEG from pairs of human participants who either mutually adjusted to each other in an interactive task or followed a computer metronome. Neurophysiologically, the interactive condition was characterized by a stronger suppression of alpha and low-beta oscillations over motor and frontal areas in contrast to the non-interactive computer condition. A multivariate analysis of two-brain activity to classify interactive versus non-interactive trials revealed asymmetric patterns of the frontal alpha-suppression in each pair, during both task anticipation and execution, such that only one member showed the frontal component. Analysis of the behavioral data showed that this distinction coincided with the leader-follower relationship in 8/9 pairs, with the leaders characterized by the stronger frontal alpha-suppression. This suggests that leaders invest more resources in prospective planning and control. Hence our results show that the spontaneous emergence of leader-follower relationships in dyadic interactions can be predicted from EEG recordings of brain activity prior to and during interaction. Furthermore, this emphasizes the importance of investigating complementarity in joint action. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analysis of brain connectivity changes after propofol injection by generalized partial directed coherence	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Multivariate autoregressive modeling; Granger causality; Frontal alpha oscillation; Anesthesia; Generalized partial directed coherence	ANESTHESIA; DEPTH; SEDATION	In this paper we present a method for the analysis of multichannel EEG by using Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC) to extract cortical connectivity changes under anesthesia. 15 channel EEG data were recorded from female subjects undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. Multivariate Autoregressive (MAR) modeling was applied to multichannel, bipolar EEG segments of awake and anesthetized states. gPDCs were calculated using the derived MAR model and averaged through EEG alpha frequency band (8-14 Hz) and through a number of data segments. The gPDC calculation was performed for three different sets of bipolar EEG channel pairs each of which mainly represent a specific scalp area. To derive consistency levels of gPDC values, surrogate analysis is also performed. Using paired t-test for 12 patients, we extracted significant gPDC changes between. awake and anesthetized stages for each set. Analysis revealed that during transition from awake to anesthetized stage, gPDCs of central. to parietal directions were suppressed whereas gPDCs of parietal to central directions were increased. The results indicate that the proposed gPDC analysis method can be used to track the changes in brain connectivity and hence to estimate the depth of anesthesia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Professional musicians represent an ideal model in which to elicit experience-driven changes in the emotional processing domain. The changes of the central representation of emotional arousal due to musical expertise are still largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the electroencephalogram ( EEG) correlates of experience-driven changes in the domain of emotional arousal. Therefore, the differences in perceived ( subjective arousal via ratings) and physiologically measured ( EEG) arousal between amateur and professional musicians were examined. Procedure: A total of 15 professional and 19 amateur musicians listened to the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th symphony ( duration= similar to 7.4 min), during which a continuous 76-channel EEG was recorded. In a second session, the participants evaluated their emotional arousal during listening. In a tonic analysis, we examined the average EEG data over the time course of the music piece. For a phasic analysis, a fast Fourier transform was performed and covariance maps of spectral power were computed in association with the subjective arousal ratings. Results: The subjective arousal ratings of the professional musicians were more consistent than those of the amateur musicians. In the tonic EEG analysis, a mid-frontal theta activity was observed in the professionals. In the phasic EEG, the professionals exhibited an increase of posterior alpha, central delta, and beta rhythm during high arousal. Discussion: Professionals exhibited different and/or more intense patterns of emotional activation when they listened to the music. The results of the present study underscore the impact of music experience on emotional reactions. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Mikutta, C.

We used a metacontrast backward masking paradigm in which subjects had to discriminate between two weak stimuli and obtained measures of accuracy and awareness while their EEG was recorded from 256 channels. Comparing targets that were correctly identified with and without awareness allowed us to contrast differences in awareness while keeping performance constant for identical physical stimuli. Two distinct pre-stimulus scalp potential fields (microstate maps) dissociated correct identification with and without awareness, and their estimated intracranial generators were stronger in primary visual cortex before correct identification without awareness. This difference in activity cannot be explained by differences in alpha power or phase which were less reliably linked with differential pre-stimulus activation of primary visual cortex. Our results shed a new light on the function of pre-stimulus activity in early visual cortex in visual awareness and emphasize the importance of trial-by-trials analysis of the spatial configuration of the scalp potential field identified with multichannel EEG.

Both mGlu2/3 receptor agonists and mGlu1 receptor antagonists reportedly improve behavioral abnormalities elicited by NMDA receptor antagonists in rodents. The present study evaluated the effects of an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist and an mGlu1 receptor antagonist on aberrant basal gamma oscillations elicited by an NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, in the rat frontal cortex. Ketamine increased spontaneous cortical gamma oscillations. Pretreatment with an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist, (-)-2-oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate (LY379268), or an mGlul receptor antagonist, (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-6]quinolin-7-y1)-(cis-4-methoxycyclohexyl)methanone (JNJ16259685), reduced the ketamine-induced basal gamma hyperactivity. These findings indicate that the stimulation of mGlu2/3 receptors and the inhibition of mGlul receptors reverse aberrant gamma oscillations, and these effects may partially explain the antipsychotic-like properties of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists and mGlul receptor antagonists.

Antiphasic 40 Hz Oscillatory Current Stimulation Affects Bistable Motion Perception	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Apparent motion; Bistable perception; Coherence; EEG gamma band; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)	INTERHEMISPHERIC EEG COHERENCE; STIMULUS-DEPENDENT CHANGES; NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; GAMMA-BAND; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; DOMINANCE DURATIONS; APPARENT MOTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; ALPHA-BAND	When viewing ambiguous stimuli, conscious perception alternates spontaneously between competing interpretations of physically unchanged stimulus information. As one possible neural mechanism underlying the perceptual switches, it has been suggested that neurons dynamically change their pattern of synchronized oscillatory activity in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). In support of this hypothesis, there is correlative evidence from human electroencephalographic (EEG) studies for gamma band modulations during ambiguous perception. To establish a causal role of gamma band oscillations in the current study, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 40 Hz over occipital-parietal areas of both hemispheres during the presentation of bistable apparent motion stimuli that can be perceived as moving either horizontally or vertically. In this paradigm, the switch between horizontal and vertical apparent motion is likely to involve a change in interhemispheric functional coupling. We examined gamma tACS effects on the durations of perceived horizontal and vertical motion as well as on interhemispheric EEG coherence and found a decreased proportion of perceived horizontal motion together with an increase of interhemispheric gamma band coherence. In a control experiment using 6 Hz tACS, we did not observe any stimulation effects on behavior or coherence. Furthermore, external stimulation at 40 Hz was only effective when applied with 180A degrees phase difference between hemispheres (anti-phase), as compared to in-phase stimulation with 0A degrees phase difference. These findings suggest that externally desynchronizing gamma oscillations between hemispheres impairs interhemispheric motion integration and in turn biases conscious experience of bistable apparent motion.

Part of the difficulty has been a lack of signal processing tools suitable for the analysis of nonstationary electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Here, we use multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), a data-driven approach that does not employ predefined basis functions. High-density EEG, and arm and eye movements were synchronously recorded in 10 subjects performing time-constrained reaching and/or eye movements. Subjects were allowed to move both the hand and the eyes, only the hand, or only the eyes following a 500-700 ms delay interval where the hand and gaze remained on a central fixation cross. An additional condition involved a nonspatially-directed "lift" movement of the hand. The neural activity during a 500 ms delay interval was decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using MEMD. Classification analysis revealed that gamma band (30 Hz <) IMFs produced more classifiable features differentiating the EEG according to the different upcoming movements. A benchmark test using conventional algorithms demonstrated that MEMD was the best algorithm for extracting oscillatory bands from EEG, yielding the best classification of the different movement conditions. The gamma rhythm decomposed using MEMD showed a higher correlation with the eventual movement accuracy than any other band rhythm and than any other algorithm.

Frequency and topography in monkey electroencephalogram during action observation: possible neural correlates of the mirror neuron system	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; mu rhythm; motor system; mirror neurons; macaque	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; INFERIOR PARIETAL; VENTRAL PREMOTOR; MU-RHYTHM; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; ACTION ORGANIZATION; DORSAL PREMOTOR; EEG EVIDENCE	The observation of actions executed by others results in desynchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the alpha and beta frequency bands recorded from the central regions in humans. On the other hand, mirror neurons, which are thought to be responsible for this effect, have been studied only in macaque monkeys, using single-cell recordings. Here, as a first step in a research programme aimed at understanding the parallels between human and monkey mirror neuron systems (MNS), we recorded EEG from the scalp of two monkeys during action observation. The monkeys were trained to fixate on the face of a human agent and subsequently to fixate on a target upon which the agent performed a grasping action. We found that action observation produced desynchronization in the 19-25 Hz band that was strongest over anterior and central electrodes. These results are in line with human data showing that specific frequency bands within the power spectrum of the ongoing EEG may be modulated by observation of actions and therefore might be a specific marker of MNS activity.

Detection of mental imagery and attempted movements in patients with disorders of consciousness using EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; mental imagery; attempted movements; passive movements; disorders of consciousness	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; VEGETATIVE STATE; SYNCHRONIZATION; AWARENESS; FMRI	Further development of an EEG based communication device for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) could benefit from addressing the following gaps in knowledge-first, an evaluation of different types of motor imagery; second, an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup; and third, rapid delivery of biased feedback. To that end we investigated whether complex and/or familiar mental imagery, passive, and attempted feet movement can be reliably detected in patients with DoC using EEG recordings, aiming to provide them with a means of communication. Six patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) took part in this study. The patients were verbally instructed to perform different mental imagery tasks (sport, navigation), as well as attempted feet movements, to induce distinctive event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S) patterns in the EEG. Offline classification accuracies above chance level were reached in all three tasks (i.e., attempted feet, sport, and navigation), with motor tasks yielding significant (p < 0.05) results more often than navigation (sport: 10 out of 18 sessions; attempted feet: 7 out of 14 sessions; navigation: 4 out of 12 sessions). The passive feet movements, evaluated in one patient, yielded mixed results: whereas time-frequency analysis revealed task-related EEG changes over neurophysiological plausible cortical areas, the classification results were not significant enough (p < 0.05) to setup an initial classifier for the detection of attempted movements. Concluding, the results presented in this study are consistent with the current state of the art in similar studies, to which we contributed by comparing different types of mental tasks, notably complex motor imagery and attempted feet movements, within patients. Furthermore, we explored new venues, such as an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup, and rapid delivery of biased feedback.

Signals were obtained in two behavioral states: eyes open no task and eyes closed no task. Four time domain measures were compared: Pearson product moment correlation, Spearman rank order correlation, Kendall rank order correlation and mutual information. The psychophysiological utility of each measure was assessed by determining its ability to discriminate between conditions. The sensitivity to epoch length was assessed by repeating calculations with 1, 2, 3, aEuro broken vertical bar, 8 s epochs. The robustness to noise was assessed by performing calculations with noise corrupted versions of the original signals (SNRs of 0, 5 and 10 dB). Three results were obtained in these calculations. First, mutual information effectively discriminated between states with less data. Pearson, Spearman and Kendall failed to discriminate between states with a 1 s epoch, while a statistically significant separation was obtained with mutual information. Second, at all epoch durations tested, the measure of between-state discrimination was greater for mutual information. Third, discrimination based on mutual information was more robust to noise. The limitations of this study are discussed. Further comparisons should be made with frequency domain measures, with measures constructed with embedded data and with the maximal information coefficient.	[Bonita, J. D.; Ambolode, L. C.

J	Ai, L; Ro, T				Ai, Lei; Ro, Tony			The phase of prestimulus alpha oscillations affects tactile perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						tactile; oscillation; perception; human	ANTICIPATORY ALPHA; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MU RHYTHM; INHIBITION; MODULATION; RESPONSES; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; POWER	Previous studies have shown that neural oscillations in the 8- to 12-Hz range influence sensory perception. In the current study, we examined whether both the power and phase of these mu/alpha oscillations predict successful conscious tactile perception. Near-threshold tactile stimuli were applied to the left hand while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded over the contralateral right somatosensory cortex. We found a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between prestimulus mu/alpha power and detection rate, suggesting that there is an intermediate level of alpha power that is optimal for tactile perception. We also found a significant difference in phase angle concentration at stimulus onset that predicted whether the upcoming tactile stimulus was perceived or missed. As has been shown in the visual system, these findings suggest that these mu/alpha oscillations measured over somatosensory areas exert a strong inhibitory control on tactile perception and that pulsed inhibition by these oscillations shapes the state of brain activity necessary for conscious perception. They further suggest that these common phasic processing mechanisms across different sensory modalities and brain regions may reflect a common underlying encoding principle in perceptual processing that leads to momentary windows of perceptual awareness.

However, whether or not such fluctuations are specific to sleepwalking episodes or generalized to all sleep-wake transitions in sleepwalkers remains unknown. The goal of this study was to compare spectral power for delta (1-4 Hz) and slow delta (0.5-1 Hz) as well as slow oscillation density before the onset of somnambulistic episodes versus non-behavioral awakenings recorded from the same group of sleepwalkers. A secondary aim was to describe the time course of observed changes in slow-wave activity and slow oscillations during the 3 min immediately preceding the occurrence of somnambulistic episodes. Methods: Twelve adult sleepwalkers were investigated polysomnographically during the course of one night. Results: Slow-wave activity and slow oscillation density were significantly greater prior to patients' somnambulistic episodes as compared with non-behavioral awakenings. However, there was no evidence for a gradual increase over the 3 min preceding the episodes. Conclusions: Increased slow-wave activity and slow oscillation density appear to be specific to sleepwalking episodes rather than generalized to all sleep-wake transitions in sleepwalkers.

Entrainment of spontaneous cerebral hemodynamic oscillations to behavioral responses	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Blood pressure oscillations; (De)Oxyhemoglobin oscillations; Entrainment; Voluntary movement; Resting state	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; BLOOD-PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; RESTING SUBJECTS; BRAIN; MODEL; ACTIVATION; TASK; EEG	Entrainment in physiological systems can be manifest in cases where phase-coupling (synchronization) between slow intrinsic oscillations and periodic motor responses, or vice versa, takes place. To test whether voluntary movement has something in common with entrainment of slow hemodynamic oscillations to motor responses, we studied blood pressure (BP), heart rate beat-to-beat intervals (RRI) and prefrontal (de)oxyhemoglobin (Hb/HbO(2)) during 5 min of rest, 10 min of self-paced, voluntary movements and 10 min of stimulus-paced movements at 10 s intervals in 9 subjects. Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of voluntary finger movements. It appeared that these movements occurred at relatively regular intervals of approximately 10 s in 5 subjects (group A); while 4 subjects showed random or very short inter-movement intervals (group B). Two remarkable results were obtained: first, the phase coupling (COH2) between BP and RRI showed a significant (p = 0.0061) interaction between activity (rest vs. movement) and group (A vs. B), with an increased (p = 0.0003) coupling in group A. Second, the COH2 between BP and Hb oscillations showed a significant (p = 0.034) interaction between activity and group, with a decreased (p = 0.079) coupling in group B. These results suggest that subjects able to initiate self-paced, voluntary movements at relatively regular intervals of 10 s show an entrainment potential between physiological oscillations and motor responses. This also provides the first evidence that not only physiological oscillations can be entrained to motor responses, but also motor responses (voluntary movements) can be entrained to slow intrinsic oscillations.

Multifaceted roles for low-frequency oscillations in bottom-up and top-down processing during navigation and memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Hippocampus; Delta; Theta; Spatial navigation	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; HUMAN NEOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; UNIT-ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PHASE PRECESSION; TASK DEPENDENCE; EEG; BEHAVIOR; SYNCHRONIZATION	A prominent and replicated finding is the correlation between running speed and increases in low-frequency oscillatory activity in the hippocampal local field potential. A more recent finding concerns low-frequency oscillations that increase in coherence between the hippocampus and neocortical brain areas such as prefrontal cortex during memory-related behaviors (i.e., remembering the correct location to visit). In this review, we tie together movement-related and memory-related low-frequency oscillations in the rodent with similar findings in humans. We argue that although movement-related low-frequency oscillations, in particular, may have slightly different characteristics in humans than rodents, placing important constraints on our thinking about this issue, both phenomena have similar functional foundations. We review four prominent theoretical models that provide partially conflicting accounts of movement-related low-frequency oscillations. We attempt to tie together these theoretical proposals, and existing data in rodents and humans, with memory-related low-frequency oscillations. We propose that movement-related low-frequency oscillations and memory-related low-frequency oscillatory activity, both of which show significant coherence with oscillations in other brain regions, represent different facets of "spectral fingerprints," or different resonant frequencies within the same brain networks underlying different cognitive processes. Together, movement-related and memory-related low-frequency oscillatory coupling may be linked by their distinct contributions to bottom-up, sensorimotor driven processing and top-down, controlled processing characterizing aspects of memory encoding and retrieval.

The complexity of the epileptic network formed by multiple tubers complicates localization of the epileptogenic zone that is needed to design a surgical treatment strategy. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) on intracranial video-electroencephalography (IVEEG) may be a valuable surrogate marker for the localization of the epileptogenic zone. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that high occurrence rate (OR) of interictal HFOs can guide the localization of the epileptogenic zone. MethodsWe analyzed the OR of interictal HFOs at 80-200Hz (ripples) and >200Hz (fast ripples, FRs). We divided OR of interictal HFOs between high and low rates by thresholding. We analyzed the correlation between seizure outcomes using Engel classification and the resection ratio of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), and high-OR HFOs using ordinal logistic regression analysis. ResultsWe collected 10 patients. The seizure outcomes resulted in Engel classification I in three patients, II in four, III in one, and IV in two. High-OR ripples (5-57 [mean 29] channels, 1-4 [2.8] lobes) and high-OR FRs (9-66 [mean 27] channels, 1-4 [2.6] lobes) were widely distributed. The resection ratio of SOZ did not show statistically significant correlation with the seizure outcome. The resection ratio of high-OR ripples showed statistically significant correlation with the seizure outcome (p=0.038). The resection ratio of high-OR FRs showed statistically significant correlation with the seizure outcome (p=0.048). SignificanceThe multiple extensive zones with high-OR HFOs suggest a complex and widespread epileptic network in patients with TSC. In a subset of TSC patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, resection of cortex with both interictal high-OR FRs and ripples on IVEEG correlated with a good seizure outcome.

Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is characterized by bilateral synchronous spike-wave discharges on electroencephalography (EEG) but normal clinical MRI. Dysfunctions involving the neocortex, particularly the prefrontal cortex, and thalamus likely contribute to seizure activity. To identify possible morphometric and functional differences in the brains of IGE patients and normal controls, we employed measures of thalamic volumes, cortical thickness, gray-white blurring, fractional anisotropy (FA) measures from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in thalamic subregions from resting state functional MRI. Data from 27 patients with IGE and 27 age- and sex-matched controls showed similar thalamic volumes, cortical thickness and gray-white contrast. There were no differences in FA values on DTI in tracts connecting the thalamus and prefrontal cortex. Functional analysis revealed decreased fALFF in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregion of the thalamus in patients with IGE. We provide minimum detectable effect sizes for each measure used in the study. Our analysis indicates that fMRI-based methods are more sensitive than quantitative structural techniques for characterizing brain abnormalities in IGE. (C) 2014 The Authors.

By making use of linear methods and statistical tests upon 10 electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) overnight sleep recordings; the computation of cross-correlation and wavelet coherence is focused on finding distinguishable features amongst the testing subjects.

In the current study, we addressed this issue with 64-channel EEG and a dichotic listening (DL) task in twenty-five healthy participants. The typical finding of DL is a more frequent conscious perception of the speech syllable presented to the right ear (RE), which is attributed to the supremacy of the contralateral pathways running from the RE to the speech-dominant left hemisphere. In contrast, the left ear (LE) input initially accesses the right hemisphere and needs additional transfer via interhemispheric pathways before it is processed in the left hemisphere. Using lagged phase synchronization (LPS) analysis and eLORETA source estimation we examined the functional connectivity between right and left primary and secondary auditory cortices in the main frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) during RE/LE-reports. Interhemispheric LPS between right and left primary and secondary auditory cortices was specifically increased in the gamma-band range, when participants consciously perceived the syllable presented to the LE. Our results suggest that synchronous gamma oscillations are involved in interhemispheric transfer of auditory information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG signals from children with math difficulties (MD) and typically achieving controls (NI) were analyzed using minimum spanning tree (MST) indices derived from Phase Lag Index values - a graph method that corrects for comparison bias. Results demonstrated progressive modulation of certain MST parameters with increased task difficulty. These findings were consistent with more distributed network activation in the theta band, and greater network integration (i.e., tighter communication between involved regions) in the alpha band as task demands increased. There was also evidence of stronger intraregional signal inter-dependencies in the higher frequency bands during the complex math task. Although these findings did not differ between groups, several MST parameters were positively correlated with individual performance on psychometric math tasks involving similar operations, especially in the NI group. The findings support the potential utility of MST analyses to evaluate function-related electrocortical reactivity over a wide range of EEG frequencies in children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cerebral cortical activity associated with non-experts' most accurate motor performance	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Novice; Motor performance; Brain activity; EEG	WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG COHERENCE; ATTENTION; NOVICE; SKILL; PATTERNS; MARKSMEN; IMPLICIT	This study's specific aim was to determine if non-experts' most accurate motor performance is associated with verbal-analytic- and working memory-related cerebral cortical activity during motor preparation. To assess this, EEG was recorded from nonexpert golfers executing putts; EEG spectral power and coherence were calculated for the epoch preceding putt execution; and spectral power and coherence for the five most accurate putts were contrasted with that for the five least accurate. Results revealed marked power in the theta frequency bandwidth at all cerebral cortical regions for the most accurate putts relative to the least accurate, and considerable power in the low-beta frequency bandwidth at the left temporal region for the most accurate compared to the least. As theta power is associated with working memory and low-beta power at the left temporal region with verbal analysis, results suggest non-experts' most accurate motor performance is associated with verbal-analytic- and working memory-related cerebral cortical activity during motor preparation.

This paper presents a biosignal processing approach as a supportive computational resource in the estimation of sleep dynamics. The application of linear, non-linear methods and statistical tests upon 10 overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings, allowed the computation of wavelet coherence and phase locking values, in order to identify discerning features amongst the clinical healthy subjects. Our findings showed that neuronal oscillations theta, alpha and sigma interact with cardiac power bands at mid-to-high rank of coherence and phase locking, particularly during NREM sleep stages.

J	Wascher, E; Heppner, H; Hoffmann, S				Wascher, Edmund; Heppner, Holger; Hoffmann, Sven			Towards the measurement of event-related EEG activity in real-life working environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Mobile EEG; Eye blinks; Working environment	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MENTAL FATIGUE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BLINK ARTIFACTS; PERFORMANCE; DOPAMINE; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; PREDICTION	In applied contexts, psychophysiological measures have a long tradition to evaluate the user state. EEG correlates that indicate mechanisms of information processing, however, are hardly accessible since discrete time stamps that are necessary for this approach are commonly not available in natural situations. However, eye blinks may close this gap. Eye blinks are assumed to mark distinct points in information processing, necessary to segment the incoming data stream. By using mobile EEG in a simulated working situation we demonstrate that eye-blink-related potentials provide reliable information about cognitive processing in distinct working environments. During cognitive tasks, an increase in the fronto-central N2 component as well as evoked theta activity can be shown, both indices of enhanced cognitive control. The posterior P3 is reduced during physical tasks (sorting of boxes), probably reflecting the more continuous nature of this task. The data are discussed within a model of dopaminergic modulation of blink activity that involves both task specific aspects like executive control and modulating influences of motivation or fatigue.

We measured EEG and heart rate variability (HRV) before and during autogenic meditation. Fourteen subjects participated in the study. Heart coherence scores were significantly increased during meditation compared to the baseline. We found near significant decrease in high beta absolute power, increase in alpha relative power and significant increases in lower (alpha) and higher (above beta) band coherence during 3 min epochs of heart coherent meditation compared to 3 min epochs of heart non-coherence at baseline. The coherence and relative power increase in alpha band and absolute power decrease in high beta band could reflect relaxation state during the heart coherent meditation. The coherence increase in the higher (above beta) band could reflect cortico-cortical local integration and thereby affect cognitive reorganization, simultaneously with relaxation. Further research is still needed for a confirmation of heart coherence as a simple window for the meditative state.

Twelve VaD patients and twelve age-matched controls participated in the study. EEG signal was recorded when subjects were performing a visual oddball task. Information flow was analyzed between 9 electrodes in frontal, central, and parietal lobes using short-window Directed Transfer Function (sDTF). VaD patients presented a significant decline in the information flow from parietal to frontal and central lobes, compared with the healthy elderly. This decline mainly occurred in delta, theta, and lower alpha bands, from about 200 ms to 300 ms after target stimulus onset. The findings indicated an impaired parietal-to-frontal and parietal-to-central connectivity in VaD patients, which may be one reason for the cognitive deficits in VaD patients.

Etomidate activates epileptic high frequency oscillations	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Activation; Etomidate; Presurgical workup; High frequency oscillations	INTRAOPERATIVE ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FOCAL EPILEPSY; 80-500 HZ; BRAIN; EEG; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; CONSEQUENCES; VARIANCE	Objective: The short acting anesthetic etomidate has been shown to provoke epileptic spikes and rarely seizures. Influence of etomidate on the occurrence of epileptic HFO (high frequency oscillations) however is unknown. An HFO inducing effect of etomidate would allow further validation of the substance as a provocation measure in presurgical evaluation as well as provide insights into the common mechanisms of HFO, spike and seizure generation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed EEG data from four patients who underwent etomidate activation during invasive video-EEG monitoring with subdural strip electrodes. Spikes were manually selected in raw data, HFO in band pass filtered data (80-250 Hz). Rate and spatial distribution of HFO and spikes in three segments were compared: immediately after etomidate administration, as well as during slow wave sleep and while awake. Results: Rates of HFO and spikes increased significantly after etomidate administration: Overall average rates of spikes were 9.7/min during sleep, 10/min while awake and 61.4/min after etomidate. Average HFO rates were 9.5/min during sleep, 8.3/min while awake and 24.4/min after etomidate (p < 0.001, non-parametric ANOVA). Spatial distributions of HFO and spikes after administration of etomidate were consistent with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and area of resection when available (SOZ: two patients; resection: one patient; no information: one patient). Except for spurious events, no additional HFO and spike foci were seen with activation. Conclusions: Etomidate administration activates spikes and HFO. Spatial distributions do not extend beyond electrodes showing spikes and HFO without Etomidate and seem consistent with the epileptic network. Significance: Etomidate activation is a safe procedure to provoke not only epileptic spikes but also HFO, which were shown to have a high specificity for the SOZ.

Two-class classification was conducted to predict subsequently remembered vs. forgotten trials based on subjects' responses in the recognition phase. The overall accuracy across 18 subjects was 59.6% by combining pre- and during-stimulus information. The single-trial classification analysis provides a dimensionality reduction method to project the high-dimensional EEG data onto a discriminative space. These projections revealed novel findings in the pre- and during-stimulus periods related to levels of encoding. It was observed that the pre-stimulus information (specifically oscillatory activity between 25 and 35 Hz)-300 to 0 ms before stimulus presentation and during-stimulus alpha (7-12 Hz) information between 1000 and 1400 ms after stimulus onset distinguished between recollection and familiarity while the during-stimulus alpha information and temporal information between 400 and 800 ms after stimulus onset mapped these two states to similar values.

Investigations of the underlying neural mechanisms are limited to post-stimulus effects of this sound-induced illusory flash. We investigated whether touch modulates the visual evoked potential in a similar vein, and also looked at pre-stimulus activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded over occipital and parieto-occipital areas of 12 observers. We compared bimodal EEG to its unimocial constituents (i.e., the difference waves) and found significant positive deflections around 110 ms and 200 ms and negative deflections around 330 ms and 390 ms from stimulus onset. These results are similar to those reported for the sound-induced illusion, albeit somewhat later. Furthermore, comparison of the EEG activity between those trials in which the illusion was perceived and those in which it was absent revealed that the phase of pre-stimulus alpha was linked to perceiving the illusion or not. We conclude that touch can modulate activity in the visual cortex and that similar neural mechanisms underlie perception of the sound- and touch-induced illusory flash and that the phase of the alpha wave at the moment of presentation that affects perception.

Anticipatory preparation for an upcoming task switch is a hallmark of top-down intentional control. Meanwhile, asymmetries in performance and voluntary choice when switching between tasks differing in relative strength reveal the effects of between-task competition, reflected in a surprising bias against switching to an easier task. Here, we assessed the impact of this bias on EEG markers of intentional control during preparation for an upcoming task switch. The results revealed strong and varied effects of between-task competition on EEG markers of global task preparationua frontal contingent negative variation (CNV), a posterior slow positive wave, and oscillatory activity in the alpha band (812 Hz) over posterior scalp sites. In contrast, we observed no between-task differences in motor-specific task preparation, as indexed by the lateralized readiness potential and by motor-related amplitude asymmetries in the mu (913 Hz) and beta (1826 Hz) frequency bands. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that between-task competition directly influences the formation of top-down intentions, not only their expression in overt behavior. Specifically, this influence occurs at the level of global task intention rather than the preparation of specific actions.

Brain Activity During Resting State in Relation to Academic Performance Evidence of Neural Efficiency	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; academic performance; coherence; neural efficiency	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EEG COHERENCE; DEFAULT-MODE; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; INTELLIGENCE; DISSOCIATION; CHILDREN	EEG coherence has been widely used to investigate brain activity and learning. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between resting-state EEG coherence and academic performance. The present study investigated this relationship with 140 healthy, normal participants. EEG was recorded during resting periods, with eyes open for 3 min, and the recordings were analyzed for 64 electrode positions in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-25 Hz) frequency bands. Coherence, defined as the spectral cross-correlation between two signals normalized by their power spectra, was calculated. Short-and long-range intrahemispheric coherence within each hemisphere and interhemispheric coherence across the left and right hemispheres were then computed and compared for each of the theta, alpha, and beta bands. The results showed that academic performance, as measured by grade point average (GPA), was negatively correlated with short-range intrahemispheric alpha and beta coherences in both hemispheres and with interhemispheric alpha and beta coherences in the temporal cortical regions. Therefore, better academic performers demonstrated more decoupling of brain areas when resting with eyes open. This is consistent with a model that relates decreased coherence to neural efficiency.

On Separability of A-Phases during the Cyclic Alternating Pattern	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				A statistical analysis of the separability of EEG A-phases, with respect to basal activity, is presented in this study. A-phases are short central events that build up the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) during sleep. The CAP is a brain phenomenon which is thought to be related to the construction, destruction and instability of sleep stages dynamics. From the EEG signals, segments obtained around the onset and offset of the A-phases were used to evaluate the separability between A-phases and basal sleep stage oscillations. In addition, a classifier was trained to separate the different A-phase types (A1, A2 and A3). Temporal, energy and complexity measures were used as descriptors for the classifier. The results show a percentage of separation between onset and preceding basal oscillations higher than 85 % for all A-phases types. For Offset separation from following baseline, the accuracy is higher than 80 % but specificity is around 75%. Concerning to A-phase type separation, A1-phase and A3-phase are well separated with accuracy higher than 80, while A1 and A2-phases show a separation lower than 50%. These results encourage the design of automatic classifiers for Onset detection and for separating among A-phases type A1 and A3. On the other hand, the A-phase Offsets present a smooth transition towards the basal sleep stage oscillations, and A2-phases are very similar to A1-phases, suggesting that a high uncertainty may exist during CAP annotation.

Subsequent memory effect in intracranial and scalp EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; iEEG; Free-recall; Memory	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; THETA; ALPHA; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Successful memory encoding is marked by increases in 30-100 Hz gamma-band activity in a broad network of brain regions. Activity in the 3-8 Hz theta band has also been shown to modulate memory encoding, but this effect has been found to vary in direction across studies. Because of the diversity in memory tasks, and in recording and data-analytic methods, our knowledge of the theta frequency modulations remains limited. The difference in the directionality of these theta effects could arise from a distinction between global cortical and deeper subcortical effects. To address this issue, we examined the spectral correlates of successful memory encoding using intracranial EEG recordings in neurosurgical patients and scalp EEG recordings in healthy controls. We found significant theta (3-8 Hz) power modulations (both increases and decreases) and high gamma (44-100 Hz) power increases in both samples of participants. These results suggest that (1) there are two separate theta mechanisms supporting memory success, a broad theta decrease present across both the cortex and hippocampus as well as a theta power increase in the frontal cortex, (2) scalp EEG is capable of resolving high frequency gamma activity, and (3) iEEG theta effects are likely not the result of epileptic pathology.

Design: Data from two double- blind, placebo- controlled randomized cross- over design studies were analyzed. Setting: Polysomnographic recordings in sleep laboratory at 490 m and at moderate altitudes in the Swiss Alps: 1630 or 1860 m and 2590 m. Patients: Study 1: 39 OSAS patients. Study 2: 41 OSAS patients. Interventions: Study 1: OSAS patients withdrawn from treatment with CPAP. Study 2: OSAS patients treated with autoCPAP. Treatment with acetazolamide (500-750 mg) or placebo at moderate altitudes. Measurements and Results: An evening dose of 500 mg acetazolamide reduced slow-wave activity (SWA; approximately 10%) and increased spindle activity (approximately 10%) during non-REM sleep. In addition, alpha activity during wake after lights out was increased. An evening dose of 250 mg did not affect these cortical oscillations. Discontinuation of CPAP therapy revealed a reduction in SWA (5-10%) and increase in beta activity (approximately 25%). \Conclusions: The higher evening dose of 500 mg acetazolamide showed the `` spectral fingerprint'' of Benzodiazepines, while 250 mg acetazolamide had no impact on cortical oscillations. However, both doses had beneficial effects on oxygen saturation and sleep quality.

The Effects of a Single Session of Upper Alpha Neurofeedback for Cognitive Enhancement: A Sham-Controlled Study	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Individual upper alpha; Cognitive performance; Single session; Sham feedback	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; POWER	The minimization of the non-specific factors of neurofeedback (NF) is an important aspect to further advance in the understanding of the effects of these types of procedures. This paper investigates the NF effects of a single session (25 min) of individual upper alpha enhancement following a sham-controlled experimental design (19 healthy participants). We measured immediate effects after the training and 1-day lasting EEG effects (eyes closed resting state and task-related activity), as well as the event-locked EEG effects during the execution of a mental rotation task. These metrics were computed in trained (upper alpha) and non-trained EEG parameters (lower alpha and lower beta). Several cognitive functions were assessed such as working memory and mental rotation abilities. The NF group showed increased upper alpha power after training in task-related activity (not significantly sustained 1 day after) and higher pre-stimulus power during the mental rotation task. Both groups improved cognitive performance, with a more prominent improvement for the NF group, however a single session seems to be insufficient to yield significant differences between groups. A higher number of training sessions seems necessary to achieve long-lasting effects on the electrophysiology and to enhance the behavioral effects.

Material/ methods: Auditory event-related low frequency oscillations (delta delta -[2, 4] Hz; theta theta -[4.5, 7] Hz; alpha a -[7.5, 12] Hz) were examined during an auditory discrimination motor task (lowfrequency tone -right hand movement, high-frequency tone -left hand movement) between two groups with mean age 26.3 and 55 years. Results: The amplitudes of the phase-locked delta, theta and a activity were more pronounced with a progressive increase in age during the sensory processing, independent of tone type. The difference between the groups with respect to scalp distribution was tone-independent for delta/ theta oscillations, but not for the alpha activity. Age-related and tone-dependent changes in a band activity were focused at frontal and sensorimotor areas. Neither functional brain specificity was observed for the amplitudes of the lowfrequency (delta, theta, alpha) oscillations during the cognitive processing, which diminished with increasing age. Conclusion: The cognitive brain oscillatory specificity diminished with increasing age. (C)2014 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp.z o.o. All rights reserved.

To be in synchrony with the environment, the brain must deal not only with differences in the speed of light and sound but also with its computational and neural transmission delays. Here, we asked whether the brain could actively compensate for temporal delays by changing its processing time. Specifically, can changes in neural timing or in the phase of neural oscillation index perceived timing? For this, a lag-adaptation paradigm was used to manipulate participants' perceived audiovisual (AV) simultaneity of events while they were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Desynchronized AV stimuli were presented rhythmically to elicit a robust 1 Hz frequency-tagging of auditory and visual cortical responses. As participants' perception of AV simultaneity shifted, systematic changes in the phase of entrained neural oscillations were observed. This suggests that neural entrainment is not a passive response and that the entrained neural oscillation shifts in time. Crucially, our results indicate that shifts in neural timing in auditory cortices linearly map participants' perceived AV simultaneity. To our knowledge, these results provide the first mechanistic evidence for active neural compensation in the encoding of sensory event timing in support of the emergence of time awareness.

However, these features may be contaminated by spontaneous EEG or noise. It is still a challenge to detect it with a high accuracy, especially at a short time window (TW) which is a tradeoff between accuracy and speed for brain computer interface. In this paper, we propose to combine both power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) feature extraction. One against one radial basis function support vector machine (OAO RBF SVM) is applied to classification in order to improve the short time window classification accuracy. Moreover, we present a signal quality evaluation method that cancels the decision of the RBF SVM when signal quality is low and prone to be misclassified. Making no decision could reduce the cost of making a wrong decision. Results show that our proposed method outperforms the standard CCA method in classifying SSVEP responses of five frequencies across four subjects. Approximately above 80 % SSVEP classification accuracy is achieved when time window is above three seconds.

SSSRs have been used both clinically and in basic neurophysiological investigation of auditory function. SSSR data acquisition typically involves thousands of presentations of each stimulus type, sometimes in two polarities, with acquisition times often exceeding an hour per subject. Here, we present a novel approach to reduce the data acquisition times significantly. Methods: Because the sources of the SSSR are deep compared to the primary noise sources, namely background spontaneous cortical activity, the SSSR varies more smoothly over the scalp than the noise. We exploit this property and extract SSSRs efficiently, using multichannel recordings and an eigendecomposition of the complex cross-channel spectral density matrix. Results: Our proposed method yields SNR improvement exceeding a factor of 3 compared to traditional single-channel methods. Conclusions: It is possible to reduce data acquisition times for SSSRs significantly with our approach. Significance: The proposed method allows SSSRs to be recorded for several stimulus conditions within a single session and also makes it possible to acquire both SSSRs and cortical EEG responses without increasing the session length.

This study aims to explore the feasibility of mixed frequency and phase coding in building a high-speed SSVEP speller with a computer monitor. A frequency and phase approximation approach was developed to eliminate the limitation of the number of targets caused by the monitor refresh rate, resulting in a speller comprising 32 flickers specified by eight frequencies (8-15 Hz with a 1Hz interval) and four phases (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees). A multi-channel approach incorporating Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and SSVEP training data was proposed for target identification. In a simulated online experiment, at a spelling rate of 40 characters per minute, the system obtained an averaged information transfer rate (ITR) of 166.91 bits/min across 13 subjects with a maximum individual ITR of 192.26 bits/min, the highest ITR ever reported in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs. The results of this study demonstrate great potential of a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI in real-life applications.

However due to their lack of contributions, compared to other frequency ranges, to decode effector kinematics especially in ECoG signals, spatiotemporal dynamics of ECoG b oscillations has not been examined despite the larger areas that ECoG arrays can cover than standard intracortical multielectrode arrays. Here, we used ECoG grids to cover large areas of motor cortex and some somatosensory cortex in monkeys while they performed an unconstrained reaching and a lever pulling task at two force levels in three dimensional space. We showed that under the pulling task b power increased around movement onset. However, the b phases were locked around the movement onsets and their peak timings were spatially aligned in the motor cortex. These results may indicate that spatiotemporal dynamics of b oscillation conveys task relevant information and that ECoG arrays will be useful to study larger spatiotemporal patterns in the motor cortex, or any cortical areas in general, than intracortical multielectrode arrays.

Dynamic modulation of shared sensory and motor cortical rhythms mediates speech and non-speech discrimination performance	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						sensorimotor rhythms; independent component analysis; event-related spectral perturbations; intertrial; coherence; speech perception	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; PREMOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; BRAIN DYNAMICS; PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; COMPREHENSION; SYSTEM	Oscillatory models of speech processing have proposed that rhythmic cortical oscillations in sensory and motor regions modulate speech sound processing from the bottom-up via phase reset at low frequencies (3-10 Hz) and from the top-down via the disinhibition of alpha/beta rhythms (8-30 Hz). To investigate how the proposed rhythms mediate perceptual performance, electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded while participants passively listened to or actively identified speech and tone-sweeps in a two-force choice in noise discrimination task presented at high and low signal-to-noise ratios. EEG data were decomposed using independent component analysis and clustered across participants using principle component methods in EEG LAB. Left and right hemisphere sensorimotor and posterior temporal lobe clusters were identified. Alpha and beta suppression was associated with active tasks only in sensonmotor and temporal clusters. In posterior temporal clusters, increases in phase reset at low frequencies were driven by the quality of bottom-up acoustic information for speech and non-speech stimuli, whereas phase reset in sensonmotor clusters was associated with top-down active task demands. A comparison of correct discrimination trials to those identified at chance showed an earlier performance related effect for the left sensorimotor cluster relative to the left-temporal lobe cluster during the syllable discrimination task only. The right sensorimotor cluster was associated with performance related differences for tone sweep stimuli only. Findings are consistent with internal model accounts suggesting that early efferent sensorimotor models transmitted along alpha and beta channels reflect a release from inhibition related to active attention to auditory discrimination. Results are discussed in the broader context of dynamic, oscillatory models of cognition proposing that top-down internally generated states interact with bottom-up sensory processing to enhance task performance.

While it has been proposed that alpha band (8-13 Hz) activity serves to route information to downstream regions by inhibiting neuronal processing in task-irrelevant regions, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we investigate how neuronal oscillations detected by electroencephalography in visual areas during working memory encoding serve to gate information reflected in the simultaneously recorded blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging in downstream ventral regions. We used a paradigm in which 16 participants were presented with faces and landscapes in the right and left hemifields; one hemifield was attended and the other unattended. We observed that decreased alpha power contralateral to the attended object predicted the BOLD signal representing the attended object in ventral object-selective regions. Furthermore, increased alpha power ipsilateral to the attended object predicted a decrease in the BOLD signal representing the unattended object. We also found that the BOLD signal in the dorsal attention network inversely correlated with visual alpha power. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that oscillations in the alpha band are implicated in the gating of information from the visual cortex to the ventral stream, as reflected in the representationally specific BOLD signal. This link of sensory alpha to downstream activity provides a neurophysiological substrate for the mechanism of selective attention during stimulus processing, which not only boosts the attended information but also suppresses distraction. Although previous studies have shown a relation between the BOLD signal from the dorsal attention network and the alpha band at rest, we demonstrate such a relation during a visuospatial task, indicating that the dorsal attention network exercises top-down control of visual alpha activity.

Correction of the resulting gradient artifact (GA) generally involves low-pass filtering to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, followed by subtraction of a GA template produced by averaging over repeats of the artifact waveforms. This average artifact subtraction (AAS) process relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artifact voltages and on invariance of the artifact waveform over repeated image acquisitions. Saturation of the amplifiers and changes in subject position can leave unwanted residual GA after AAS. Previous modeling work suggested that modifying the lead layout and the exit position of the cable bundle on the EEG cap could reduce the GA amplitude. Here, we used simulations and experiments to evaluate the effect of modifying the lead paths on the magnitude of the GA and on the residual artifact after AAS. The modeling work showed that for wire paths following great circles, the smallest overall GA occurs when the leads converge at electrode Cz. The performance of this new cap design was compared with a standard cap in experiments on a spherical agar phantom and human subjects. Using gradient pulses applied separately along the three Cartesian axes, we found that the GA due to the foot-head gradient was most significantly reduced relative to a standard cap for the phantom, whereas the anterior-posterior GA was most attenuated for human subjects. In addition, there was an overall 37% reduction in the RMS GA amplitude produced by a standard EPI sequence when comparing the two caps on the phantom. In contrast, the subjects showed an 11% increase in the average RMS of the GA. This work shows that the optimal design reduces the GA on a spherical phantom however; these gains are not translated to human subjects, probably due to the differences in geometry.

Yet, how sensorimotor integration supports these functions is unclear due to a lack of data examining the timing of activity from these regions. Beta (similar to 20 Hz) and alpha (similar to 10 Hz) spectral power within the EEG mu rhythm are considered indices of motor and somatosensory activity, respectively. In the current study, perception conditions required discrimination (same/different) of syllables pairs (/ba/ and /da/) in quiet and noisy conditions. Production conditions required covert and overt syllable productions and overt word production. Independent component analysis was performed on EEG data obtained during these conditions to (1) identify clusters of components common to all conditions and (2) examine real-time event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) within alpha and beta bands. 17 and 15 out of 20 participants produced left and right mu-components, respectively, localized to precentral gyri. Discrimination conditions were characterized by significant (pFDR < 0.05) early alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) prior to and during stimulus presentation and later alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) following stimulus offset. Beta ERD began early and gained strength across time. Differences were found between quiet and noisy discrimination conditions. Both overt syllable and word productions yielded similar alpha/beta ERD that began prior to production and was strongest during muscle activity. Findings during covert production were weaker than during overt production. One explanation for these findings is that mu-beta ERD indexes early predictive coding (e.g., internal modeling) and/or overt and covert aftentional/motor processes. mu-alpha ERS may index inhibitory input to the premotor cortex from sensory regions prior to and during discrimination, while mu-alpha ERD may index sensory feedback during speech rehearsal and production.

Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is a measure allowing to trace neuronal reorganizations which are functionally relevant for motor recovery. Contrary to previous studies which were performed only in chronic stage, we measured CMC in patients with stroke at both acute and chronic stroke stages. Methods: For the detection of CMC we used multichannel EEG and EMG recordings along with an optimization algorithm for the detection of corticomuscular interactions. Results: In acute stroke, the CMC amplitude was larger on the unaffected side compared to the affected side and also larger compared to the unaffected side in the chronic period. Additionally, CMC peak frequencies on both sides decreased in the acute compared to the chronic period and to control subjects. In chronic stage, there were no inter-hemispheric or group differences in CMC amplitude or frequency. Conclusions: The changes in CMC parameters in acute stroke could result from a temporary decrease in inhibition, which normalizes in the course of recovery. As all patients showed very good motor recovery, the modulation of CMC amplitude and frequency over time might thus reflect the process of motor recovery.

J	Cheaha, D; Sawangjaroen, K; Kumarnsit, E				Cheaha, Dania; Sawangjaroen, Kitja; Kumarnsit, Ekkasit			Characterization of fluoxetine effects on ethanol withdrawal-induced cortical hyperexcitability by EEG spectral power in rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ethanol withdrawal; Gamma oscillation; Fluoxetine; Serotonin; EEG	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; RECEPTOR FUNCTION; UP-REGULATION; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; ALCOHOL-WITHDRAWAL; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; NITRIC-OXIDE; SEROTONIN; DOPAMINE	Antidepressants have been used for treatment of ethanol withdrawal symptoms mainly in observational studies. However, cortical frequency oscillation of ethanol withdrawal treatment with antidepressants remained to be elucidated. This study aimed to identify surrogate biomarkers that represent intact biological or ethanol withdrawal processes and response to pretreatment with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with quantitative methods. Adult male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes over the frontal and parietal cortices were rendered dependent on ethanol via modified liquid diet (MLD) containing ethanol. Then, ethanol-containing MLD was replaced with isocaloric ethanol-free MLD to induce ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Locomotor activity, sleep-wakefulness and spectral frequencies of electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern during ethanol-withdrawal period were analyzed. One-way ANOVA confirmed significant increases in locomotor activity and time spent in awake state and decreases time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM-sleep during ethanol withdrawal period. Fast Fourier Transformation also revealed predominant increases in gamma spectral powers within both the frontal and parietal cortices during ethanol withdrawal. However, these changes, except sleep-wake disturbances, were significantly attenuated by fluoxetine pretreatment (10 mg/kg). The present study supports the hypothesis that serotonergic hypofunction may underlie most of ethanol withdrawal symptoms and proposes that electroencephalographic patterns are valid biomarkers for ethanol withdrawal evaluation and treatment.

Our present study aimed at using empirical methods to indirectly estimate skull conductivity; the model parameter that is known to significantly affect the behavior of newborn scalp EEG and cause it to be markedly different from that of an adult. To this end, we used 64 channel EEG recordings to study the spatial specificity of scalp EEG by assessing the spatial decays in focal transients using both amplitudes and between-Channels linear correlations. The findings showed that these amplitudes and correlations decay within few centimeters from the reference channel/electrode, and that the nature of the decay is independent of the scalp area. This decay in newborn infants was found to be approximately three times faster than the corresponding decay in adult EEG analyzed from a set of 256 channel recordings. We then generated realistic head models using both finite and boundary element methods along with a manually segmented magnetic resonance images to study the spatial decays of scalp potentials produced by single dipole in the cortex. By comparing the spatial decays due to real and simulated EEG for different skull conductivities (from 0.003 to 03 S/m), we showed that a close match between the empirical and simulated decays was obtained when the selected skull conductivity for newborn was around 0.06-0.2 S/m. This is over an order of magnitude higher than the currently used values in adult head modeling. The results also showed that the neonatal scalp EEG is less smeared than that of an adult and this characteristic is the same across the entire scalp, including the fontanel region. These results indicate that a focal cortical activity is generally only registered by electrodes within few centimeters from the source. Hence, the conventional 10 to 20 channel neonatal EEG acquisition systems give a significantly spatially under sampled scalp EEG and may, consequently, give distorted pictures of focal brain activities. Such spatial specificity can only be reconciled by appreciating the anatomy of the neonatal head, especially the still unossified skull structure that needs to be modeled with higher conductivities than conventionally used in the adults.

Because only a small fraction can be encoded in long-term memory, the brain must rely on powerful mechanisms to filter out irrelevant information. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying the gating of information into long-term memory, we employed a paradigm where the encoding was directed by a "Remember" or a "No-Remember" cue. We found that posterior alpha activity increased prior to the "No-Remember" stimuli, whereas it decreased prior to the "Remember" stimuli. The sources were localized in the parietal cortex included in the dorsal attention network. Subjects with a larger cue-modulation of the alpha activity had better memory for the to-be-remembered items. Interestingly, alpha activity reflecting successful inhibition following the "No-Remember" cue was observed in the frontal midline structures suggesting preparatory inhibition was mediated by anterior parts of the dorsal attention network. During the presentation of the memory items, there was more gamma activity for the "Remember" compared to the "No-Remember" items in the same regions. Importantly, the anticipatory alpha power during cue predicted the gamma power during item. Our findings suggest that top-down controlled alpha activity reflects attentional inhibition of sensory processing in the dorsal attention network, which then finally gates information to long-term memory. This gating is achieved by inhibiting the processing of visual information reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band. In conclusion, the functional architecture revealed by region-specific changes in the alpha activity reflects attentional modulation which has consequences for long-term memory encoding.

Here, we assessed performance on the Trail Making Test and resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings from 53 healthy adults (18-89 years old) to investigate associations between age-dependent changes in spontaneous oscillatory activity and cognitive performance. Results show that healthy aging is accompanied by a marked and linear decrease of resting-state activity in the slow frequency range (0.5-6.5 Hz). The effects of slow wave power on cognitive performance were expressed as interactions with age: For older (>54 years), but not younger participants, enhanced delta and theta power in temporal and central regions was positively associated with perceptual speed and executive functioning. Consistent with previous work, these findings substantiate further the important role of slow wave oscillations in neurocognitive function during healthy aging.

They are used in order to give a global idea of cortical structures for given sensory cognitive functions. In the last decades, the analysis of brain oscillations gained high importance for the correlation of brain functions. Moreover, the use of the spectral connectivity provides information on dynamic connectivity between various structures. Beside this, according to (Luria, 1966), brain responses have dynamic features and structural localization is almost impossible. According to these uses, brain functions are very difficult to localize and need joint analysis of oscillation and event related coherences. In the present report, a model called "CLAIR" is described to extend and possibly to replace the concept of the Brodmann areas. To design a perfect functioning CLAIR model requires years; however, the beginning step is provided in the present report.

The objective of this study is to find components that might be related to phoneme representation in the brain and to discriminate EEG responses for each speech sound on a trial basis. Approach. We used multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and common spatial pattern for feature extraction. We chose three vowel stimuli, /a/, /i/ and /u/, based on previous findings, such that the brain can detect change in formant frequency (F2) of vowels. EEG activity was recorded from seven native Korean speakers at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. We applied MEMD over EEG channels to extract speech-related brain signal sources, and looked for the intrinsic mode functions which were dominant in the alpha bands. After the MEMD procedure, we applied the common spatial pattern algorithm for enhancing the classification performance, and used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classifier. Main results. The brain responses to the three vowels could be classified as one of the learned phonemes on a single-trial basis with our approach. Significance. The results of our study show that brain responses to vowels can be classified for single trials using MEMD and LDA. This approach may not only become a useful tool for the brain-computer interface but it could also be used for discriminating the neural correlates of categorical speech perception.

We recorded resting-state EEG and collected psychometric data to obtain information about how chronic tinnitus experience affects the cognitive and emotional state of TI. The study was meant to disentangle TI with high distress from those who suffer less from persistent tinnitus based on both neurophysiological and behavioral data. A principal component analysis of psychometric data uncovers two distinct independent dimensions characterizing the individual tinnitus experience. These independent states are distress and presence, the latter is described as the perceived intensity of sound experience that increases with tinnitus duration devoid of any considerable emotional burden. Neuroplastic changes correlate with the two independent components. TI with high distress display increased EEG activity in the oscillatory range around 25 Hz (upper beta-band) that agglomerates over frontal recording sites. TI with high presence show enhanced EEG signal strength in the delta-, alpha-, and lower gamma-bands (30-40Hz) over bilateral temporal and left perisylvian electrodes. Based on these differential patterns we suggest that the two dimensions, namely, distress and presence, should be considered as independent dimensions of chronic subjective tinnitus.

The time course of EEG event-related alpha synchronisation (ERS) and desynchronisation was investigated in two groups (eight skilled and ten less skilled) of right-handed cricket batsmen whilst viewing projected video footage of a bowler delivering a randomised series of 24 deliveries repeated 10 times (total of 240 deliveries). Ball release from the bowler's hand was used as the corresponding reaction cue. Participants were instructed to press one of two buttons on a keypad to identify in-swingers or out-swingers. T3 ERS was significantly greater in skilled batsmen from approximately 1500 ms prior to ball release, but differences reduced close to ball release, reaching nonsignificance by 250 ms. There was no significant difference in T4 between the groups. This study uniquely highlights that the relative timing of the T3 high-alpha ERS state appears to differentiate batting skill groups in a reactive task.

Serotonin modulates fast ripple activity in rats with spontaneous recurrent seizures	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Epileptogenesis; Fast ripple; High frequency oscillation; Hippocampus; Pilocarpine model; Temporal lobe epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; NETWORK ACTIVITY; ANIMAL-MODEL; HIPPOCAMPUS; EPILEPTOGENESIS; MECHANISMS	Fast ripples (FRs) are pathological high frequency oscillations that occur in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as in animal models of epilepsy in which seizures are induced with kainic acid or pilocarpine. These oscillations have been considered potential biomarkers of epileptogenesis in the hippocampus. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests an important role of serotonin in epilepsy and an increased frequency of FRs have been demonstrated in slow wave sleep, a period during which serotonin levels decrease. Accordingly, we investigated the role of serotonin in FRs modulation by evaluating the effects of citalopram, a blocker of serotonin uptake, on the occurrence of spontaneous FRs measured through intracranial bilateral EEG recording of the hippocampus of rats with spontaneous recurrent seizures. In addition, we recorded the mean number of oscillation cycles per FRs event and the average frequency (Hz) before, during and after citalopram administration in order to determine whether increases in extra-synaptic serotonin levels modulate FRs. The elevation of serotonin levels induced by citalopram (4.78 +/- 1.69 nM) reduced the occurrence of spontaneous FRs (57%), the mean number of oscillation cycles per FRs event (34%) and the average frequency of FRs (33%). These findings suggest an important modulatory effect of serotonin on FRs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Theta oscillations orchestrate medial temporal lobe and neocortex in remembering autobiographical memories	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; Theta rhythm; Magnetoencephalography; Medial temporal lobe-neocortical synchrony	FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; PHASE-LOCKING; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; RETRIEVAL; EEG	Remembering autobiographical events can be associated with detailed visual imagery. The medial temporal lobe (MTL), precuneus and prefrontal cortex are held to jointly enable such vivid retrieval, but how these regions are orchestrated remains unclear. An influential prediction from animal physiology is that neural oscillations in theta frequency may be important. In this experiment, participants prospectively collected audio recordings describing personal autobiographical episodes or semantic knowledge over 2 to 7 months. These were replayed as memory retrieval cues while recording brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). We identified a peak of theta power within a left MTL region of interest during both autobiographical and General Semantic retrieval. This mu, region was selectively phase-synchronized with theta oscillations in precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex, and this synchrony was higher during autobiographical as compared to General Semantic knowledge retrieval. Higher synchrony also predicted more detailed visual imagery during retrieval. Thus, theta phase-synchrony orchestrates in humans the MTL with a distributed neocortical memory network when vividly remembering autobiographical experiences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The top-down mechanism considered is macrocolumnar EEG firings in neocortex, as described by a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), developed as a magnetic vector potential A. The bottom-up process considered is Ca2+ waves prominent in synaptic and extracellular processes that are considered to greatly influence neuronal firings. Here, the complimentary effects are considered, i.e., the influence of A on Ca2+ momentum, p. The canonical momentum of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, II = p+qA (SI units), is calculated, where the charge of Ca2+ is q = -2e, e is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. Calculations demonstrate that macroscopic EEG A can be quite influential on the momentum p of Ca2+ ions, in both classical and quantum mechanics. Molecular scales of Ca2+ wave dynamics are coupled with A fields developed at macroscopic regional scales measured by coherent neuronal firing activity measured by scalp EEG. The project has three main aspects: fitting A models to EEG data as reported here, building tripartite models to develop A models, and studying long coherence times of Ca2+ waves in the presence of A due to coherent neuronal firings measured by scalp EEG. The SMNI model supports a mechanism wherein the p+qA interaction at tripartite synapses, via a dynamic centering mechanism (DCM) to control background synaptic activity, acts to maintain short-term memory (STM) during states of selective attention.

One suggestion is that oscillatory coherence mediates inter-regional communication, implicating theta phase and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in mnemonic function across species. To examine this hypothesis, we used non-invasive whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) as participants retrieved the location of objects encountered within a virtual environment. We demonstrate that, when participants are cued with the image of an object whose location they must subsequently navigate to, there is a significant increase in 4-8 Hz theta power in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the phase of this oscillation is coupled both with ongoing theta phase in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and perceptually induced 65-85 Hz gamma amplitude in medial parietal cortex. These results suggest that theta phase coupling between mPFC and MTL and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling between mPFC and neocortical regions may play a role in human spatial memory retrieval.

Since several cognitive processes are involved in the generation of creative ideas, different EEG correlates may result as a function of time. In this study we addressed this crucial point. Forty-five participants worked on the "Alternative Uses Task" while the EEG was recorded and changes in task-related power (relative to rest) in the upper-frequency band (10-12 Hz) for three isochronous time intervals of the idea generation period were determined. Alpha power changes during idea generation followed a characteristic time course: we found a general increase of alpha power at the beginning of idea generation that was followed by a decrease and finally by a re-increase of alpha prior to responding that was most pronounced at parietal and temporal sites of the right hemisphere. Additionally, the production of more original ideas was accompanied by increasing hemispheric asymmetry (more alpha in the right than left hemisphere) with increasing duration of the idea generation period. The observed time course of brain activity may reflect the progression of different but well-known stages in the idea generation process: that is the initial retrieval of common and old ideas followed by the actual generation of novel and more creative ideas by overcoming typical responses through processes of mental simulation and imagination.

Characterization of the autonomic system during the cyclic alternating pattern of sleep	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc		Heart Rate Variability; CAP; Sleep; NFLE; EEG	ACTIVATION; AROUSAL	Evaluation of the RR variability was carried out during the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) in sleep. CAP is a central phenomenon formed by short events called A-phases that break basal electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations of the sleep stages. A-phases are classified in three types (A1, A2 and A3) based on the EEG desynchronization during A-phase. However, the relation of A-phases with other systems, such as cardiovascular system, is unclear and a deep analysis is required. For the study, six patients with Nocturnal Front Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE) and other six healthy controls patients underwent whole night polysomnographic recordings with CAP and hypnogram annotations. Amplitude reduction and time delay of the RR intervals minimum with respect to A-phases onset were computed. In addition, the same process was computed over randomly chosen RR interval segments during the NREM sleep for further comparison. The results suggest that the onset of the A-phases is correlated with a significative increase of the heart rate that peaks at around 4s after the Aphase onset, independently of the A-phase subtype.

In-vitro studies suggest that the neurochemical basis of gamma-band oscillatory activity is based on interactions between excitatory (i.e. glutamate) and inhibitory (i.e. GABA) neurotransmitter concentrations. However, the nature of the relationship between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and changes in gamma band activity in humans remains undetermined. Here, we examine the links between dynamic glutamate concentration and the formation of functional gamma-band oscillatory networks. Using concurrently acquired event-related magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electroencephalography, during a repetition-priming paradigm, we demonstrate an interaction between stimulus type (object vs. abstract pictures) and repetition in evoked gamma-band oscillatory activity, and find that glutamate levels within the lateral occipital cortex, differ in response to these distinct stimulus categories. Importantly, we show that dynamic glutamate levels are related to the amplitude of stimulus evoked gamma-band (but not to beta, alpha or theta or ERP) activity. These results highlight the specific connection between excitatory neurotransmitter concentration and amplitude of oscillatory response, providing a novel insight into the relationship between the neurochemical and neurophysiological processes underlying cognition.

The Decoupled Mind: Mind-wandering Disrupts Cortical Phase-locking to Perceptual Events	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; SYNCHRONY; ATTENTION; THOUGHT; BRAIN; TASK; PERFORMANCE	The mind flows in a stream of consciousness, which often neglects immediate sensory input in favor of focusing on intrinsic, self-generated thoughts or images. Although considerable research has documented the disruptive influences of task-unrelated thought for perceptual processing and task performance, the brain dynamics associated with these phenomena are not well understood. Here we investigate the possibility, suggested by several convergent lines of research, that task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the trial-to-trial phase consistency of the oscillatory neural signal in response to perceptual input. Using an experience sampling paradigm coupled with continuous high-density electroencephalography, we observed that task-unrelated thought was associated with a reduction of the P1 ERP, replicating prior observations that mind-wandering is accompanied by a reduction of the brain-evoked response to sensory input. Time-frequency analysis of the oscillatory neural response revealed a decrease in theta-band cortical phase-locking, which peaked over parietal scalp regions. Furthermore, we observed that task-unrelated thought impacted the oscillatory mode of the brain during the initiation of a task-relevant action, such that more cortical processing was required to meet task demands. Together, these findings document that the attenuation of perceptual processing that occurs during task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the temporal fidelity with which the brain responds to a stimulus and suggest that increased neural processing may be required to recouple attention to a task. More generally, these data provide novel confirmatory evidence for the mechanisms through which attentional states facilitate the neural processing of sensory input.

We also investigated whether psychological attachment styles shape human cortical activity differently in these two settings. The results indicate that social context matters and that participants' cortical activity is moderated by the anxious, but not avoidant attachment style. We found enhanced alpha, beta and theta band activity in the T rather than the A resting-state condition, which was more pronounced in posterior brain regions. We further found a positive correlation between anxious attachment style and enhanced alpha power in the T vs. A condition over frontal and parietal scalp regions. There was no significant correlation between the absolute powers registered in the other two frequency bands and the participants' anxious attachment style.	[Verbeke, Willem J. M.

The participants in both groups watched a first- person shooter (FPS) gameplay from Halo Reach during five minutes. None of the participants was notified as to the content of the video before watching it. Only the VGPs showed an increased right intrahemispheric prefrontal- parietal correlation (F4- P4) in the gamma band (31- 50 Hz) during the observation of the gameplay. These data provide novel information on the participation of the gamma band during motor imagery for an action- type video game. It is probable that this higher degree of coupling between the prefrontal and parietal cortices could represent a characteristic pattern of brain functionality in VGPs as they make motor representations.

While the extent to which these two processes rely on common neural mechanisms remains debated, recent studies of sensory working memory (WM) have identified an oscillatory signature of continuous magnitude information, in terms of quantitative modulations of prefrontal upper beta activity (20-30 Hz). Here, we examined how such parametric oscillatoryWMactivity may also reflect the abstract assessment of the numerosity of discrete items. We recorded EEG while participants (n = 24) processed the number of stimulus pulses presented in the visual, auditory, or tactile modality, under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Behavioral response profiles showed varying degrees of analog estimation and of discretized quantification in the different modalities. During sustained processing in WM, the amplitude of posterior alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) reflected the increased memory load associated with maintaining larger sets of discrete items. In contrast, earlier numerosity-dependent modulations of right prefrontal upper beta (20-30 Hz) specifically reflected the extent to which numerosity was assessed by analog estimation, both between and within presentation modalities. Together, the analog approximation-but not the discretized representation-of numerosity information exhibited a parametric oscillatory signature akin to a continuous sensory magnitude. The results suggest dissociable oscillatory mechanisms of abstract numerosity integration, at a supramodal processing stage in human WM.

The transition period is in the order of 20-30 ms, and standard signal processing methodologies such as Fourier analysis are inadequate for proper characterization of the phenomenon. Hilbert transform-based (HT) analysis has shown great promise in detecting rapid changes in the synchronization properties of the cortex measured by high-density EEG arrays. Therefore, HT is a primary candidate of operational principles of brain computer interfaces (BCI). Hilbert transform over narrow frequency bands has been applied successfully to develop robust BCI methods, but optimal filtering is a primary concern. Here we systematically evaluate the performance of FIR filters over various narrow frequency bands before applying Hilbert transforms. The conclusions are illustrated using rabbit ECoG data. The results are applicable for the analysis of scalp EEG data for advanced BCI devices.

The first objective of this paper was to observe the brain activity of Asian athletes before the match. Second, the paper aimed to study the anxiety symptom showing on the brain via QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) maps. The anxiety level for Asian athletes can be classified using the index of brain topographic map (Absolute power) relative to the normative database used for analysis. Firstly, Asian athletes have to complete revised competitive state anxiety inventory-2 (CSAI-2R) questionnaires. The Asian athletes then were recorded for their QEEG twice in 2 weeks (1 time/week) before competing in a match. In the competition, the anxiety symptom and performance of Asian athletes are observed and their feedbacks from the coach are asked. Lastly, the anxiety level is classified from results of QEEG maps, the CSAI-2R questionnaires and condition in the competition. The result of anxiety level showed that the quantity of alpha frequency band in posterior head region (parietal and occipital lobes) is less than the normal condition in term of brain topographic map. In addition, amateur Asian athletes have lower quantity of alpha frequency band than the experienced Asian athletes when the time of competition becomes nearer. Furthermore, the focal area that showed in brain connectivity (Coherence) was presented in lower interactions between position to position in the frontal lobe.

Design: Comparative study for sleep behavior, sleep architecture, electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 protein expression in juvenile rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA), sodium salt, or saline in utero. Setting: N/A. Participants: Juvenile (postnatal day 32) male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Interventions: In utero exposure to either saline or 400 mg/kg VPA administered intraperitoneally to the dams on gestational day 12.5. On postnatal days 22-24, all rats were implanted with transmitters to record EEG and electromyogram (EMG) activity. Measurements and Results: During the light phase, when nocturnal animals are typically quiescent, the VPA-exposed animals spent significantly more time in wake (similar to 35 min) and significantly less time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (similar to 26 min) compared to the saline controls. Furthermore, spectral analysis of the EEG reveled that VPA-exposed animals exhibited increased high-frequency activity during wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced theta power across all vigilance states. Interestingly, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system, which modulates the induction and maintenance of sleep states, was also disrupted, with reduced levels of both GAD 65 and GAD67 in the cortical tissue of VPA-exposed animals compared to saline controls. Conclusions: To date, the current animal models of ASD have been underutilized in the investigation of associated sleep disturbances. The VPA animal model recapitulates aspects of sleep disruptions reported clinically, providing a tool to investigate cellular and molecular dysregulation contributing to sleep disruptions in ASD.

Blockade of the metabotropic glutamate (mGluR2) modulates arousal through vigilance states transitions: Evidence from sleep-wake EEG in rodents	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						mGluR2; Arousal behavior; Theta/gamma oscillations; States transition; Rodents; Psychiatric disorders	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MOOD DISORDERS; REM-SLEEP; ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; THETA RHYTHM; RAT; DEPRESSION; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; MICE	Accumulating data continue to support the therapeutic potential of glutamate metabotropic (mGluR2) receptors for treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Glutamate neurotransmission is an integral component of sleep wake mechanisms, which have translational relevance to assess on-target activity of drugs. Here, we investigated the influence of mGluR2 inactivation upon sleep-wake electroencephalogram (EEG) in rodents. Rats were administered with vehicle, the specific mGluR2 antagonist LY341495 (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) or negative allosteric modulator (NAM) Ro-4491533 (2.5, 10 and 40 mg/kg) at lights onset. mGluR2 (-/-) mice were used to confirm the selectivity of functional response. Both LY341495 and Ro-4491533 induced an immediate and endured desynchronized cortical activity during 3-6h associated with enhanced theta and gamma oscillations and depressed slow oscillations during sleep. The arousal-promoting effect is consistent with the marked lengthening of sleep onset latency, an increased number of state transitions from light sleep to waking and the gradual increase in homeostatic compensatory sleep. The arousal response to mGluR2 blockade was not accompanied by sharp rebound hypersomnolence as found with the classical psycho-stimulant amphetamine. mGluR2 (-/-) mice and their WT littermates exhibited similar sleep wake phenotype, while Ro-4491533 (40 mg/kg) enhanced waking associated with increased locomotor activity and body temperature in WT but not in mGluR2 (-/-) mice, which confirm the role of mGluR2 inactivation in the arousal response. Our results lend support for a role of mGluR2 blockade in promoting cortical arousal associated with theta/gamma oscillations as well as high thresholds transitions from sleep to waking.

J	Nakatani, C; Raffone, A; van Leeuwen, C				Nakatani, Chie; Raffone, Antonino; van Leeuwen, Cees			Efficiency of Conscious Access Improves with Coupling of Slow and Fast Neural Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; TERM-MEMORY TASK; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CIRCULAR ANALYSIS; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE; MODEL; EEG; NEUROSCIENCE	Global workspace access is considered as a critical factor for the ability to report a visual target. A plausible candidate mechanism for global workspace access is coupling of slow and fast brain activity. We studied coupling in EEG data using cross-frequency phase-amplitude modulation measurement between delta/theta phases and beta/gamma amplitudes from two experimental sessions, held on different days, of a typical attentional blink (AB) task, implying conscious access to targets. As the AB effect improved with practice between sessions, theta-gamma and theta-beta coupling increased generically. Most importantly, practice effects observed in delta-gamma and delta-beta couplings were specific to performance on the AB task. In particular, delta-gamma coupling showed the largest increase in cases of correct target detection in the most challenging AB conditions. All these practice effects were observed in the right temporal region. Given that the delta band is the main frequency of the P3 ERP, which is a marker of global workspace activity for conscious access, and because the gamma band is involved in visual object processing, the current results substantiate the role of phase-amplitude modulation in conscious access to visual target representations.

Fronto-parietal network oscillations reveal relationship between working memory capacity and cognitive control	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						working memory capacity; cognitive control; fronto-parietal; EEG; theta; connectivity	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; CONTROL MECHANISMS; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; GOAL-NEGLECT; TASK SET; CONFLICT; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Executive-attention theory proposes a close relationship between working memory capacity (WMC) and cognitive control abilities. However, conflicting results are documented in the literature, with some studies reporting that individual variations in WMC predict differences in cognitive control and trial-to-trial control adjustments (operationalized as the size of the congruency effect and congruency sequence effects, respectively), while others report no WMC-related differences. We hypothesized that brain network dynamics might be a more sensitive measure of WMC-related differences in cognitive control abilities. Thus, in the present study, we measured human EEG during the Simon task to characterize WMC-related differences in the neural dynamics of conflict processing and adaptation to conflict. Although high- and low-WMC individuals did not differ behaviorally, there were substantial WMC-related differences in theta (4-8 Hz) and delta (1-3 Hz) connectivity in fronto-parietal networks. Group differences in local theta and delta power were relatively less pronounced. These results suggest that the relationship between WMC and cognitive control abilities is more strongly reflected in large-scale oscillatory network dynamics than in spatially localized activity or in behavioral task performance.

Selective Modulation of Interhemispheric Functional Connectivity by HD-tACS Shapes Perception	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NEURONAL INTERACTIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG-DATA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION	Oscillatory neuronal synchronization between cortical areas has been suggested to constitute a flexible mechanism to coordinate information flow in the human cerebral cortex. However, it remains unclear whether synchronized neuronal activity merely represents an epiphenomenon or whether it is causally involved in the selective gating of information. Here, we combined bilateral high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) at 40 Hz with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to study immediate electrophysiological effects during the selective entrainment of oscillatory gamma-band signatures. We found that interhemispheric functional connectivity was modulated in a predictable, phase-specific way: In-phase stimulation enhanced synchronization, anti-phase stimulation impaired functional coupling. Perceptual correlates of these connectivity changes were found in an ambiguous motion task, which strongly support the functional relevance of long-range neuronal coupling. Additionally, our results revealed a decrease in oscillatory alpha power in response to the entrainment of gamma band signatures. This finding provides causal evidence for the antagonistic role of alpha and gamma oscillations in the parieto-occipital cortex and confirms that the observed gamma band modulations were physiological in nature. Our results demonstrate that synchronized cortical network activity across several spatiotemporal scales is essential for conscious perception and cognition.

Interhemispheric functional interactions between the subthalamic nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						basal ganglia; coherence; deep brain stimulation; levodopa; neural oscillations	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; FIELD POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; BETA OSCILLATIONS; CONNECTIVITY; DBS; RECORDINGS; MODULATION; STN; EEG	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by widespread neural interactions in cortico-basal-ganglia networks primarily in beta oscillations (approx. 10-30Hz), as suggested by previous findings of levodopa-modulated interhemispheric coherence between the bilateral subthalamic nuclei (STN) in local field potential recordings (LFPs). However, due to confounding effects of volume conduction the existence of genuine' interhemispheric subcortical coherence remains an open question. To address this issue we utilized the imaginary part of coherency (iCOH) which, in contrast to the standard coherence, is not susceptible to volume conduction. LFPs were recorded from eight patients with PD during wakeful rest before and after levodopa administration. We demonstrated genuine coherence between the bilateral STN in both 10-20 and 21-30Hz oscillations, as revealed by a non-zero iCOH. Crucially, increased iCOH in 10-20Hz oscillations positively correlated with the worsening of motor symptoms in the OFF medication condition across patients, which was not the case for standard coherence. Furthermore, across patients iCOH was increased after levodopa administration in 21-30Hz oscillations. These results suggest a functional distinction between low and high beta oscillations in STN-LFP in line with previous studies. Furthermore, the observed functional coupling between the bilateral STN might contribute to the understanding of bilateral effects of unilateral deep brain stimulation. In conclusion, the present results imply a significant contribution of time-delayed neural interactions to interhemispheric coherence, and the clinical relevance of long-distance neural interactions between bilateral STN for motor symptoms in PD.

Applying EEG phase synchronization measures to non-linearly coupled neural mass models	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Phase synchronization; Neural mass models; Phase locking value; Phase lag index; Imaginary coherence	BRAIN ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAG INDEX; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS; MEG; ORGANIZATION	Background: Recent neuroimaging analyses aim to understand how information is integrated across brain regions that have traditionally been studied in isolation; however, detecting functional connectivity networks in experimental EEG recordings is a non-trivial task. New method: We use neural mass models to simulate 10-s trials with coupling between 1-3 and 5-8 s and compare how well three phase-based connectivity measures recover this connectivity pattern across a set of experimentally relevant conditions: variable oscillation frequency and power spectrum, feed forward connections with or without feedback, and simulated signals with and without volume conduction. Results: Overall, the results highlight successful detection of the onset and offset of significant synchronizations for a majority of the 28 simulated configurations; however, the tested phase measures sometimes differ in their sensitivity and specificity to the underlying connectivity. Comparison with existing methods: Prior work has shown that these phase measures perform well on signals generated by a computational model of coupled oscillators. In this work we extend previous studies by exploring the performance of these measures on a different class of computational models, and we compare the methods on 28 variations that capture a set of experimentally relevant conditions. Conclusions: Our results underscore that no single phase synchronization measure is substantially better than all others, and experimental investigations will likely benefit from combining a set of measures together that are chosen based on both the experimental question of interest, the signal to noise ratio in the EEG data, and the approach used for statistical significance.

J	Morenko, A				Morenko, Alevtyna			Brain processes during the perception of sensory signals in men with high and low output alpha-frequencies	ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						Electricalactivity; Individual; alpha-frequency; EEG; Sensory signals; Power; Coherence		Background: Human functional capabilities largely depend upon genetic qualities of person's nervous system. The registration of the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) is among the physiological technigues allowing making a direct estimation of specific features of the nervous system, in particular, the human brain activity. Purpose: The study is devoted to the investigation of brain processes in men with high and low levels of individual alpha-frequency determined in a quiescent state during the perception of sensory signals. Methods: A test group consisting of 104 right-hand healthy men from the ages of 19 to 21 was divided into two groups according to the magnitude of their individual alpha-frequency (IAF) median - groups with high (n = 53, IA >= 10,04 Hz) and low (n = 51, IAF <= 10,03 Hz) levels of IAF. The power and coherence of the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex as well as inter group differences were evaluated in a quiescent state and during the perception of sensory signals by Subjects. Results: A localized power increase of the EEG alpha 1-waves are registered in frontal areas, beta 1, beta 2-oscillations - in the anterior cortex, gamma-activity - around the scalp and its decrease is present in the posterior temporal, parietal and occipital cortex leads, especially in the alpha- and beta- frequency spectrum during the perception of sensory signals in men with a high IAF. The generalized depression of the alpha-, a- and beta- activity of the cortex is fixed in individuals with a low IAF while the expression of gamma-waves is more local. The generalized increase of data in EEG coherence fluctuations throughout the frequency spectrum of the EEG in the cortex is set in all Subjects. The dextrocerebral preponderance is observable in posterior structures of the Subjects' right hemisphere. A localized decrease of the coherence concerning.-, alpha 1-, alpha 3-, beta- and gamma- oscillations are traced in the frontal and anterior temporal areas of the left hemisphere. Conclusion: We are of the opinion that the establishment of such common factors in the studied groups is an important step towards the release of the clear prognostic criteria for the functionality of men in the sensory area according to the congenital features of brain function.

Although pain is known to disrupt synchrony in thalamocortical oscillations, evidence in the literature is controversial. Thalamocortical coherence has been reported to be increased in patients with neurogenic pain but decreased in a rat model of central pain. Moreover, theta (4 to 8 Hz) oscillations in primary somatosensory (S1) cortex are speculated to predict pain in humans. To date, the link between pain and network oscillations in animal models has been understudied. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that pain disrupts thalamocortical coherence and S1 theta power in two rat models of pain. We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) waveforms over S1 and local field potentials (LFP) within ventral posterolateral thalamus in freely behaving rats under spontaneous (stimulus-independent) pain conditions. Rats received intradermal capsaicin injection (Cap) in the hindpaw, followed hours later by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve lasting several days. Our results show that pain decreases coherence between LFP and ECoG waveforms in the 2- to 30-Hz range, and increases ECoG power in the theta range. These changes are short-lasting after Cap and longer-lasting after CCI.

This study reports the case of a 37-year-old man with refractory generalised epilepsy, who recently reported an increase in frequency of nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures, not responding to treatment. During the nocturnal video study, in non-rapid eye movements sleep, we recorded 106 generalised sharp- and polyspike-waves lasting for 3 to 7 seconds, associated with bradycardia and asystole, without behavioural changes and without increase in deltoid muscle activity. The asystole had a duration of between 3 and 8 seconds. In one case, a 7 second asystole was associated with a tonic-clonic generalised seizure. A 24-hour electrocardiographic study revealed a bradycardia and a Wenckebach atrioventricular block. Heart rate analysis at the time of the interictal epileptic discharges revealed an abrupt increase in the RR interval, occurring simultaneously with the onset of interictal epileptic discharges and followed by a return to values below baseline value. A cardiac pacemaker was installed with a reduction of asystole length during the interictal epileptic discharges. Our findings indicate, for the first time, the role of interictal generalised discharges in EEG-related asystole and bradycardia. These data support the hypothesis that some patients with epilepsy may be predisposed to disturbances of the autonomic cardiac system.

However, most associated evidence derives from post hoc correlations between brain dynamics and behavior. Although a few recent studies demonstrate rhythms in behavior, it remains largely unknown whether behavioral performances manifest spectrotemporal dynamics in a neurophysiologically relevant manner (e. g., the temporal modulation of ongoing oscillations, the cross-frequency coupling). To investigate the issue, we examined fine spectrotemporal dynamics of behavioral time courses in a large sample of human participants (n=49), by taking a high time-resolved psychophysical measurement in a precuing attentional task. We observed compelling dynamic oscillatory patterns directly in behavior. First, typical attentional effects are demonstrated in low-pass (0-2 Hz) filtered time courses of behavioral responses. Second, an uninformative peripheral cue elicits recurring alpha-band (8-20 Hz) pulses in behavioral performances, and the elicited alpha pulses for cued and uncued conditions are in a temporally alternating relationship. Finally, ongoing alpha-band power is phase locked to ongoing theta-bands (3-5 Hz) in behavioral time courses. Our findings constitute manifestation of oscillations at physiologically relevant rhythms and power-phase locking, as widely observed in neurophysiological recordings, in behavior. The findings suggest that behavioral performance actually consists of rich dynamic information and may reflect underlying neuronal oscillatory substrates. Our data also speak to a neural mechanism for item attention based on successive cycles (theta) of a sequential attentional sampling (alpha) process.

The effect of action experience on sensorimotor EEG rhythms during action observation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Alpha; Beta; EEG; Sensorimotor; Experience; Action processing	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR IMAGERY; MU-RHYTHM; ALPHA; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; MODULATION; MOVEMENTS	A recent line of inquiry has examined how an observer's experience with action changes the neural processing of similar actions when they are subsequently observed. The current study used electro-encephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that giving participants different types and amounts of experience with specific objects would lead to differential patterns of sensorimotor rhythms during the observation of similar actions on those objects. While EEG was recorded, three groups of participants (n=20 in each group; mean age=22.0 years, SD=2.7) watched video clips of an actor reaching, grasping, and lifting two objects. Participants then received information about differences in weight between the two objects. One group gained this information through extended sensorimotor experience with the objects, a second group received much briefer sensorimotor experience with the objects, and the third group read written information about the objects' weights. Participants then viewed the action sequences again. For participants who had sensorimotor experience with the objects, the EEG response to viewing the actions was differentially sensitive to the anticipated weight of the objects. We conclude that this sensitivity was based on the participant's prior sensorimotor experience with the objects. The participants who only received semantic information about the objects showed no such effects. The primary conclusion is that even brief experience with actions affects sensorimotor cortex activity during the subsequent observation of similar actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS			English	Article						auditory steady-state response; ASSR; menstrual cycle; estrogen; time-frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; EEG; BRAIN; WOMEN; MODULATION; ESTRADIOL; STEROIDS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STIMULATION	Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are widely applied to test brain's ability to follow external stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders. It is known that ASSRs are related to GABAergic transmission. Female sex steroid homones - both estrogens and progesterone affect functioning of GABAergic system. However, it is not known how these hormones affect brain's ability to entrain. This study was designed to test the ability to synchronize to 40 Hz stimulation during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-eight healthy females participated in the research during one of the menstrual cycle phases: (1) early follicular; (2) late follicular; (3) and mid-luteal. Auditory 40 Hz trains of 500 ms were delivered binaurally and EEG was recorded. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. Additionally, alpha power of the baseline period was calculated. Parameters of ASSR were increasing in a linear manner with increasing levels of 17 beta-estradiol and largest estimates of ASSR parameters were obtained in the late follicular phase, smallest in the mid-luteal phase. Alpha power values were highest in the late follicular phase and lowest in the mid-luteal phase, pointing to lower arousal level in the late follicular phase. We speculate that increased 40 Hz ASSRs during mid-cycle might be related to the level of general arousal and specific GABA-mediated changes during the menstrual cycle. The results suggest that the ability to entrain to 40 Hz stimulation depends on the phase of menstrual cycle. This should be taken into account, particularly when ASSRs are used in clinical practice, comparing patients and healthy subjects.

This paper describes the impact of an auditory secondary task on drivers' mental states during a primary driving task. N=20 participants performed the test procedure in a car following task with repeated forced braking on a non-public test track. Performance measures (provoked reaction time to brake lights) and brain activity (EEG alpha spindles) were analyzed to describe distracted drivers. Further, a classification approach was used to investigate whether alpha spindles can predict drivers' mental states. Results show that reaction times and alpha spindle rate increased with time-on-task. Moreover, brake reaction times and alpha spindle rate were significantly higher while driving with auditory secondary task opposed to driving only. In single-trial classification, a combination of spindle parameters yielded a median classification error of about 8% in discriminating the distracted from the alert driving. Reduced driving performance (i.e., prolonged brake reaction times) during increased cognitive load is assumed to be indicated by EEG alpha spindles, enabling the quantification of driver distraction in experiments on public roads without verbally assessing the drivers' mental states.

Low-voltage activated (LVA) Ca(V)3 T-type Ca2+ channels have been related to thalamic rebound burst firing and to generation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. High-voltage activated (HVA) Ca(V)1 L-type Ca2+ channels, on the opposite, favor the tonic mode of action associated with higher levels of vigilance. However, the role of the HVA Non-L-type Ca(V)2.3 Ca2+ channels, which are predominantly expressed in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN), still remains unclear. Recently, Ca(V)2.3(-/-) mice were reported to exhibit altered spike-wave discharge (SWD)/absence seizure susceptibility supported by the observation that Ca(V)2.3 mediated Ca2+ influx into RTN neurons can trigger small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channel type 2 (SK2) currents capable of maintaining thalamic burst activity. Based on these studies we investigated the role of Ca(V)2.3 R-type Ca2+ channels in rodent sleep. Methods: The role of Ca(V)2.3 Ca2+ channels was analyzed in Ca(V)2.3(-/-) mice and controls in both spontaneous and artificial urethane-induced sleep, using implantable video-EEG radiotelemetry. Data were analyzed for alterations in sleep architecture using sleep staging software and time-frequency analysis. Results: Ca(V)2.3 deficient mice exhibited reduced wake duration and increased slow-wave sleep (SWS). Whereas mean sleep stage durations remained unchanged, the total number of SWS epochs was increased in Ca(V)2.3(-/-) mice. Additional changes were observed for sleep stage transitions and EEG amplitudes. Furthermore, urethane-induced SWS mimicked spontaneous sleep results obtained from Ca(V)2.3 deficient mice. Quantitative Real-time PCR did not reveal changes in thalamic Ca(V)3 T-type Ca2+ channel expression. The detailed mechanisms of SWS increase in Ca(V)2.3(-/-) mice remain to be determined. Conclusions: Low-voltage activated Ca(V)2.3 R-type Ca2+ channels in the thalamocortical loop and extra-thalamocortical circuitries substantially regulate rodent sleep architecture thus representing a novel potential target for pharmacological treatment of sleep disorders in the future.

Frontal midline theta oscillations are a cortical correlate of cognitive control influencing behavioral outcomes including reaction times. Reaction time variability (RTV) is consistently increased in ADHD and is known to share genetic effects with the disorder. The etiological relationship between the cognitive control system, RTV, and ADHD is unknown. In a sample of twins selected for ADHD and matched control subjects, we aimed to quantify the strength of the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental relationships between event-related midline theta oscillations, RTV, and ADHD. Methods: Our sample included 134 participants aged 12 to 15 years: 67 twin pairs (34 monozygotic; 33 dizygotic) with concordance or discordance for ADHD symptomatology assessed at 8, 10, and 12 years of age. Our main outcome measures were frontal midline theta activity, derived from both channel and source decomposed electroencephalographic data, and behavioral performance on a responsechoice arrow flanker task known to elicit theta activity. Results: Variability in stimulus event-related theta phase from frontal midline cortex is strongly related to both RTV and ADHD, both phenotypically and genetically. Conclusions: This is the first finding to confirm the genetic link between the frontal midline cognitive control system and ADHD and the first to identify a genetically related neurophysiological marker of RTV in ADHD. Variability in the timing of the theta signal in ADHD may be part of a dysfunctional brain network that impairs regulation of task-relevant responses in the disorder.

Mark			Detection of high-frequency oscillations by hybrid depth electrodes in standard clinical intracranial EEG recordings	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; clinical neurophysiology; mesial temporal lobe; ripples; fast ripples		High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a novel marker for epileptogenic tissue, spurring tremendous research interest into the characterization of these transient events. A wealth of continuously recorded intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) data is currently available from patients undergoing invasive monitoring for the surgical treatment of epilepsy. In contrast to data recorded on research-customized recording systems, data from clinical acquisition systems remain an underutilized resource for HFO detection in most centers. The effective and reliable use of this clinically obtained data would be an important advance in the ongoing study of HFOs and their relationship to ictogenesis. The diagnostic utility of HFOs ultimately will be limited by the ability of clinicians to detect these brief, sporadic, and low amplitude events in an electrically noisy clinical environment. Indeed, one of the most significant factors limiting the use of such clinical recordings for research purposes is their low signal to noise ratio, especially in the higher frequency bands. In order to investigate the presence of HFOs in clinical data, we first obtained continuous intracranial recordings in a typical clinical environment using a commercially available, commonly utilized data acquisition system and "off the shelf" hybrid macro-/micro-depth electrodes. These data were then inspected for the presence of HFOs using semi-automated methods and expert manual review. With targeted removal of noise frequency content, HFOs were detected on both macro- and micro-contacts, and preferentially localized to seizure onset zones. HFOs detected by the offline, semi-automated method were also validated in the clinical viewer, demonstrating that (1) this clinical system allows for the visualization of HFOs and (2) with effective signal processing, clinical recordings can yield valuable information for offline analysis.

To date, detailed information on influencing factors of HR changes related to seizures by multiple linear regression analysis remains scarce. Methods: Using video-electroencephalograph (EEG)-electrocardiograph (ECG) recordings, we retrospectively assessed the changes in the HR of 81 patients during a total of 181 seizures, including 27 simple partial seizures (SPS), 110 complex partial seizures (CPS) and 44 complex partial seizures secondarily generalized (CPS-G). The epileptogenic focus and the seizure type, age, gender, and sleep/wakefulness state of each patient were evaluated during and after the seizure onset. The HR changes were evaluated in the stage of epilepsy as time varies. Results: Of the 181 seizures from 81 patients with ictal ECGs, 152 seizures (83.98%) from 74 patients were accompanied by ictal tachycardia (IT). And only 1 patient was accompanied by ictal bradycardia (IB). A patient has both IT and IB. We observed that HR difference was independently correlated with side, type and sleep/wakefulness state. In this analysis, the HR changes were related to the side, gender, seizure type, and sleep/wakefulness state. Right focus, male, sleep, and CPS-G showed more significant increases than that were observed in left, female, wakefulness, SPS and CPS. HR increases rapidly within 10 seconds before seizure onset and ictus, and typically slows to normal with seizure offset. Conclusion: CPS-G, sleep and right focus led to higher ictal HR. The HR in the stage of epilepsy has regularly been observed to change to become time-varying. The risk factors of ictal HR need to be controlled along with sleep, CPS-G and right focus. Our study first explains that the HR in seizures has a regular evolution varying with time. Our study might help to further clarify the basic mechanisms of interactions between heart and brain, making seizure detection and closed-loop systems a possible therapeutic alternative in refractory patients.

Teams that interact using text-based collaboration technology typically exchange more information than when they perform the same task face-to-face, but past results suggest that team members are more likely to ignore information they receive from others. Collaboration technology makes unique demands on individual cognitive resources that may change how individual team members process information in virtual settings compared to face-to-face settings. This experiment uses electroencephalography, electrodermal activity, and facial electromyography to investigate how team members process information received from text-based collaboration during a team decision-making process. Our findings show that information that challenges an individual's prediscussion decision preference is processed similarly to irrelevant information, while information that supports an individual's prediscussion decision preference is processed more thoroughly. Our results present neurological evidence for the underlying processes of confirmation bias in information processing during online team discussions.

Previous work suggests that neural oscillations in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) play an important role in inhibiting incoming distracting information during attention and selective encoding tasks. However, whether alpha power is involved in inhibiting no-longer-relevant content or in representing relevant WM content is still debated. To clarify this issue, we manipulated the amount of relevant/irrelevant information using a task requiring spatial WM updating while measuring neural oscillatory activity via EEG and localized current sources across the scalp using a surface Laplacian transform. An initial memory set of two, four, or six spatial locations was to be memorized over a delay until an updating cue was presented indicating that only one or three locations remained relevant for a subsequent recognition test. Alpha amplitude varied with memory maintenance and updating demands among a cluster of left frontocentral electrodes. Greater postcue alpha power was associated with the high relevant load conditions (six and four dots cued to reduce to three relevant) relative to the lower load conditions (four and two dots reduced to one). Across subjects, this difference in alpha power was correlated with condition differences in performance accuracy. In contrast, no significant effects of irrelevant load were observed. These findings demonstrate that, during WM updating, alpha power reflects maintenance of relevant memory contents rather than suppression of no-longer-relevant memory traces.

We know little, however, about the ability to report on one's attentional focus. The degree and direction of somatosensory attention can, however, be readily discerned through suppression of alpha band frequencies in EEG/MEG produced by the somatosensow cortex. Such top-down attentional modulations of cortical excitability have been shown to result in better discrimination performance and decreased response times. In this study we asked whether the degree of attentional focus is also accessible for subjective report, and whether such evaluations correspond to the amount of somatosensory alpha activity. In response to auditory cues participants maintained somatosensow attention to either their left or right hand for intervals varying randomly between 5 and 32 seconds, while their brain activity was recorded with MEG. Trials were terminated by a probe sound, to which they reported their level of attention on the cued hand right before probe-onset. Using a beamformer approach, we quantified the alpha activity in left and right somatosensory regions, one second before the probe. Alpha activity from contra- and ipsilateral somatosensory cortices for high versus low attention trials were compared. As predicted, the contralateral somatosensory alpha depression correlated with higher reported attentional focus. Finally, alpha activity two to three seconds before the probe-onset was correlated with attentional focus. We conclude that somatosensory attention is indeed accessible to metacognitive awareness.

Here, we recorded MEG signals and seek for percept related modulations of alpha, beta and gamma band activity during a perceptual form/motion integration task. Participants reported their bound or unbound perception of ambiguously moving displays that could either be seen as a whole square-like shape moving along a Lissajou's figure (bound percept) or as pairs of bars oscillating independently along cardinal axes (unbound percept). We found that beta (15-25 Hz), but not gamma (55-85 Hz) oscillations, index perceptual states at the individual and group level. The gamma band activity found in the occipital lobe, although significantly higher during visual stimulation than during base line, is similar in all perceptual states. Similarly, decreased alpha activity during visual stimulation is not different for the different percepts. Trial-by-trial classification of perceptual reports based on beta band oscillations was significant in most observers, further supporting the view that modulation of beta power reliably index perceptual integration of form/motion stimuli, even at the individual level.

J	Thorne, JD; Debener, S				Thorne, Jeremy D.; Debener, Stefan			Look now and hear what's coming: On the functional role of cross-modal phase reset	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Review							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY TASK-PERFORMANCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; REACTION-TIME; ALPHA-PHASE; EEG PHASE	In our multisensory environment our sensory systems are continuously receiving information that is often interrelated and must be integrated. Recent work in animals and humans has demonstrated that input to one sensory modality can reset the phase of ambient cortical oscillatory activity in another. The periodic fluctuations in neuronal excitability reflected in these oscillations can thereby be aligned to forthcoming anticipated sensory input. In the auditory domain, the example par excellence is speech, because of its inherently rhythmic structure. In contrast, fluctuations of oscillatory phase in the visual system are argued to reflect periodic sampling of the environment. Thus rhythmic structure is imposed on, rather than extracted from, the visual sensory input. Given this distinction, we suggest that cross-modal phase reset subserves separate functions in the auditory and visual systems. We propose a modality-dependent role for cross-modal input in temporal prediction whereby an auditory event signals the visual system to look now, but a visual event signals the auditory system that it needs to hear what is coming.

Detection of the synchronous activation of neurons can be used to determine the well-being of the connectivity in the human brain networks. Well-connected highly synchronous activity can be measured by MEG, EEG, fMRI, and PET and then analyzed with several types of mathematical algorithms. Coherence is one mathematical method that can detect how well 2 or more sensors or brain regions have similar oscillatory activity with each other. Phase synchrony can be used to determine if these oscillatory activities are in sync or out of sync with each other. Correlation is used to determine the strength of interaction between two locations or signals. Granger causality can be used to determine the direction of the information flow in the neuronal brain networks. Statistical analysis can be performed on the connectivity results to verify evidence of normal or abnormal network activity in a patient.

Here, we administered a free recall test to 114 neurosurgical patients and used intracranial theta and high-frequency activity (HFA) to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity underlying spontaneous episodic retrieval. We found that retrieval evolved in three electrophysiological stages composed of: (1) early theta oscillations in the right temporal cortex, (2) increased HFA in the left hemisphere including the medial temporal lobe (MTL), left inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the ventrolateral temporal cortex, and (3) motor/language activation during vocalization of the retrieved item. Of these responses, increased HFA in the left MTL predicted recall performance. These results suggest that spontaneous recall of verbal episodic memories involves a spatiotemporal pattern of spectral changes across the brain; however, high-frequency activity in the left MTL represents a final common pathway of episodic retrieval.

Afferent inputs to cortical fast-spiking interneurons organize pyramidal cell network oscillations at high-gamma frequencies (60-200 Hz)	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cortex; high-gamma; model; oscillations	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES; MOTOR CORTEX; NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; NEOCORTEX	High-gamma activity, ranging in frequency between similar to 60 Hz and 200 Hz, has been observed in local field potential, electrocorticography, EEG and magnetoencephalography signals during cortical activation, in a variety of functional brain systems. The origin of these signals is yet unknown. Using computational modeling, we show that a cortical network model receiving thalamic input generates high-gamma responses comparable to those observed in local field potential recorded in monkey somatosensory cortex during vibrotactile stimulation. These high-gamma oscillations appear to be mediated mostly by an excited population of inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons firing at high-gamma frequencies and pacing excitatory regular-spiking pyramidal cells, which fire at lower rates but in phase with the population rhythm. The physiological correlates of high-gamma activity, in this model of local cortical circuits, appear to be similar to those proposed for hippocampal ripples generated by subsets of interneurons that regulate the discharge of principal cells.

Neural Oscillations and Synchronization Differentially Support Evidence Accumulation in Perceptual and Value-Based Decision Making	NEURON			English	Article							DRIFT-DIFFUSION MODEL; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; TEMPORAL INTEGRATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; VALUE COMPUTATION; VISUAL FIXATIONS	Organisms make two types of decisions on a regular basis. Perceptual decisions are determined by objective states of the world (e. g., melons are bigger than apples), whereas value-based decisions are determined by subjective preferences (e. g., I prefer apples to melons). Theoretical accounts suggest that both types of choice involve neural computations accumulating evidence for the choice alternatives; however, little is known about the overlap or differences in the processes underlying perceptual versus value-based decisions. We analyzed EEG recordings during a paradigm where perceptualand value-based choices were based on identical stimuli. For both types of choice, evidence accumulation was evident in parietal gamma-frequency oscillations, whereas a similar frontal signal was unique for value-based decisions. Fronto-parietal synchronization of these signals predicted value-based choice accuracy. These findings uncover how decisions emerge from topographic- and frequency-specific oscillations that accumulate distinct aspects of evidence, with large-scale synchronization as a mechanism integrating these spatially distributed signals.

Detection of Fast Ripples Using Hidden Markov Model	2014 21TH IRANIAN CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (ICBME)			English	Proceedings Paper	21th Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering	NOV 26-28, 2014	Tehran, IRAN	IEEE		Fast Ripple; Interictal Epileptic Spike; HFO; HMM	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS	Studies show that High frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be used as a reliable biomarker of epileptogenic zone, thus many algorithms have been proposed to detect HFOs. Among the wide variety of HFOs, fast ripples (FRs) are important transient oscillations occurring in the frequency band ranging from 250 Hz to 600 Hz. The automatic detection of FRs can be degenerated by the presence of some "pulse-like" events (commonly, the component of interictal epileptic spikes) associated with an increase of the signal energy in the high frequency bands, exactly as in the case of real FRs. The goal of this study is to propose a new method for automatic detection of fast ripples by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This method can separate fast ripples from interictal epileptic spikes and background EEG by classifying each segment of signal in three classes. The sensitivity and specificity show this method is reliable to detect fast ripples and avoids false detections caused by sharp transient events often present in raw signals.

High frequency oscillations are associated with cognitive processing in human recognition memory	BRAIN			English	Article						high frequency oscillations; cognitive processing; memory; gamma oscillations; neural networks	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; LARGE-SCALE; SINGLE NEURONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN CORTEX; EEG; HIPPOCAMPAL	High frequency oscillations have been associated with focal epilepsy, but their role in human cognition is less clear. During intracranial recordings in patients undergoing seizure monitoring, Kucewicz et al. detect high gamma, ripple and fast ripple oscillations that are induced by image processing, and modulated by memory encoding and recall.High frequency oscillations are associated with normal brain function, but also increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers of the epileptogenic brain. Their role in human cognition has been predominantly studied in classical gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz), which reflect neuronal network coordination involved in attention, learning and memory. Invasive brain recordings in animals and humans demonstrate that physiological oscillations extend beyond the gamma frequency range, but their function in human cognitive processing has not been fully elucidated. Here we investigate high frequency oscillations spanning the high gamma (50-125 Hz), ripple (125-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) frequency bands using intracranial recordings from 12 patients (five males and seven females, age 21-63 years) during memory encoding and recall of a series of affectively charged images. Presentation of the images induced high frequency oscillations in all three studied bands within the primary visual, limbic and higher order cortical regions in a sequence consistent with the visual processing stream. These induced oscillations were detected on individual electrodes localized in the amygdala, hippocampus and specific neocortical areas, revealing discrete oscillations of characteristic frequency, duration and latency from image presentation. Memory encoding and recall significantly modulated the number of induced high gamma, ripple and fast ripple detections in the studied structures, which was greater in the primary sensory areas during the encoding (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.002) and in the higher-order cortical association areas during the recall (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.001) of memorized images. Furthermore, the induced high gamma, ripple and fast ripple responses discriminated the encoded and the affectively charged images. In summary, our results show that high frequency oscillations, spanning a wide range of frequencies, are associated with memory processing and generated along distributed cortical and limbic brain regions. These findings support an important role for fast network synchronization in human cognition and extend our understanding of normal physiological brain activity during memory processing.

Converging evidence from electrophysiological studies suggests a close link between WM processes and frontal theta (FT) activity (4-8 Hz). However, the effect of stress on WM-related FT activity has not been investigated yet. To shed light on this topic we acquired EEG data from 31 healthy male subjects who underwent a stressful and a neutral control condition. In both conditions, they performed an n-back WM task at two different difficulty levels. Our results showed that WM-related FT activity was decreased under stress. Behaviorally, we found performance impairments under stress in the difficult task condition that were related to FT decreases. Increased cortisol levels indicated a successful moderate stress induction. These findings indicate that FT is a potential neurobiological marker for intact PFC functioning during WM and further supports the recently made assumption that FTacts in the PFC to optimize performance.

In healthy subjects, the overnight decrease of the slope of slow waves in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep has been linked to brain recovery to regain optimal cognitive performance. Here, we investigated whether the electrophysiologic hallmark of CSWS, the spike waves during sleep, is related to an alteration in the overnight decrease of the slope, and if this alteration is linked to location and density of spike waves. Methods In a retrospective study, the slope of slow waves (0.5-2Hz) in the first hour and last hour of sleep (19 electroencephalography [EEG] electrodes) of 14 patients with CSWS (3.1-13.5years) was calculated. The spike wave "focus" was determined as the location of highest spike amplitude and the density of spike waves as spike wave index (SWI). Results There was no overnight change of the slope of slow waves in the "focus." Instead, in "nonfocal" regions, the slope decreased significantly. This difference in the overnight course resulted in a steeper slope in the "focus" compared to "nonfocal" electrodes during the last hour of sleep. Spike wave density was correlated with the impairment of the overnight slope decrease: The higher the SWI, the more hampered the slope decrease. Significance Location and density of spike waves are related to an alteration of the physiologic overnight decrease of the slow wave slope. This overnight decrease of the slope was shown to be closely related to the recovery function of sleep. Such recovery is necessary for optimal cognitive performance during wakefulness. Therefore we propose the impairment of this process by spike waves as a potential mechanism leading to neuropsychological deficits in CSWS.

Third order spectral analysis robust to mixing artifacts for mapping cross-frequency interactions in EEG/MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Cross-frequency interactions; Higher order spectral analysis; Bispectrum; Brain networks; Volume conduction	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG DATA; BRAIN; MEG; BISPECTRUM; COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS	We present a novel approach to the third order spectral analysis, commonly called bispectral analysis, of electro-encephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data for studying cross-frequency functional brain connectivity. The main obstacle in estimating functional connectivity from EEG and MEG measurements lies in the signals being a largely unknown mixture of the activities of the underlying brain sources. This often constitutes a severe confounder and heavily affects the detection of brain source interactions. To overcome this problem, we previously developed metrics based on the properties of the imaginary part of coherency. Here, we generalize these properties from the linear to the nonlinear case. Specifically, we propose a metric based on an antisymmetric combination of cross-bispectra, which we demonstrate to be robust to mixing artifacts. Moreover, our metric provides complex-valued quantities that give the opportunity to study phase relationships between brain sources. The effectiveness of the method is first demonstrated on simulated EEG data. The proposed approach shows a reduced sensitivity to mixing artifacts when compared with a traditional bispectral metric. It also exhibits a better performance in extracting phase relationships between sources than the imaginary part of the cross-spectrum for delayed interactions. The method is then applied to real EEG data recorded during resting state. A cross-frequency interaction is observed between brain sources at 10 Hz and 20 Hz, i.e., for alpha and beta rhythms. This interaction is then projected from signal to source level by using a fit-based procedure. This approach highlights a 10-20 Hz dominant interaction localized in an occipito-parieto-central network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present double-blind randomized control study, we investigated whether gamma and beta neurofeedback protocols, that have been shown to modulate performance on cognitive control and memory in young adults, also leads to increased brain activity and cognitive performance in elderly. Twenty older adults either performed eight 30-min gamma neurofeedback session or beta neurofeedback session within a period of 21 days. Cognitive performance was determined before and after the training through an IQ and memory task and we added a subjective well-being questionnaire. Both neurofeedback training protocols resulted in a significant increase of the brain activity within each training session, suggesting that the aging brain is still trainable. However, we found no effects on cognitive performance or transfer of the feedback beyond the trainings. We discuss several possible reasons for the lack of training on rest measurements and cognition and ways to improve the feedback protocols for future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Despite the vast literature on functional brain connectivity in typical brain development, surprisingly few attempts have been made to characterize brain network integrity in neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we used resting-state EEG to characterize functional brain connectivity and brain network organization in eight males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and 12 healthy male controls. Functional connectivity was calculated based on the phase lag index (PLI), a non-linear synchronization index that is less sensitive to the effects of volume conduction. Brain network organization was assessed with graph theoretical analysis. A decrease in global functional connectivity was observed in FXS males for upper alpha and beta frequency bands. For theta oscillations, we found increased connectivity in long-range (fronto-posterior) and short-range (frontal-frontal and posterior-posterior) clusters. Graph theoretical analysis yielded evidence of increased path length in the theta band, suggesting that information transfer between brain regions is particularly impaired for theta oscillations in FXS. These findings are discussed in terms of aberrant maturation of neuronal oscillatory dynamics, resulting in an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal circuit activity.

To understand comprehensively the effect of synchronization on the brain function, accurate computation of the synchronization strength among multivariate neural series from the whole brain is necessary. In this study, we proposed a method named global coupling index (GCI) to estimate the synchronization strength of multiple neural signals. First of all, performance of the GCI method was evaluated by analyzing simulated EEG signals from a multi-channel neural mass model, including the effects of the frequency band, the coupling coefficient, and the signal noise ratio. Then, the GCI method was applied to analyze the EEG signals from 12 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 12 normal controls (NC). The results showed that GCI method had two major advantages over the global synchronization index (CSI) or S-estimator. Firstly, simulation data showed that the GCI method provided both a more robust result on the frequency band and a better performance on the coupling coefficients. Secondly, the actual EEG data demonstrated that GCI method was more sensitive in differentiating the MCI from control subjects, in terms of the global synchronization strength of neural series of specific alpha, betal and beta2 frequency bands. Hence, it is suggested that GCI is a better method over GSI and S-estimator to estimate the synchronization strength of multivariate neural series for predicting the MCI from the whole brain EEG recordings.

Our aim was to quantify their alterations in nocturnal sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). In 20 patients and 20 healthy volunteers, we recorded a nocturnal digital polysomnography. Different sleep parameters were measured. Besides, we performed quantitative analysis of EEG (qEEG) as follows: spectral power in the different sleep stages was calculated in the frequency bands low delta, delta, theta, alpha, and sigma. Also, the mean dominant frequency and Sleep Indexes were obtained. In comparison with controls, the group of patients showed (1) different alterations in both the microstructure and the macrostructure of sleep; (2) an increase in, both, theta band power and the average mean dominant frequency during rapid eye movement (REM); (3) in all sleep stages, a decrease of sleep electroencephalogram spectral power in low delta band and an increase in delta band: and (4) in stages N3 and REM, significant increases in the minimum of mean dominant frequency and in the respective sleep indexes. Therefore, in cirrhotic patients without overt HE, and likely having minimal hepatic encephalopathy, we found different alterations in both the microstructure and the macrostructure of nocturnal sleep. Also, sleep qEEG showed a brain dysfunction in slow oscillatory mechanisms intrinsic of sleep stages, with an increase in the frequency of its maximal electroencephalogram synchronization, from low delta to delta band. These alterations may reflect the onset of encephalopathy; sleep qEEG may, thus, be an adequate tool for its brain functional evaluation and follow-up.

Methods: The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 70 healthy normal subjects ranging in age from 13 to 20 years. A time point by time point computation of LORETA current sources were computed for 14 Brodmann areas comprising the DMN in the delta frequency band. The Hilbert transform of the LORETA time series was used to compute the instantaneous phase differences between all pairs of Brodmann areas. Phase shift and lock durations were calculated based on the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the time series of phase differences. Results: Phase shift duration exhibited three discrete modes at approximately: (1) 25 ms, (2) 50 ms, and (3) 65 ms. Phase lock duration present primarily at: (1) 300-350 ms and (2) 350-450 ms. Phase shift and lock durations were inversely related and exhibited an exponential change with distance between Brodmann areas. Conclusions: The results are explained by local neural packing density of network hubs and an exponential decrease in connections with distance from a hub. The results are consistent with a discrete temporal model of brain function where anatomical hubs behave like a "shutter" that opens and closes at specific durations as nodes of a network giving rise to temporarily phase locked clusters of neurons for specific durations.

The AM illusion is strongest at presentation frequencies around 3 Hz. At lower presentation frequencies, the percept varies from trial to trial between AM and sequential alternation, while at higher frequencies perception varies between AM and two simultaneously flickering objects. Previous studies have demonstrated that prestimulus alpha oscillations explain trial-to-trial variability in detection performance for visual stimuli presented at threshold. In the present study, we investigated whether fluctuations of prestimulus alpha oscillations can also account for variations in AM perception. Prestimulus alpha power was stronger when observers reported AM perception in subsequent trials with low presentation frequencies, while at high presentation frequencies there were no significant differences in alpha power preceding AM and veridical flicker perception. Moreover, when observers perceived AM the prestimulus functional connectivity between frontal and occipital channels was increased in the alpha band, as revealed by the imaginary part of coherency, which is insensitive to artefacts from volume conduction. Dynamic causal modelling of steady-state responses revealed that the most likely direction of this fronto-occipital connectivity was from frontal to occipital sources. These results point to a role of ongoing alpha oscillations in the inferential process that gives rise to the perception of AM and suggest that front-ooccipital interactions bias perception towards internally generated predictions.

PD patients also show a slowing of resting state activity. Alpha-synuclein is causally linked to PD and accumulates in sleep-related brain regions. While sleep problems occur in over 75% of PD patients and severely impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers, their study is limited by a paucity of adequate animal models. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether overexpression of wildtype alpha-synuclein could lead to alterations in sleep patterns reminiscent of those observed in PD by measuring sleep/wake activity with rigorous quantitative methods in a well-characterized genetic mouse model. Methods: At 10 months of age, mice expressing human wildtype alpha-synuclein under the Thy-1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn) and wildtype littermates underwent the subcutaneous implantation of a telemetry device (Data Sciences International) for the recording of electromyograms (EMG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) in freely moving animals. Surgeries and data collection were performed without knowledge of mouse genotype. Results: Thy1-aSyn mice showed increased non-rapid eye movement sleep during their quiescent phase, increased active wake during their active phase, and decreased rapid eye movement sleep over a 24-h period, as well as a shift in the density of their EEG power spectra toward lower frequencies with a significant decrease in gamma power during wakefulness. Conclusions: Alpha-synuclein overexpression in mice produces sleep disruptions and altered oscillatory EEG activity reminiscent of PD, and this model provides a novel platform to assess mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for sleep dysfunction in PD.

Sleep EEG patterns and tonic cortisol in healthy volunteers simulating manned flight to Mars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep; Cortisol; Social/environmental confinement; Stress; High-density EEG; NREM sleep; MARS 500	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; GROWTH-HORMONE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; PLASMA-CORTISOL; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRESSION; SECRETION; FRAGMENTS; PITUITARY	Spaceflights "environment" negatively affects sleep and its functions. Among the different causes promoting sleep alterations, such as circadian rhythms disruption and microgravity, stress is of great interest also for earth-based sleep medicine. This study aims to evaluate the relationships between stress related to social/environmental confinement and sleep in six healthy volunteers involved in the simulation of human flight to Mars (MARS500). Volunteers were sealed in a spaceship simulator for 105 days and studied at 5 specific time-points of the simulation period. Sleep EEG, urinary cortisol (24 h preceding sleep EEG recording) and subjectively perceived stress levels were collected. Cognitive abilities and emotional state were evaluated before and after the simulation. Sleep EEG parameters in the time (latency, duration) and frequency (power and hemispheric lateralization) domains were evaluated. Neither cognitive and emotional functions alterations nor abnormal stress levels were found. Higher cortisol levels were associated to: i) decrease of sleep duration, increase of arousals, and shortening of REM latency; ii) reduction of delta power and enhancement of sigma and beta in NREM N3; and iii) left lateralization of delta activity (NREM and REM) and right lateralization-of beta activity (NREM). Stressful conditions, even with cortisol fluctuations in the normal range, alter sleep structure and sleep EEG spectral content, mirroring pathological conditions such as primary insomnia or insomnia associated to depression. Correlations between cortisol fluctuations and sleep changes suggest a covert risk for developing allostatic load, and thus the need to develop ad-hoc countermeasures for preventing sleep alterations in long lasting manned space missions.

Gamma Deficits as a Neural Signature of Cognitive Impairment in Children Treated for Brain Tumors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain tumor; children; cranial radiation therapy; gamma oscillations; magnetoencephalography; visual-motor	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CONFORMAL RADIATION-THERAPY; POSTERIOR-FOSSA TUMORS; LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; BAND EEG ACTIVITY; LOW-GRADE GLIOMA; WHITE-MATTER; CRANIAL RADIATION; WORKING-MEMORY	Cognitive impairment is consistently reported in children treated for brain tumors, particularly in the categories of processing speed, memory, and attention. Although tumor site, hydrocephalus, chemotherapy, and cranial radiation therapy (CRT) are all associated with poorer function, CRT predicts the greatest deficits. There is a particularly high correlation between CRT and slowed information-processing speed. Cortical gamma-band oscillations have been associated with processing behaviorally relevant information; however, their role in the maintenance of cognition in individuals with processing deficits is unclear. We examined gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children undergoing CRT to test whether gamma characteristics can be a signature of cognitive impairment in this population. We collected resting-state data as well as data from baseline and active periods during two visual-motor reaction time tasks of varying cognitive loads from 18 healthy children and 20 patients. We found that only high-gamma oscillations (60-100 Hz), and not low-gamma oscillations (30-59 Hz), showed significant group differences in absolute power levels. Overall, compared with healthy children, patients showed the following: (1) lower total high-gamma (60-100 Hz) power during the resting state, as well as during task-related baseline and performance measures; (2) no change in gamma reactivity to increases in cognitive load; and (3) slower processing speeds both inside and outside MEG. Our findings show that high-gamma oscillations are disrupted in children after treatment for a brain tumor. The temporal dynamic of the high-gamma response during information processing may index cognitive impairment in humans with neurological injury.

The typically small groups of analyzed schizophrenic patients yielded different neurophysiological findings, probably because small patient groups are likely to comprise different schizophrenia subtypes. We analyzed multichannel eyes-closed resting EEG from three small groups of acutely ill, first episode productive schizophrenic patients before start of medication (from three centers: Bern N = 9; Osaka N = 9; Berlin N = 12) and their controls. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute intracortical source model-based lagged functional connectivity not biased by volume conduction effects between 19 cortical regions of interest (ROls). The connectivities were compared between controls and patients of each group. Conjunction analysis determined six aberrant cortical functional connectivities that were the same in the three patient groups. Four of these six concerned the facilitating EEG alpha-1 frequency activity; they were decreased in the patients. Another two of these six connectivities concerned the inhibiting EEG delta frequency activity; they were increased in the patients. The principal orientation of the six aberrant cortical functional connectivities was sagittal; five of them involved both hemispheres. In sum, activity in the posterior brain areas of preprocessing functions and the anterior brain areas of evaluation and behavior control functions were compromised by either decreased coupled activation or increased coupled inhibition, common across schizophrenia subtypes in the three patient groups. These results of the analyzed three independent groups of schizophrenics support the concept of functional dissociation.

Resting State Electroencephalogram Oscillatory Abnormalities in Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Patients and Their Relatives from the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes Study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Bipolar disorder; EEG; intermediate phenotypes; psychosis; resting state; schizophrenia	QUANTITATIVE EEG; FIRST-EPISODE; DISORDER; BRAIN; POWER; RISK; CONNECTIVITY; HERITABILITY; SIGNATURES; FREQUENCY	Background: Abnormal resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations are reported in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder, illnesses with overlapping symptoms and genetic risk. However, less evidence exists on whether similar EEG spectral abnormalities are present in individuals with both disorders or whether these abnormalities are present in first-degree relatives, possibly representing genetic predisposition for these disorders. Methods: Investigators examined 64-channel resting state EEGs of 225 SZ probands and 201 first-degree relatives (SZR), 234 psychotic bipolar (PBP) probands and 231 first-degree relatives (PBPR), and 200 healthy control subjects. Eight independent resting state EEG spectral components and associated spatial weights were derived using group independent component analysis. Analysis of covariance was conducted on spatial weights to evaluate group differences. Relative risk estimates and familiality were evaluated on abnormal spectral profiles in probands and relatives. Results: Both SZ and PBP probands exhibited increased delta, theta, and slow and fast alpha activity. Post-hoc pair-wise comparison revealed increased frontocentral slow beta activity in SZ and PBP probands as well as SZR and PBPR. Augmented frontal delta activity was exhibited by SZ probands and SZR, whereas PBP probands and PBPR showed augmented fast alpha activity. Conclusions: Both SZ and PBP probands demonstrated aberrant low-frequency activity. Slow beta activity was abnormal in SZ and PBP probands as well as SZR and PBPR perhaps indicating a common endophenotype for both disorders. Delta and fast alpha activity were unique endophenotypes for SZ and PBP probands, respectively. The EEG spectral activity exhibited moderate relative risk and heritability estimates, serving as intermediate phenotypes in future genetic studies for examining biological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the two disorders.

Some gamma-band deficits have also been seen in unaffected first-degree relatives, suggesting heritability of these findings. This review covers the published literature on gamma abnormalities in autism, the proposed mechanisms underlying the deficits and the potential for translation into new treatments. Although the utility of gamma-band metrics as diagnostic biomarkers is currently limited, such changes in autism are also useful as endophenotypes, for evaluating potential neural mechanisms, and for use as surrogate markers of treatment response to interventions.

We conducted a retrospective population study that sought to analyze the age-related changes in EEG coherence in a group of 17,722 healthy professional drivers. Materials and methods: The EEGs were obtained using a standard 10-20 electrode configuration on the scalp. The recordings from 19 scalp electrodes were taken while the participants' eyes were closed. The linear correlations between the age and coherence were estimated by linear regression analysis. Results: Our results showed a significant decrease in coherence with age in the theta and alpha bands, and there was an increasing coherence with the beta bands. The most prominent changes occurred in the alpha bands. The delta bands contained movement artefacts, which most likely do not change with age. Conclusions: The age-related EEG desynchrony can be partly explained by the age-related reduction of cortical connectivity. Higher frequencies of oscillations require less cortical area of high coherence. These findings explain why the lowest average coherence values were observed in the beta and sigma bands, as well as why the beta bands show borderline statistical significance and the sigma bands show non-significance. The age-dependent decrease in coherence may influence the estimation of age-related changes in EEG energy due to phase cancellation. (C) 2014 Polish Neurological Society.

The spatial and signal characteristics of physiologic high frequency oscillations	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						High frequency oscillations; Intracranial EEG; Ripples; Epilepsy; Electrocorticography	HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; HIGH GAMMA ACTIVITY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; 80-500 HZ; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; SURGICAL RESECTION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FOCAL SEIZURES; FAST RIPPLES	ObjectivesTo study the incidence, spatial distribution, and signal characteristics of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) outside the epileptic network. MethodsWe included patients who underwent invasive evaluations at Yale Comprehensive Epilepsy Center from 2012 to 2013, had all major lobes sampled, and had localizable seizure onsets. Segments of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep prior to the first seizure were analyzed. We implemented a semiautomated process to analyze oscillations with peak frequencies >80Hz (ripples 80-250Hz; fast ripples 250-500Hz). A contact location was considered epileptic if it exhibited epileptiform discharges during the intracranial evaluation or was involved ictally within 5s of seizure onset; otherwise it was considered nonepileptic. ResultsWe analyzed recordings from 1,209 electrode contacts in seven patients. The nonepileptic contacts constituted 79.1% of the total number of contacts. Ripples constituted 99% of total detections. Eighty-two percent of all HFOs were seen in 45.2% of the nonepileptic contacts (82.1%, 47%, 34.6%, and 34% of the occipital, parietal, frontal, and temporal nonepileptic contacts, respectively). The following sublobes exhibited physiologic HFOs in all patients: Perirolandic, basal temporal, and occipital subregions. The ripples from nonepileptic sites had longer duration, higher amplitude, and lower peak frequency than ripples from epileptic sites. A high HFO rate (>1/min) was seen in 110 nonepileptic contacts, of which 68.2% were occipital. Fast ripples were less common, seen in nonepileptic parietooccipital regions only in two patients and in the epileptic mesial temporal structures. ConclusionsThere is consistent occurrence of physiologic HFOs over vast areas of the neocortex outside the epileptic network. HFOs from nonepileptic regions were seen in the occipital lobes and in the perirolandic region in all patients. Although duration of ripples and peak frequency of HFOs are the most effective measures in distinguishing pathologic from physiologic events, there was significant overlap between the two groups.

Can quantitative EEG measures predict clinical outcome in subjects at Clinical High Risk for psychosis? A prospective multicenter study	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Psychosis prediction; Clinical High Risk; QEEG	PRODROMAL PSYCHOSIS; META-ANALYSIS; RESTING EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HERITABILITY; EPISODE; P300; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSITION; RELATIVES	Background: Prediction studies in subjects at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis are hampered by a high proportion of uncertain outcomes. We therefore investigated whether quantitative EEG (QEEG) parameters can contribute to an improved identification of CHR subjects with a later conversion to psychosis. Methods: This investigation was a project within the European Prediction of Psychosis Study (EPOS), a prospective multicenter, naturalistic field study with an 18-month follow-up period. QEEG spectral power and alpha peak frequencies (APF) were determined in 113 CHR subjects. The primary outcome measure was conversion to psychosis. Results: Cox regression yielded a model including frontal theta (HR = 1.82; [95% CI 1.00-3.32]) and delta (HR = 2.60; [95% CI 1.30-5.20]) power, and occipital-parietal APF (HR = .52; [95% CI.35-.80]) as predictors of conversion to psychosis. The resulting equation enabled the development of a prognostic index with three risk classes (hazard rate 0.057 to 0.81). Conclusions: Power in theta and delta ranges and APF contribute to the short-term prediction of psychosis and enable a further stratification of risk in CHR samples. Combined with (other) clinical ratings, EEG parameters may therefore be a useful tool for individualized risk estimation and, consequently, targeted prevention. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Self-enhancement Influences Medial Frontal Cortex Alpha Power to Social Rejection Feedback	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EXCLUSION; DYNAMICS; RESOLUTION; ESTEEM; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONTINGENCIES	Although previous research has demonstrated that individuals are motivated to self-enhance, the neurocognitive mechanisms and temporal dynamics of self-enhancement are poorly understood. The current research examined whether self-enhancing motivations affect the perceptual processing of social feedback. Participants who varied in self-enhancement motivations received accept and reject feedback while EEG was recorded. Following this task, we measured perceptions of feedback by asking participants to estimate the number of times they were rejected. Source localization and time-frequency analyses revealed that alpha power in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) completely mediated the relationship between self-enhancement motivations and rejection estimates. Specifically, greater self-enhancement motivations predicted decreased MFC alpha power to reject compared to accept feedback, which predicted decreased rejection estimates. These findings suggest that self-enhancement motivations decrease perception of social rejection by influencing how the MFC processes social feedback.

Quantitative sleep stage analyses as a window to neonatal neurologic function	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; ENTROPY-BASED MEASURES; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; EEG; INFANTS; TERM; DYNAMICS	Objective:To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates.Methods:Newborn infants (35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results:Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions:Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleepincluding analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentationshowed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.	[Shellhaas, Renee A.; Barks, John D.

EASSRs are studied for the objective fitting of CIs in infants, as electrophysiological thresholds determined with EASSRs correlate well with behavioural thresholds. Currently available techniques to remove CI artifacts from such measurements are only able to deal with artifacts for low-rate pulse trains or modulated pulse trains presented in bipolar mode, which are not used in main clinical practice. In this paper, an automatic EASSR CI artifact rejection technique based on independent component analysis (ICA) is presented that is suitable for clinical parameters. Artifactual independent components are selected based on the spectral amplitude of the pulse rate. Electrophysiological thresholds determined based on ICA compensated signals are equal to those detected using blanked signals, but measurements at only one modulation frequency are required.

J	Zanto, TP; Chadick, JZ; Gazzaley, A				Zanto, Theodore P.; Chadick, James Z.; Gazzaley, Adam			Anticipatory alpha phase influences visual working memory performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Electroencephalography; Alpha band; Phase; Working memory; Motion	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; MOTION; TMS; CORTEX; BRAIN	Alpha band (8-12 Hz) phase dynamics in the visual cortex are thought to reflect fluctuations in cortical excitability that influences perceptual processing. As such, visual stimuli are better detected when their onset is concurrent with specific phases of the alpha cycle. However, it is unclear whether alpha phase differentially influences cognitive performance at specific times relative to stimulus onset (i.e., is the influence of phase maximal before, at, or after stimulus onset?). To address this, participants performed a delayed-recognition, working memory (WM) task for visual motion direction during two separate visits. The first visit utilized functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging to identify neural regions associated with task performance. Replicating previous studies, fMRI data showed engagement of visual cortical area V5, as well as a prefrontal cortical region, the inferior frontal junction (IFJ). During the second visit, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied separately to both the right IFJ and right V5 (with the vertex as a control region) while electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded. During each trial, a single pulse of TMS (spTMS) was applied at one of six time points (200, 100, -50, 0, 80, 160 ms) relative to the encoded stimulus onset Results demonstrated a relationship between the phase of the posterior alpha signal prior to stimulus encoding and subsequent response times to the memory probe two seconds later. Specifically, spTMS to V5, and not the IFJ or vertex, yielded faster response times, indicating improved WM performance, when delivered during the peak, compared to the trough, of the alpha cycle, but only when spTMS was applied 100 ms prior to stimulus onset These faster responses to the probe correlated with decreased early event related potential (ERP) amplitudes (i.e., P1) to the probe stimuli. Moreover, participants that were least affected by spTMS exhibited greater functional connectivity between V5 and fronto-parietal regions. These results suggest that posterior alpha phase indexes a critical time period for motion processing in the context of WM encoding goals, which occurs in anticipation of stimulus onset.

The stimulus consisted of a pointer performing regular ticks in a clockwise sequence across 42 dots arranged in a circle. Participants were requested to covertly attend to the pointer and press a response button as quickly as possible in the event of a jump, a rare and random event. Main results. Significant increases in response latencies and decreases in the detection rates were found as a function of time-on-task, a characteristic effect of sustained attention tasks known as the vigilance decrement. Subjective sleepiness showed a significant increase over the duration of the experiment. Increased activity in the alpha-frequency range (8-14 Hz) was observed emerging and gradually accumulating 10 s before a missed target. Additionally, a significant gradual attenuation of the P3 event-related component was found to antecede misses by 5 s. Significance. The results corroborate recent findings that behavioural errors are presaged by specific neurophysiological activity and demonstrate that lapses of attention can be predicted in a covert setting up to 10 s in advance reinforcing the prospective use of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for the detection of waning vigilance in real-world scenarios. Combining these findings with real-time single-trial analysis from BCI may pave the way for cognitive states monitoring systems able to determine the current, and predict the near-future development of the brain's attentional processes.

However, the neural mechanisms that coordinate these large networks are poorly understood, particularly in the context of the growing interest in network dynamics. Recent work in anesthetized rats has shown that the spontaneous BOLD fluctuations are tightly linked to infraslow local field potentials (LFPs) that are seldom recorded but comparable in frequency to the slow BOLD fluctuations. These findings support the hypothesis that long-range coordination involves low frequency neural oscillations and establishes infraslow LFPs as an excellent candidate for probing the neural underpinnings of the BOLD spatiotemporal patterns observed in both rats and humans. To further examine the link between large-scale network dynamics and infraslow LFPs, simultaneous fMRI and microelectrode recording were performed in anesthetized rats. Using an optimized filter to isolate shared components of the signals, we found that time-lagged correlation between infraslow LFPs and BOLD is comparable in spatial extent and timing to a quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) found from BOLD alone, suggesting that fMRI-measured QPPs and the infraslow LFPs share a common mechanism. As fMRI allows spatial resolution and whole brain coverage not available with electroencephalography, QPPs can be used to better understand the role of infraslow oscillations in normal brain function and neurological or psychiatric disorders.

Evidence that the negative BOLD response is neuronal in origin: A simultaneous EEG-BOLD-CBF study in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CALIBRATED FUNCTIONAL MRI; OXYGEN-METABOLISM; VISUAL-CORTEX; ARTERIAL TERRITORIES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FMRI RESPONSES; SIGNAL CHANGES	Unambiguous interpretation of changes in the BOLD signal is challenging because of the complex neurovascular coupling that translates changes in neuronal activity into the subsequent haemodynamic response. In particular, the neurophysiological origin of the negative BOLD response (NBR) remains incompletely understood. Here, we simultaneously recorded BOLD, EEG and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to 10 s blocks of unilateral median nerve stimulation (MNS) in order to interrogate the NBR. Both negative BOLD and negative CBF responses to MNS were observed in the same region of the ipsilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and calculations showed that MNS induced a decrease in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in this NBR region. The Delta CMRO2/Delta CBF coupling ratio (n) was found to be significantly larger in this ipsilateral S1/M1 region (n = 0.91 +/- 0.04, M = 10.45%) than in the contralateral S1/M1 (n = 0.65 +/- 0.03, M = 10.45%) region that exhibited a positive BOLD response (PBR) and positive CBF response, and a consequent increase in CMRO2 during MNS. The fMRI response amplitude in ipsilateral S1/M1 was negatively correlated with both the power of the 8-13 Hz EEG mu oscillation and somatosensory evoked potential amplitude. Blocks in which the largest magnitude of negative BOLD and CBF responses occurred therefore showed greatest mu power, an electrophysiological index of cortical inhibition, and largest somatosensory evoked potentials. Taken together, our results suggest that a neuronal mechanism underlies the NBR, but that the NBR may originate from a different neurovascular coupling mechanism to the PBR, suggesting that caution should be taken in assuming the NBR simply represents the neurophysiological inverse of the PBR.

J	Hinterberger, T; Zlabinger, M; Blaser, K				Hinterberger, Thilo; Zlabinger, Milena; Blaser, Klaus			Neurophysiological correlates of various mental perspectives	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental perspectives; attentional focus; EEG; intrapersonal space; empathy	CORTICAL MIDLINE STRUCTURES; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELF; MINDFULNESS; EMPATHY	A common view of consciousness is that our mind presents emotions, experiences, and images in an internal mental (re-)presentation space which in a state of wakefulness is triggered by the world outside. Consciousness can be defined as the observation of this inner mental space. We propose a new model, in which the state of the conscious observer is defined by the observer's mental position and focus of attention. The mental position of the observer can either be within the mental self (intrapersonal space), in the mental outer world (extrapersonal space) or in an empathic connection, i.e., within the intrapersonal space of another person (perspective taking). The focus of attention can be directed toward the self or toward the outside world. This mental space model can help us to understand the patterns of relationships and interactions with other persons as they occur in social life. To investigate the neurophysiological correlates and discriminability of the different mental states, we conducted an EEG experiment measuring the brain activity of 16 subjects via 64 electrodes while they engaged in different mental positions (intrapersonal, extrapersonal, perspective taking) with different attentional foci (self, object). Compared to external mental locations, internal ones showed significantly increased alpha2 power, especially when the observer was focusing on an object. Alpha2 and beta2 were increased in the empathic condition compared to the extrapersonal perspective. Delta power was significantly higher when the attentional focus was directed toward an object in comparison to the participant's own self. This exploratory study demonstrates highly significant differences between various mental locations and foci, suggesting that the proposed categories of mental location and intra- and interpersonal attentional foci are not only helpful theoretical concepts but are also physiologically relevant and therefore may relate to basic brain processing mechanisms.

We employed a speech perception paradigm that manipulated the congruency between a visually presented picture and an auditory stimulus and asked participants to judge whether they matched or mismatched. A group of children (mean age 10 years, 5 months) participated in this study and their electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded while performing the experimental task. It was found that in comparison with mismatch condition, match condition facilitated speech perception by eliciting greater theta-gamma coupling in the frontal area and smaller theta-gamma coupling in the left temporal area. These findings suggested that a top-down facilitation effect from congruent visual pictures engaged different mechanisms in low-level sensory (temporal) regions and high-level linguistic and decision (frontal) regions. Interestingly, hemispheric asymmetry is with higher theta-gamma coupling in the match condition in the right hemisphere and higher theta-gamma coupling in the mismatch condition in the left hemisphere. This indicates that a fast global processing strategy and a slow detailed processing strategy were differentially adopted in the match and mismatch conditions. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms of speech perception from the interaction of different oscillatory activities and provides neural evidence for theories of speech perception allowing for top-down feedback connections. Furthermore, it sheds light on children's speech perception development by showing a similar pattern of integration of bottom-up and top-down information during speech perception as previous studies have revealed in adults.

The present research seeks deeper insights into these intrinsically motivating mechanisms by investigating neurophysiological correlates of cognitive absorption in the context of enactive learning, specifically simulation-based training on the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. An experiment was conducted in which 36 student trainees used ERP software to make decisions while running a simulated company. Consistent with flow theory, skill, difficulty, and their interaction significantly influenced cognitive absorption (R-2 = .16). Five neurophysiological measures were captured for each trainee: EEG alpha, EEG beta, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, and heart rate variability. Each of the five neurophysiological measures explained significant unique variance in cognitive absorption over and above skill, difficulty, and their interaction, and collectively more than doubled the explained variance to R-2 = .34. Overall, cognitive absorption was positively related to a more relaxed, less vigilant state. Cognitive absorption was significantly related to the training outcome. These findings provide new insights into the psychological states that are conducive to experiencing cognitive absorption during enactive training. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adaptive and maladaptive coping styles were determined in 85 tinnitus patients. Based on resting state EEG recordings, coping related differences in brain activity and connectivity were found. Maladaptive coping behavior was related to increases in subjective tinnitus loudness and distress, higher tinnitus severity and higher depression scores. EEG recordings demonstrated increased alpha activity over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as well as increased connectivity in the default (i.e. resting state) network in tinnitus patients with a maladaptive coping style. Correlation analysis revealed that the changes in the DLPFC correlate primarily with maladaptive coping behavior, whereas the changes in the sgACC correlate with tinnitus severity and depression. Our findings are in line with previous research in the field of depression that during resting state a alpha band hyperconnectivity exists within the default network for patients who use a maladaptive coping style, with the sgACC as the dysfunctional node and that the strength of the connectivity is related to focusing on negative mood and catastrophizing about the consequences of tinnitus.

Despite all countermeasures, the PLI still corrupts physiological signals, for example, electromyograms (EMG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and electrocardiograms (ECG). When analyzing the fetal ECG (fECG) recorded on the maternal abdomen, the PLI represents a particular strong noise component, being sometimes 10 times greater than the fECG signal, and thus impairing the extraction of any useful information regarding the fetal health state. Many signal processing methods for cancelling the PLI from biopotentials are available in the literature. In this review study, six different principles are analyzed and discussed, and their performance is evaluated on simulated data (three different scenarios), based on five quantitative performance indices.

J	Xu, HJ; Lu, YF; Zhu, SN; He, B				Xu, Haojie; Lu, Yunfeng; Zhu, Shanan; He, Bin			Assessing Dynamic Spectral Causality by Lagged Adaptive Directed Transfer Function and Instantaneous Effect Factor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF); causal ordering estimation; dynamic spectral causality; instantaneous effect factor (IEF); time-lagged causality; visual evoked potentials (VEPs)	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN CAUSALITY; GRANGER CAUSALITY; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION-FLOW; TIME-SERIES; SCALP EEG; MODEL; NONSTATIONARY; COHERENCE	It is of significance to assess the dynamic spectral causality among physiological signals. Several practical estimators adapted from spectral Granger causality have been exploited to track dynamic causality based on the framework of time-varying multivariate autoregressive (tvMVAR) models. The nonzero co-variance of the model's residuals has been used to describe the instantaneous effect phenomenon in some causality estimators. However, for the situations with Gaussian residuals in some autoregressive models, it is challenging to distinguish the directed instantaneous causality if the sufficient prior information about the "causal ordering" is missing. Here, we propose a new algorithm to assess the time-varying causal ordering of tvMVAR model under the assumption that the signals follow the same acyclic causal ordering for all time lags and to estimate the instantaneous effect factor (IEF) value in order to track the dynamic directed instantaneous connectivity. The time-lagged adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF) is also estimated to assess the lagged causality after removing the instantaneous effect. In this study, we first investigated the performance of the causal-ordering estimation algorithm and the accuracy of IEF value. Then, we presented the results of IEF and time-lagged ADTF method by comparing with the conventional ADTF method through simulations of various propagation models. Statistical analysis results suggest that the new algorithm could accurately estimate the causal ordering and give a good estimation of the IEF values in the Gaussian residual conditions. Meanwhile, the time-lagged ADTF approach is also more accurate in estimating the time-lagged dynamic interactions in a complex nervous system after extracting the instantaneous effect. In addition to the simulation studies, we applied the proposed method to estimate the dynamic spectral causality on real visual evoked potential (VEP) data in a human subject. Its usefulness in time-variant spectral causality assessment was demonstrated through the mutual causality investigation of brain activity during the VEP experiments.

Real-time information of ongoing brain states acquired through BCI might be exploited for controlling data presentation in virtual environments. Brain states discrimination during mixed reality experience is thus critical for adapting specific data features to contingent brain activity. In this study we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants experienced MR scenarios implemented through the eXperience Induction Machine (XIM). The XIM is a novel framework modeling the integration of a sensing system that evaluates and measures physiological and psychological states with a number of actuators and effectors that coherently reacts to the user's actions. We then assessed continuous EEG-based discrimination of spatial navigation, reading and calculation performed in MR, using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Dynamic single trial classification showed high accuracy of LDA and SVM classifiers in detecting multiple brain states as well as in differentiating between high and low mental workload, using a 5s time-window shifting every 200 ms. Our results indicate overall better performance of LDA with respect to SVM and suggest applicability of our approach in a BCI-controlled MR scenario. Ultimately, successful prediction of brain states might be used to drive adaptation of data representation in order to boost information processing in MR.

Resting state alpha frequency is associated with menstrual cycle phase, estradiol and use of oral contraceptives	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Estradiol; Individual alpha frequency; Center frequency; Oral contraceptive	HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES; EEG-ALPHA; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; YOUNG-WOMEN; FOOD-INTAKE; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; WEIGHT; MATTER; PILL	Ongoing intrinsic brain activity in resting, but awake humans is dominated by alpha oscillations. In human, individual alpha frequency (IAF) is associated with cognitive performance. Noticeable, performance in cognitive and emotional tasks in women is associated with menstrual cycle phase and sex hormone levels, respectively. In the present study, we correlated frequency of alpha oscillation in resting women with menstrual cycle phase, sex hormone level, or use of oral contraceptives. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 57 women (aged 24.07 +/- 3.67 years) having a natural menstrual cycle as well as from 57 women (aged 22.37 +/- 2.20 years) using oral contraceptives while they sat in an armchair with eyes closed. Alpha frequency was related to the menstrual cycle phase. Luteal women showed highest and late follicular women showed lowest TAP or center frequency. Furthermore, TAP as well as center frequency correlated negatively with endogenous estradiol level, but did not reveal an association with endogenous progesterone. Women using oral contraceptives showed an alpha frequency similar to women in the early follicular phase. We suggest that endogenous estradiol modulate resting alpha frequency. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Everyday examples of this are the social dilemmas in which goals tend to clash, requiring one to weigh alternative courses of action in limited time. In spite of this fact, there are few studies that directly address the dynamics of flexible brain network integration during social interaction. To study the preceding, we carried out EEG recordings while subjects played a repeated version of the Ultimatum Game in both human (social) and computer (non-social) conditions. We found phase synchrony (inter-site-phase-clustering) modulation in alpha band that was specific to the human condition and independent of power modulation. The strength and patterns of the inter-site-phase-clustering of the cortical networks were also modulated, and these modulations were mainly in frontal and parietal regions. Moreover, changes in the individuals' alpha network structure correlated with the risk of the offers made only in social conditions. This correlation was independent of changes in power and inter-site-phase-clustering strength. Our results indicate that, when subjects believe they are participating in a social interaction, a specific modulation of functional cortical networks in alpha band takes place, suggesting that phase synchrony of alpha oscillations could serve as a mechanism by which different brain areas flexibly interact in order to adapt ongoing behavior in socially demanding contexts.

However, the relation between attention and prediction remains undetermined given the conflation of these two mechanisms in the literature. To evaluate whether attention and prediction are dependent of each other, and if so, how these two top-down mechanisms may interact in sensory processing, we orthogonally manipulated attention and prediction in a target detection task. Participants were instructed to pay attention to one of two interleaved stimulus streams of predictable/unpredictable tone frequency. We found that attention and prediction interacted on the amplitude of the N1 ERP component. The N1 amplitude in the attended/predictable condition was larger than that in any of the other conditions. Dipole source localization analysis showed that the effect came from the activation in bilateral auditory areas. No significant effect was found in the P2 time window. Our results suggest that attention and prediction are dependent of each other. While attention might determine the overall cortical responsiveness to stimuli when prediction is involved, prediction might provide an anchor for the modulation of the synaptic input strengths which needs to be operated on the basis of attention.

Previous studies characterized the alterations of brain oscillatory activity at this stage, but little is known about the differences between single and multidomain amnestic MCI patients. In order to study the patterns of oscillatory magnetic activity in amnestic MCI subtypes, a total of 105 subjects underwent an eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalographic recording: 36 healthy controls, 33 amnestic single domain MCIs (a-sd-MCI), and 36 amnestic multidomain MCIs (a-md-MCI). Relative power values were calculated and compared among groups. Subsequently, relative power values were correlated with neuropsychological tests scores and hippocampal volumes. Both MCI groups showed an increase in relative power in lower frequency bands (delta and theta frequency ranges) and a decrease in power values in higher frequency bands (alpha and beta frequency ranges), as compared with the control group. More importantly, clear differences emerged from the comparison between the two amnestic MCI subtypes. The a-md-MCI group showed a significant power increase within delta and theta ranges and reduced relative power within alpha and beta ranges. Such pattern correlated with the neuropsychological performance, indicating that the a-md-MCI subtype is associated not only with a "slowing" of the spectrum but also with a poorer cognitive status. These results suggest that a-md-MCI patients are characterized by a brain activity profile that is closer to that observed in Alzheimer disease. Therefore, it might be hypothesized that the likelihood of conversion to dementia would be higher within this subtype.	[Lopez, M. E.; Cuesta, P.; Garces, P.; Castellanos, P.

Vortioxetine has been shown to improve cognitive performance in several preclinical rat models and in patients with major depressive disorder. Here we investigated the mechanistic basis for these effects by studying the effect of vortioxetine on synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning and memory, and theta oscillations in the rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Vortioxetine was found to prevent the 5-HT-induced increase in inhibitory post-synaptic potentials recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells, most likely by 5-HT3 receptor antagonism. Vortioxetine also enhanced LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Finally, vortioxetine increased fronto-cortical theta power during active wake in whole animal electroencephalographic recordings. In comparison, the selective SERT inhibitor escitalopram showed no effect on any of these measures. Taken together, our results indicate that vortioxetine can increase pyramidal cell output, which leads to enhanced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Given the central role of the hippocampus in cognition, these findings may provide a cellular correlate to the observed preclinical and clinical cognition-enhancing effects of vortioxetine.

INVOLVEMENT OF GLUTAMATERGIC AND GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION IN MK-801-INCREASED GAMMA BAND OSCILLATION POWER IN RAT CORTICAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						NMDA receptor antagonist; gamma band oscillation; schizophrenia; antipsychotic drug; mGlu2/3 receptor	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GROUP-II; LY2140023 MONOHYDRATE; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; IN-VIVO; SCHIZOPHRENIA; KETAMINE; MODEL	Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAr) has been considered to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In rodent electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, non-competitive NMDAr antagonists have been reported to produce aberrant basal gamma band oscillation (GBO), as observed in schizophrenia. Aberrations in GBO power have attracted attention as a translational biomarker for the development of novel antipsychotic drugs. However, the neuronal mechanisms as well as the pharmacological significance of NMDAr antagonist-induced aberrant GBO power have not been fully investigated. In the present study, to address the above questions, we examined the pharmacological properties of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg)-increased basal GBO power in rat cortical EEG. Riluzole (3-10 mg/kg), a glutamate release inhibitor, reduced the MK-801-increased basal GBO power. In contrast, L-838,417 (1-3 mg/kg), an alpha 2/3/5 subunit-selective GABA(A) receptor-positive allosteric modulator, enhanced the GBO increase. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol (0.05-0.3 mg/kg) and clozapine (1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the MK-801-increased GBO power. Likewise, LY379268 (0.3-3 mg/kg), an metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor (mGlu2/3 receptor) agonist, reduced the GBO increase in a dose-dependent manner, which was antagonized by an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495. These results suggest that an increase in cortical GBO power induced by NMDAr hypofunction can be attributed to the aberrant activities of both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in local circuits. The aberrant cortical GBO power reflecting cortical network dysfunction observed in schizophrenia might be a useful biomarker for the discovery of novel antipsychotic drugs. (C) 2014 IBRO.

Neuromagnetic Evidence of Abnormal Movement-Related Beta Desynchronization in Parkinson's Disease	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cortex; magnetoencephalography; MEG; motor control; oscillations	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RHYTHMIC ACTIVITY; HAND AREA; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEG	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with debilitating motor, posture, and gait abnormalities. Human studies recording local field potentials within the subthalamic nucleus and scalp-based electroencephalography have shown pathological beta synchronization throughout the cortical-basal ganglia motor network in PD. Suppression of such pathological beta synchronization has been associated with improved motor function, which may explain the effectiveness of deep-brain stimulation. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural population-level beta responses, and other oscillatory activity, during a motor task in unmedicated patients with PD and a matched group of healthy adults. MEG is a noninvasive neurophysiological technique that permits the recording of oscillatory activity during movement planning, execution, and termination phases. Each of these phases was independently examined using beamforming to distinguish the brain areas and movement phases, where pathological oscillations exist during motor control. Patients with PD exhibited significantly diminished beta desynchronization compared with controls prior to and during movement, which paralleled reduced alpha desynchronization. This study is the first to systematically investigate neural oscillatory responses in PD during distinct stages of motor control (e. g. planning, execution, and termination) and indicates that these patients have significant difficulty suppressing cortical beta synchronization during movement planning, which may contribute to their diminished movement capacities.

Constitutive spectral EEG peaks in the gamma range: suppressed by sleep, reduced by mental activity and resistant to sensory stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; EEG bands; steady-state responses; oddball task; mental difficulty; neuro-psychiatric disorder	BAND ACTIVITY; POTENTIALS; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; INTERFACE; RESPONSES; REVEALS; HZ	Objective: In a systematic study of gamma activity in neuro-psychiatric disease, we unexpectedly observed distinctive, apparently persistent, electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral peaks in the gamma range (25-100 Hz). Our objective, therefore, was to examine the incidence, distribution and some of the characteristics of these peaks. Methods: High sample-rate, 128-channel, EEG was recorded in 603 volunteers (510 with neuropsychiatric disorders, 93 controls), whilst performing cognitive tasks, and converted to power spectra. Peaks of spectral power, including in the gamma range, were determined algorithmically for all electrodes. To determine if peaks were stable, 24-h ambulatory recordings were obtained from 16 subjects with peaks. In 10 subjects, steady-state responses to stimuli at peak frequency were compared with off-peak-frequency stimulation to determine if peaks were a feature of underlying network resonances and peaks were evaluated with easy and hard versions of oddball tasks to determine if peaks might be influenced by mental effort. Results: 57% of 603 subjects exhibited peaks >2 dB above trough power at or above 25 Hz. Larger peaks (>5 dB) were present in 13% of subjects. Peaks were distributed widely over the scalp, more frequent centrally. Peaks were present through the day and were suppressed by slow-wave-sleep. Steady-state responses were the same with on- or off-peak sensory stimulation. In contrast, mental effort resulted in reductions in power and frequency of gamma peaks, although the suppression did not correlate with level of effort. Conclusions: Gamma EEG can be expressed constitutively as concentrations of power in narrow or wide frequency bands that play an, as yet, unknown role in cognitive activity. Significance: These findings expand the described range of rhythmic EEG phenomena. In particular, in addition to evoked, induced and sustained gamma band activity, gamma activity can be present constitutively in spectral peaks.

J	Senkowski, D; Pomper, U; Fitzner, I; Engel, AK; Kral, A				Senkowski, Daniel; Pomper, Ulrich; Fitzner, Inga; Engel, Andreas Karl; Kral, Andrej			Beta-band activity in auditory pathways reflects speech localization and recognition in bilateral cochlear implant users	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						deafness; oscillatory activity; EEG; cortical plasticity; beta-band responses	INTERAURAL TIME DIFFERENCES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; DIFFERENCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; LATERALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	In normal-hearing listeners, localization of auditory speech involves stimulus processing in the postero-dorsal pathway of the auditory system. In quiet environments, bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users show high speech recognition performance, but localization of auditory speech is poor, especially when discriminating stimuli from the same hemifield. Whether this difficulty relates to the inability of the auditory system to translate binaural electrical cues into neural signals, or to a functional reorganization of auditory cortical pathways following long periods of binaural deprivation is unknown. In this electroencephalography study, we examined the processing of auditory syllables in postlingually deaf adults with bilateral CIs and in normal-hearing adults. Participants were instructed to either recognize (recognition task) or localize (localization task) the syllables. The analysis focused on event-related potentials and oscillatory brain responses. N1 amplitudes in CI users were larger in the localization compared with recognition task, suggesting an enhanced stimulus processing effort in the localization task. Linear beamforming of oscillatory activity in CI users revealed stronger suppression of beta-band activity after 200 ms in the postero-dorsal auditory pathway for the localization compared with the recognition task. In normal-hearing adults, effects for longer latency event-related potentials were found, but no effects were observed for N1 amplitudes or beta-band responses. Our study suggests that difficulties in speech localization in bilateral CI users are not reflected in a functional reorganization of cortical auditory pathways. New signal processing strategies of cochlear devices preserving unambiguous binaural cues may improve auditory localization performance in bilateral CI users. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3107-3121, 2014.

How these brain regions communicate during conflict processing (detection, resolution, and adaptation), however, is still unknown. The Stroop task provides a well-established paradigm to investigate the cognitive mechanisms mediating such response conflict. Here, we explore the oscillatory patterns within and between the DMPFC and DLPFC in human epilepsy patients with intracranial EEG electrodes during an auditory Stroop experiment. Data from the DLPFC were obtained from 12 patients. Thereof four patients had additional DMPFC electrodes available for interaction analyses. Our results show that an early theta (4-8 Hz) modulated enhancement of DLPFC gamma-band (30-100 Hz) activity constituted a prerequisite for later successful conflict processing. Subsequent conflict detection was reflected in a DMPFC theta power increase that causally entrained DLPFC theta activity (DMPFC to DLPFC). Conflict resolution was thereafter completed by coupling of DLPFC gamma power to DMPFC theta oscillations. Finally, conflict adaptation was related to increased postresponse DLPFC gamma-band activity and to theta coupling in the reverse direction (DLPFC to DMPFC). These results draw a detailed picture on how two regions in the prefrontal cortex communicate to resolve cognitive conflicts. In conclusion, our data show that conflict detection, control, and adaptation are supported by a sequence of processes that use the interplay of theta and gamma oscillations within and between DMPFC and DLPFC.

Alterations in Early and Late Visually Evoked EEG Potentials in Asperger Observers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ATTENTION; QUOTIENT; P300; RECOGNITION; DISORDERS; CHILDREN; BRAIN	Background: Asperger Autism is a lifelong psychiatric condition with highly circumscribed interests and routines, problems in social cognition, verbal and nonverbal communication, and also perceptual abnormalities with sensory hypersensitivity. To objectify both lower-level visual and cognitive alterations we looked for differences in visual event-related potentials (EEG) between Asperger observers and matched controls while they observed simple checkerboard stimuli. Methods: In a balanced oddball paradigm checkerboards of two checksizes (0.6 degrees and 1.2 degrees) were presented with different frequencies. Participants counted the occurrence times of the rare fine or rare coarse checkerboards in different experimental conditions. We focused on early visual ERP differences as a function of checkerboard size and the classical P3b ERP component as an indicator of cognitive processing. Results: We found an early (100-200 ms after stimulus onset) occipital ERP effect of checkerboard size (dominant spatial frequency). This effect was weaker in the Asperger than in the control observers. Further a typical parietal/central oddball-P3b occurred at 500 ms with the rare checkerboards. The P3b showed a right-hemispheric lateralization, which was more prominent in Asperger than in control observers. Discussion: The difference in the early occipital ERP effect between the two groups may be a physiological marker of differences in the processing of small visual details in Asperger observers compared to normal controls. The stronger lateralization of the P3b in Asperger observers may indicate a stronger involvement of the right-hemispheric network of bottom-up attention. The lateralization of the P3b signal might be a compensatory consequence of the compromised early checksize effect. Higher-level analytical information processing units may need to compensate for difficulties in low-level signal analysis.

Prestimulus frontal-parietal coherence predicts auditory detection performance in rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; oscillation; synchrony	SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; MU-RHYTHM; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS	Electrophysiology in primates has implicated long-range neural coherence as a potential mechanism for enhancing sensory detection. To test whether local synchronization and long-range neural coherence support detection performance in rats, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in frontal and parietal cortex while rats performed an auditory detection task. We observed significantly elevated power at multiple low frequencies (<15 Hz) preceding the target beep when the animal failed to respond to the signal (misses), in both frontal and parietal cortex. In terms of long-range coherence, we observed significantly more frontal-parietal coherence in the beta band (15-30 Hz) before the signal on misses compared with hits. This effect persisted after regressing away linear trends in the coherence values during a session, showing that the excess frontal-parietal beta coherence prior to misses cannot be explained by slow motivational changes during a session. In addition, a trend toward higher low-frequency (<15 Hz) coherence prior to miss trials compared with hits became highly significant when we rereferenced the LFPs to the mean voltage on each recording array, suggesting that the results are specific to our frontal and parietal areas. These results do not support a role for long-range frontal-parietal coherence or local synchronization in facilitating the detection of external stimuli. Rather, they extend to long-range frontal-parietal coherence previous findings that correlate local synchronization of low-frequency (<15 Hz) oscillations with inattention to external stimuli and synchronization of beta rhythms (15-30 Hz) with voluntary or involuntary prolongation of the current cognitive or motor state.

Phase-Amplitude Coupling and Interlaminar Synchrony Are Correlated in Human Neocortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical column; high-gamma; human cortex; phase-amplitude coupling; synchrony; theta	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG; HZ; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; CIRCUITS; DYNAMICS; SPIKING; RHYTHM	One of the striking manifestations of neuronal population activity is that of rhythmic oscillations in the local field potential. It is thought that such oscillatory patterns, including phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and inter-regional synchrony, mayrepresent forms of local and long-range cortical computations, respectively. Although it has been speculated that these two oscillatory patterns are functionally related, and bind disparate cortical assemblies to one another at different timescales, there is little direct evidence to support this hypothesis. We have demonstrated recently that theta to high-gamma PAC and interlaminar phase coherence at theta frequencies can be generated in human cortical slices maintained in vitro. Here we show that not only do such oscillatory patterns exist within human temporal neocortex, but that the strength of one is related to the strength of the other. We demonstrate that at theta frequencies, metrics of temporal synchrony between superficial and deep cortical laminae (phase-dependent power correlations, and phase coherence) are correlated to the magnitude of intralaminar PAC between theta and high-gamma. Specifically, our results suggest that interlaminar communication within human temporal neocortex and local laminar excitability are linked to one another through a dependence mediated by theta oscillations. More generally, our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that theta oscillations may coordinate inter-areal excitability in the human brain.

Based on this dual characteristic mu suppression is thought to signalize activation of a human analogue of the mirror neuron system (MNS) found in macaque monkeys. However, much uncertainty remains concerning its specificity and full significance. To further explore the hypothesized relationship between mu suppression and MNS activation, we investigated how it is affected by damage to cortical regions, including areas where the MNS is thought to reside. EEG was recorded in 33 first-event stroke patients during observation of video clips showing reaching and grasping hand movements. We examined the modulation of EEG oscillations at central and occipital sites, and analyzed separately the lower (8-10 Hz) and higher (10-12 Hz) segments of the alpha/mu range. Suppression was determined relative to observation of a non-biological movement Normalized lesion data were used to investigate how damage to regions of the fronto-parietal cortex affects the pattern of suppression. The magnitude of mu suppression during action observation was significantly reduced in the affected hemisphere compared to the unaffected hemisphere. Differences between the hemispheres were significant at central (sensorimotor) sites but not at occipital (visual) sites. Total hemispheric volume loss did not correlate with mu suppression. Suppression in the lower mu range in the unaffected hemisphere (C3) correlated with lesion extent within the right inferior parietal cortex. Our lesion study supports the role of mu suppression as a marker of MNS activation, confirming previous studies in normal subjects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Effects of Individual Upper Alpha Neurofeedback in ADHD: An Open-Label Pilot Study	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						ADHD; Neurofeedback; Individual upper alpha; Cognitive performance; EEG	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; THETA/BETA RATIO; EEG ALPHA; FOLLOW-UP; CHILDREN; HYPERACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; IMPULSIVITY; PERFORMANCE	Standardized neurofeedback (NF) protocols have been extensively evaluated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, such protocols do not account for the large EEG heterogeneity in ADHD. Thus, individualized approaches have been suggested to improve the clinical outcome. In this direction, an open-label pilot study was designed to evaluate a NF protocol of relative upper alpha power enhancement in fronto-central sites. Upper alpha band was individually determined using the alpha peak frequency as an anchor point. 20 ADHD children underwent 18 training sessions. Clinical and neurophysiological variables were measured pre- and post-training. EEG was recorded pre- and post-training, and pre- and post-training trials within each session, in both eyes closed resting state and eyes open task-related activity. A power EEG analysis assessed long-term and within-session effects, in the trained parameter and in all the sensors in the (1-30) Hz spectral range. Learning curves over sessions were assessed as well. Parents rated a clinical improvement in children regarding inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Neurophysiological tests showed an improvement in working memory, concentration and impulsivity (decreased number of commission errors in a continuous performance test). Relative and absolute upper alpha power showed long-term enhancement in task-related activity, and a positive learning curve over sessions. The analysis of within-session effects showed a power decrease ("rebound" effect) in task-related activity, with no significant effects during training trials. We conclude that the enhancement of the individual upper alpha power is effective in improving several measures of clinical outcome and cognitive performance in ADHD. This is the first NF study evaluating such a protocol in ADHD. A controlled evaluation seems warranted due to the positive results obtained in the current study.

In contrast, most forms of meditation ask for a down-regulation of certain mental processing activities while remaining fully conscious. To identify the physiological properties of conscious states with decreased mental and cognitive processing, the electrical brain activity (64 channels of EEG) of 50 participants of various meditation proficiencies was measured during distinct and idiosyncratic meditative tasks. The tasks comprised a wakeful "thoughtless emptiness (TE)," a "focused attention," and an "open monitoring" task asking for mindful presence in the moment and in the environment without attachment to distracting thoughts. Our analysis mainly focused on 30 highly experienced meditators with at least 5 years and 1000 h of meditation experience. Spectral EEG power comparisons of the TE state with the resting state or other forms of meditation showed decreased activities in specific frequency bands. In contrast to a focused attention task the TE task showed significant central and parietal gamma decreases (p < 0.05). Compared to open monitoring TE expressed decreased alpha and beta amplitudes, mainly in parietal areas (p < 0.01). TE presented significantly less delta (p < 0.001) and theta (p < 0.05) waves than a wakeful closed eyes resting condition. A group of participants with none or little meditation practice did not present those differences significantly. Our findings indicate that a conscious state of TE reached by experienced meditators is characterized by reduced high-frequency brain processing with simultaneous reduction of the low frequencies. This suggests that such a state of meditative conscious awareness might be different from higher cognitive and mentally focused states but also from states of sleep and drowsiness.

This study aims to investigate whether neurofeedback (NF) training can improve working memory (WM) performance in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The NF group (n = 40) underwent eight NF sessions and was compared to a non-interventional control group (n = 20). The NF protocol aimed to increase the individual upper alpha power in the parieto-occipital area of the scalp. Main cognitive variable was WM, which was measured pre- and post-training along with other variables such as attention and executive functions. EEG was recorded in both eyes closed resting state and eyes open task-related activity, pre- and post- NF training, and pre- and post- the NF trials within each session. A power EEG analysis and an alpha asymmetry analysis were conducted at the sensor level. Frequency domain standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA) was used to assess the effect at brain source level. Correlation analysis between the clinical/cognitive and EEG measurements was conducted at both the sensor and brain source level. The NF group showed increased performance as well as improved processing speed in a WM test after the training. The NF group showed pre-post enhancement in the upper alpha power after the training, better visible in task-related activity as compared to resting state. A current density increase appeared in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) for the NF group, localized in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, BA 25). A positive correlation was found for the NF group between the improvement in processing speed and the increase of beta power at both the sensor and brain source level. These results show the effectiveness of this NF protocol in improving WM performance in patients with MDD.

However, its small size and location deep within the brain have impeded direct investigation in humans with non-invasive techniques. Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 8 volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding. Neocortical-ATN theta oscillatory phase synchrony of local field potentials and neocortical-theta-to-ATN-gamma cross-frequency coupling during presentation of complex photographic scenes predicted later memory for the pictures, demonstrating a key role for the ATN in human memory encoding.

Oscillatory Coupling Reveals the Dynamic Reorganization of Large-scale Neural Networks as Cognitive Demands Change	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG; ATTENTION; MEMORY; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATIONS; MAINTENANCE; CORTEX; THETA; MEG	Cognitive operations are thought to emerge from dynamic interactions between spatially distinct brain areas. Synchronization of oscillations has been proposed to regulate these interactions, but we do not know whether this large-scale synchronization can respond rapidly to changing cognitive demands. Here we show that, as task demands change during a trial, multiple distinct networks are dynamically formed and reformed via oscillatory synchronization. Distinct frequency-coupled networks were rapidly formed to process reward value, maintain information in visual working memory, and deploy visual attention. Strong single-trial correlations showed that networks formed even before the presentation of imperative stimuli could predict the strength of subsequent networks, as well as the speed and accuracy of behavioral responses seconds later. These frequency-coupled networks better predicted single-trial behavior than either local oscillations or ERPs. Our findings demonstrate the rapid reorganization of networks formed by dynamic activity in response to changing task demands within a trial.	[Reinhart, Robert M.

Functional connectivity has been studied by analyzing the correlation between coherent neural oscillations in different areas of the brain. In electro- or magneto-encephalography, coherent source reconstruction in a source-space is very tricky due to power leaking from the correlation among the sources. For this reason, most studies have been limited to sensor-space analyses, which give doubtful results because of volume current mixing. The direct visualization of coherent brain oscillations can circumvent this problem. The feasibility of this idea was demonstrated by conducting phantom experiments with a SQUID-based, micro-Tesla NMR/MRI system. We introduce an experimental trick, an effective step-up of the measurement B-field in a pulse sequence, to decouple the magnetic resonance signal from the strong magneto-encephalographic signal at the same frequency.

Methods: The entire long-term intracranial monitoring sessions of 12 consecutive patients were evaluated on an XLTEK system for ISA. Three additional patients had long-term scalp recordings. Results: In intracranial as well as scalp recordings, the ISA background was consistently higher in the waking state than during sleep. From this background emerged intermittently focal changes, which could achieve in intracranial recordings millivolt amplitudes, while they remained in the microvolt range in scalp recordings. Although they were mainly contiguous between adjacent channels, this was not necessarily the case and intermittent build-up could be seen distant from the epileptogenic zone or radiographic lesion. Conclusions: Interictal ISA can be detected in routine intracranial and scalp recordings, without the need for DC amplifiers, and can provide additional information. Significance: Since ISA is a separate element of the electromagnetic spectrum, apparently non-neuronal in origin, its assessment should be included not only in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy patients but also in patients with other neurologic disorders and normal volunteers.

In previous studies low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used, with positive behavioral and electrophysiological results, for the experimental treatment in ASD. In this study we combined prefrontal rTMS sessions with electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) to prolong and reinforce TMS-induced EEG changes. The pilot trial recruited 42 children with ASD (similar to 14.5 years). Outcome measures included behavioral evaluations and reaction time test with event-related potential (ERP) recording. For the main goal of this exploratory study we used rTMS-neurofeedback combination (TMS-NFB, N = 20) and waitlist (WTL, N = 22) groups to examine effects of 18 sessions of integrated rTMS-NFB treatment or wait period) on behavioral responses, stimulus and response-locked ERPs, and other functional and clinical outcomes. The underlying hypothesis was that combined TMS-NFB will improve executive functions in autistic patients as compared to the WTL group. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were collected in pre- and post-treatment tests in both groups. Results of the study supported our hypothesis by demonstration of positive effects of combined TMS-NFB neurotherapy in active treatment group as compared to control WTL group, as the TMS-NFB group showed significant improvements in behavioral and functional outcomes as compared to the WTL group.

Microelectrode is contacted more close to neurons than macroelectrode and it is more sensitive to neuron activity changes than macroelectrode. Microwire iEEG recordings are inevitably advantageous over macrowire iEEG recordings to reveal neuronal mechanisms contributing to the generation of seizures. In this study, we investigate the seizure generation from microwire iEEG recordings and discuss synchronization of microwire iEEGs in four frequency bands: alpha (1-30 Hz), gamma (30-80 Hz), ripple (80-250 Hz), and fast ripple (> 250 Hz) via two measures: correlation and phase synchrony. We find that an increase trend of correlation or phase synchrony exists before the macroseizure onset mostly in gamma and ripple bands where the duration of the preictal states varied in different seizures ranging up to a few seconds (minutes). This finding is contrast to the well-known result that a decrease of synchronization in macro domains exists before the macroseizure onset. The finding demonstrates that it is only when the seizure has recruited enough surrounding brain tissue does the signal become strong enough to be observed on the clinical macroelectrode and as a result support the hypothesis of progressive coalescence of microseizure domains. The potential ramifications of such an early detection of microscale seizure activity may open a new window on treatment by making possible disruption of seizure activity before it becomes fully established.

Implantation of central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) electrodes was chosen, as this treatment has been reported to display beneficial effects with respect to behavioural responsiveness in DOC. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations were recorded from central thalamic electrodes and their changes elicited by speech stimuli consisting either of familiar voices addressing the patient or unfamiliar non-addressing phrases were studied. In response to familiar-addressing speech we observed modulation of oscillatory activity in the beta and theta band within the central thalamus accompanied by an increase in thalamocortical coherence in the theta band. Furthermore, the theta phase was coupled to the amplitude of gamma locally in the thalamus. These findings indicate a local and long-range cross-frequency response which is not only indicative of the principle involvement of the central thalamus in processing emotional and cognitive information, but also point towards intact physiological functions that may serve as a marker in diagnosing DOC patients and determining novel targets and parameters concerning therapeutic efforts.

Many ICs may be identified with a precise physiological or non-physiological origin. However, this process is hindered by partial instability in ICA results that can arise from noise in the data. Here we propose RELICA (RELiable ICA), a novel method to characterize IC reliability within subjects. RELICA first computes IC "dipolarity" a measure of physiological plausibility, plus a measure of IC consistency across multiple decompositions of bootstrap versions of the input data. RELICA then uses these two measures to visualize and cluster the separated ICs, providing a within-subject measure of IC reliability that does not involve checking for its occurrence across subjects. We demonstrate the use of RELICA on EEG data recorded from 14 subjects performing a working memory experiment and show that many brain and ocular artifact ICs are correctly classified as "stable" (highly repeatable across decompositions of bootstrapped versions of the input data). Many stable ICs appear to originate in the brain, while other stable ICs account for identifiable non-brain processes such as line noise. RELICA might be used with any linear blind source separation algorithm to reduce the risk of basing conclusions on unstable or physiologically un-interpretable component processes.

J	Perucca, P; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J				Perucca, Piero; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean			Intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns: effect of underlying pathology	BRAIN			English	Article						intracranial EEG; seizure-onset; lesional epilepsy; low-voltage fast activity; high-frequency oscillations	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NMDA RECEPTOR ENCEPHALITIS; FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; DEPTH ELECTRODE; EPILEPTOGENESIS; MECHANISMS; ILAE; CLASSIFICATION	Because seizures originate from different pathological substrates, the question arises of whether distinct or similar mechanisms underlie seizure generation across different pathologies. Better defining intracranial electroencephalographic morphological patterns at seizure-onset could improve the understanding of such mechanisms. To this end, we investigated intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns associated with different epileptogenic lesions, and defined high-frequency oscillation correlates of each pattern. We analysed representative seizure types from 33 consecutive patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and a structural magnetic resonance imaging lesion (11 mesial temporal sclerosis, nine focal cortical dysplasia, six cortical atrophy, three periventricular nodular heterotopia, three polymicrogyria, and one tuberous sclerosis complex) who underwent depth-electrode electroencephalographic recordings (500 Hz filter, 2000 Hz sampling rate). Patients were included only if seizures arose from contacts located in lesional/peri-lesional tissue, and if clinical manifestations followed the electrographic onset. Seizure-onset patterns were defined independently by two reviewers blinded to clinical information, and consensus was reached after discussion. For each seizure, pre-ictal and ictal sections were selected for high-frequency oscillation analysis. Seven seizure-onset patterns were identified across the 53 seizures sampled: low-voltage fast activity (43%); low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes (21%); sharp activity at 13 Hz (15%); spike-and-wave activity (9%); burst of high-amplitude polyspikes (6%); burst suppression (4%); and delta brush (4%). Each pattern occurred across several pathologies, except for periodic spikes, only observed with mesial temporal sclerosis, and delta brush, exclusive to focal cortical dysplasia. However, mesial temporal sclerosis was not always associated with periodic spikes nor focal cortical dysplasia with delta brush. Compared to other patterns, low-voltage fast activity was associated with a larger seizure-onset zone (P = 0.04). Four patterns, sharp activity at 13 Hz, low-voltage fast activity, spike-and-wave activity and periodic spikes, were also found in regions of seizure spread, with periodic spikes only emerging from mesial temporal sclerosis. Each of the seven patterns was accompanied by a significant increase in high-frequency oscillations upon seizure-onset. Overall, our data indicate that: (i) biologically-distinct epileptogenic lesions share intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns, suggesting that different pathological substrates can affect similarly networks or mechanisms underlying seizure generation; (ii) certain pathologies are associated with intracranial electroencephalographic signatures at seizure-onset, e.g. periodic spikes which may reflect mechanisms specific to mesial temporal sclerosis; (iii) some seizure-onset patterns, including periodic spikes, can also be found in regions of spread, which cautions against relying on the morphology of the initial discharge to define the epileptogenic zone; and (iv) high-frequency oscillations increase at seizure-onset, independently of the pattern.

The study aimed at investigating the role of functional connectivity between and within different brain regions in relation to the progression of cognitive deficit in MCI. The EEG was recorded in two sessions during eyes closed and eyes open resting conditions. Functional brain connectivity was investigated based on the measurement of phase synchronization in different frequency bands. Delta and theta synchronization characteristics indicated decreased level of local and large-scale connectivity in the patients within the frontal, between the frontal and temporal, and frontal and parietal brain areas which was more pronounced 1 year later. As a consequence of opening the eyes connectivity in the alphal band within the parietal lobe decreased compared to the eyes closed condition but only in the control group. The lack of alpha1 band reactivity following eye opening could reliably differentiate patients from controls. Our preliminary results support the notion that the functional disconnection between distant brain areas is a characteristic feature of MCI, and may prove to be predictive in terms of the progression of this condition.

However, small-world cortical functional networks during auditory oddball tasks and their relationships with symptom severity scores in schizophrenia have not yet been investigated. In this study, the small-world characteristics of source-level functional connectivity networks of EEG responses elicited by an auditory oddball paradigm were evaluated using two representative graph-theoretical measures, clustering coefficient and path length. EEG signals from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls were recorded while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. The results showed reduced clustering coefficients and increased path lengths in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that the small-world functional network is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the negative and cognitive symptom components of positive and negative symptom scales were negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient and positively correlated with path length, demonstrating that both indices are indicators of symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia. Our study results suggest that disrupted small-world characteristics are potential biomarkers for patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Enhanced synchronization of gamma activity between frontal lobes during REM sleep as a function of REM sleep deprivation in man	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						REM sleep deprivation; Synchronized EEG activity; EEG temporal coupling; Gamma activity; Frontal lobes	INTERHEMISPHERIC EEG COHERENCE; MEMORY FUNCTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WAKEFULNESS; OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION; DYNAMICS; WAKING; CORTEX	Studies have shown that synchrony or temporal coupling of gamma activity is involved in processing and integrating information in the brain. Comparing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to waking and non-REM (NREM) sleep, interhemispheric temporal coupling is higher, but lower between the frontal and posterior association areas of the same hemisphere. However, the homeostatic response of REM sleep temporal coupling after selective REM sleep deprivation (REMD) has not been studied. This study proposed exploring the effect of one night of selective REMD on the temporal coupling of cortical gamma activity during recovery REM sleep. Two groups of healthy subjects were subjected to either REMD by awakening them at each REM sleep onset, or to NREM sleep interruptions. Subjects slept four consecutive nights in the laboratory: first for adaptation, second as baseline, third for sleep manipulation, and fourth for recovery. Interhemispheric and intrahemispheric EEG correlations were analyzed during tonic REM (no eye movements) for the first three REM sleep episodes during baseline sleep, and recovery sleep after one night of selective REMD. Temporal coupling between frontal lobes showed a significant homeostatic rebound that increased during recovery REM sleep relative to baseline and controls. Results showed a rebound in temporal coupling between the two frontal lobes after REM sleep deprivation, indicating that the enhanced gamma temporal coupling that occurs normally during REM sleep has functional consequences. Conclusion: results suggest that synchronized activity during REM sleep may play an important role in integrating and reprocessing information.

J	Bamdadian, A; Guan, CT; Ang, KK; Xu, JX				Bamdadian, Atieh; Guan, Cuntai; Ang, Kai Keng; Xu, Jianxin			The predictive role of pre-cue EEG rhythms on MI-based BCI classification performance	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Motor imagery; EEG rhythms; Performance prediction	SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; ALPHA; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; SHIFT	Background: One of the main issues in motor imagery-based (MI-based) brain-computer interface (BC!) systems is a large variation in the classification performance of BC! users. However, the exact reason of low performance of some users is still under investigation. Having some prior knowledge about the performance of users may be helpful in understanding possible reasons of performance variations. New method: In this study a novel coefficient from pre-cue EEG rhythms is proposed. The proposed coefficient is computed from the spectral power of pre-cue EEG data for specific rhythms over different regions of the brain. The feasibility of predicting the classification performance of the MI-based BCI users from the proposed coefficient is investigated. Results: Group level analysis on N=17 healthy subjects showed that there is a significant correlation r=0.53 (p=0.02) between the proposed coefficient and the cross-validation accuracies of the subjects in performing MI. The results showed that subjects with higher cross-validation accuracies have yielded significantly higher values of the proposed coefficient and vice versa. Comparison with existing methods: In comparison with other previous predictors, this coefficient captures spatial information from the brain in addition to spectral information. Conclusion: The result of using the proposed coefficient suggests that having higher frontal theta and lower posterior alpha prior to performing MI may enhance the BCI classification performance. This finding reveals prospect of designing a novel experiment to prepare the user towards improved motor imagery performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Global field synchronization (GFS) can measure functional synchronization in frequency-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The aim of this study is to explore GFS values and its clinical significance for severity of cognitive decline in AD. EEGs were recorded from 37 AD patients and 37 age-matched healthy individuals. GFS values were calculated in delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma, and full frequency bands. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were employed to assess symptom severity in AD patients. Correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis were performed to analyze the relationship between GFS values and MoCA scores in AD patients. GFS values of the beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and full bands were lower in AD patients than in healthy individuals, and positively correlated with MoCA and CDR scores in the combined group (AD patients and healthy individuals). GFS values were positively correlated with MoCA socres in 3 beta bands and full bands, and with CDR scores in the delta band. There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating of GFS values and MoCA scoring (kappa = .913, P < .001). In conclusion, the present results indicated that GFS can serve as an indicator of cognitive decline or impairment in AD patients. Furthermore, the GFS method of EEG holds considerable promise to distinguish mild cognitive impairment from serious cognitive impairment in patients with AD.

In addition, top-down modulation of visual processing has previously been demonstrated during cognitive operations including selective attention and working memory tasks. In the absence of a stable gravitational reference, the updating of salient stimuli becomes crucial for successful visuo-spatial behavior by humans in weightlessness. Here we found that visually-evoked potentials triggered by the image of a tunnel just prior to an impending 3D movement in a virtual navigation task were altered in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station, while those evoked by a classical 2D-checkerboard were not. Specifically, the analysis of event-related spectral perturbations and inter-trial phase coherency of these EEG signals recorded in the frontal and occipital areas showed that phase-locking of theta-alpha oscillations was suppressed in weightlessness, but only for the 3D tunnel image. Moreover, analysis of the phase of the coherency demonstrated the existence on Earth of a directional flux in the EEG signals from the frontal to the occipital areas mediating a top-down modulation during the presentation of the image of the 3D tunnel. In weightlessness, this fronto-occipital, top-down control was transformed into a diverging flux from the central areas toward the frontal and occipital areas. These results demonstrate that gravity-related sensory inputs modulate primary visual areas depending on the affordances of the visual scene.

Clinical studies investigating the viability of ASSR under total intravenous anesthesia have not been performed. Methods: During craniotomy under total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil in 20 patients, ASSR were recorded. An additional control patient undergoing cerebellopontine angle surgery was included, in whom the auditory nerve could not be preserved. One-minute sinus tones (500, 1,000, 2,000 Hz) were applied with 60-, 70-, and 80-decibel hearing level. Stimuli were amplitude modulated with 40, 90, or 110 Hz and applied monaurally to the left and right ears. Time to detect a significant response and response amplitudes at 40, 90, or 110 Hz in the evoked EEG spectra was evaluated. Results: Overall, 90-Hz ASSR were successfully detected in all 20 patients, 110 Hz in 18 patients, and 40 Hz in 14 patients after a median of 10 seconds. No ASSR could be detected in the control patient at the end of the surgical procedure. Time-to-significance and ASSR amplitudes were influenced by stimulus intensity, carrier, and modulation frequency (Scheirer-Ray-Hare test, P<0.005). Ipsilateral responses were higher than contralateral (P<0.0001). Conclusions: In conclusion, 90-and 110-Hz ASSR can be reliably detected under total intravenous anesthesia. Our results are in line with those from previous studies in awake patients. Auditory steady-state response during anesthesia may enable intraoperative frequency-specific audiometry and monitoring of the auditory nerve.

First and despite the fact that the mu rhythm can be functionally segregated in two discrete sub-bands, 8-10 Hz and 10-12/13 Hz, mu-suppression in ASD has been analyzed as a homogeneous phenomenon covering the 8-13 Hz frequency. Second and although alpha-like activity is usually found across the entire scalp, ASD studies of action observation have focused on the central electrodes (C3/C4). The present study was aimed at testing on the whole brain the hypothesis of a functional dissociation of mu and alpha responses to the observation of human actions in ASD according to bandwidths. Electroencephalographic (EEG) mu and alpha responses to execution and observation of hand gestures were recorded on the whole scalp in high functioning subjects with ASD and typical subjects. When two bandwidths of the alpha-mu 8-13 Hz were distinguished, a different mu response to observation appeared for subjects with ASD in the upper sub-band over the sensorimotor cortex, whilst the lower sub-band responded similarly in the two groups. Source reconstructions demonstrated that this effect was related to a joint mu-suppression deficit over the occipito-parietal regions and an increase over the frontal regions. These findings suggest peculiarities in top-down response modulation in ASD and question the claim of a global dysfunction of the MNS in autism. This research also advocates for the use of finer grained analyses at both spatial and spectral levels for future directions in neurophysiological accounts of autism.

Association of aberrant neural synchrony and altered GAD67 expression following exposure to maternal immune activation, a risk factor for schizophrenia	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NMDA RECEPTORS; ANIMAL-MODEL; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; INTERNEURONS; PERSISTENCE	A failure of integrative processes within the brain, mediated via altered GABAergic inhibition, may underlie several features of schizophrenia. The present study examined, therefore, whether maternal immune activation (MIA), a risk factor for schizophrenia, altered inhibitory markers in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while also altering electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence between these regions. Pregnant rats were treated with saline or polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid mid-gestation. EEG depth recordings were made from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and mPFC of male adult offspring. Glutamic decarboxylase (GAD67) levels were separately assayed in these regions using western blot. GAD67 expression was also assessed within parvalbumin-positive cells in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus using immunofluorescence alongside stereological analysis of parvalbumin-positive cell numbers. EEG coherence was reduced between the dorsal hippocampus and mPFC, but not the ventral hippocampus and mPFC, in MIA animals. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that GAD67 expression within parvalbumin-positive cells was also reduced in the dorsal hippocampus relative to ventral hippocampus in MIA animals when compared with controls. This reduction was observed in the absence of parvalbumin-positive neuronal loss. Overall, MIA produced a selective reduction in EEG coherence between the dorsal hippocampus and mPFC that was paralleled by a similarly specific reduction in GAD67 within parvalbumin-positive cells of the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest a link between altered inhibitory mechanisms and synchrony and, therefore point to potential mechanisms via which a disruption in neurodevelopmental processes might lead to pathophysiology associated with schizophrenia.

Granger causality (GC) is one of the most popular methods to explore causality relationship between different brain regions. In 2011, Hu et. al [1] pointed out shortcomings and/or limitations of GC by using a large of number of illustrative examples and showed that GC is only a causality definition in the sense of Granger and does not reflect real causality at all, and meanwhile proposed a new causality (NC) which is shown to be more reasonable and understandable than GC by those examples. Motor imagery (MI) is an important mental process in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology and has received growing attention for a long time. However, there is few work about causality flow so far during MI based on scalp EEG. In this paper, we use scalp EEG to study causality flow during MI. The scalp EEGs are from 9 subjects in BCI competition IV held in 2008 [2] and provided by Graz University of Technology. We are interested in three regions: Cz (the centre of cerebral cortex), C3 (the left of cerebral cortex) and C4 (the right of cerebral cortex) which are considered to be optimal locations for recognizing MI states in literature. We apply GC and NC to scalp EEG and find that i) there is strong directional connectivity from Cz to C3/C4 during left hand and right hand MI based on GC and NC. ii) During left hand MI, there is directional connectivity from C4 to C3 based on GC and NC. iii) During right hand MI, there is strong directional connectivity from C3 to C4 which is much clearly revealed by NC method than by GC method. iv) Our results suggest that NC method in time and frequency domains is demonstrated to be much better to reveal causal influence between different brain regions than GC method. Thus, we deeply believe that NC method will shed new light on causality analysis in economics and neuroscience.

The last decades have seen a growing interest in the automatic detection of such states from voice, facial expression, and physiological signals, primarily with the goal of enhancing human-computer interaction with an affective component. With the advent of brain-computer interface research, the idea of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCI), enabling affect detection from brain signals, arose. In this article, we set out to survey the field of neurophysiology-based affect detection. We outline possible applications of aBCI in a general taxonomy of brain-computer interface approaches and introduce the core concepts of affect and their neurophysiological fundamentals. We show that there is a growing body of literature that evidences the capabilities, but also the limitations and challenges of affect detection from neurophysiological activity.

The former starts from the study of the detailed functioning of a small number of neuronal assemblies, while the latter tries to decode brain functioning by considering the brain as a whole. This review discusses the top-down approach and the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to describe global brain properties. The main idea behind this approach is that the concurrence of several areas is required for the brain to instantiate a specific behavior/functioning. A central issue is therefore the study of brain functional connectivity and the concept of brain networks as ensembles of distant brain areas that preferentially exchange information. Importantly, the human brain is a dynamic device, and MEG is ideally suited to investigate phenomena on behaviorally relevant timescales, also offering the possibility of capturing behaviorally-related brain connectivity dynamics.

However, the time-frequency representation of ERPs by higher-order tensors are usually large-scale, which prevents the popularity of most tensor factorization algorithms. To overcome this issue, we introduce a non-negative canonical polyadic decomposition (NCPD) based on low-rank approximation (LRA) and hierarchical alternating least square (HALS) techniques. We applied NCPD (LRAHALS and benchmark HALS) and CPD to extract multi-domain features of a visual ERP. The features and components extracted by LRAHALS NCPD and HALS NCPD were very similar, but LRAHALS NCPD was 70 times faster than HALS NCPD. Moreover, the desired multi-domain feature of the ERP by NCPD showed a significant group difference (control versus depressed participants) and a difference in emotion processing (fearful versus happy faces). This was more satisfactory than that by CPD, which revealed only a group difference.

Inhibiting such responses seems to come more easily to some of us than others, however. From where do these individual differences originate? Here, we measured 263 participants' neural baseline activation using resting electroencephalogram. Then, we used this stable neural marker to predict a reliable electrophysiological index of response inhibition capacity in the cued Continuous Performance Test, the NoGo-Anteriorization (NGA). Using a source-localization technique, we found that resting delta, theta, and alpha1 activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and resting alpha1 activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus were negatively correlated with the NGA. As a larger NGA is thought to represent better response inhibition capacity, our findings demonstrate that lower levels of resting slow-wave oscillations in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, are associated with a better response inhibition capacity.

Slow modulations of high-frequency activity (40-140 Hz) discriminate preictal changes in human focal epilepsy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SEIZURE PREDICTION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP STAGE; EEG; ONSET; POWER; MACROELECTRODES; SYNCHRONIZATION; GENERATION; WORKSHOP	Recent evidence suggests that some seizures are preceded by preictal changes that start from minutes to hours before an ictal event. Nevertheless an adequate statistical evaluation in a large database of continuous multiday recordings is still missing. Here, we investigated the existence of preictal changes in long-term intracranial recordings from 53 patients with intractable partial epilepsy (in total 531 days and 558 clinical seizures). We describe a measure of brain excitability based on the slow modulation of high-frequency gamma activities (40-140 Hz) in ensembles of intracranial contacts. In prospective tests, we found that this index identified preictal changes at levels above chance in 13.2% of the patients (7/53), suggesting that results may be significant for the whole group(p < 0.05). These results provide a demonstration that preictal states can be detected prospectively from EEG data. They advance understanding of the network dynamics leading to seizure and may help develop novel seizure prediction algorithms.

J	Chen, LL; Zhang, J; Zou, JZ; Zhao, CJ; Wang, GS				Chen, Lan-Lan; Zhang, Jian; Zou, Jun-Zhong; Zhao, Chen-Jie; Wang, Gui-Song			A framework on wavelet-based nonlinear features and extreme learning machine for epileptic seizure detection	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Seizure detection; Wavelet decomposition; Approximate entropy (ApEn); Sample entropy (SampEn); Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA); Extreme learning machine (ELM); Support vector machine (SVM)	RECURRENCE QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS; SAMPLE ENTROPY; EEG; PLOTS; ONSET; TOOL	Background: Many investigations based on nonlinear methods have been carried out for the research of seizure detection. However, some of these nonlinear measures cannot achieve satisfying performance without considering the basic rhythms of epileptic EEGs. New method: To overcome the defects, this paper proposed a framework on wavelet-based nonlinear features and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the seizure detection. Three nonlinear methods, i.e., approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) were computed from orignal EEG signals and corresponding wavelet decomposed sub-bands separately. The wavelet-based energy was measured as the comparative. Then the combination of sub-band features was fed to ELM and SVM classifier respectively. Results: The decomposed sub-band signals show significant discrimination between interictal and ictal states and the union of sub-band features helps to achieve better detection. All the three nonlinear methods show higher sensitivity than the wavelet-based energy analysis using the proposed framework. The wavelet-based SampEn-ELM detector reaches the best performance with a sensitivity of 92.6% and a false detection rate (FDR) of 0.078. Compared with SVM, the ELM detector is better in terms of detection accuracy and learning efficiency. Comparison with existing method(s): The decomposition of original signals into sub-bands leads to better identification of seizure events compared with that of the existing nonlinear methods without considering the time-frequency decomposition. Conclusions: The proposed framework achieves not only a high detection accuracy but also a very fast learning speed, which makes it feasible for the further development of the automatic seizure detection system.

Methods We explored the relation between cognitive performance and regional GM volumes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), in order to discover if the association between gamma noise power (an electroencephalography measurement of background activity in the gamma band) and cognition is observed through structural deficits related to the disease. Noise power, magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessments were obtained in 17 drug-free paranoid patients with schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls. Results In comparison with controls, patients showed GM deficits at posterior cingulate (bilateral),left inferior parietal (supramarginal gyrus) and left inferior dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Patients exhibited a direct association between performance in working memory and right temporal (superior and inferior gyri) GM densities. They also displayed a negative association between right anterior cerebellum volume and gamma noise power at the frontal midline (Fz) site. Conclusion A structural deficit in the cerebellum may be involved in gamma activity disorganization in schizophrenia. Temporal structural deficits may relate to cognitive dysfunction in this illness.

Painful cutaneous laser stimuli induce event-related oscillatory EEG activities that are different from those induced by nonpainful electrical stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; cortex; event-related synchronization; EEG; human; pain	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; A-DELTA-FIBER; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; C-FIBER; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES	The non-phase-locked EEG response to painful stimuli has usually been characterized as decreased oscillatory activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the alpha band. Increased activity (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the gamma band has been reported more recently. We have now tested the hypothesis that the non-phase-locked responses to nonpainful electric cutaneous stimuli are different from those to painful cutaneous laser stimuli when the baseline salience of the two stimuli is the same and the salience during the protocol is modulated by count laser and count electric tasks. Both of these stimuli were presented in random order in a single train at intensities that produced the same baseline salience in the same somatic location. The response to the laser stimulus was characterized by five windows (designated windows I-V) in the time-frequency domain: early (200-400 ms) and late (600-1,400 ms) delta/theta ERS, 500-900 ms alpha ERD, 1,200-1,600 ms beta ERS (rebound), and 800-1,200 ms gamma ERS. Similar ERS/ERD windows of activity were found for the electric stimulus. Individual participants very commonly had activity in windows consistent with the overall analysis. Linear regression of ERS/ERD for parietal channels was most commonly found for sensory (pain or unpleasantness)- or attention (salience)-related measures. Overall, the main effect for modality was found in window I-delta/theta and window V-gamma, and the Modality with Task interaction was found in all five windows. All significant interaction terms included Modality as a factor. Therefore, Modality was the most common factor explaining our results, which is consistent with our hypothesis.	[Chien, J. H.; Liu, C.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 5 Mio. people in Europe with the global prevalence of AD predicted to quadruple to 106 Mio. by 2050. This chapter is focused on demonstrating models of neural circuitry and brain structures affected during neurodegeneration as a result of AD and how these model can be employed to better understand how changes in the physical basis in the electrochemical interactions at neuron/synapse level are revealed at the neural population level. The models are verified using known and observed neuropathalogical oscillations in AD. The thalamus plays a major role in generating many rhythmic brain oscillations yet, little is known about the role of the thalamus in neurodegeneration and whether or not thalamus atrophy is a primary or secondary phenomenon to hippocampal or neo cortical loss in AD. Neural mass models of thalamocortical networks are presented to investigate the role these networks have in the alterations of brain oscillation observed in AD. Whilst neural mass models offer many insights into thalamocortcial circuitry and rhythm generation in the brain, they are not suitable for elucidating changes synaptic processes and individual synaptic loss at the microscopic scale. There is significant evidence that AD is a synaptic disease. A model consisting of multiple Izhikevich type neurons elucidates now large scale networks of simple neurons can shed light on the relationship between synaptic/neuron degradation/loss and neural network oscillations. Focusing on thalamocortical circuitry may help explain oscillatory changes however the progression of AD is also usually associated with memory deficits, this implicates other brain structure such as the hippocampus. A hippocampal computational model that allows investigation of how the hippocampo-septal theta rhythms can be be altered by beta-amyloid peptide (A beta, a main marker of AD) is also described. In summary the chapter presents three different computational models of neural circuitry at different scales/brain regions and demonstrates how these models can be used to elucidate some of the vacuities in our knowledge of brain oscillations and how the symptoms associated with AD are manifested from the electrochemical interactions in neurobiology and neural populations.

Mechanisms of Epileptiform Synchronization in Cortical Neuronal Networks	CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Entorhinal cortex; extracellular Ca2+ concentration; extracellular K+ concentration; GABA; high frequency oscillations; hippocampus; ictal discharges; interictal spikes; seizure onset; temporal lobe epilepsy	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE-ONSET PATTERNS; RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; FAST RIPPLES; IN-VITRO; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; PHASIC EXCITATION; INTERICTAL SPIKES	Neuronal synchronization supports different physiological states such as cognitive functions and sleep, and it is mirrored by identifiable EEG patterns ranging from gamma to delta oscillations. However, excessive neuronal synchronization is often the hallmark of epileptic activity in both generalized and partial epileptic disorders. Here, I will review the synchronizing mechanisms involved in generating epileptiform activity in the limbic system, which is closely involved in the pathophysiogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE is often associated to a typical pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis, and it is one of the most refractory adult form of partial epilepsy. This epileptic disorder can be reproduced in animals by topical or systemic injection of pilocarpine or kainic acid, or by repetitive electrical stimulation; these procedures induce an initial status epilepticus and cause 1-4 weeks later a chronic condition of recurrent limbic seizures. Remarkably, a similar, seizure-free, latent period can be identified in TLE patients who suffered an initial insult in childhood and develop partial seizures in adolescence or early adulthood. Specifically, I will focus here on the neuronal mechanisms underlying three abnormal types of neuronal synchronization seen in both TLE patients and animal models mimicking this disorder: (i) interictal spikes; (ii) high frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz); and (iii) ictal (i.e., seizure) discharges. In addition, I will discuss the relationship between interictal spikes and ictal activity as well as recent evidence suggesting that specific seizure onsets in the pilocarpine model of TLE are characterized by distinctive patterns of spiking (also termed preictal) and high frequency oscillations.

While such studies have generated valuable insights into the neural basis of VMIL, little is known about the processes that represent the current state of VMIL independently of motor execution. Here, we present empirical evidence that a subject's performance in a 3D reaching task can be predicted on a trial-to-trial basis from pre-trial electroencephalographic (EEG) data. This evidence provides novel insights into the brain states that support successful VMIL. Methods: Six healthy subjects, attached to a seven degrees-of- freedom (DoF) robot with their right arm, practiced 3D reaching movements in a virtual space, while an EEG recorded their brain's electromagnetic field. A random forest ensemble classifier was used to predict the next trial's performance, as measured by the time needed to reach the goal, from pre-trial data using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure. Results: The learnedmodels successfully generalized to novel subjects. An analysis of the brain regions, on which the models based their predictions, revealed areas matching prevalent motor learning models. In these brain areas, the alpha/mu frequency band (8-14 Hz) was found to be most relevant for performance prediction. Conclusions: VMIL induces changes in cortical processes that extend beyond motor execution, indicating a more complex role of these processes than previously assumed. Our results further suggest that the capability of subjects to modulate their alpha/mu bandpower in brain regions associated with motor learning may be related to performance in VMIL. Accordingly, training subjects in alpha/mu- modulation, e. g., by means of a brain-computer interface (BCI), may have a beneficial impact on VMIL.

Modulation of frontal-midline theta by neurofeedback	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Fm-theta; Neurofeedback; Individualized training	EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BAND POWER; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; CORTEX; ALPHA; ADHD	Cortical oscillations demonstrate a relationship with cognition. Moreover, they also exhibit associations with task performance and psychiatric mental disorders. This being the case, the modification of oscillations has become one of the key interests of neuroscientific approaches for cognitive enhancement. For such kind of alterations, neurofeedback (NF) of brain activity constitutes a promising tool. Concerning specific higher cognitive functions, frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) has been suggested as an important indicator of relevant brain processes. This paper presents a novel approach for an individualized, eight-session NF training to enhance fm-theta. An individual's dominant fm-theta frequency was determined based on experiments tapping executive functions. Effects of the actual NF training were compared to a pseudo-NF training. Participants of the pseudo-NF training experienced a comparable degree of motivation and commitment as the subjects of the actual NF training, but found the "training" slightly easier. In comparison to the pseudo-NF training, proper NF training significantly enhanced fm-theta amplitude in the actual training sessions, as well as during the whole course of training. However, unspecific changes in the alpha and beta frequency ranges found with both the actual NF and the pseudo-NF training groups emphasize the relevance of active control groups for neurofeedback studies.

Although sleep EEG changes during adolescence index fundamental brain reorganization, a detailed analysis of sleep spindling and the spindle-intelligence relationship was not yet provided for adolescents. Therefore, adolescent development of sleep spindle oscillations were studied in a home polysomnographic study focusing on the effects of chronological age and developmentally acquired overall mental efficiency (fluid IQ) with sex as a potential modulating factor. Subjects were 24 healthy adolescents (12 males) with an age range of 15-22 years (mean: 18 years) and fluid IQ of 91-126 (mean: 104.12, Raven Progressive Matrices Test). Slow spindles (SSs) and fast spindles (FSs) were analyzed in 21 EEG derivations by using the individual adjustment method (IAM). A significant age-dependent increase in average FS density (r = 0.57; p = 0.005) was found. Moreover, fluid IQ correlated with FS density (r = 0.43; p = 0.04) and amplitude (r = 0.41; p = 0.049). The latter effects were entirely driven by particularly reliable FS-IQ correlations in females [r = 0.80 (p = 0.002) and r = 0.67 (p = 0.012), for density and amplitude, respectively]. Region-specific analyses revealed that these correlations peak in the fronto-central regions. The control of the age-dependence of FS measures and IQ scores did not considerably reduce the spindle-IQ correlations with respect to FS density. The only positive spindle-index of fluid IQ in males turned out to be the frequency of FSs (r = 0.60, p = 0.04). Increases in FS density during adolescence may index reshaped structural connectivity related to white matter maturation in the late developing human brain. The continued development over this age range of cognitive functions is indexed by specific measures of sleep spindling unraveling gender differences in adolescent brain maturation and perhaps cognitive strategy.

BNA was used for extracting group-common stimulus-activated network patterns elicited to matching probe stimuli in the context of a delayed matching-to-sample task following placebo and scopolamine treatments administered to healthy participants. The BNA extracted networks revealed the existence of two pathophysiological mechanisms following scopolamine, disconnection, and compensation. Specifically, weaker frontal theta and parietal alpha coupling was accompanied with enhanced fronto-centro-parietal theta activation relative to placebo. In addition, using the characteristic BNA network of each treatment as well as corresponding literature-guided selective subnetworks as combined biomarkers managed to differentiate between individual responses to each of the treatments. Behavioral effects associated with scopolamine included delayed response time and impaired response accuracy. These results indicate that the BNA method is sensitive to the effects of scopolamine on working memory and that it may potentially enable diagnosis and treatment assessment of dysfunctions associated with cholinergic deficiency.

Inter-regional MEG amplitude correlations in adult RSNs have been shown to be most prominent in alpha and beta frequency ranges and to express strong congruence with RSN topologies found using fMRI. Despite such advances, little is known about how oscillatory connectivity in RSNs develops throughout childhood and adolescence. This study used a novel fMRI-guided MEG approach to investigate the maturation of resting-state amplitude correlations in physiologically relevant frequency ranges within and among six RSNs in 59 participants, aged 6-34 years. We report age-related increases in inter-regional amplitude correlations that were largest in alpha and beta frequency bands. In contrast to fMRI reports, these changes were observed both within and between the various RSNs analyzed. Our results provide the first evidence of developmental changes in spontaneous neurophysiological connectivity in source-resolved RSNs, which indicate increasing integration within and among intrinsic functional brain networks throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.

Occipitoparietal alpha-band responses to the graded allocation of top-down spatial attention	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha band; attention; EEG	VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN EEG; POWER; EXCITABILITY; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISM; DISCRIMINATION; OSCILLATIONS; INCREASES; REFLECT	The voluntary, top-down allocation of visual spatial attention has been linked to changes in the alpha-band of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal measured over occipital and parietal lobes. In the present study, we investigated how occipitoparietal alpha-band activity changes when people allocate their attentional resources in a graded fashion across the visual field. We asked participants to either completely shift their attention into one hemifield, to balance their attention equally across the entire visual field, or to attribute more attention to one-half of the visual field than to the other. As expected, we found that alpha-band amplitudes decreased stronger contralaterally than ipsilaterally to the attended side when attention was shifted completely. Alpha-band amplitudes decreased bilaterally when attention was balanced equally across the visual field. However, when participants allocated more attentional resources to one-half of the visual field, this was not reflected in the alpha-band amplitudes, which just decreased bilaterally. We found that the performance of the participants was more strongly reflected in the coherence between frontal and occipitoparietal brain regions. We conclude that low alpha-band amplitudes seem to be necessary for stimulus detection. Furthermore, complete shifts of attention are directly reflected in the lateralization of alpha-band amplitudes. In the present study, a gradual allocation of visual attention across the visual field was only indirectly reflected in the alpha-band activity over occipital and parietal cortexes.

Effect of 7-Nitroindazole, a Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitor, on Behavioral and Physiological Parameters	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						7-nitroindazole; Open field test; Ladder rung walking test; Brain excitability; Blood gas analysis; Rat	MOTOR-ACTIVITY; POTENT INHIBITORS; NOS INHIBITOR; MICE LACKING; HIPPOCAMPAL; ACTIVATION; NNOS; EEG; RESPIRATION; RECEPTORS	The role of brain derived nitric oxide in the physiology and behavior remains disputable. One of the reasons of the controversies might be systemic side effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Therefore, under nNOS inhibition by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) we carried out recordings of blood gasses, blood pressure and spontaneous EEG in conscious adult rats. Locomotion and spontaneous behavior were assessed in an open field. In addition skilled walking and limb coordination were evaluated using a ladder rung walking test. The blood gas analysis revealed a significant increase in pCO2 180 min and 240 min after the application of 7-NI. The power and entropy decreased simultaneously with a shift of the mean frequency of the spontaneous EEG toward slow oscillations after 7-NI treatment. The thresholds of evoked potentials underwent a significant drop and a trend towards a slight increase in the I-O curve slope was observed. 7-NI significantly suppressed open field behavior expressed as distance moved, exploratory rearing and grooming. As for the ladder rung walking test the 7-NI treated animals had more errors in foot placement indicating impairment in limb coordination. Therefore our findings suggest that 7-NI increased cortical excitability and altered some physiological and behavioral parameters.

Our present understanding of the biophysics and physiology of T channels, however, highlights a much more diverse and complex picture of the pivotal contributions that they make to different sleep rhythms. In particular, recent experimental evidence has conclusively demonstrated the essential contribution of thalamic T channels to the expression of slow waves of natural sleep and the key role played by Ca2+ entry through these channels in the activation or modulation of other voltage-dependent channels that are important for the generation of both slow waves and sleep spindles. However, the precise contribution to sleep rhythms of T channels in cortical neurons and other sleep-controlling neuronal networks remains unknown, and a full understanding of the cellular and network mechanisms of sleep delta waves is still lacking.

Sham/verum tACS with individually determined theta frequency was applied to the left parietal (target electrode=P3) or frontal (target electrode=F3) brain areas (return electrode above the right eyebrow). After sham and verum stimulation, 24 respondents solved a task measuring the scope of attention while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Verum tACS with the target electrode positioned over the left parietal brain area significantly increased WM storage capacity, as compared to sham tACS. No such influence was observed for tACS with the target electrode positioned over the left frontal area. Increased WM storage capacity was accompanied by event-related potential (ERP) P300 latency decrease in the left hemisphere. The obtained behavioral and neuroelectric data emphasize the causal relationship between WM storage capacity and theta frequency oscillations in the left parietal brain area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Prestimulus Oscillations in the Alpha Band of the EEG Are Modulated by the Difficulty of Feature Discrimination and Predict Activation of a Sensory Discrimination Process	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PATTERN-SPECIFIC COMPONENTS; VISUAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOURCE LOCATIONS; EXTRASTRIATE; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; STRIATE; CORTEX	Recent work has demonstrated that the occipital-temporal N1 component of the ERP is sensitive to the difficulty of visual discrimination, in a manner that cannot be explained by simple differences in low-level visual features, arousal, or time on task. These observations provide evidence that the occipital-temporal N1 component is modulated by the application of top-down control. However, the timing of this control process remains unclear. Previous work has demonstrated proactive, top-down modulation of cortical excitability for cued spatial attention or feature selection tasks. Here, the possibility that a similar top-down process facilitates performance of a difficult stimulus discrimination task is explored. Participants performed an oddball task at two levels of discrimination difficulty, with difficulty manipulated by modulating the similarity between target and nontarget stimuli. Discrimination processes and cortical excitability were assessed via the amplitude of the occipital-temporal N1 component and prestimulus alpha oscillation of the EEG, respectively. For correct discriminations, prestimulus alpha power was reduced, and the occipital-temporal N1 was enhanced in the hard relative to the easy condition. Furthermore, within the hard condition, prestimulus alpha power was reduced, and the occipital-temporal N1 was enhanced for correct relative to incorrect discriminations. The generation of ERPs contingent on relative prestimulus alpha power additionally suggests that diminished alpha power preceding stimulus onset is related to enhancement of the occipital-temporal N1. As in spatial attention, proactive control appears to enhance cortical excitability and facilitate discrimination performance in tasks requiring nonspatial, feature-based attention, even in the absence of competing stimulus features.

Results from magnetoencephalography/EEG studies using near-threshold stimuli have consistently pointed to reduced levels of alpha- (8-12 Hz) power in relevant sensory areas to predict whether a stimulus will be consciously perceived or not. These findings have been mainly interpreted in strictly "local" terms of enhanced excitability of neuronal ensembles in respective cortical regions. The present study aims to introduce a framework that complements this rather local perspective, by stating that the functional connectivity architecture before stimulation will predetermine information flow. Thus, information computed at a local level will be distributed throughout a network, thereby becoming consciously accessible. Data from a previously published experiment on conscious somatosensory near-threshold perception was reanalyzed focusing on the prestimulus period. Analysis of spectral power showed reduced alpha-power mainly in the contralateral S2 and middle frontal gyrus to precede hits, thus overall supporting the current literature. Furthermore, differences between hits and misses were obtained on global network (graph theoretical) features in the same interval. Most importantly, in accordance with our framework, we could show that the somatosensory cortex is "more efficiently" integrated into a distributed network in the prestimulus period. This finding means that when a relevant sensory stimulus impinges upon the system, it will encounter preestablished pathways for information flow. In this sense, prestimulus functional connectivity patterns form "windows" to conscious perception.

Recent studies on cognition and consciousness have shown that the brain control channels are closely related to the brainwave beta (14-40 Hz) and alpha (7-13 Hz) oscillations. The high-beta wave is used by brain to synchronize local neural activities and the alpha oscillation is for desynchronization. When two sensory inputs are simultaneously presented to a person, the high-beta is used to select one of the inputs and the alpha is used to deselect the other so that only one input will get the attention. In this work we demonstrated that we can scan a person's brain using binaural beats technique and identify the individual's preferred control channels. The identified control channels can then be used to influence the subject's brain executive functions. In the experiment, an EEG measurement system was used to record and identify a subject's control channels. After these channels were identified, the subject was asked to do Stroop tests. Binaural beats was again used to produce these control-channel frequencies on the subject's brain when we recorded the completion time of each test. We found that the high-beta signal indeed speeded up the subject's executive function performance and reduced the time to complete incongruent tests, while the alpha signal didn't seem to be able to slow down the executive function performance.

Though decades of research have uncovered much about these disorders, the pathological mechanism remains unknown. Hampering efforts is the seeming inability to integrate findings over the micro to macro scales of study, from changes in molecular, synaptic and cellular function to large-scale brain dysfunction impacting sensory, communicative, motor and cognitive activity. In this review, we describe how studies focusing on neuronal circuit function provide unique context for identifying common neurobiological disease mechanisms of ASD. We discuss how recent EEG and MEG studies in subjects with ASD have repeatedly shown alterations in ensemble population recordings (both in simple evoked related potential latencies and specific frequency subcomponents). Because these disease-associated electrophysiological abnormalities have been recapitulated in rodent models, studying circuit differences in these models may provide access to abnormal circuit function found in ASD. We then identify emerging in vivo and ex vivo techniques, focusing on how these assays can characterize circuit level dysfunction and determine if these abnormalities underlie abnormal clinical electrophysiology. Such circuit level study in animal models may help us understand how diverse genetic and environmental risks can produce a common set of EEG,MEG and anatomical abnormalities found in ASD.

In the visual delayed-match-to-sample WM task young (18-26 years, N = 20) and elderly (60-71 years N = 16) adults had to memorize sample stimuli consisting of 3 or 5 items while 33 channel EEG recording was performed. The phase lag index was used to quantify connectivity strength between cortical regions. The low and high memory demanding WM maintenance periods were classified based on whether they were successfully maintained (remembered) or unsuccessfully maintained (unrecognized later). In the elderly reduced connectivity strength of FM brain region and decreased performance were observed. The connectivity strength between FM and posterior sensory cortices was shown to be sensitive to both increased memory demands and memory performance regardless of age. The coupling of frontal regions (midline and lateral) and FM-temporal cortices characterized successfully maintained trials and declined with advancing age. The findings provide evidence that a FM neural circuit of theta oscillations that serves a possible basis of active maintenance process is especially vulnerable to aging. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Critical phenomena and noise-induced phase transitions in neuronal networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; COMPLEX NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LIMIT-CYCLE; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; MODEL; ORGANIZATION; AVALANCHES	We study numerically and analytically first- and second-order phase transitions in neuronal networks stimulated by shot noise (a flow of random spikes bombarding neurons). Using an exactly solvable cortical model of neuronal networks on classical random networks, we find critical phenomena accompanying the transitions and their dependence on the shot noise intensity. We show that a pattern of spontaneous neuronal activity near a critical point of a phase transition is a characteristic property that can be used to identify the bifurcation mechanism of the transition. We demonstrate that bursts and avalanches are precursors of a first-order phase transition, paroxysmal-like spikes of activity precede a second-order phase transition caused by a saddle-node bifurcation, while irregular spindle oscillations represent spontaneous activity near a second-order phase transition caused by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Our most interesting result is the observation of the paroxysmal-like spikes. We show that a paroxysmal-like spike is a single nonlinear event that appears instantly from a low background activity with a rapid onset, reaches a large amplitude, and ends up with an abrupt return to lower activity. These spikes are similar to single paroxysmal spikes and sharp waves observed in electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements. Our analysis shows that above the saddle-node bifurcation, sustained network oscillations appear with a large amplitude but a small frequency in contrast to network oscillations near the Hopf bifurcation that have a small amplitude but a large frequency. We discuss an amazing similarity between excitability of the cortical model stimulated by shot noise and excitability of the Morris-Lecar neuron stimulated by an applied current.

An essential step in measuring PAC is decomposing data to obtain rhythmic components of interest. Current methods of PAC assessment employ narrowband Fourier-based filters, which assume that biological rhythms are stationary, harmonic oscillations. However, biological signals frequently contain irregular and nonstationary features, which may contaminate rhythms of interest and complicate comodulogram interpretation, especially when frequency resolution is limited by short data segments. New method: To better account for nonstationarities while maintaining sharp frequency resolution in PAC measurement, even for short data segments, we introduce a new method of PAC assessment which utilizes adaptive and more generally broadband decomposition techniques such as the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). To obtain high frequency resolution PAC measurements, our method distributes the PAC associated with pairs of broadband oscillations over frequency space according to the time-local frequencies of these oscillations. Comparison with existing methods: We compare our novel adaptive approach to a narrowband comodulogram approach on a variety of simulated signals of short duration, studying systematically how different types of nonstationarities affect these methods, as well as on EEG data. Conclusions: Our results show: (1) narrowband filtering can lead to poor PAC frequency resolution, and inaccuracy and false negatives in PAC assessment; (2) our adaptive approach attains better PAC frequency resolution and is more resistant to nonstationarities and artifacts than traditional comodulograms.

While the underlying neural principles are slowly becoming evident, most work has focused on transient stimuli and little is known about those mechanisms underlying audio-visual motion processing. We studied the facilitation of visual motion perception by auxiliary sounds, i.e. sounds that by themselves do not provide the specific evidence required for the perceptual task at hand. In our experiment human observers became significantly better at detecting visual random dot motion when this was accompanied by auxiliary acoustic motion rather than stationary sounds. EEG measurements revealed that both auditory and visual motion modulated low frequency oscillations over the respective sensory cortices. Using single trial decoding we quantified those oscillatory signatures permitting the discrimination of visual motion similar to the subject's task. This revealed visual motion-related signatures in low (1-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands that were significantly enhanced during congruent compared to disparate audio-visual conditions. Importantly, the auditory enhancement of these oscillatory signatures was predictive of the perceptual multisensory facilitation. These findings emphasise the importance of slow and alpha rhythms for perception in a multisensory context and suggest that acoustic motion can enhance visual perception by means of attention or priming-related mechanisms that are reflected in rhythmic activity over parieto-occipital regions.

The study was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a user test was conducted to identify the optimal luminance by assessing the facial squint level, subjective glare evaluation, eye blink frequency and users' subjective preferences. Based on the results of the user test, the dynamics of backlight luminance was designed. It has two levels of luminance: the optimal level for initial viewing to avoid sudden glare or fatigue to users' eyes, and the optimal level for constant viewing, which is comfortable, but also bright enough for constant reading of the displayed material. The luminance for initial viewing starts from 10 cd/m(2), and it gradually increases to 40 cd/m(2) for users' visual comfort at constant viewing for 20 seconds; In the second stage, a validation test on dynamics of backlight luminance was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed dynamics. It involving users' subjective preferences, eye blink frequency, and brainwave analysis using the electroencephalogram (EEG) to confirm that the proposed dynamic backlighting enhances users' visual comfort and visual cognition, particularly for using smartphones in a dark environment.

Previous studies show increases in EEG power in lower frequency bands (theta, alpha) in experienced meditators in both meditation states and baseline conditions. Higher gamma band power has been found in advanced Buddhist meditators, yet it is not known if this occurs in Yoga meditation practices. This study used eLORETA to compare differences in cortical source activity underlying scalp EEG from intermediate (mean experience 4 years) and advanced (mean experience 30 years) Australian meditators from the Satyananda Yoga tradition during a body-steadiness meditation, mantra meditation, and non-meditation mental calculation condition. Intermediate Yoga meditators showed greater source activity in low frequencies (particularly theta and alpha1) during mental calculation, body-steadiness and mantra meditation. A similar spatial pattern of significant differences was found in all conditions but the number of significant voxels was double during body-steadiness and mantra meditation than in the non-meditation (calculation) condition. These differences were greatest in right (R) superior frontal and R precentral gyri and extended back to include the R parietal and occipital lobes. Advanced Yoga meditators showed greater activity in high frequencies (beta and especially gamma) in all conditions but greatly expanded during meditation practice. Across all conditions (meditation and non-meditation) differences were greatest in the same regions: R insula, R inferior frontal gyrus and R anterior temporal lobe. Distinct R core networks were identified in alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and gamma (25-42 Hz) bands, respectively. The voxels recruited to these networks greatly expanded during meditation practice to include homologous regions of the left hemisphere. Functional interpretation parallels traditionally described stages of development in Yoga proficiency.

These movements are not usually designed to communicate and are frequently accomplished with little or no awareness. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sFSTG are associated with specific changes in the electrical brain activity that might indicate an involvement of regulatory emotional processes and working memory. Fourteen subjects performed a delayed memory task of complex haptic stimuli. The stimuli had to be explored and then remembered for a retention interval of 5 min. The retention interval was interrupted by unpleasant sounds from The International Affective Digitized Sounds and short sound-free periods. During the experiment a video stream of behavior, 19-channel EEG, and EMG (of forearm muscles) were recorded. Comparisons of the behavioral data and spectral power of different EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were conducted. An increase of sFSTG during the application of unpleasant sounds was observed. A significant increase of spectral theta and beta power was observed after exploration of the stimuli as well as after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes. The spectral theta power extremely decreased just before sFSTG during the retention interval. Contrary to this, no significant changes were detected in any of the frequencies when the spectral power before and after instructed facial self-touch movements (b-iFSTG and a-iFSTG) were compared. The changes of spectral theta power in the intervals before and after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes imply that sFSTG are associated with cortical regulatory processes in the domains of working memory and emotions.

During the first year of life, differential maturational changes have been observed between the Magnocellular (P) and the Parvocellular (P) visual pathways. However, few studies investigated P and M system development in infants born prematurely. The aim of the present study was to characterize P and M system maturational differences between healthy preterm and fullterm infants through a critical period of visual maturation: the first year of life. Using a cross-sectional design, high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 31 healthy preterms and 41 fullterm infants of 3, 6, or 12 months (corrected age for premature babies). Three visual stimulations varying in contrast and spatial frequency were presented to stimulate preferentially the M pathway, the P pathway, or both systems simultaneously during EEG recordings. Results from early visual evoked potentials in response to the stimulation that activates simultaneously both systems revealed longer N1 latencies and smaller P1 amplitudes in preterm infants compared to fullterms. Moreover, preterms showed longer N1 and P1 latencies in response to stimuli assessing the M pathway at 3 months. No differences between preterms and fullterms were found when using the preferential P system stimulation. In order to identify the cerebral generator of each visual response, distributed source analyses were computed in 12-month-old infants using LORETA. Source analysis demonstrated an activation of the parietal dorsal region in fullterm infants, in response to the preferential M pathway, which was not seen in the preterms. Overall, these findings suggest that the Magnocellular pathway development is affected in premature infants. Although our VEP results suggest that premature children overcome, at least partially, the visual developmental delay with time, source analyses reveal abnormal brain activation of the Magnocellular pathway at 12 months of age.

The medical treatment for MdDS is still limited. Motivated by our previous pilot study that demonstrates the promising clinical efficacy of repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) in MdDS patients, a novel rTMS paradigm, i.e., 1 Hz stimulation over ipsilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with respect to the dominant hand followed by 10 Hz stimulation over contralateral DLPFC, was proposed and conducted in MdDS in the present study. To evaluate the potential efficacy, we examined the changes before and after rTMS in both subjective reported symptom using visual analogue scale (VAS) and direct brain activity in resting state electroencephalography (rsEEG). To disentangle activity from distinct brain substrates and/or local networks in rsEEG signals, a group-wise independent component analysis was employed and the corresponding spectral power changes were examined in the identified components. In general, reduction in rocking sensation was reported in five of ten subjects (with dramatic reductions (changes > 30) in three subjects) after rTMS using the present paradigm, while no changes and slight increases in rocking sensation were reported in the remaining subjects. In rsEEG, significant elevated spectral powers in low frequency bands (i.e., theta and alpha) over broad areas of occipital, parietal, motor, and prefrontal cortices were induced by rTMS, reflecting the enhancement of cortical inhibition over these areas. Meanwhile, the significant correlations between changes in rsEEG and VAS scores were detected in the high frequency bands (i.e., high alpha and beta) over posterior parietal and left visual areas, reflecting the suppression of spatial information processing. Therefore, the present findings demonstrate the promising clinical efficacy of a new rTMS paradigm for MdDS, and suggest its merit for further studies in more patients.

Therefore, the aim of this contribution is to review all the articles reporting statistical evidence concerning the performance of patients in VS vs. patients in MCS, on behavioral or neurophysiological measures. Twenty-three articles matched these inclusion criteria, and comprised behavioral, electroencephalographic (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. The analysis of these articles yielded 47 different statistical findings. More than half of these findings (n = 24) did not reveal any statistically significant difference between VS and MCS. Overall, there was no combination of variables that allowed reliably discriminating between VS and MCS. This pattern of results casts doubt on the empirical validity of the distinction between VS and MCS.

Can we predict the response in the treatment of epilepsy with vagus nerve stimulation?	NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Treatment of epilepsy; Vagus nerve stimulation	MEDICALLY INTRACTABLE SEIZURES; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; THERAPY; MULTICENTER; SURGERY; VNS	Despite the introduction of new antiepileptic drugs and advances in the surgical treatment of epilepsy, an important group of patients still remains uncontrolled by any of these methods. The relatively recent introduction of vagus nerve stimulation is yet another possible treatment for refractory epilepsy. This safe, simple, and adjustable technique reduces the number of seizures and multiple publications support its increasing efficacy and effectiveness, with few adverse effects. The goal of our study is to determine the efficacy of this procedure and the factors predicting a response, particularly in the presence of a temporal lobe discharge on the video electroencephalogram (video-EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. We undertook a retrospective study of all the patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator between 2003 and 2009, and with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The statistical analysis was done with SPSS for Windows. The stimulator was implanted in 40 patients, of whom 38 had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. In one patient, the device had to be removed due to infection, so the series comprised 37 patients. These were divided into different groups, according to the epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, and electroencephalographic data. In addition, an analysis of the response was performed. The efficacy of the procedure was established according to the reduction in the mean seizure frequency. The baseline value of these seizures was 80.97 +/- 143.59, falling to 37 +/- 82.51 at the last revision. The response rate (reduction in seizures a parts per thousand yen50 %) at 6 months was 51.4 %, with 62.2 % of the patients showing this reduction at the last evaluation. Significant differences in the response were seen for the variables: baseline frequency of seizures, temporal lobe discharge on VideoEEG and MRI lesions. The mean time to response was 10 months in patients with lower rate of seizures versus 25 months of those with the higher rate (p = 0.024), and the response at 6 months was higher (p = 0.05). Patients with temporal lobe discharge alone or in combination with discharges over other regions had a mean time to response of 11 months versus 26 months in those without temporal discharge (p = 0.037). In the analysis of the MRI, we had seen that at the last revision, 82.4 % of the patients with lesion had achieved response versus 45 % without lesion (p = 0.02). Vagus nerve stimulation reduces the frequency of seizures. A temporal lobe discharge on the video-EEG is an indicator of an early response and the presence of an MRI lesion indicates a late response. Patients with fewer rates of seizures have a better prognosis.	[Arcos, A.; Romero, L.; Arraez, M.

Mental workload was experimentally manipulated with dichotic listening tasks. Medium and high workload conditions alternated. Behavioral measures confirmed that the manipulation of mental workload was successful. Reduced P300 amplitude was found for the high workload condition. Along with lower performance and an increase in the subjective level of fatigue, an increase of power in the alpha band was found for the last as compared to the first run of both conditions. The study confirms that a combination of signals derived from the time and frequency domain of the electroencephalogram is promising for the online detection of workload and fatigue. It also demonstrates that satisfactory accuracies can be achieved by healthy participants with the P300 speller, despite constant distraction and when pursuing the task for a long time.

In the RLD group, increased duration of convulsive motor seizures (CMS, Racine scale stage >= 3) with a significant reduction in mortality from 21% to 6% and decreased variability in seizure severity between animals/batches were observed when compared to the SHD group. There was a significant increase in the percentage of animals that reached stage-5 seizures (65% versus 96%) in the RLD group. Integrated real-time video-EEG analysis of both groups, using NeuroScore software, revealed stage-specific spikes and power spectral density characteristics. When the seizures progressed from non-convulsive seizures (NCS, stage 1-2) to CMS (stage 3-5), the delta power decreased which was followed by an increase in gamma and beta power. A transient increase in alpha and sigma power marked the transition from NCS to CMS with characteristic 'high frequency trigger' spikes on the EEG, which had no behavioral expression. During SE the spike rate was higher in the RLD group than in the SHD group. Overall these results confirm that RLD of KA is a more robust and consistent mouse model of SE than the SHD of KA mouse model.

We have collected the 18 channel EEG signals over 30 subjects (males) under the standard IADS affective sounds as the stimuli. These affective sound clips are classified in three emotional states, happy, neutral and fear. Power spectrum were calculated from the four frequency bands namely theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz). In order to discover significant effects, a significance level of p < 0.01 is combined with the power spectrum to analyse the data. Repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferoni correction were employed to analysis. The results showed only three bands have the significant relations between power and emotion. High alpha band between 10.86 and 12.15 Hz showed differences with significant effects in the prefrontal, central, temporal and parietal regions. Power differences of beta band between 13.72 and 29.6 Hz were found in the all cerebral areas except prefrontal region. In addition, the gamma band has one narrow band between 30.16 and 38.6 Hz with power differences in the frontal and central regions, and another narrow band between 40 and 46.75 Hz in the parietal and occipital regions. Interaction between emotional states and cerebral regions revealed that all cerebral areas had an important role, especially right medial frontal, right central and left temporal regions.

Here, we introduce a method of network construction based on the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and examine whether coordinated social interaction is associated with CFC within and between brains. Specifically, we compare the electroencephalograms (EEG) of 15 heterosexual couples during romantic kissing to kissing one's own hand, and to kissing one another while performing silent arithmetic. Using graph-theory methods, we identify theta-alpha hyper-brain networks, with alpha serving a cleaving or pacemaker function. Network strengths were higher and characteristic path lengths shorter when individuals were kissing each other than when they were kissing their own hand. In both partner-oriented kissing conditions, greater strength and shorter path length for 5-Hz oscillation nodes correlated reliably with greater partner-oriented kissing satisfaction. This correlation was especially strong for inter-brain connections in both partner-oriented kissing conditions but not during kissing one's own hand. Kissing quality assessed after the kissing with silent arithmetic correlated reliably with intra-brain strength of 10-Hz oscillation nodes during both romantic kissing and kissing with silent arithmetic. We conclude that hyper-brain networks based on CFC may capture neural mechanisms that support interpersonally coordinated voluntary action and bonding behavior.

However, empirical evidence for this is rather scarce. Slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG activity of 1-4.5 Hz) during deep sleep can be used as a marker of experience-dependent plasticity. For example, performing a visuomotor adaptation task in adults increased SWA during subsequent sleep over a locally restricted region of the right parietal cortex, which is known to be involved in visuomotor adaptation. Here, we investigated whether local experience-dependent changes in SWA vary as a function of brain maturation. Three age groups (children, adolescents, and adults) participated in a high-density EEG study with two conditions (baseline and adaptation) of a visuomotor learning task. Compared with the baseline condition, sleep SWA was increased after visuomotor adaptation in a cluster of eight electrodes over the right parietal cortex. The local boost in SWA was highest in children. Baseline SWA in the parietal cluster and right parietal gray matter volume, which both indicate region-specific maturation, were significantly correlated with the local increase in SWA. Our findings indicate that processes of brain maturation favor experience-dependent plasticity and determine how sensitive a specific brain region is for learning experiences. Moreover, our data confirm that SWA is a highly sensitive tool to map maturational differences in experience-dependent plasticity.

The mirror illusion induces high gamma oscillations in the absence of movement	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Hand movements; Mirror visual feedback; Sensorimotor cortex; High gamma somatotopy	MOTOR CORTEX ACTIVATION; VISUAL FEEDBACK; TACTILE STIMULATION; ROBUST REGRESSION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HAND MOVEMENTS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; HUMAN EEG; MEG	We tested whether mirror visual feedback (MVF) from a moving hand induced high gamma oscillation (HGO) response in the hemisphere contralateral to the mirror and ipsilateral to the self-paced movement. MEG was recorded in 14 subjects under three conditions: bilateral synchronous movements of both index fingers (BILATERAL), movements of the right hand index finger while observing the immobile left index finger (NOMIRROR), and movements of the right hand index finger while observing its mirror reflection (MIRROR). The right hemispheric spatiospectral regions of interests (ROIs) in the sensor space, sensitive to bilateral movements, were found by statistical comparison of the BILATERAL spectral responses to baseline. For these ROIs, the post-movement HGO responses were compared between the MIRROR and NOMIRROR conditions. We found that MVF from the moving hand, similarly to the real movements of the opposite hand, induced HGOs (55-85 Hz) in the sensorimotor cortex. This MVF effect was frequency-specific and did not spread to oscillations in other frequency bands. This is the first study demonstrating movement-related HGO induced by MVF from the moving hand in the absence of proprioceptive feedback signaling. Our findings support the hypothesis that MVF can trigger the feedback-based control processes specifically associated with perception of one's own movements. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

MEG source imaging method using fast L1 minimum-norm and its applications to signals with brain noise and human resting-state source amplitude images	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Minimum norm; L1-norm; Resting-state; Median-nerve; Brain noise; Beamformer	MIDLINE THETA-RHYTHM; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SPACE SEPARATION; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; SLEEP SPINDLES; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EEG; RECONSTRUCTION; BEAMFORMER; RESPONSES	The present study developed a fast MEG source imaging technique based on Fast Vector-based Spatio-Temporal Analysis using a L1-minimum-norm (Fast-VESTAL) and then used the method to obtain the source amplitude images of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals for different frequency bands. The Fast-VESTAL technique consists of two steps. First, Ll-minimum-norm MEG source images were obtained for the dominant spatial modes of sensor-waveform covariance matrix. Next, accurate source time-courses with millisecond temporal resolution were obtained using an inverse operator constructed from the spatial source images of Step I. Using simulations, Fast-VESTAL's performance was assessed for its 1) ability to localize multiple correlated sources; 2) ability to faithfully recover source time-courses; 3) robustness to different SNR conditions including SNR with negative dB levels; 4) capability to handle correlated brain noise; and 5) statistical maps of MEG source images. An objective pre-whitening method was also developed and integrated with Fast-VESTAL to remove correlated brain noise. Fast-VESTAL's performance was then examined in the analysis of human median-nerve MEG responses. The results demonstrated that this method easily distinguished sources in the entire somatosensory network. Next, Fast-VESTAL was applied to obtain the first whole-head MEG source-amplitude images from resting-state signals in 41 healthy control subjects, for all standard frequency bands. Comparisons between resting-state MEG sources images and known neurophysiology were provided. Additionally, in simulations and cases with MEG human responses, the results obtained from using conventional beamformer technique were compared with those from Fast-VESTAL, which highlighted the beamformer's problems of signal leaking and distorted source time-courses.

Eye closure causes widespread low-frequency power increase and focal gamma attenuation in the human electrocorticogram	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; ECoG; Eye closure; Event-related synchronization; Alpha; Gamma; High frequency activity; Frontal eye fields	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; EPISODIC MEMORY FORMATION; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; TACTILE STIMULATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; ATTENTION	Objective: We sought to characterize the effects of eye closure on EEG power using electrocorticography (ECoG). Specifically, we sought to elucidate the anatomical areas demonstrating an eye closure effect, and at which frequencies this effect occurs. Methods: ECoG was recorded from 32 patients undergoing invasive monitoring for seizure focus localization. Patients were instructed to close and open their eyes repeatedly. ECoG power was compared in the epochs following eye closure and opening, for various frequency bands and brain regions. Results: We found that at low frequencies, eye closure causes widespread power increases involving all lobes of the brain. This effect was significant not only in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band but in the delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), and beta (15-30 Hz) bands as well. At high frequencies, eye closure causes comparatively focal power decreases over occipital cortex and frontal Brodmann areas 8 and 9. Conclusions: Eye closure (1) affects a broad range of frequencies outside the a band and (2) involves a distributed network of neural activity in anatomical areas outside visual cortex. Significance: This study constitutes the first large-scale, systematic application of ECoG to study eye closure, which is shown to influence a broad range of frequencies and brain regions.

J	Kuribayashi, R; Yamamoto, R; Nittono, H				Kuribayashi, Ryuma; Yamamoto, Ryuta; Nittono, Hiroshi			High-resolution music with inaudible high-frequency components produces a lagged effect on human electroencephalographic activities	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						autonomic nervous system; electroencephalogram; facial electromyogram; hypersonic effect; music; alpha power; sound quality	ALPHA-BAND; PUBLICATION RECOMMENDATIONS; ELECTRODERMAL MEASUREMENTS; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; AROUSAL; SOUNDS; AUDIO	High-quality digital sound sources with inaudible high-frequency components (above 20 kHz) have become available because of recent advances in information technology. Listening to such sounds has been shown to increase the a-band power of an electroencephalogram (EEG). The present study scrutinized the time course of this effect by recording EEG along with autonomic measures (skin conductance level and heart rate) and facial electromyograms (corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major). Twenty university students (19-24 years old) listened to two types of a 200-s musical excerpt (J. S. Bach's French Suite No. 5) with or without inaudible high-frequency components using a double-blind method. They were asked to rate the sound quality and to judge which excerpt contained high-frequency components. High-a EEG power (10.5-13 Hz) was larger for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the excerpt without them. This effect was statistically significant only in the last quarter of the period (150-200 s). Participants were not able to distinguish between the excerpts, which did not produce any discernible differences in subjective, autonomic, and facial muscle measures. This study shows that inaudible high-frequency components have an impact on human brain activity without conscious awareness. Unlike a standard test for sound quality, at least 150 s of exposure is required to examine this effect in future research. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Ten drug-na ve children with CAE were studied using a 275-channel MEG system. MEG data were digitized at a sampling rate of 6000 Hz. HFO spectral power in real-time spectrograms was assessed using Monet continuous wavelet transform. Magnetic sources were volumetrically localized through dynamic magnetic source imaging with a slide window. HFOs were identified in all patients. The total time of fast ripples (250-500 Hz) was greater than that of ripples (80-250 Hz) during absence seizures. The rate of fast ripples was associated with seizure frequency. HFO duration was significantly longer when co-occurring with spikes than when occurring independently, and the maximum frequency of HFOs co-occurring with spikes was higher than that of HFOs occurring independently. HFOs were predominantly localized in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), whereas spikes were widespread to a variety of regions during the absence seizures. Compared with spikes, HFOs appeared to be more focal. The findings indicate that HFOs in the MPFC have a primary function in initializing epileptic activity in CAE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These attributes make SpiNNaker an ideal platform for simulating biologically plausible computational models. Our focus in this work is to design a TCT framework that can be simulated on SpiNNaker to mimic dynamical behavior similar to Electroencephalogram (EEG) time and power-spectra signatures in sleep-wake transition. The scale of the model is minimized for simplicity in this proof-of-concept study; thus the total number of spiking neurons is approximate to 1000 and represents a "minicolumn" of the thalamocortical tissue. All data on model structure, synaptic layout and parameters is inspired from previous studies and abstracted at a level that is appropriate to the aims of the current study as well as computationally suitable for model simulation on a small 4-chip SpiNNaker system. The initial results from selective deletion of synaptic connectivity parameters in the model show similarity with EEG power spectra characteristics of sleep and wakefulness. These observations provide a positive perspective and a basis for future implementation of a very large scale biologically plausible model of thalamo-cortico-thalamic interactivity the essential brain circuit that regulates the biological sleep-wake cycle and associated EEG rhythms.

J	Fasano, A; Villani, V				Fasano, Antonio; Villani, Valeria			Baseline wander removal for bioelectrical signals by quadratic variation reduction	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Baseline wander; Detrending; Quadratic variation reduction; ECG; EEG; EMG	ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; NOISE; FILTER; RECOMMENDATIONS; CANCELLATION; DESIGN	Baseline wander is a low-frequency additive noise affecting almost all bioelectrical signals, in particular the ECG. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to baseline wander estimation and removal for bioelectrical signals, based on the notion of quadratic variation reduction. The quadratic variation is meant as a measure of variability for vectors or sampled functions, and is a consistent measure in this regard. Baseline wander is estimated solving a constrained convex optimization problem where quadratic variation enters as a constraint. The solution depends on a single parameter whose value is not critical, as proven by a sensitivity analysis. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm compares favorably also in terms of computational complexity, which is linear in the size of the vector to detrend. This makes it suitable for real-time applications as well as for applications on devices with reduced computing power, such as handheld devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sensory-modality-independent topology of N550 and P900, with maximal detection rate on fronto-central areas, has been consistently reported, suggesting that sensory inputs arise to the cortex avoiding specific primary sensory areas. However, these studies neglected latencies of all MC components as a function of electrode sites. Our aim is to identify, component by component, which topological/dynamical properties of eKCs depend on stimulus modality and which are mainly related to local cortical properties. We measured temporal and morphological features of acoustic, tactile and visual eKCs to disentangle specific sensory excitatory activities from aspecific responses due to local proneness to bistability, measured by means of the N550 descending steepness (synchronization in falling into down state). While confirming the sensory-modality independence of N550 and P900 topology with maximal detection rate in fronto-central areas, four main original results emerge from this study: (i) the topology of P200 latency depends on the sensory modality with earliest waves in the stimulation-related primary sensory areas; (ii) P200 rapidly travels as a cortical excitation; (iii) P200-like excitations when KCs are not evoked are detected over the scalp with significantly smaller amplitudes in fronto-central areas, compared to eKC P200s; and (iv) N550 latency mirrors its mean local steepness which is a function of topological proneness to bistability. From these results we can describe the emergence N550/P900 complex as the interplay between a waxing P200 cortical travel and higher fronto-central proneness to bistability. In conclusion, eKCs exhibit a physiological dichotomy: P200 acts as a traveling cortical excitation whose function is to induce the bistable cortical response (N550/P900), which in turn is crucial for maintaining sleep and unconsciousness.

Spike-wave discharges in adult Sprague-Dawley rats and their implications for animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Thalamocortical oscillations; Absence seizures; Limbic seizures; Video-EEG; Pilocarpine; Female	PHOTOTHROMBOTIC BRAIN INFARCTION; GENETIC ABSENCE EPILEPSY; FLUID PERCUSSION INJURY; LONG-EVANS RATS; SEIZURE ACTIVITY; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; POSTTRAUMATIC EPILEPSY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL STATES	Spike-wave discharges (SWDs) are thalamocortical oscillations that are often considered to be the EEG correlate of absence seizures. Genetic absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg (GAERS) and Wistar Albino Glaxo rats from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) exhibit SWDs and are considered to be genetic animal models of absence epilepsy. However, it has been reported that other rat strains have SWDs, suggesting that SWDs may vary in their prevalence, but all rats have a predisposition for them. This is important because many of these rat strains are used to study temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), where it is assumed that there is no seizure-like activity in controls. In the course of other studies using the Sprague-Dawley rat, a common rat strain for animal models of TLE, we found that approximately 19% of 2- to 3-month-old naive female Sprague-Dawley rats exhibited SWDs spontaneously during periods of behavioral arrest, which continued for months. Males exhibited SWDs only after 3 months of age, consistent with previous reports (Buzsaki et al., 1990). Housing in atypical lighting during early life appeared to facilitate the incidence of SWDs. Spike-wave discharges were often accompanied by behaviors similar to stage 1-2 limbic seizures. Therefore, additional analyses were made to address the similarity. We observed that the frequency of SWDs was similar to that of hippocampal theta rhythm during exploration for a given animal, typically 7-8 Hz. Therefore, activity in the frequency of theta rhythm that occurs during frozen behavior may not reflect seizures necessarily. Hippocampal recordings exhibited high frequency oscillations (>250 Hz) during SWDs, suggesting that neuronal activity in the hippocampus occurs during SWDs, i.e., it is not a passive structure. The data also suggest that high frequency oscillations, if rhythmic, may reflect SWDs. We also confirmed that SWDs were present in a common animal model of TLE, the pilocarpine model, using female Sprague-Dawley rats. Therefore, damage and associated changes to thalamic, hippocampal, and cortical neurons do not prevent SWDs, at least in this animal model. The results suggest that it is possible that SWDs occur in rodent models of TLE and that investigators mistakenly assume that they are stage 1-2 limbic seizures. We discuss the implications of the results and ways to avoid the potential problems associated with SWDs in animal models of TLE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Detection of new acoustic signals from the human head	ACOUSTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						acoustic emission; electroencephalography; acoustoencephalographic signals; alpha rhythm	AUSCULTATION	New acoustic signals generated in the human head have been found using piezoelectric transducers of longitudinal acoustic oscillations; these signals clearly manifest themselves in recording from the temporal regions and are less pronounced when recording from the forehead. They have a form of 4-ms pulses with a repetition frequency varying from 60 to 120 ms. The signal level exceeds that of thermal acoustic fluctuations by about two orders of magnitude. The signals are formed when the subject of an experiment is relaxed; i.e., the human is at rest with closed eyes and is about to fall asleep. The repetition frequency of these signals is close to the alpha-rhythm frequencies; however, there is no exact correlation between these types of signals at long (of about minute) time intervals. The signals recorded from different temples generally have no strong synchronization. Since some parameters of these signals are close to those of electroencephalographic signals, the former can be referred to as acoustoencephalographic signals.	[Mirgorodskii, V. I.; Gerasimov, V.

Alpha power increases in right parietal cortex reflects focused internal attention	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attention; Memory; Inhibition; EEG; Alpha; Divergent thinking	EEG-ALPHA; DIVERGENT THINKING; PHASE-LOCKING; MEMORY LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; CREATIVITY; BAND; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION	This study investigated the functional significance of EEG alpha power increases, a finding that is consistently observed in various memory tasks and specifically during divergent thinking. It was previously shown that alpha power is increased when tasks are performed in mind e.g., when bottom-up processing is prevented. This study aimed to examine the effect of task-immanent differences in bottom-up processing demands by comparing two divergent thinking tasks, one intrinsically relying on bottom-up processing (sensory-intake task) and one that is not (sensory-independence task). In both tasks, stimuli were masked in half of the trials to establish conditions of higher and lower internal processing demands. In line with the hypotheses, internal processing affected performance and led to increases in alpha power only in the sensory-intake task, whereas the sensory-independence task showed high levels of task-related alpha power in both conditions. Interestingly, conditions involving focused internal attention showed a clear lateralization with higher alpha power in parietal regions of the right hemisphere. Considering evidence from fMRI studies, right-parietal alpha power increases may correspond to a deactivation of the right temporoparietal junction, reflecting an inhibition of the ventral attention network. Inhibition of this region is thought to prevent reorienting to irrelevant stimulation during goal-driven, top-down behavior, which may serve the executive function of task shielding during demanding cognitive tasks such as idea generation and mental imagery.

It is hypothesized that this neural suppression reflects the functional sharpening of local neuronal assemblies which boosts information processing efficiency. This neural suppression phenomenon has been mainly reported during conditions of conscious stimulus perception. The question remains whether frequent stimuli processed in the absence of conscious perception also induce repetition suppression in those specialized networks. Using rare intracranial EEG recordings in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) of human epileptic patients we investigated neural repetition suppression in conditions of conscious and unconscious visual processing of words. To this end, we used an orthogonal design manipulating respectively stimulus repetition (frequent vs. unique stimuli) and conscious perception (masked vs. unmasked stimuli). By measuring the temporal dynamics of high-frequency broadband gamma activity in VOTC and testing for main and interaction effects, we report that early processing of words in word-form selective networks exhibits a temporal cascade of modulations by stimulus repetition and masking: neuronal attenuation initially is observed in response to repeated words (irrespective of consciousness), that is followed by a second modulation contingent upon word reportability (irrespective of stimulus repetition). Later on (>300 ms post-stimulus), a significant effect of conscious perception on the extent of repetition suppression was observed. The temporal dynamics of consciousness, the recognition memory processes and their interaction revealed in this study advance our understanding of their contributions to the neural mechanisms of word processing in VOTC.

Later research attempted to categorize meditation as either involving focused or distributed attentional systems. Neither of these hypotheses received strong empirical support, and most of the studies investigated Theravada style meditative practices. In this study, we compared neurophysiological (EEG, EKG) and cognitive correlates of meditative practices that are thought to utilize either focused or distributed attention, from both Theravada and Vajrayana traditions. The results of Study 1 show that both focused (Shamatha) and distributed (Vipassana) attention meditations of the Theravada tradition produced enhanced parasympathetic activation indicative of a relaxation response. In contrast, both focused (Deity) and distributed (Rig-pa) meditations of the Vajrayana tradition produced sympathetic activation, indicative of arousal. Additionally, the results of Study 2 demonstrated an immediate dramatic increase in performance on cognitive tasks following only Vajrayana styles of meditation, indicating enhanced phasic alertness due to arousal. Furthermore, our EEG results showed qualitatively different patterns of activation between Theravada and Vajrayana meditations, albeit highly similar activity between meditations within the same tradition. In conclusion, consistent with Tibetan scriptures that described Shamatha and Vipassana techniques as those that calm and relax the mind, and Vajrayana techniques as those that require 'an awake quality' of the mind, we show that Theravada and Vajrayana meditations are based on different neurophysiological mechanisms, which give rise to either a relaxation or arousal response. Hence, it may be more appropriate to categorize meditations in terms of relaxation vs. arousal, whereas classification methods that rely on the focused vs. distributed attention dichotomy may need to be reexamined.

Action Experience, More than Observation, Influences Mu Rhythm Desynchronization	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; TOOL-USE; PERCEPTION; INFANTS; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION	Since the discovery of mirror neurons in premotor and parietal areas of the macaque monkey, the idea that action and perception may share the same neural code has been of central interest in social, developmental, and cognitive neurosciences. A fundamental question concerns how a putative human mirror neuron system may be tuned to the motor experiences of the individual. The current study tested the hypothesis that prior motor experience modulated the sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. Specifically, we hypothesized that these sensorimotor rhythms would be more desynchronized after active motor experience compared to passive observation experience. To test our hypothesis, we collected EEG from adult participants during the observation of a relatively novel action: an experimenter used a claw-like tool to pick up a toy. Prior to EEG collection, we trained one group of adults to perform this action with the tool (performers). A second group comprised trained video coders, who only had experience observing the action (observers). Both the performers and the observers had no prior motor and visual experience with the action. A third group of novices was also tested. Performers exhibited the greatest mu rhythm desynchronization in the 8-13 Hz band, particularly in the right hemisphere compared to observers and novices. This study is the first to contrast active tool-use experience and observation experience in the mu rhythm and to show modulation with relatively shorter amounts of experience than prior mirror neuron expertise studies. These findings are discussed with respect to its broader implication as a neural signature for a mechanism of early social learning.

A Comparison of Propofol- and Dexmedetomidine-induced Electroencephalogram Dynamics Using Spectral and Coherence Analysis	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; THALAMOCORTICAL MECHANISMS; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; BEHAVIORAL-EXPERIMENTS; BISPECTRAL INDEX; SLEEP; CONSCIOUSNESS; EEG; SEDATION; AROUSAL	Background: Electroencephalogram patterns observed during sedation with dexmedetomidine appear similar to those observed during general anesthesia with propofol. This is evident with the occurrence of slow (0.1 to 1 Hz), delta (1 to 4 Hz), propofol-induced alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and dexmedetomidine-induced spindle (12 to 16 Hz) oscillations. However, these drugs have different molecular mechanisms and behavioral properties and are likely accompanied by distinguishing neural circuit dynamics. Methods: The authors measured 64-channel electroencephalogram under dexmedetomidine (n = 9) and propofol (n = 8) in healthy volunteers, 18 to 36 yr of age. The authors administered dexmedetomidine with a 1-mu g/kg loading bolus over 10 min, followed by a 0.7 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) infusion. For propofol, the authors used a computer-controlled infusion to target the effect-site concentration gradually from 0 to 5 g/ml. Volunteers listened to auditory stimuli and responded by button press to determine unconsciousness. The authors analyzed the electroencephalogram using multitaper spectral and coherence analysis. Results: Dexmedetomidine was characterized by spindles with maximum power and coherence at approximately 13 Hz (mean SD; power, -10.8 +/- 3.6 dB; coherence, 0.8 +/- 0.08), whereas propofol was characterized with frontal alpha oscillations with peak frequency at approximately 11 Hz (power, 1.1 +/- 4.5 dB; coherence, 0.9 +/- 0.05). Notably, slow oscillation power during a general anesthetic state under propofol (power, 13.2 +/- 2.4 dB) was much larger than during sedative states under both propofol (power, -2.5 +/- 3.5 dB) and dexmedetomidine (power, -0.4 +/- 3.1 dB). Conclusion: The results indicate that dexmedetomidine and propofol place patients into different brain states and suggest that propofol enables a deeper state of unconsciousness by inducing large-amplitude slow oscillations that produce prolonged states of neuronal silence.

A simple procedure to synchronize concurrent measurements of gait and brain electrical activity and preliminary results from a pilot measurement involving motor-cognitive dual-tasking in healthy older and young volunteers	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Synchronization; TTL, Concurrent; Aging; Gait, Brain activity	WALKING	Background: The ability to record brain activity under normal walking conditions is the key to studying supraspinal influence on spinal gait control. New method: We developed a procedure of synchronizing an electronic walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems Inc.) with a multi-channel, wireless EEG-system (BrainAmp, Brainproducts). To assess the practicability of our procedure we performed a proof of concept measurement involving concurrently recording gait pattern and brain electrical activity in two elderly and two young participants. This measurement enabled us to assess the synchronization of the two data sets under realistic conditions. Results: Only carrying a filled water glass reduced gait regularity in the elderly. In the young gait regularity was constant across all tasks. This concurs with previous findings reporting a task specific influence on gait. Carrying a full water glass also led to an increase in the power of the EEG gamma-band oscillations in frontal cortex of the elderly, but led to a decrease in the young participants. Carrying a full glass increased activity in frontal cortex of the elderly but decreased it in the young participants. Comparison with existing methods: At present, concurrent recording of gait pattern and electrical brain activity requires participants to walk on a treadmill. Our procedure enables these measurements to be made under natural walking conditions. This allows measurements of brain activity during walking in special needs groups such as children, the elderly or the infirm under near natural conditions. Conclusions: Our procedure for synchronizing EEG and gait proved simple, reliable and generated data of high-quality. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Modelling such processes would require sophisticated information science methods and the best ones could be the brain-inspired ones, that use the same brain information processing principles. Spatio and spectro-temporal data (SSTD) are also the most common types of data collected in many domain areas, including engineering, bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, ecology, environment, medicine, economics, etc. However, there is lack of methods for the efficient analysis of such data and for spatio-temporal pattern recognition (STPR). The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine and deals extremely well with spatio-temporal data. Its organization and functions have been the inspiration for the development of new methods for SSTD analysis and STPR. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) are considered the third generation of neural networks and are a promising paradigm for the creation of new intelligent ICT for SSTD. This new generation of computational models and systems is potentially capable of modeling complex information processes due to the ability to represent and integrate different information dimensions, such as time, space, frequency, and phase, and to deal with large volumes of data in an adaptive and self-organizing manner. This chapter reviews methods and systems of SNN for SSTD analysis and STPR, including single neuronal models, evolving spiking neural networks (eSNN), and computational neurogenetic models (CNGM). Software and hardware implementations and some pilot applications for audio-visual pattern recognition, EEG data-analysis, cognitive robotic systems, BCI, neurodegenerative diseases, and others are discussed.

We hypothesized that resting state networks would be modified under hyperoxic conditions. Thirty-four normal volunteers were recruited for this study. All participants were scanned twice: once while breathing atmospheric air and once under hyperoxic conditions in a randomized order. Hyperoxic conditions were produced by administering 100% O-2. Blood oxygen level-dependent T2* scans were obtained for each of the scans. Resting state networks were extracted using independent component analysis. A paired t-test showed that the resting state networks scans (default mode network, attention network and executive network) acquired under hyperoxic conditions had significantly higher Z-scores than scans performed under atmospheric air. Spectral analysis of the time-course signal in these networks also showed a difference in the total power of low frequencies between the two conditions. These results were reversed in the visual network. Clinical or research applications of oxygen-enhanced MRI need to take into account the modularly effects that hyperoxia exerts on the networks resting state functional MRI.

Within recent years it has become more commonly understood that ongoing brain activity, mainly measured with electrophysiology, can predict whether an upcoming stimulus is consciously perceived. One approach to investigate the relationship between ongoing brain activity and conscious perception is to conduct near-threshold (NT) experiments and focus on the pre-stimulus period. The current review will, in the first part, summarize main findings of pre-stimulus research from NT experiments, mainly focusing on the alpha band (8-14 Hz). It is probable that the most prominent finding is that local (mostly sensory) areas show enhanced excitatory states prior to detection of upcoming NT stimuli, as putatively reflected by decreased alpha band power. However, the view of a solely local excitability change seems to be too narrow. In a recent paper, using a somatosensory NT task,14/etsz et al. (2014) replicated the common alpha finding and, furthermore, conceptually embedded this finding into a more global framework called "Windows to Consciousness" (Win2Con). In this review, we want to further elaborate on the crucial assumption of "open windows" to conscious perception, determined by pre-established pathways connecting sensory and higher order areas. Methodologically, connectivity and graph theoretical analyses are applied to source-imaging magnetoencephalographic data to uncover brain regions with strong network integration as well as their connection patterns. Sensory regions with stronger network integration will more likely distribute information when confronted with weak NT stimuli, favoring its subsequent conscious perception. First experimental evidence confirms our aforementioned "open window" hypothesis. We therefore emphasize that future research on prerequisites of consciousness needs to move on from investigating solely local excitability to a more global view of network connectivity.

This experimental constraint is mostly in place to control visual stimuli presentation and to avoid artifacts in non-invasive measures of brain activity, however, this limitation can be overcome with intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from epilepsy patients. Moreover, the high-frequency components of the iEEG signal (between about 50 and 150 Hz) can provide a proxy of population-level spiking activity in any cortical area during free-viewing. We combined iEEG with high precision eye-tracking to study fine temporal dynamics and functional specificity in the fusiform face (FFA) and visual word form area (VWFA) while patients inspected natural pictures containing faces and text. We defined the first local measure of visual (electrophysiological) responsiveness adapted to free-viewing in humans: amplitude modulations in the high-frequency activity range (50-150 Hz) following fixations (fixation-related high-frequency response). We showed that despite the large size of receptive fields in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, neural activity during natural vision of realistic cluttered scenes is mostly dependent upon the category of the foveated stimulus - suggesting that category-specificity is preserved during free-viewing and that attention mechanisms might filter out the influence of objects surrounding the fovea.

Internal and external spatial attention examined with lateralized EEG power spectra	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Visuospatial attention; Visual short term memory; PCN; Lateralized power spectra; Theta; Alpha; Simon effect	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ORIENTING ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; MODULATION; LOCATIONS; COMMON; STATES	Several authors argued that retrieval of an item from visual short term memory (internal spatial attention) and focusing attention on an externally presented item (external spatial attention) are similar. Part of the neuroimaging support for this view may be due to the employed experimental procedures. Furthermore, as internal spatial attention may have a more induced than evoked nature some effects may not have been visible in event related analyses of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which limits the possibility to demonstrate differences. In the current study, a colored frame cued which stimulus, one out of four presented in separate quadrants, required a response, which depended on the form of the cued stimulus (circle or square). Importantly, the frame occurred either before (precue), simultaneously with (simultaneous cue), or after the stimuli (postcue). The precue and simultaneous cue condition both concern external attention, while the postcue condition implies the involvement of internal spatial attention. Event-related lateralizations (ERLs), reflecting evoked effects, and lateralized power spectra (LPS), reflecting both evoked and induced effects, were determined. ERLs revealed a posterior contralateral negativity (PCN) only in the precue condition. LPS analyses on the raw EEG showed early increased contralateral theta power at posterior sites and later increased ipsilateral alpha power at occipito-temporal sites in all cue conditions. Responses were faster when the internally or externally attended location corresponded with the required response side than when not. These findings provide further support for the view that internal and external spatial attention share their underlying mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Modulation of alpha power at encoding and retrieval tracks the precision of visual short-term memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; VSTM; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY; DISCRETE RESOURCE; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; VARIABILITY; EEG; MAINTENANCE; PERFORMANCE; RESOLUTION	Our ability to hold information in mind is strictly limited. We sought to understand the relationship between oscillatory brain activity and the allocation of resources within visual short-term memory (VSTM). Participants attempted to remember target arrows embedded among distracters and used a continuous method of responding to report their memory for a cued target item. Trial-to-trial variability in the absolute circular accuracy with which participants could report the target was predicted by event-related alpha synchronization during initial processing of the memoranda and by alpha desynchronization during the retrieval of those items from VSTM. Using a model-based approach, we were also able to explore further which parameters of VSTM-guided behavior were most influenced by alpha band changes. Alpha synchronization during item processing enhanced the precision with which an item could be retained without affecting the likelihood of an item being represented per se (as indexed by the guessing rate). Importantly, our data outline a neural mechanism that mirrors the precision with which items are retained; the greater the alpha power enhancement during encoding, the greater the precision with which that item can be retained.

To further elucidate this question specifically for memory, we investigated if a musical template can enhance verbal learning in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and if music-assisted learning will also influence short-term, system-level brain plasticity. We measured systems-level brain activity with oscillatory network synchronization during music-assisted learning. Specifically, we measured the spectral power of 128-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in alpha and beta frequency bands in 54 patients with MS. The study sample was randomly divided into two groups, either hearing a spoken or a musical (sung) presentation of Rey's auditory verbal learning test. We defined the "learning-related synchronization" (LRS) as the percent change in EEG spectral power from the first time the word was presented to the average of the subsequent word encoding trials. LRS differed significantly between the music and the spoken conditions in low alpha and upper beta bands. Patients in the music condition showed overall better word memory and better word order memory and stronger bilateral frontal alpha LRS than patients in the spoken condition. The evidence suggests that a musical mnemonic recruits stronger oscillatory network synchronization in prefrontal areas in MS patients during word learning. It is suggested that the temporal structure implicit in musical stimuli enhances" deep encoding" during verbal learning and sharpens the timing of neural dynamics in brain networks degraded by demyelination in MS.

Stress-induced gastrointestinal motility is responsible for epileptic susceptibility	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES; EEG; RECEPTORS; SYSTEM; MUSCLE; MU; MECHANOTRANSDUCTION; INCREASES; FEELINGS	In order to explain observations linking epileptic EEG patterns (3 Hz spike wave complexes and beta-gamma activity of 25-40 Hz) and the involuntary slow wave of the gut (3 c/min) and colonic contractile electrical complexes (25-40 c/min), the physiological and pathological electrographic patterns recorded from different anatomical structures were compared. The similarities in shape and pattern provided the basis to hypothesise that these waves exist as a continuum associated with different cell types and that stress induces high-force involuntary tonic contractions and resistance to the segmental rhythmic contractions of the gut's circular muscles. As a consequence, electrographic patterns with a waveform of 3 c/min and 25-40 c/min are organised in the periphery and transmitted to the central nervous system via visceral afferents with the same shape. The electrical interactions between the adjacent neurons of the enteric network, as well as between the interconnected gut/brain neuronal circuits, facilitate synchronisation of neuronal activity by the frequencies of the stress-induced patterns. In this way, the peripherally organised electrographic patterns actively participate in creating epileptic susceptibility with expressed gut symptoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is despite the obvious asymmetry in the initiation and termination of natural sleep. In order to characterize the restoration of consciousness after surgery, we recorded frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) from 100 patients in the operating room during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. We have defined, for the first time, 4 steady-state patterns of anesthetic maintenance based on the relative EEG power in the slow-wave (<14 Hz) frequency bands that dominate sleep and anesthesia. Unlike single-drug experiments performed in healthy volunteers, we found that surgical patients exhibited greater electroencephalographic heterogeneity while re-establishing conscious awareness after drug discontinuation. Moreover, these emergence patterns could be broadly grouped according to the duration and rapidity of transitions amongst these slow-wave dominated brain states that precede awakening. Most patients progressed gradually from a pattern characterized by strong peaks of delta (0.5-4 Hz) and alpha/spindle (8-14 Hz) power ('Slow-Wave Anesthesia') to a state marked by low delta-spindle power ('Non Slow-Wave Anesthesia') before awakening. However, 31% of patients transitioned abruptly from Slow-Wave Anesthesia to waking; they were also more likely to express pain in the post-operative period. Our results, based on sleep-staging classification, provide the first systematized nomenclature for tracking brain states under general anesthesia from maintenance to emergence, and suggest that these transitions may correlate with post-operative outcomes such as pain.

To gain an insight into the neurobiological processes linked to facial affect recognition, we investigated both induced and evoked oscillatory activity by calculating the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and the Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) during facial affect recognition. Fearful and neutral faces as well as nonface patches were presented to 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls while EEG was recorded. The participants' task was to recognize facial expressions. Because previous findings with healthy controls showed that facial feature decoding was associated primarily with oscillatory activity in the theta band, we analyzed ERSP and ITC in this frequency band in the time interval of 140-200 ms, which corresponds to the N170 component. Event-related theta activity and phase-locking to facial expressions, but not to nonface patches, predicted emotion recognition performance in both controls and patients. Event-related changes in theta amplitude and phase-locking were found to be significantly weaker in patients compared with healthy controls, which is in line with previous investigations showing decreased neural synchronization in the low frequency bands in patients with schizophrenia. Neural synchrony is thought to underlie distributed information processing. Our results indicate a less effective functioning in the recognition process of facial features, which may contribute to a less effective social cognition in schizophrenia.

We hypothesized that this may be due to retained perception as a human voice. We report a follow-up ECoG study in which we contrast forward and reverse speech with a signal- correlated noise (SCN) control task that cannot be perceived as a human voice. Methods: Ten patients were presented 90 audible stimuli, including 30 each of corresponding forward speech, reverse speech, and SCN trials, during ECoG recording with evaluation of gamma activity between 50 and 150 Hz. Results: Sites of the lateral temporal gyri activated throughout speech stimuli were generally less activated by SCN, while some temporal sites seemed to process both human and non- human sounds. Reverse speech trials were associated with activities across the temporal lobe similar to those associated with forward speech. Conclusions: Findings herein externally validate functional neuroimaging studies utilizing SCN as a control for non- language- specific auditory function. Our findings are consistent with the notion that stimuli perceived as originating from a human voice are poor controls for non- language auditory function.

In the first experiment theta-gamma functional coupling was determined based on resting (eyes closed) EEG data of 100 participants. Twenty participants with either low or high theta-gamma correlation coefficients were asked to participate in the second experiment in which they were presented with a test of fluid intelligence. The results showed that: (1) resting-state theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital areas negatively correlated with IQ scores and (2) theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in frontal areas correlated with performance on the test of fluid intelligence. Individuals with low theta-gamma coupling during rest showed an increase in theta-gamma functional coupling in frontal areas as task difficulty increased, which was associated with better performance on the test. These findings demonstrate for the first time that theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in frontal areas, and partly also in parietal areas (Experiment 1), relates to the level of intelligence.

The subject's own name (SON) is preferentially processed in the right hemisphere, mainly because of its self-relevance and emotional content, together with other personally relevant information such as the voice of a familiar person. Whether emotional and self-relevant information are able to attract attention and can be, in future, introduced in clinical studies remains unclear. In the present study we used EEG and asked participants to count a target name (active condition) or to just listen to the SON or other unfamiliar names uttered by a familiar or unfamiliar voice (passive condition). Data reveals that the target name elicits a strong alpha event related desynchronization with respect to nontarget names and triggers in addition a left lateralized theta synchronization as well as delta synchronization. In the passive condition alpha desynchronization was observed for familiar voice and SON stimuli in the right hemisphere. Altogether we speculate that participants engage additional attentional resources when counting a target name or when listening to personally relevant stimuli which is indexed by alpha desynchronization whereas left lateralized theta synchronization may be related to verbal working memory load. After validating the present protocol in healthy volunteers it is suggested to move one step further and apply the protocol to patients with disorders of consciousness in which the degree of residual cognitive processing and self-awareness is still insufficiently understood.

CONSCIOUSNESS BEGAN WITH A HUNTER'S PLAN	COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Action-perception cycle; consciousness; EEG; entorhinal cortex; phase transition		Animals search for food and shelter by locomotion through time and space. The elemental step is the action-perception cycle, which has three steps. In the first step a volley of action potentials initiated by an act of search (sniff, saccade, etc.) triggers the formation of a macroscopic wave packet that constitutes the memory of the stimulus. The wave packet is filtered and sent to the entorhinal cortex, where it is combined with wave packets from all sensory systems. This triggers the second step forming a unified memory that is passed through the hippocampal formation where it is assigned a place in the life-long memory of the subject. In the third step the output of the entorhinal cortex triggers the formation of a global wave packet that synchronizes the oscillatory activity of most of not all of the cerebral cortex. This shared oscillation caries a pattern of amplitude modulation, that can be observed noninvasively from the scalp EEG of human volunteers perceiving the stimulus and correlated with the stimulus. The same dendritic electric currents that drive the output of the brains of the wave packet drive the observed EEG signs. Therefore I postulate that the global wave packet, the third step in the cycle requiring only 0.2 seconds expresses the memory of the global accommodation that initiates the next action-perception cycle. Some unspecified fraction of the AM pattern is available to me the observer, and some other unspecified fraction of the total activity in the subject who is expected to respond to the stimulus. There is reason to hope that these fractions will coincide often enough to support refinements in techniques for extending these correlates of consciousness.

We recorded their EEG at no-task and eyes-closed conditions. The elderly subjects were divided into high score group (HSG) and low score group (LSG) according to the MMSE score. The partially oriented coherent (PDC) values were computed separately in the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta, gamma1 and gamma2 bands and were used to construct brain functional networks. Then the connection properties of constructed networks were tested by calculating the cluster coefficients C and characteristic path length L. Results showed that, there were no statistical differences of the global values for two groups in each band; increased PDC values were found after the opera experience for the low score group in delta band; the L value of theta band was significantly longer in the high score group, whereas the C value showed no significant changes. The finding indicates the abnormal of brain functional networks in low score group, and the Opera has enhancement features to people's brain functional connectivity.

However, false diagnosis with potentially catastrophic consequences for patients such as intraoperative awareness may result from unnoticed irregularities in the process of signal analysis. Here we ask whether Benford's Law can be applied to detect accidental or intended modulation of neurophysiologic signals. This law states that the first digits of many datasets such as atomic weights or river lengths are distributed logarithmically and not equally. In particular, we tested whether data obtained from electrophysiological recordings of human patients representing global activity and organotypic slice cultures representing pure cortical activity follow the predictions of Benford's Law in the absence and in the presence of an anesthetic drug. METHODS: Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from human subjects and local field potential recordings from cultured cortical brain slices were obtained before and after administration of sevoflurane. The first digit distribution of the datasets was compared with the Benford distribution. RESULTS: All datasets showed a Benford-like distribution. Nevertheless, distributions belonging to different anesthetic levels could be distinguished in vitro and in human EEGs. With sevoflurane, the first digit distribution of the in vitro data becomes steeper, while it flattens for EEG data. In the presence of high frequency noise, the Benford distribution falls apart. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro and EEG data show a Benford-like distribution which is altered by sevoflurane or destroyed by noise used to simulate artefacts. These findings suggest that algorithms based on Benford's Law can be successfully used to detect sevoflurane-induced signal modulations in electrophysiological recordings.

We show that oscillatory activity in the theta band (4-6 Hz) related to Sternberg task performance may differentiate people characterized by high and low WMC. Specifically, there is a linear increase of frontal midline (FM) theta power with load, however, only in the high WMC group. Furthermore, a positive linear relationship was found between WMC (operation span task score) and average FM theta power increase from lower to higher loads which was not present at other scalp locations. The distinct patterns of high and low WMC individual's FM theta response to memory load seem to support the assumption that theta activity during maintenance reflects not only the amount of information stored, but also the effort it takes to remember them and the efficiency of involved neural processes. This contributes to perceiving FM theta as an individual trait which can reflect individual working memory mechanism efficiency.

We analyzed intracellular activities of neurons either from different cortical areas or from a variety of specific and nonspecific thalamic nuclei in relation to the phase of global EEG signal in ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice. We found that, on average, slow-wave active states started off within frontal cortical areas as well as higher-order and intralaminar thalamus (posterior and parafascicular nuclei) simultaneously. Then, the leading edge of active states propagated in the anteroposterior/lateral direction over the cortex at similar to 40 mm/s. The latest structure we recorded within the slow-wave cycle was the anterior thalamus, which followed active states of the retrosplenial cortex. Active states from different cortical areas tended to terminate simultaneously. Sensory thalamic ventral posterior medial and lateral geniculate nuclei followed cortical active states with major inhibitory and weak tonic-like "modulator" EPSPs. In these nuclei, sharp-rising, large-amplitude EPSPs ("drivers") were not modulated by cortical slow waves, suggesting their origin in ascending pathways. The thalamic active states in other investigated nuclei were composed of depolarization: some revealing "driver"- and "modulator"-like EPSPs, others showing "modulator"-like EPSPs only. We conclude that sensory thalamic nuclei follow the propagating cortical waves, whereas neurons from higher-order thalamic nuclei display "hub dynamics" and thus may contribute to the generation of cortical slow waves.

Brain connectivity in West syndrome	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Hypsarrhythmia; Coherence; Phase lag; Connectivity; Development	COHERENCE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS	Purpose: Hypsarrhythmia, the pathognomonic EEG pattern of West syndrome, is typically characterized by a high amplitude, arrhythmic, and asynchronous pattern. While this severely aberrant pattern would suggest severe abnormalities in connectivity, coherence has not yet been systematically assessed in hypsarrhythmia. Methods: We evaluated the EEGs of 28 infants, 12 with infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia and 16 similarly age control infants for coherence and spectral power. Results: Children with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia EEGs had marked abnormalities in coherence and spectral power compared to normal children of similar ages. During sleep increases in delta, theta, alpha and beta coherences were seen, particularly at long inter-electrode distances while at short inter-electrode distances coherences were decreased in the theta and beta range, particularly in the frontal region. The enhanced coherences at long inter-electrode distances suggest that during sleep in children with infantile spasms widely spread cortical region do not have functional differentiation whereas in the frontal lobe there is reduced functional connectivity and integration of local cortical regions. Children with continued seizures and developmental delay showed persistent abnormalities in coherence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that hypsarrhythmic EEGs have marked abnormalities in coherence spectral power and such abnormalities may be related to cognitive impairment.

Towards this aim, ten healthy human subjects performed delayed responses to visual targets presented at different spatial locations. Two tasks were attained, one in which the spatial location of the target was the goal for a pointing movement and one in which the spatial location of the target was used for a perceptual (yes or no) change detection. Each task involved two conditions: a memory condition in which the target remained visible only for the first 250 ms of the delay period and a delay condition in which the target location remained visible throughout the delay period. The amplitude spectrum analysis of the EEG revealed that the alpha (8-12 Hz) band signal was smaller, while the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz) band signals were larger in the memory compared to the non-memory condition. The alpha band signal difference was confined to the frontal midline area; the beta band signal difference extended over the right hemisphere and midline central area, and the gamma band signal difference was confined to the right occipitoparietal area. Importantly, both in beta and gamma bands, we observed a significant increase in the movement-related compared to the perceptual-related memory-specific amplitude spectrum signal in the central midline area. This result provides clear evidence for the dissociation of motor and perceptual spatial working memory.

Appropriate targeting of control stimuli at selected cortical locations may lead to seizure abatement. Neural population models describe the macroscopic neural activity that can be clinically recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). These models provide a safer way to develop and test the effect of such simulation strategies. In this study, a heterogeneously connected neural field model has been used which can replicate spatio-temporal patterns commonly observed in the EEG during generalized seizures. Seizure abatement has been formulated as an optimal control problem and the pseudospectral method has been used to develop stimuli with anti-ictogenic properties. The minimum energy optimal stimuli, developed in this study have been shown to abate seizures simulated from the model. It has been demonstrated that the control stimuli are spatially variant due to the underlying heterogeneity of the neural dynamics. This study provides a novel approach for designing optimal stimuli for seizure abatement while taking into account the heterogeneous dynamics of the human brain. It also raises the possibility of finding the appropriate set of cortical locations which may be stimulated to achieve the anti-seizure effect.

However, the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying this impairment are entirely unknown. Here, we sought to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging during MSL and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during daytime sleep, the functional correlates and physiological characteristics of this age-related motor memory deficit. As predicted, older subjects did not exhibit sleep-dependent gains in performance (i.e., behavioral changes that reflect consolidation) and had reduced sleep spindles compared with young subjects. Brain imaging analyses also revealed that changes in activity across the retention interval in the putamen and related brain regions were associated with sleep spindles. This change in striatal activity was increased in young subjects, but reduced by comparison in older subjects. These findings suggest that the deficit in sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation in elderly individuals is related to a reduction in sleep spindle oscillations and to an associated decrease of activity in the cortico-striatal network.

Methods: 135 subjects presenting with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS, n = 58) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, n = 52) with respective sleepiness or fatigue complaints and a control group (n = 25) underwent polysomnography and psychometric assessments for fatigue, sleepiness, affective symptoms and perceived sleep quality. Sleep EEG spectral analysis for ultra slow, delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta power bands was performed on frontal, central and occipital derivations. Results: Patient groups presented with impaired subjective sleep quality and higher affective symptom intensity. CFS patients presented with highest fatigue and SAHS patients with highest sleepiness levels. All groups showed similar total sleep time. Subject groups mainly differed in sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, duration of light sleep (N1, N2) and slow wave sleep, as well as in sleep fragmentation and respiratory disturbance. Relative non-REM sleep power spectra distributions suggest a pattern of power exchange in higher frequency bands at the expense of central ultra slow power in CFS patients during all non-REM stages. In SAHS patients, however, we found an opposite pattern at occipital sites during N1 and N2. Conclusions: Slow wave activity presents as a crossroad of fatigue and sleepiness with, however, different spectral power band distributions during non-REM sleep. The homeostatic function of sleep might be compromised in CFS patients and could explain why, in contrast to sleepiness, fatigue does not resolve with sleep in these patients. The present findings thus contribute to the differentiation of both phenomena. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Detailed analyses from source-localization indicated that a likely origin was the parahippocampal regions whose net differences at 10, 11 and 12 Hz intervals were significantly correlated with geomagnetic activity. Analyses of residuals to obtain a "purer" measure of parahippocampal contributions indicated that interhemispheric temporal lobe coherence across unit increments between 1 and 40Hz revealed the most statistically significant peaks at 7.5 Hz and 19.5 Hz. These weak but reliable correlations between global geomagnetic activity and the degree of inter-temporal lobe coherence for normal people relaxing in a dark, quiet area are consistent with the results of multiple studies indicating that intrusive experiences such as "presences" or "hallucinations" are more frequent when global geomagnetic activity increases above similar to 15-20 nT.

However, its relation to functional connectivity has remained largely obscure. In the sensorimotor system, movement-related changes emerge in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) range (event-related desynchronization, ERD, before and during movement; event-related synchronization, ERS, after movement offset). Some studies suggest that beta-ERS may functionally inhibit new movements. According to the gating-by-inhibition framework ( Jensen and Mazaheri 2010), we expected that the ERD would go along with increased corticomuscular coupling, and vice versa. By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography, we were directly able to test this hypothesis. In a reaction time task, single TMS pulses were delivered randomly during ERD/ERS to the motor cortex. The motor-evoked potential (MEP) was then related to the beta and alpha frequencies and corticomuscular coherence. Results indicate that MEPs are smaller when preceded by high pre-TMS beta-band power and low pre-TMS alpha-band corticomuscular coherence (and vice versa) in a network of motor-relevant areas comprising frontal, parietal, and motor cortices. This confirms that an increase in rhythms that putatively reflect functionally inhibited states goes along with weaker coupling of the respective brain regions.

Hypnotic induction is followed by state-like changes in the organization of EEG functional connectivity in the theta and beta frequency bands in high-hypnotically susceptible individuals	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hypnosis; EEG; theta rhythm; beta rhythm; functional connectivity; coherence; imaginary coherence	FRANKLIN COMMISSION; WORKING-MEMORY; HYPNOSIS; COHERENCE; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; TRANCE; GAMMA; NEGATIVITY	Altered state theories of hypnosis posit that a qualitatively distinct state of mental processing, which emerges in those with high hypnotic susceptibility following a hypnotic induction, enables the generation of anomalous experiences in response to specific hypnotic suggestions. If so then such a state should be observable as a discrete pattern of changes to functional connectivity (shared information) between brain regions following a hypnotic induction in high but not low hypnotically susceptible participants. Twenty-eight channel EEG was recorded from 12 high susceptible (highs) and 11 low susceptible (lows) participants with their eyes closed prior to and following a standard hypnotic induction. The EEG was used to provide a measure of functional connectivity using both coherence (COH) and the imaginary component of coherence (iCOH), which is insensitive to the effects of volume conduction. COH and iCOH were calculated between all electrode pairs for the frequency bands: delta (0.1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz) alpha (8-12.9 Hz), beta1 (13-19.9 Hz), beta2 (20-29.9 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz). The results showed that there was an increase in theta iCOH from the pre-hypnosis to hypnosis condition in highs but not lows with a large proportion of significant links being focused on a central-parietal hub. There was also a decrease in beta1 iCOH from the pre-hypnosis to hypnosis condition with a focus on a fronto-central and an occipital hub that was greater in high compared to low susceptibles. There were no significant differences for COH or for spectral band amplitude in any frequency band. The results are interpreted as indicating that the hypnotic induction elicited a qualitative change in the organization of specific control systems within the brain for high as compared to low susceptible participants. This change in the functional organization of neural networks is a plausible indicator of the much theorized "hypnotic-state."

Results: PSG analysis revealed significant alterations in sleep architecture in the JME group in the form of reduced mean sleep efficiency (p=<0.035) and number of patients with reduced sleep efficiency (p=0.001), increased mean sleep onset latency (p=0.04) and number of patients with increased sleep latency (p=0.023), reduced mean N2 sleep percentage (p=0.005) and reduced mean total NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (p=0.001) and increased mean wake percentage (p=0.001). The frequency of arousals, involuntary limb movements, and event related arousals in the JME groups was not different from the controls. Patients >20 years had reduced total sleep time compared to those <20 years (p=0.012). Patients with seizures for >5 years had reduced NREM steep percentage (p=0.042) and those on VPA therapy >1 year had a longer stage 2 (p=0.03) and N3 latency (p=0.03). Patients on <= 600 mg/day of VPA had a higher prevalence of isolated limb movements (p=0.01). Conclusions: PSG revealed significant alterations in sleep architecture in JME despite adequate seizure control. There was variable degree of PSG-phenotypic correlation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies concerning gamma band power in schizophrenia have yielded diverse results. Methods: In this study, we assessed gamma band power in minimally treated patients with schizophrenia, their first-degree relatives and healthy controls during an oddball paradigm performance, as well as the relation between gamma power and cognitive performance. Results: We found a higher gamma power in the patient group than in the healthy controls at the P3, P4, Fz, Pz and T5 sites. Compared with their relatives, gamma power in the patients was only marginally higher over P3 and P4. We found a nearly significant inverse association between gamma power at F4 and Tower of London performance in the patients, as well as a significant inverse association between gamma power at T5 and verbal memory and working memory scores in the relatives. Conclusion: These results support higher total gamma power in association with schizophrenia and its inverse association with cognitive performance in patients and their first-degree relatives.

We recorded neuromagnetic signals in 14 healthy volunteers using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during simulated driving. MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry to detect the spatial distribution of cerebral oscillations. Group effects between subjects were analyzed statistically using a non-parametric permutation test. Oscillatory differences were calculated by comparison between "passive viewing" and "active driving." "Passive viewing" was the baseline, and oscillatory differences during "active driving" showed an increase or decrease in comparison with a baseline. Power increase in the theta band was detected in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during active driving. Power decreases in the alpha, beta, and low gamma bands were detected in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCiG) during active driving. Power increase in the theta band in the SFG may play a role in attention. Power decrease in the right IPL may reflect selectively divided attention and visuospatial processing, whereas that in the left PoCG reflects sensorimotor activation related to driving manipulation. Power decreases in the MTG and PCiG may be associated with object recognition.

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which semantic content from multiple modalities is integrated into a coherent multisensory representation. Therefore we aimed to characterize differences between integration of lexical-semantic information from a single modality compared with two sensory modalities. We used magnetoencephalography in humans to investigate changes in oscillatory neuronal activity while participants verified two features for a given target word (e.g., "bus"). Feature pairs consisted of either two features from the same modality (visual: "red," "big") or different modalities (auditory and visual: "red," "loud"). The results suggest that integrating modality-specific features of the target word is associated with enhanced high-frequency power (80 - 120 Hz), while integrating features from different modalities is associated with a sustained increase in low-frequency power (2-8 Hz). Source reconstruction revealed a peak in the anterior temporal lobe for low-frequency and high-frequency effects. These results suggest that integrating lexical-semantic knowledge at different cortical scales is reflected in frequency-specific oscillatory neuronal activity in unisensory and multisensory association networks.

Cortical theta wanes for language	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FIELD POTENTIALS; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; BOLD; ALPHA; POWER; GAMMA; BAND; EEG	The role of low frequency oscillations in language areas is not yet understood. Using ECoG in six human subjects, we studied whether different language regions show prominent power changes in a specific rhythm, in similar manner as the alpha rhythm shows the most prominent power changes in visual areas. Broca's area and temporal language areas were localized in individual subjects using fMRI. In these areas, the theta rhythm showed the most pronounced power changes and theta power decreased significantly during verb generation. To better understand the role of this language-related theta decrease, we then studied the interaction between low frequencies and local neuronal activity reflected in high frequencies. Amplitude-amplitude correlations showed that theta power correlated negatively with high frequency activity, specifically across verb generation trials. Phase-amplitude coupling showed that during control trials, high frequency power was coupled to theta phase, but this coupling decreased significantly during verb generation trials. These results suggest a dynamic interaction between the neuronal mechanisms underlying the theta rhythm and local neuronal activity in language areas. As visual areas show a pronounced alpha rhythm that may reflect pulsed inhibition, language regions show a pronounced theta rhythm with highly similar features. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of ketamine (a primarily non-GABAergic anesthetic drug) on alpha oscillations has not been systematically evaluated. We analyzed the electroencephalogram of 28 surgical patients during consciousness and ketamine-induced unconsciousness with a focus on frontal power, frontal cross-frequency coupling, frontal-parietal functional connectivity (measured by coherence and phase lag index), and frontal-to-parietal directional connectivity (measured by directed phase lag index) in the alpha bandwidth. Unlike past studies of propofol, ketamine-induced unconsciousness was not associated with increases in the power of frontal alpha rhythms, characteristic cross-frequency coupling patterns of frontal alpha power and slow-oscillation phase, or decreases in coherence in the alpha bandwidth. Like past studies of propofol using undirected and directed phase lag index, ketamine reduced frontal-parietal (functional) and frontal-to-parietal (directional) connectivity in the alpha bandwidth. These results suggest that directional connectivity changes in the alpha bandwidth may be state-related markers of unconsciousness induced by both GABAergic and non-GABAergic anesthetics.

Physical plausibility of the spatial-kinematic relationship of human movement may play a major role in the top-down processing of human motion recognition. Here, we investigated the time course of scalp activation during observation of human gait in order to extract and use it on future integrated brain-computer interface using virtual reality (VR). We analyzed event related potentials (ERP), the event related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and the inter-trial coherence (ITC) from high-density EEG recording during video display onset (-200-600 ms) and the steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) inside the video of human walking 3D-animation in three conditions: Normal; Upside-down (inverted images); and Uncoordinated (pseudo-randomly mixed images). We found that early visual evoked response P120 was decreased in Upside-down condition. The N170 and P300b amplitudes were decreased in Uncoordinated condition. In Upside-down and Uncoordinated conditions, we found decreased alpha power and theta phase-locking. As regards gamma oscillation, power was increased during the Upside-down animation and decreased during the Uncoordinated animation. An SSVEP-like response oscillating at about 10 Hz was also described showing that the oscillating pattern is enhanced 300ms after the heel strike event only in the Normal but not in the Upside-down condition. Our results are consistent with most of previous point-light display studies, further supporting possible use of virtual reality for neurofeedback applications.

SEPs reveal a burst of superimposed early (N20) high-frequency oscillations around 600 Hz. Previous studies reported alterations of SEPs in patients with schizophrenia. This study addresses the question whether those alterations are also observable in populations at risk for developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. To our knowledge to date, this is the first study investigating SEPs in a population at risk for developing psychoses. Median nerve SEPs were investigated using multichannel EEG in individuals at risk for developing bipolar disorders (n = 25), individuals with high-risk status (n = 59) and ultra-high-risk status for schizophrenia (n =73) and a gender and age-matched control group (n = 45). Strengths and latencies of low- and high-frequency components as estimated by dipole source analysis were compared between groups. Low- and high-frequency source activity was reduced in both groups at risk for schizophrenia, in comparison to the group at risk for bipolar disorders. HFO amplitudes were also significant reduced in subjects with high-risk status for schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. These differences were accentuated among cannabis non-users. Reduced N20 source strengths were related to higher positive symptom load. These results suggest that the risk for schizophrenia, in contrast to bipolar disorders, may involve an impairment of early cerebral somatosensory processing. Neurophysiologic alterations in schizophrenia precede the onset of initial psychotic episode and may serve as indicator of vulnerability for developing schizophrenia.

Selective attention modulates high-frequency activity in the face-processing network	CORTEX			English	Article						Emotion; Face processing; Amygdala; Gamma band activity; Intracranial EEG	FACIAL-EXPRESSION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; INTRACRANIAL RECORDINGS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; EMOTION; POTENTIALS	Face processing depends on the orchestrated activity of a large-scale neuronal network. Its activity can be modulated by attention as a function of task demands. However, it remains largely unknown whether voluntary, endogenous attention and reflexive, exogenous attention to facial expressions equally affect all regions of the face-processing network, and whether such effects primarily modify the strength of the neuronal response, the latency, the duration, or the spectral characteristics. We exploited the good temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and recorded from depth electrodes to uncover the fast dynamics of emotional face processing. We investigated frequency-specific responses and event-related potentials (ERP) in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), ventral temporal cortex (VTC), anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala when facial expressions were task-relevant or task-irrelevant. All investigated regions of interest (ROI) were clearly modulated by task demands and exhibited stronger changes in stimulus-induced gamma band activity (50-150 Hz) when facial expressions were task-relevant. Observed latencies demonstrate that the activation is temporally coordinated across the network, rather than serially proceeding along a processing hierarchy. Early and sustained responses to task-relevant faces in VOTC and VTC corroborate their role for the core system of face processing, but they also occurred in the anterior insula. Strong attentional modulation in the OFC and amygdala (300 msec) suggests that the extended system of the face-processing network is only recruited if the task demands active face processing. Contrary to our expectation, we rarely observed differences between fearful and neutral faces. Our results demonstrate that activity in the face-processing network is susceptible to the deployment of selective attention. Moreover, we show that endogenous attention operates along the whole face-processing network, and that these effects are reflected in frequency-specific changes in the gamma band.

This phenomenon is typically studied with the retrieval practice paradigm in which a category cue (e.g., Fruits) is presented together with an item-specific cue (e.g., Or::). Presentation of the category cue usually induces interference by reactivating competing memories (e.g., Banana, Apple, etc.), which is thought to be solved by means of inhibition, leading to retrieval-induced forgetting of these competing memories. Previous studies associated interference with an increase in medial prefrontal theta band (4-8 Hz) oscillations, but these studies could not disentangle the interference from the inhibition processes. We here used a retrieval practice procedure in which the category cue was presented before the item-specific cue to disentangle the interference from the inhibition signal. Furthermore, a competitive retrieval condition was contrasted with a noncompetitive condition. At a behavioral level, retrieval-induced forgetting was found in the competitive but not in the noncompetitive condition. At a neural level, presentation of the category cue elicited higher levels of theta power in the competitive condition, when compared with the noncompetitive retrieval condition. Importantly, this difference was localized to the ACC, which has been associated with the detection and mediation of interference. Additionally, theta power decreased upon presentation of the item-specific cue, and this difference was related to later forgetting. Our results therefore disentangle, for the first time, interference and inhibition in episodic memory retrieval and suggest that theta oscillations track the fine-grained temporal dynamics of interference during competitive memory retrieval.

J	Tamaki, M; Bang, JW; Watanabe, T; Sasaki, Y				Tamaki, Masako; Bang, Ji Won; Watanabe, Takeo; Sasaki, Yuka			The first-night effect suppresses the strength of slow-wave activity originating in the visual areas during sleep	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Sleep; First-night effect; Slow-wave activity; Adaptation; Plasticity	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; EEG POWER-DENSITY; MESSENGER-RNA; LOCAL SLEEP; NIGHT; ADAPTATION; CORTEX; FMRI; ORGANIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	Our visual system is plastic and adaptive in response to the stimuli and environments we experience. Although visual adaptation and plasticity have been extensively studied while participants are awake, little is known about what happens while they are asleep. It has been documented that sleep structure as measured by sleep stages using polysomnography is altered specifically in the first sleep session due to exposure to a new sleep environment, known as the first-night effect (FNE). However, the impact of the FNE on spontaneous oscillations in the visual system is poorly understood. How does the FNE affect the visual system during sleep? To address this question, the present study examined whether the FNE modifies the strength of slow-wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz)-the dominant spontaneous brain oscillation in slow-wave sleep-in the visual areas. We measured the strength of SWA originating in the visual areas during the first and the second sleep sessions. Magnetoencephalography, polysomnography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to localize the source of SWA to the visual areas. The visual areas were objectively defined using retinotopic mapping and an automated anatomical parcellation technique. The results showed that the strength of SWA was reduced in the first sleep session in comparison to the second sleep session, especially during slow-wave sleep, in the ventral part of the visual areas. These results suggest that environmental novelty may affect the visual system through suppression of SWA. The impact of the FNE may not be negligible in vision research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Seizure freedom has been correlated with removal of brain regions generating pathologic HFOs. However, quantitative analysis of preictal HFOs has seldom been applied to the clinical problem of planning the surgical resection. We performed Granger causality (GC) analysis of iEEG recordings to analyze features of preictal seizure networks and to aid in surgical decision making. MethodsTen retrospective and two prospective patients were chosen on the basis of individually stereotyped seizure patterns by visual criteria. Prospective patients were selected, additionally, for failure of those criteria to resolve apparent multilobar ictal onsets. iEEG was recorded at 500 or 1,000Hz, using up to 128 surface and depth electrodes. Preictal and early ictal GC from individual electrodes was characterized by the strength of causal outflow, spatial distribution, and hierarchical causal relationships. ResultsIn all patients we found significant, widespread preictal GC network activity at peak frequencies from 80 to 250Hz, beginning 2-42s before visible electrographic onset. In the two prospective patients, GC source/sink comparisons supported the exclusion of early ictal regions that were not the dominant causal sources, and contributed to planning of more limited surgical resections. Both patients have a class 1 outcome at 1year. SignificanceGC analysis of iEEG has the potential to increase understanding of preictal network activity, and to help improve surgical outcomes in cases of otherwise ambiguous iEEG onset.

Here we show that artificially elevating parietal activity via positively-charged electric current through the skull can rapidly and effortlessly change people'prestimulus alpha power and improve subsequent performance on a visual short-term memory (VSTM) task. This modulation of alpha power and behavioral performance, however, is dependent on people's natural VSTIV capability such that only the low performers benefitted from the stimulation, whereas high performers dic not. This behavioral dichotomy is accounted by prestimulus alpha powers around the parieto-occipital regions low performers showed decreased prestimulus alpha power, suggesting improvement in attention deploymen in the current paradigm, whereas the high performers did not benefit from tDCS as they showed equally-low prestimulus alpha power before and after the stimulation. Together, these results suggest that prestimulus alpha power, especially in low performers, can be modulated by anodal stimulation and alter subsequen VSTM performance/capacity. Thus, measuring alpha before stimulus onset may be as important as measuring other VSTM-related electrophysiological components such as attentional allocation and memory capacity relate components (i.e. N2 posterior-contralateral, N2pc, or contralateral delay activity, CDA). In addition, low VST1V performers perhaps do not suffer not only from poor VSTM capacity, but also from broad attentional mechanisms and prestimulus alpha may be an useful tool in understanding the nature of individual differences in VSTM.

Neural correlates of cross-modal affective priming by music in Williams syndrome	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Williams syndrome; music; emotion; EEG	ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RESPONSES; EMOTION; EEG; INDIVIDUALS; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; BAND; ATTRACTION	Emotional connection is the main reason people engage with music, and the emotional features of music can influence processing in other domains. Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder where musicality and sociability are prominent aspects of the phenotype. This study examined oscillatory brain activity during a musical affective priming paradigm. Participants with WS and age-matched typically developing controls heard brief emotional musical excerpts or emotionally neutral sounds and then reported the emotional valence (happy/sad) of subsequently presented faces. Participants with WS demonstrated greater evoked fronto-central alpha activity to the happy vs sad musical excerpts. The size of these alpha effects correlated with parent-reported emotional reactivity to music. Although participant groups did not differ in accuracy of identifying facial emotions, reaction time data revealed a music priming effect only in persons with WS, who responded faster when the face matched the emotional valence of the preceding musical excerpt vs when the valence differed. Matching emotional valence was also associated with greater evoked gamma activity thought to reflect cross-modal integration. This effect was not present in controls. The results suggest a specific connection between music and socioemotional processing and have implications for clinical and educational approaches for WS.

J	Matsumoto, A; Kakigi, R				Matsumoto, Atsushi; Kakigi, Ryusuke			Subliminal Semantic Priming Changes the Dynamic Causal Influence between the Left Frontal and Temporal Cortex	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; PROCESSING EVIDENCE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; REPETITION; EEG; REPRESENTATION	Recent neuroimaging experiments have revealed that subliminal priming of a target stimulus leads to the reduction of neural activity in specific regions concerned with processing the target. Such findings lead to questions about the degree to which the subliminal priming effect is based only on decreased activity in specific local brain regions, as opposed to the influence of neural mechanisms that regulate communication between brain regions. To address this question, this study recorded EEG during performance of a subliminal semantic priming task. We adopted an information-based approach that used independent component analysis and multivariate autoregressive modeling. Results indicated that subliminal semantic priming caused significant modulation of alpha band activity in the left inferior frontal cortex and modulation of gamma band activity in the left inferior temporal regions. The multivariate autoregressive approach confirmed significant increases in information flow from the inferior frontal cortex to inferior temporal regions in the early time window that was induced by subliminal priming. In the later time window, significant enhancement of bidirectional causal flow between these two regions underlying subliminal priming was observed. Results suggest that unconscious processing of words influences not only local activity of individual brain regions but also the dynamics of neural communication between those regions.

Spontaneous theta activity recorded locally in the posterior hypothalamic area (PHa) has never been the subject of detailed studies. The authors have shown that local theta field potentials could be generated in urethane-anesthetized rats in the supramammillary (SuM) nuclei and posterior hypothalamic (PH) nuclei. Theta recorded in the PHa was produced independently of simultaneously occurring hippocampal theta. These data were confirmed in the PHa maintained in vitro. Local theta field activity was recorded in the SuM and PH nuclei of PHa slice preparations perfused with cholinergic agonist carbachol. Both in vivo and in vitro recorded PHa theta rhythmicity had a cholinergic-muscarinic profile, that is, it was antagonized by muscarinic antagonist atropine sulfate. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The P300 BCI system relies on an oddball paradigm to elicit the P300. With the aim to extract different P300 feature information from different subjects and reduce the data amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) in P300 classification, a P300 feature extraction algorithm is proposed, which is based on independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform. Firstly, based on the algorithms of ICA and fisher distance, specific channel combinations which to extract features from are selected for different subjects, and different optimal features such as peaks of time domain, peak areas and wavelet coefficients from these specific channel combinations are extracted. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for the classification of P300. Here, the BCI Competition III data set II has been used to verify the method. Compared with the two related literature, for subject A, the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of 85%, which has 6 and 5 percentage point increase respectively and reduce the data amount by 62.5%, and for subject B, achieve an accuracy of 94%, which has 5 and 1 percentage point increase respectively and reduce the data amount by 64.3%. All these verify that the proposed method can select optimal features from both time domain and frequency domain according to specific subjects and reduce the data amount to improve the speed of classification, while achieve an higher accuracy.

Mice Lacking the Circadian Modulators SHARP1 and SHARP2 Display Altered Sleep and Mixed State Endophenotypes of Psychiatric Disorders	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; BIPOLAR-I DISORDER; PREPULSE INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; STRAIN DIFFERENCES; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOOD DISORDERS; PHASE SYNDROME; ANIMAL-MODELS; CLOCK GENES	Increasing evidence suggests that clock genes may be implicated in a spectrum of psychiatric diseases, including sleep and mood related disorders as well as schizophrenia. The bHLH transcription factors SHARP1/DEC2/BHLHE41 and SHARP2/DEC1/ BHLHE40 are modulators of the circadian system and SHARP1/DEC2/BHLHE40 has been shown to regulate homeostatic sleep drive in humans. In this study, we characterized Sharp1 and Sharp2 double mutant mice (S1/2(-/-)) using online EEG recordings in living animals, behavioral assays and global gene expression profiling. EEG recordings revealed attenuated sleep/wake amplitudes and alterations of theta oscillations. Increased sleep in the dark phase is paralleled by reduced voluntary activity and cortical gene expression signatures reveal associations with psychiatric diseases. S1/2(-/-) mice display alterations in novelty induced activity, anxiety and curiosity. Moreover, mutant mice exhibit impaired working memory and deficits in prepulse inhibition resembling symptoms of psychiatric diseases. Network modeling indicates a connection between neural plasticity and clock genes, particularly for SHARP1 and PER1. Our findings support the hypothesis that abnormal sleep and certain (endo) phenotypes of psychiatric diseases may be caused by common mechanisms involving components of the molecular clock including SHARP1 and SHARP2.

A neuronal signal emitted by the prefrontal cortex is considered to be an important contributor to filtering. Proof of the functional significance of this signal during normal cognitive functioning is, however, still missing. Furthermore, research has so far neglected that the prefrontal cortex must receive input from posterior brain areas that report the necessity to filter. From human electroencephalograms, we extracted several event-related components that reflect the different subprocesses of filtering. On the basis of their timing and a clear pattern of correlations, we reason that filtering might consist of a causal chain of events that involve prefrontal and posterior cortex regions: After distractors are detected in posterior regions, a prefrontal mechanism is activated, which in turn prevents subsequent unnecessary parietal storage of distractor information.

We investigated the time course of sensory encoding and subsequent maintenance in memory via EEG. Twenty-nine healthy participants completed a facial emotion delayed match-to-sample task. P100, N170 and N250 ERPs were measured in response to the first stimulus, and evoked theta power (4-7 Hz) was measured during the delay interval. Negative facial expressions produced larger N170 amplitudes and greater theta power early in the delay. N170 amplitude correlated with theta power, however larger N170 amplitude coupled with greater theta power only predicted behavioural performance for one emotion condition (very happy) out of six tested (see Supplemental Data). These findings indicate that the N170 ERP may be sensitive to emotional facial expressions when task demands require encoding and retention of this information. Furthermore, sustained theta activity may represent continued attentional processing that supports short-term memory, especially of negative facial stimuli. Further study is needed to investigate the potential influence of these measures, and their interaction, on behavioural performance. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We examine the possibility to monitor learning using physiological measures that have been reported to reflect effort or workload. Thirty-five participants performed different difficulty levels of the n-back task while a range of physiological and performance measurements were recorded. In order to dissociate non-specific time-related effects from effects of learning, we used the easiest level as a baseline condition. This condition is expected to only reflect non-specific effects of time. Performance and subjective measures confirmed more learning for the difficult level than for the easy level. The difficulty levels affected physiological variables in the way as expected, therewith showing their sensitivity. However, while most of the physiological variables were also affected by time, time-related effects were generally the same for the easy and the difficult level. Thus, in a well-controlled experiment that enabled the dissociation of general time effects from learning we did not find physiological variables to indicate decreasing effort associated with learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Brouwer, Anne-Marie; Hogervorst, Maarten A.; Holewijn, Michael; van Erp, Jan B.

However, these methods evaluated the interactions between recorded signals in an isolated network. In this study, we present a novel approach for estimating interactions between observed neuronal signals by theorizing that those signals are observed from only a part of the network that also includes unobserved structures. We propose a variant of the recurrent network model that consists of both observable and unobservable units. The observable units represent recorded neuronal activity, and the unobservable units are introduced to represent activity from unobserved structures in the network. The network structures are characterized by connective weights, i.e., the interaction intensities between individual units, which are estimated from recorded signals. We applied this model to multi-channel brain signals recorded from monkeys, and obtained robust network structures with physiological relevance. Furthermore, the network exhibited common features that portrayed cortical dynamics as inversely correlated interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons, which are consistent with the previous view of cortical local circuits. Our results suggest that the novel concept of incorporating an unobserved structure into network estimations has theoretical advantages and could provide insights into brain dynamics beyond what can be directly observed.

However, the marked acute psychological side effects of ketamine complicate the interpretation of both preclinical and clinical data. Moreover, the lack of controlled data demonstrating the ability of ketamine to sustain the antidepressant response with repeated administration leaves the potential clinical utility of this class of drugs in question. Using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to objectively align doses of a low-trapping NMDA channel blocker, AZD6765 (lanicemine), to that of ketamine, we demonstrate the potential for NMDA channel blockers to produce antidepressant efficacy without psychotomimetic and dissociative side effects. Furthermore, using placebo-controlled data, we show that the antidepressant response to NMDA channel blockers can be maintained with repeated and intermittent drug administration. Together, these data provide a path for the development of novel glutamatergic-based therapeutics for treatment-refractory mood disorders.

Studies devoted to unraveling mechanisms of seizure termination often take one of the two following approaches. The first approach focuses on metabolic mechanisms such as ionic concentrations, acidity, or neuromodulator release, studying how they are dependent on, and in turn affect changes of neuronal activity. The second approach uses quantitative tools to derive functional networks from electrophysiological recordings and analyzes these networks with mathematical methods, without focusing on actual details of cell biology. In this chapter, we summarize key results obtained by both of these approaches and attempt to show that they are complementary and equally necessary in our aim to gain a better understanding of seizure termination.

Learning can be completed after memory consolidation. The thalamus plays an important role in consciousness. In past research had supported that that stimulation in the central lateral thalamus could enhance the learning behavioral. Here, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation components to collect data and run the closed-loop algorithm with real-time spectrum measurement. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find the biomarker, that the theta (theta) spectral band power of local field potentials (LFPs) could be a control variable of interest when modulating hippocampal network state after central lateral thalamic stimulation. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.

This study aimed to investigate whether the resting alpha activity can predict the learning ability in alpha neurofeedback. A total of 25 subjects performed 20 sessions of individualized alpha neurofeedback and the learning ability was assessed by three indices respectively: the training parameter changes between two periods, within a short period and across the whole training time. It was found that the resting alpha amplitude measured before training had significant positive correlations with all learning indices and could be used as a predictor for the learning ability prediction. This finding would help the researchers in not only predicting the training efficacy in individuals but also gaining further insight into the mechanisms of alpha neurofeedback.

In the present electro-encephalographic study, early cross-modal interactions were investigated by comparing auditory evoked potentials during auditory, audio-visual and audio-haptic speech perception in dyadic interactions between a listener and a speaker. In line with previous studies, early auditory evoked responses were attenuated and speeded up during audio-visual compared to auditory speech perception. Crucially, shortened latencies of early auditory evoked potentials were also observed during audio-haptic speech perception. Altogether, these results suggest early bimodal interactions during live face-to-face and hand-to-face speech perception in dyadic interactions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bioinformatic approach to correction of negative emotional state in rats	VISNYK OF DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY-BIOLOGY ECOLOGY			Russian	Article						aggressive behavior; biopotentials; ventromedial hypothalamus; EEG	AGGRESSION	One of the most important problems of modem society is the growth of aggression which leads to crimes, sadism, violence and other antisocial actions. Therefore, the study of the mechanisms of development of aggressive behavior and negative aggressive reactions is extremely urgent. Thus, in order to correct the aggressive behavior it is extremely important to develop new methodological approaches. Previous studies have shown that the brain biopotentials provide functional transfer of information. With the help of magnetic or other information carrier, the information can be stored and transmitted remotely from the donor to the recipient and, in that way, can control the behavior of the animal body. Using of biological programs, expressed via the brain biopotentials at their minimum voltage (which is indicated by the amplitude of the frequency spectrum of electrical oscillations in the EEG), it can give therapeutic effect. The aim of the paper is studying of the neurobiological mechanisms of aggressive behavior and usage of bioinformatic programs expressed via the potentials of the brain. In the course of the experiments, we have shown the possibility to use the ventromedial hypothalamic stimulation as a realistic model of negative emotional state. In this model, behavioral indexes (reactions of avoidance, increased vocalizations, negative grooming) correlated with the indexes of electrical activity of brain structures of emotional limbic-neocortical system (numerous epilepti-form paroxysms, sharp shocks and complexes with epi components of peak-theta and peak-delta type). The introduction of information expressed in biopotentials of the positive emotional ventrolateral hypothalamus of the brain of donor rat to recipient rats with a model negative emotional state leads to balancing of emotional homeostasis, resulting in disappearance of convulsive components and diffuse affective paroxysms in EEG, and also in manifestations of positive grooming and tranquility. This method of emotional homeostasis correction is suggested as a new method for correction of emotional disorders and is expected to be effective for the further study.	[Bevzyuk, D.

Results were compared between QEEG indices calculated from the standard 19 versus 4 frontal (or 4 posterior) electrodes to assess the feasibility and efficacy of employing a reduced electrode montage. Resting-state EEG was recorded at the bedside within 62-101 h after onset of symptoms of middle cerebral artery, ischaemic stroke (confirmed radiologically). Relative power for delta, theta, alpha and beta, delta/alpha ratio (DAR) and pairwise-derived brain symmetry index (pdBSI) were averaged; over all electrodes (global), over F3, F4, F7, F8 (frontal) and P3, P4, T5, T6 (posterior). The functional independence measure and functional assessment measure (FIM-FAM) was administered at mean 105 days post-stroke. Total (30 items) and cognition-specific (5 items) FIM-FAM scores were correlated with QEEG indices using Spearman's coefficient, with a Bonferroni correction. Twenty-five patients were recruited, 4 died within 3 months and 1 was lost to follow-up. Hence 20 cases (10 female; 9 left hemisphere; mean age 68 years, range 38-84) were analysed. Two QEEG indices demonstrated highly-significant correlations with cognitive outcomes: frontal DAR (rho = -0.664, p <= 0.001) and global, relative alpha power (rho = 0.67, p <= 0.001). After correction there were no other significant correlations. Alpha activity - particularly frontally - may index post-stroke attentional capacity, which appears to be a key determinant of functional and cognitive outcomes. Likewise frontal delta pathophysiology influences such outcomes. Pending further studies, DAR from 4 frontal electrodes may inform early screening for post-MCA stroke cognitive deficits, and thereby, clinical decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamics on Networks: The Role of Local Dynamics and Global Networks on the Emergence of Hypersynchronous Neural Activity	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; ABSENCE SEIZURES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; GENERALIZED SEIZURES; CORTICAL NETWORKS; KURAMOTO MODEL	Graph theory has evolved into a useful tool for studying complex brain networks inferred from a variety of measures of neural activity, including fMRI, DTI, MEG and EEG. In the study of neurological disorders, recent work has discovered differences in the structure of graphs inferred from patient and control cohorts. However, most of these studies pursue a purely observational approach; identifying correlations between properties of graphs and the cohort which they describe, without consideration of the underlying mechanisms. To move beyond this necessitates the development of computational modeling approaches to appropriately interpret network interactions and the alterations in brain dynamics they permit, which in the field of complexity sciences is known as dynamics on networks. In this study we describe the development and application of this framework using modular networks of Kuramoto oscillators. We use this framework to understand functional networks inferred from resting state EEG recordings of a cohort of 35 adults with heterogeneous idiopathic generalized epilepsies and 40 healthy adult controls. Taking emergent synchrony across the global network as a proxy for seizures, our study finds that the critical strength of coupling required to synchronize the global network is significantly decreased for the epilepsy cohort for functional networks inferred from both theta (3-6 Hz) and low-alpha (6-9 Hz) bands. We further identify left frontal regions as a potential driver of seizure activity within these networks. We also explore the ability of our method to identify individuals with epilepsy, observing up to 80% predictive power through use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Collectively these findings demonstrate that a computer model based analysis of routine clinical EEG provides significant additional information beyond standard clinical interpretation, which should ultimately enable a more appropriate mechanistic stratification of people with epilepsy leading to improved diagnostics and therapeutics.

Irsel; Remi, Jan; Erbil, Nurhan; Noachtar, Soheyl; Saygi, Serap			A reduction of sleep spindles heralds seizures in focal epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep; Epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Sleep spindle; Seizure prediction	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	Objectives: Sleep has profound effects on epilepsy. It may alter the occurrence of interictal discharges (IEDs) and seizures. Vice versa, an active epilepsy changes sleep. Sleep spindles are typically associated with an increase of IEDs. We examined whether seizures change the number and power of spindles preceding nightly seizures. Methods: We retrospectively examined the nightly EEG recordings of presurgical epilepsy patients from our EEG-video-monitoring unit. We evaluated the 200 s before the EEG seizure onset for spindle density (spindles per minute) and spindle power and compared that to the interictal baseline sleep. Results: The spindle density and the spindle power decreased significantly before the first seizure. The reduction before secondarily generalized seizures (8.7 +/- 2.5; p = 0.001) was more pronounced than before focal seizures (10.5 +/- 2.5; p = 0.003) compared to baseline (12.2 +/- 2.7). This finding was more pronounced in extratemporal lobe epilepsies than in temporal lobe epilepsies. The reduction of spindle power was also significant and was more pronounced in XTLE. These results were consistent for all other seizures during sleep, the mean spindle density decreased significantly in all focal (10.2 +/- 1.9; p = 0.001) and generalized preictal period (8.8 +/- 2.4; p = 0.001) compared to the mean interictal period (12.1 +/- 2.1). These were also more significant in XTLE than TLE group. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the occurrence of seizures and propensity of seizure generalisation in focal epilepsy is modulated by specific characteristics of light sleep such as sleep spindles.

Accordingly the alpha power in visual regions varies in anticipation of upcoming, predictable stimuli which has consequences for visual processing and subsequent behavior. In covert spatial attention studies it has been demonstrated that performance correlates with the adaptation of alpha power in response to explicit spatial cueing. However it remains unknown whether such an adaptation also occurs in response to implicit statistical properties of a task. In a covert attention switching paradigm, we here show evidence that individuals differ on how they adapt to implicit statistical properties of the task. Subjects whose behavioral performance reflects the implicit change in switch trial likelihood show strong adjustment of anticipatory alpha power lateralization. Most importantly, the stronger the behavioral adjustment to the switch trial likelihood was, the stronger the adjustment of anticipatory posterior alpha lateralization. We conclude that anticipatory spatial attention is reflected in the distribution of posterior alpha band power which is predictive of individual detection performance in response to the implicit statistical properties of the task.

Apart from the traditional homeostatic slow-wave economy, we also overviewed research on the existence and role of reactive aspects of sleep slow waves. Based on the results from spontaneous and artificially evoked slow waves, we offer a new hypothesis on instant slow wave homeostatic regulation. This regulation compensates for any potentially sleep-disturbing events by providing instant "delta injections" to maintain the nightly delta level, thus protecting cognitive functions located in the frontal lobe. We suggest that this double (long-term /instant) homeostasis provides double security for the frontal lobes in order to protect cognitive functions. The incorporation of reactive slow wave activity (SWA) makes sleep regulation more dynamic and provides more room for the internalization of external influences during sleep. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Our hypothesis is that in trials where pre- or peristimulus alpha phase is already aligned in a way that voltage positive alpha peaks develop seamlessly into the P-1, detection performance will be enhanced as compared to trials where alpha is not aligned. The findings supported our hypothesis and showed that target detection times for the subset of seamless alpha trials was significantly shorter than for trials that are not seamless. Our findings contradict the evoked model for the generation of early ERP components, which rests on the assumption of fixed latency, fixed polarity components. We found that in the non-seamless trials the 'candidate' component of the single trial P-1 was at the opposite polarity. Despite this fact, alpha phase locking was at the same high level as was observed for the seamless trials. Finally, we found that prestimulus alpha phase was aligned already in a time window preceding the P-1 by 400 ms. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Following the dose-dependent local sleep concept, two succeeding questions emerge: (1) is the sleep regulation a network-specific process; and (2) is the awakening state dependent on the previous sleep stages? To answer the questions, we conducted simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings over 22 healthy male participants, along pre-sleep, nocturnal sleep and awakening. Using paired comparisons between awakening and pre-sleep conditions, three scenarios of the regional specificity were demonstrated on awakening: (1) the default-mode and hippocampal networks maintained similar connectivity and spectral power; (2) the sensorimotor network presented reduced connectivity and spectral power; and (3) the thalamus demonstrated substantially enhanced connectivity to the neo-cortex with decreased spectral power. With regard to the stage effect, the deep sleep group had significant changes in both functional connectivity and spectral power on awakening, whereas the indices of light sleep group remained relatively quiescent after sleep. The phenomena implied that slow-wave sleep could be key to rebooting the BOLD fluctuations after sleep. In conclusion, the regional specificity and the stage effect were verified in support of the local awakening concept, indicating that sleep regulation leads to the reorganization of brain networks upon awakening.

Such plastic changes have previously been shown not only to abet the processing of musical sounds, but likewise spectral and temporal aspects of speech. Therefore, here we used the EEG technique and measured a sample of musicians and nonmusicians while the participants were passively exposed to artificial vowels in the context of an oddball paradigm. Thereby, we evaluated whether increased intracerebral functional connectivity between bilateral auditory-related brain regions may promote sensory specialization in musicians, as reflected by altered cortical N1 and P2 responses. This assumption builds on the reasoning that sensory specialization is dependent, at least in part, on the amount of synchronization between the two auditory-related cortices. Results clearly revealed that auditory-evoked N1 responses were shaped by musical expertise. In addition, in line with our reasoning musicians showed an overall increased intracerebral functional connectivity (as indexed by lagged phase synchronization) in theta, alpha, and beta bands. Finally, within-group correlative analyses indicated a relationship between intracerebral beta band connectivity and cortical N1 responses, however only within the musicians' group. Taken together, we provide first electrophysiological evidence for a relationship between musical expertise, auditory-evoked brain responses, and intracerebral functional connectivity among auditory-related brain regions.

Here, we investigated the thalamic and cortical contributions to these sleep spindle deficits. Methods: Anatomical volume of interest analysis (i.e., thalamic volumes) and electroencephalogram (EEG) source modeling (i.e., spindle-related cortical currents) were performed in patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects. Findings: Schizophrenia patients had reduced mediodorsal (MD) thalamic volumes, especially on the left side, compared to healthy controls, whereas whole thalami and lateral geniculate nuclei did not differ between groups. Furthermore, left MD volumes were strongly correlated with the number of scalp-recorded spindles in an anterior frontal region, and cortical currents underlying these anterior frontal spindles were localized in the prefrontal cortex, in Brodmann area (BA) 10. Finally, prefrontal currents at the peak of spindle activity were significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients and correlated with their performance in an abstraction/working memory task. Conclusion: Altogether, these findings point to deficits in a specific thalamo-cortical circuitry in schizophrenia, which is associated with some cognitive deficits commonly reported in those patients.

Rigidity and bradykinesia are associated with the low-beta component (13-20 Hz) but the neurophysiological correlate of freezing of gait in PD has not been ascertained. Methods: We evaluated the power and coherence of the low- and high-beta bands in the STN and cortex (EEG) of PD patients with (p-FOG) (n = 14) or without freezing of gait (n-FOG) (n = 8) in whom electrodes for chronic stimulation in the STN had been implanted for treatment with deep brain stimulation. Results: p-FOG patients showed higher power in the high-beta band (F = 11.6, p = 0.002) that was significantly reduced after L-dopa administration along with suppression of FOG (F = 4.6, p = 0.042). High-beta cortico-STN coherence was maximal for midline cortical EEG electrodes, whereas the low-beta band was maximal for lateral electrodes (chi(2) = 20.60, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The association between freezing of gait, high-beta STN oscillations and cortico-STN coherence suggests that this oscillatory activity might interfere in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia networks, thereby participating in the pathophysiology of FOG in PD.

Hypersynchrony despite pathologically reduced beta oscillations in patients with Parkinson's disease: a pharmaco-magnetoencephalography study	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cortex; oscillations; magnetoencephalography; MEG; resting state	FIELD POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MEG	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive debilitating neurodegenerative disorder clinically manifest by motor, posture and gait abnormalities. Human neurophysiological studies recording local field potentials within the subthalamic nucleus and scalp-based electroencephalography have shown pathological beta synchrony throughout the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical motor network in PD. Notably, suppression of this pathological beta synchrony by dopamine replacement therapy or deep-brain stimulation has been associated with improved motor function. However, due to the invasive nature of these studies, it remains unknown whether this "pathological beta" is actually stronger than that observed in healthy demographically matched controls. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate neuronal synchrony and oscillatory amplitude in the beta range and lower frequencies during the resting state in patients with PD and a matched group of patients without neurological disease. Patients with PD were studied both in the practically defined drug "OFF" state, and after administration of dopamine replacements. We found that beta oscillatory amplitude was reduced bilaterally in the primary motor regions of unmedicated patients with PD compared with controls. Administration of do medications significantly increased beta oscillatory activity, thus having a normalizing effect. Interestingly, we also found significantly stronger beta synchrony (i.e., hypersynchrony) between the primary motor regions in unmedicated patients with PD compared with controls, and that medication reduced this coupling which is in agreement with the intraoperative studies. These results are consistent with the known functionality of the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical motor circuit and the likely consequences of beta hypersynchrony in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with PD.

The response of cortical alpha activity to pain and neuromuscular changes caused by exercise-induced muscle damage	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						EIMD; muscle pain; cortical alpha activity; central regulator; top-down control; EEG	EEG-ALPHA; WORKING-MEMORY; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; INCREASES; CORTEX; LENGTH; THETA; POWER	Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is characterized by pain, swelling, and shortening of the muscle; increased serum creatine kinase; decreased force output; and altered neuromuscular function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EIMD to determine the relationship between the peripheral symptoms, neuromuscular changes, and delayed pain sensation during a submaximal movement of the biceps brachii on cortical alpha () activity. In contrast to the control (n=12) group, the experimental (n=16) group participated in an EIMD protocol, and both groups were monitored for 132h post-EIMD protocol. At 12h, neuromuscular functioning was already disturbed while the sensation of pain was perceived, but not fully developed. Muscle pain scores in the experimental group peaked after 36h with the lowest torque reported at 12h. -1 activity increased significantly in the motor and somatosensory area 12h post-EIMD while -2 activity increased in the contralateral fronto-central area. At 36h, pain had further increased and neuromuscular function improved while -1 and -2 activities had decreased. We hypothesize that -1 activity over the motor and somatosensory cortex of the experimental group displays a compensatory increase in response to the changes in neuromuscular function during movement, while an increase in -2 activity is related to the suppression of pain experienced within the first 12h.

Here, we analyzed the occurrence of interictal spikes and high frequency oscillations (HFOs; ripples: 80-200 Hz and fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) from 48 h before to 96 h after the first seizure in the rat pilocarpine model of MTLE. Interictal spikes recorded with depth EEG electrodes from the hippocampus CA3 area and entorhinal cortex (EC) were classified as type 1 (characterized by a spike followed by a wave) or type 2 (characterized by a spike with no wave). We found that: (i) there was a switch in the distribution of both types of interictal spikes before and after the occurrence of the first seizure; during the latent phase both types of interictal spikes predominated in the EC whereas during the chronic phase both types of spikes predominated in CA3; (ii) type 2 spike duration decreased in both regions from the latent to the chronic phase; (iii) type 2 spikes associated to fast ripples occurred at higher rates in EC compared to CA3 during the latent phase while they occurred at similar rates in both regions in the chronic phase; and (iv) rates of fast ripples outside of spikes were higher in EC compared to CA3 during the latent phase. Our findings demonstrate that the transition from the latent to the chronic phase is paralleled by dynamic changes in interictal spike and HFO expression in EC and CA3. We propose that these changes may represent biomarkers of epileptogenicity in MTLE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many studies have reported that cognitive control of emotion induces increases in neural activity of the control system, including the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and increases or decreases (depending upon the regulation goal) in neural activity of the appraisal system, including the amygdala and the insula. It has been hypothesized that information about regulation goals needs to be processed through interactions between the control and appraisal systems in order to support cognitive reappraisal. However, how this information is represented in the dynamics of cortical activity remains largely unknown. To address this, we investigated temporal changes in gamma band activity (35-55 Hz) in human electroencephalograms during a cognitive reappraisal task that was comprised of three reappraisal goals: to decease, maintain, or increase emotional responses modulated by affect-laden pictures. We examined how the characteristics of gamma oscillations, such as spectral power and large-scale phase synchronization, represented cognitive reappraisal goals. We found that left frontal gamma power decreased, was sustained, or increased when the participants suppressed, maintained, or amplified their emotions, respectively. This change in left frontal gamma power appeared during an interval of 1926 to 2453 ms after stimulus onset. We also found that the number of phase-synchronized pairs of gamma oscillations over the entire brain increased when participants regulated their emotions compared to when they maintained their emotions. These results suggest that left frontal gamma power may reflect cortical representation of emotional states modulated by cognitive reappraisal goals and gamma phase synchronization across whole brain regions may reflect emotional regulatory efforts to achieve these goals. Our study may provide the basis for an electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback system for the cognitive regulation of emotion.

Functional and effective connectivity of stopping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stopping; Inhibition; Stop signal task; N200; P300; Delta; Theta; Connectivity	MOTOR INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; MECHANISMS; FAILURE; POWER; TASK; AGE	Behavioral inhibition often is studied by comparing the electroencephalographic responses to stop and to go signals. Most studies simply assess amplitude differences of the N200 and P300 event-related potentials, which seem to best correspond to increased activity in the theta and delta frequency bands, respectively. However, neither have reliable indicators for successful behavioral inhibition been identified nor have the causal dependencies of stop-related neurocognitive processes been addressed yet. By studying functional and effective connectivity underlying stopping behavior, this study opens new directions for the investigation of behavioral inhibition. Group independent component analysis was used to infer functionally coherent networks from electroencephalographic data, which were recorded from healthy human participants during processing of a stop signal task. Then, the temporal dynamics of causal dependencies between independent components were identified by means of Bayesian network estimations. The mean clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length measure indicated time windows between 130 and 180 ms and between 420 and 500 ms to express significantly different connectivity profiles between conditions. Three components showed significant correlations between 120 and 260 ms with stop signal reaction times and the number of failed stops. Two of these components acted as sources of causal flow, one capturing P300/delta characteristics while the other was characterized by alpha power depletion putatively representing the evaluation or processing of stimulus features. Although results suggest that the P300 and associated delta activity seem to be statistically dependent on earlier processes associated with behavioral inhibition, the time window critical for inhibition coincides with early changes in causal patterns and largely precedes peak amplitude differences between go and stop trials. Altogether, utilizing the analysis of stopping-related connectivity, previously undetected patterns emerged that warrant further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mukhopadhyay, D				Mukhopadhyay, Dyutiman			Understanding the Neuropsychology of Aesthetic Paradox: The Dual Phase Oscillation Hypothesis	REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						aesthetic delight; suspension of disbelief; introspective detached contemplation; Default Mode Network; dual phase oscillation hypothesis	DEFAULT NETWORK; STIMULUS COMPLEXITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WANDERING MINDS; ART; MODE; SELF; EEG; NOVELTY; SYSTEMS	Aesthetic delight is a unique and paradoxical psychological experience of simultaneous emotional exaltation and a state of serenity toward a percept when an individual experiences the percept with the approach of an art experiencer or artist. The primary drawback of neuroscientific investigation of art is that it fails to trace the functional coherence of the entire process of generation of aesthetic delight. At least 2 recent seminal works by Vessel et al. (2013) and Cela-Conde et al. (2013) tried to resolve this deficiency using 2 different neuroimaging techniques (fMRI and MEG respectively) and assessed the relevance of the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain in the generation of aesthetic pleasure. However, their works are yet to precisely highlight what primarily separates aesthetic experience from similar psychological experiences. This article formulates the dual phase oscillation hypothesis based on the neural correlate of the paradox of aesthetic delight, explaining the precise logic behind linking aesthetic delight and DMN activity. The hypothesis focuses on 2 seemingly paradoxical unique attributes of aesthetic delight: the phenomenon of suspension of disbelief (SOD), whereby the person experiencing art temporarily suspends the belief of surface reality, and the phenomenon of introspective detached contemplation, whereby the same person, while experiencing the same art, reflects on the artistic phenomenon and is simultaneously aware of the surface reality. The hypothesis proposes that aesthetic delight is the dynamic, oscillatory balance between SOD and introspective detached contemplation and is orchestrated by the functional coherence of the DMN. The article integrates the 2 previous works with the fundamentals of this proposal and thus offers a unique neuropsychological solution to the problem of aesthetic paradox.

Whole-brain network models have proved helpful to investigate the source of slow (<0.1 Hz) correlated hemodynamic fluctuations revealed in fMRI during rest. However, the mechanisms mediating resting-state long-distance correlations and the relationship with the faster neural activity remain unclear. Novel insights coming from MEG studies have shown that the amplitude envelopes of alpha- and beta-frequency oscillations (-8-30 Hz) display similar correlation patterns as the fMRI signals. In this work, we combine experimental and theoretical work to investigate the mechanisms of spontaneous MEG functional connectivity. Using a simple model of coupled oscillators adapted to incorporate realistic whole-brain connectivity and conduction delays, we explore how slow and structured amplitude envelopes of band-pass filtered signals - fairly reproducing MEG data collected from 10 healthy subjects at rest - are generated spontaneously in the space-time structure of the brain network Our simulation results show that the large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity provides an optimal network structure to support a regime with metastable synchronization. In this regime, different subsystems may temporarily synchronize at reduced collective frequencies (falling in the 8-30 Hz range due to the delays) while the global system never fully synchronizes. This mechanism modulates the frequency of the oscillators on a slow time-scale (<0.1 Hz) leading to structured amplitude fluctuations of band-pass filtered signals. Taken overall, our results reveal that the structured amplitude envelope fluctuations observed in resting-state MEG data may originate from spontaneous synchronization mechanisms naturally occurring in the space-time structure of the brain.

J	Frohlich, F				Frohlich, Flavio			Endogenous and exogenous electric fields as modifiers of brain activity: rational design of noninvasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation	DIALOGUES IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						feedback electric field; magnetic resonance imaging; neuronal network; transcranial alternating current stimulation		Synchronized neuronal activity in the cortex generates weak electric fields that are routinely measured in humans and animal models by electroencephalography and local field potential recordings. Traditionally, these endogenous electric fields have been considered to be an epiphenomenon of brain activity. Recent work has demonstrated that active cortical networks are surprisingly susceptible to weak perturbations of the membrane voltage of a large number of neurons by electric fields. Simultaneously, non-invasive brain stimulation with weak, exogenous electric fields (transcranial current stimulation, TCS) has undergone a renaissance due to the broad scope of its possible applications in modulating brain activity for cognitive enhancement and treatment of brain disorders. This review aims to interface the recent developments in the study of both endogenous and exogenous electric fields, with a particular focus on rhythmic stimulation for the modulation of cortical oscillations. The main goal is to provide a starting point for the use of rational design for the development of novel mechanism-based TCS therapeutics based on transcranial alternating current stimulation, for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

J	Castellani, G; Intrator, N; Remondini, D				Castellani, Gastone; Intrator, Nathan; Remondini, Daniel			Systems biology and brain activity in neuronal pathways by smart device and advanced signal processing	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS			English	Article							NETWORKS; EXPRESSION; GENES; ASSOCIATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CELLS; STATE	Contemporary biomedicine is producing large amount of data, especially within the fields of "omic" sciences. Nevertheless, other fields, such as neuroscience, are producing similar amount of data by using non-invasive techniques such as imaging, functional magnetic resonance and electroencephalography. Nowadays a big challenge and a new research horizon for Systems Biology is to develop methods to integrate and model this data in an unifying framework capable to disentangle this amazing complexity. In this paper we show how methods from genomic data analysis can be applied to brain data. In particular the concept of pathways, networks and multiplex are discussed. These methods can lead to a clear distinction of various regimes of brain activity. Moreover, this method could be the basis for a Systems Biology analysis of brain data and for the integration of these data in a multivariate and multidimensional framework. The feasibility of this integration is strongly dependent from the feature extraction method used. In our case we used an "alphabet" derived from a multi-resolution analysis that is capable to capture the most relevant information from these complex signals.

Thalamic delta-Subunit Containing GABA(A) Receptors Promote Electrocortical Signatures of Deep Non-REM Sleep But Do Not Mediate the Effects of Etomidate at the Thalamus In Vivo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anesthesia; extrasynaptic GABAA receptors; sleep; thalamus	GENERAL ANESTHETIC ETOMIDATE; THALAMOCORTICAL RELAY NEURONS; BRAIN-MIND STATES; TONIC INHIBITION; A RECEPTOR; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; THIP GABOXADOL; KNOCKOUT MICE; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EEG CHANGES	Extrasynaptic delta-subunits containing GABA(A) receptors (delta GABA(A)Rs) are sensitive targets for several commonly used hypnotic agents and mediate tonic neuronal inhibition. delta GABA(A)Rs are highly expressed within the thalamus and their activation promotes a switch from tonic to burst firing in vitro. Here we test two hypotheses in vivo. (1) Activation of thalamic delta GABA(A)Rs will elicit electrocortical signatures consistent with widespread thalamocortical burst firing such as increased delta oscillations (1-4 Hz) and reciprocal changes in spindle-like oscillations (7-14 Hz). (2) These signatures will be recapitulated by the general anesthetic etomidate, if the electrocortical effects of etomidate at the thalamus are mediated by delta GABA(A)Rs. Microperfusion of the delta GABA(A)R-preferring agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP; 10 and 50 mu M) into the ventrobasal complex produced significant effects on electrocortical activity in wild-type mice, but not in mice lacking delta GABA(A)Rs (Gabrd(-/-)), i.e., the effects with THIP were dependent on delta GABA(A)Rs. THIP (1) increased 1-4 Hz power in wakefulness and nonrapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep; (2) reduced spindle-like oscillations in NREM sleep; and (3) increased the speed of stable transitions into NREM sleep, indicating effects on state-space dynamics. In contrast, microperfusion of etomidate (10 and 30 mu M) into the ventrobasal complex produced effects on electrocortical activity that were independent of delta GABA(A)Rs, i.e., effects occurred in wild-type and Gabrd(-/-) mice. Etomidate (1) decreased 1-4 Hz power, increased 8 -12 Hz, and/or 12-30 Hz power in all sleep-wake states; (2) increased spindle-like oscillations; and (3) increased REM sleep expression. These results indicate that thalamic delta GABA(A)Rs promote electrocortical signatures of deep NREM sleep, but do not mediate the effects of etomidate at the thalamus in vivo.

Methods: The subjects were 16 adult women with migraine and 16 normal controls. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained during PAS with standard (SS) and deviant stimuli (DS) were used. Alpha ERS fading, the phase locking index (PLI) and de-locking index (DLI) were evaluated from the 10 Hz complex Morlet wavelet components at 100 ms (t100) and 300 ms (t300) after PAS. Results: At t100, significant ERS was found with SS and DS in the migraineurs and controls (P = 0.000). At t300 in the controls, ERS faded to zero for DS while in the migraineurs there was no fading for DS. In both groups the PLI for SS and DS was significantly reduced, i.e. de-locked, at t300 compared to t100 (P = 0.000). In the migraineurs, the DLI for DS was significantly lower than in the controls (P = 0.003). Conclusion: The alpha ERS fading and phase de-locking are defective in migraineurs during passive auditory cognitive processing. Significance: The defects in timely alpha ERS fading and in de-locking may play a role in the different attention processing in migraine patients.

J	Ulrich, D				Ulrich, Daniel			Subthreshold delta-frequency resonance in thalamic reticular neurons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						action potential; EEG; GABA; I-h; oscillation	HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; NUCLEUS-RETICULARIS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NETWORK PROPERTIES; CALCIUM-CHANNEL; JUVENILE RATS; H-CURRENT; IN-VITRO; PACEMAKER	The thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) is an assembly of GABAergic projection neurons that participate in the generation of brain rhythms during synchronous sleep and absence epilepsy. NRt cells receive inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs, and are endowed with an intricate set of intrinsic conductances. However, little is known about how intrinsic and synaptic properties interact to generate rhythmic discharges in these neurons. In order to better understand this interaction, I studied the subthreshold responses of nRt cells to time-varying inputs. Patch-clamp recordings were performed in acute slices of rat thalamus (postnatal days 12-21). Sinusoidal current waveforms of linearly changing frequencies were injected into the soma, and the resulting voltage oscillations were recorded. At the resting membrane potential, the impedance profile showed a characteristic resonance at 1.7 Hz. The relative strength of the resonance was 1.2, and increased with membrane hyperpolarization. Small suprathreshold current injections led to preferred spike generation at the resonance frequency. Bath application of ZD7288 or Cs+, inhibitors of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-h), transformed the resonance into low-pass behaviour, whereas the T-channel blockers mibefradil and Ni2+ decreased the strength of the resonance. It is concluded that nRt cells have an I-h-mediated intrinsic frequency preference in the subthreshold voltage range that favours action potential generation in the delta-frequency band.

Involvement of Human Internal Globus Pallidus in the Early Modulation of Cortical Error-Related Activity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						basal ganglia; error monitoring; error-related negativity; Granger causality; response errors	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASAL GANGLIA; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS; MOVEMENT	The detection and assessment of errors are a prerequisite to adapt behavior and improve future performance. Error monitoring is afforded by the interplay between cortical and subcortical neural systems. Ample evidence has pointed to a specific cortical error-related evoked potential, the error-related negativity (ERN), during the detection and evaluation of response errors. Recent models of reinforcement learning implicate the basal ganglia (BG) in early error detection following the learning of stimulus-response associations and in the modulation of the cortical ERN. To investigate the influence of the human BG motor output activity on the cortical ERN during response errors, we recorded local field potentials from the sensorimotor area of the internal globus pallidus and scalp electroencephalogram representing activity from the posterior medial frontal cortex in patients with idiopathic dystonia (hands not affected) during a flanker task. In error trials, a specific pallidal error-related potential arose 60 ms prior to the cortical ERN. The error-related changes in pallidal activity-characterized by theta oscillations-were predictive of the cortical error-related activity as assessed by Granger causality analysis. Our findings show an early modulation of error-related activity in the human pallidum, suggesting that pallidal output influences the cortex at an early stage of error detection.

Recently using magnetoencephalography, we showed increased right auditory alpha activity when attention was cued ipsilaterally. Here, we investigated the issue how cue validity itself influences oscillatory alpha activity. Acoustic cues were presented either to the right or left ear, followed by a compound dichotically presented target plus distractor. The preceding cue was either informative (75% validity) or uninformative (50%) about the location of the upcoming target. Cue validity x side-related alpha modulations were identified in pre- and posttarget periods in a right lateralized network, comprising auditory and non-auditory regions. This replicates and extends our previous finding of the right hemispheric dominance of auditory attentional modulations. Importantly, effective connectivity analysis showed that, in the pre-target period, this effect is accompanied by a pronounced and time-varying connectivity pattern of the right auditory cortex to the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), with influence of IPS on superior temporal gyrus dominating at earlier intervals of the cue-target period. Our study underlines the assumption that alpha oscillations may play a similar functional role in auditory cortical regions as reported in other sensory modalities and suggests that these effects may be mediated via IPS.

J	Moretti, DV; Frisoni, GB; Binetti, G; Zanetti, O				Moretti, Davide V.; Frisoni, Giovanni B.; Binetti, Giuliano; Zanetti, Orazio			Comparison of the effects of transdermal and oral rivastigmine on cognitive function and EEG markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transdermal rivastigmine oral rivastigmine; Alzheimer's disease; dementia; cognitive function; EEG	FREELY MOVING RAT; CHOLINERGIC ENHANCEMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; VASCULAR DAMAGE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA RHYTHMS; EFFICACY; PATCH; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older patients. Rivastigmine (RV, Exelon, Novartis), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, improves clinical manifestations of AD and may enhance ACh-modulated electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency. This pilot study aimed to determine the effects of two formulations of RV [transdermal patch (RV-TDP) and oral capsules (TV-CP)] on alpha frequency, in particular the posterior dominant rhythm, and cognitive function [assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] in patients with AD. Methods: Subjects with AD were assigned to receive either RV-TDP 10 cm(2) or RV-CP 12 mg/day. All patients underwent EEG recordings at the beginning and end of the 18-month study period using P3, P4, O1, and O2 electrodes, each at high (10.5-13.0 Hz) and low (8.0-10.5 Hz) frequency. MMSE scores were determined at the start of the study (TO) and at three successive 6-month intervals (T1, T2, and T3). Results: RV-TDP administration (n = 10) maintained cognitive function as evidenced by stable MMSE scores from baseline to 18 months (21.07 +/- 2.4-21.2 +/- 3.1) compared with a decrease in MMSE score with RV-CP (n = 10) over 18 months [18.3 +/- 3.6-13.6 +/- 5.06 (adjusted for covariates p = 0.006)]. MMSE scores were significantly different between treatment groups from 6 months (p = 0.04). RV-TDP also increased the spectral power of alpha waves in the posterior region measured with electrode P3 in a significantly great percentage of patients than TV-CP from baseline to 18 months; 80% vs 30%, respectively [p = 0.025 (chi(2) test)]. Conclusions: RV-TDP was associated with a greater proportion of patients with increased posterior region alpha wave spectral power and significantly higher cognitive function at 18 months, compared with RV-CP treatment. Our findings suggest that RV-TDP provides an effective long-term management option in patients with AD compared with oral RV-CP. This study is a pilot, open-label study with a clear explorative purpose and with a small number of patients. Further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studies with a bigger sample size as well as healthy controls are needed to support these initial results.

Due to limited understanding of the artifacts appeared in the in vivo neural data, it is more challenging to identify artifacts from neural signal components compared with other applications. The objective of this work is to analyze artifact characteristics and to develop an algorithm for automatic artifact detection and removal without distorting the signals of interest. New method: The proposed algorithm for artifact detection and removal is based on the stationary wavelet transform with selected frequency bands of neural signals. The selection of frequency bands is based on the spectrum characteristics of in vivo neural data. Further, to make the proposed algorithm robust under different recording conditions, a modified universal-threshold value is proposed. Results: Extensive simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both amount of artifact removal and amount of distortion to neural signals. The quantitative results reveal that the algorithm is quite robust for different artifact types and artifact-to-signal ratio. Comparison with existing methods: Both real and synthesized data have been used for testing the proposed algorithm in comparison with other artifact removal algorithms (e.g. ICA, wICA, wCCA, EMD-ICA, and EMD-CCA) found in the literature. Comparative testing results suggest that the proposed algorithm performs better than the available algorithms. Conclusion: Our work is expected to be useful for future research on in vivo neural signal processing and eventually to develop a real-time neural interface for advanced neuroscience and behavioral experiments.

Their occurrence thus constrains many aspects of the communication between thalamus and cortex, ranging from sensory transmission, to cortical plasticity and learning, to development and disease. I review these functional aspects in conjunction with novel findings on the cellular and molecular makeup of spindle-pacemaking circuits. A highlight in the search of roles for sleep spindles is the repeated finding that spindles correlate with memory consolidation in humans and animals. By illustrating that spindles are at the forefront understanding on how the brain might benefit from sleep rhythms, I hope to stimulate further experimentation.

One of the most popular application of such a method is noise elimination. EMD based denoising methods require a robust threshold to determine which IMFs are noise related components. In this study, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is suggested to obtain such a threshold. The scaling exponential obtained by the root mean squared fluctuation is capable of distinguishing uncorrelated white Gaussian noise and anti-correlated signals. Therefore, in our method the slope of the scaling exponent is used as the threshold for EMD based denoising. IMFs with lower slope than the threshold are assumed to be noisy oscillations and excluded in the reconstruction step. The proposed method is tested on various signal to noise ratios (SNR) to show its denoising performance and reliability compared to several other methods.

Treating Working Memory Deficits in Schizophrenia: A Review of the Neurobiology	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Cognition; EEG; neurophysiology; schizophrenia; TMS; working memory	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; GAMMA OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DOUBLE-BLIND; MOTOR CORTEX; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS	Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. Among these deficits, working memory impairment is considered a central cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The prefrontal cortex, a region critical for working memory performance, has been demonstrated as a critical liability region in schizophrenia. As yet, there are no standardized treatment options for working memory deficits in schizophrenia. In this review, we summarize the neuronal basis for working memory impairment in schizophrenia, including dysfunction in prefrontal signaling pathways (e.g.,gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission) and neural network synchrony (e.g., gamma/theta oscillations). We discuss therapeutic strategies for working memory dysfunction such as pharmacological agents, cognitive remediation therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Despite the drawbacks of current approaches, the advances in neurobiological and translational treatment strategies suggest that clinical application of these methods will occur in the near future.

To achieve this, thirty-seconds of resting EEG were spectrally transformed in sLORETA. Three-dimensional statistical non-paramentric maps (SnPM) for the sLORETA Global Field Power within each band were then computed. Our results illustrated that the Right Superior Frontal Gyrus (t=2.049, p=0.007), along the dopamine mesolimbic pathway, had higher neuronal oscillations in the delta frequency band in the 100 Schizophrenia patients as compared to the 32depressive female patients. The comparisons with both the 48 depressive patient cohort or the sixteen male depressive patient cohort did not yield any statistically significant findings. We conclude that the Superior Frontal Gyrus should be investigated as a possible surrogate biomarker for preclinical and clinical drug discovery in neuropharmacology.

Incorporating a passive BCI that detects when the user is performing poorly at a primary task, and adapts accordingly may prove to increase overall user performance. Here, we explore the potential for extending an established method to generate continuous estimates of behavioral performance from ongoing neural activity; evaluating the extended method by applying it to the original task domain, simulated driving; and generalizing the method by applying it to a BCI-relevant perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we used EEG log power spectra and sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) to estimate endogenous changes in behavior in both a simulated driving task and a perceptual discrimination task. For the driving task the average correlation coefficient between the actual and estimated lane deviation was 0.37 +/- 0.22 (mu +/- s). For the perceptual discrimination task we generated estimates of accuracy, reaction time, and button press duration for each participant. The correlation coefficients between the actual and estimated behavior were similar for these three metrics (accuracy = 0.25 +/- 0.37, reaction time = 0.33 +/- 0.23, button press duration = 0.36 +/- 0.30). These findings illustrate the potential for modeling time-on-task decrements in performance from concurrent measures of neural activity.

This definition has been used since the era of Hughlings Jackson, and does not take into account subsequent advances made in epilepsy and neuroscience research. The clinical diagnosis of a seizure is empirical, based upon constellations of certain signs and symptoms, while simultaneously ruling out a list of potential imitators of seizures. Seizures should be delimited in time, but the borders of ictal (during a seizure), interictal (between seizures) and postictal (after a seizure) often are indistinct. EEG recording is potentially very helpful for confirmation, classification and localization. About a half-dozen common EEG patterns are encountered during seizures. Clinicians rely on researchers to answer such questions as why seizures start, spread and stop, whether seizures involve increased synchrony, the extent to which extra-cortical structures are involved, and how to identify the seizure network and at what points interventions are likely to be helpful. Basic scientists have different challenges in use of the word 'seizure,' such as distinguishing seizures from normal behavior, which would seem easy but can be very difficult because some rodents have EEG activity during normal behavior that resembles spike-wave discharge or bursts of rhythmic spiking. It is also important to define when a seizure begins and stops so that seizures can be quantified accurately for pre-clinical studies. When asking what causes seizures, the transition to a seizure and differentiating the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal state is also important because what occurs before a seizure could be causal and may warrant further investigation for that reason. These and other issues are discussed by three epilepsy researchers with clinical and basic science expertise.

Consequently, the acoustic environment requires flexible choosing and switching amongst available cues. The present study targets the brain functions underlying such changes in cue utilization. Participants performed a categorization task with immediate feedback on acoustic stimuli from two categories that varied in duration and spectral properties, while we simultaneously recorded Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) responses in fMRI and electroencephalograms (EEGs). In the first half of the experiment, categories could be best discriminated by spectral properties. Halfway through the experiment, spectral degradation rendered the stimulus duration the more informative cue. Behaviorally, degradation decreased the likelihood of utilizing spectral cues. Spectrally degrading the acoustic signal led to increased alpha power compared to nondegraded stimuli. The EEG-informed fMRI analyses revealed that alpha power correlated with BOLD changes in inferior parietal cortex and right posterior superior temporal gyrus (including planum temporale). In both areas, spectral degradation led to a weaker coupling of BOLD response to behavioral utilization of the spectral cue. These data provide converging evidence from behavioral modeling, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics that (a) increased alpha power mediates the inhibition of uninformative (here spectral) stimulus features, and that (b) the parietal attention network supports optimal cue utilization in auditory categorization. The results highlight the complex cortical processing of auditory categorization under realistic listening challenges.

Here we used power of LFP recorded from area MT of a macaque monkey to decode where the animal covertly attended. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to learn the pattern of power at different frequencies for attention to two possible positions. We found that LFP power at both low (<9 Hz) and high (31-120 Hz) frequencies contains sufficient information to decode the focus of attention. Highest decoding performance was found for gamma frequencies (31-120 Hz) and reached 82%. In contrast low frequencies (<9 Hz) could help the classifier reach a higher decoding performance with a smaller amount of training data. Consequently, we suggest that low frequency LFP can provide fast but coarse information regarding the focus of attention, while higher frequencies of the LFP deliver more accurate but less timely information about the focus of attention.

However, the limited spatial resolution of low-density scalp recordings is a roadblock to the unequivocal monitoring and targeting of neuroanatomical regions and physiological signaling. This latter aspect is pivotal to the actual efficiency of neurofeedback procedures, which are expected to engage the modulation of well-identified components of neural activity within and between predetermined brain regions. Our group has previously contributed to demonstrate the principles of real-time magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging. Here we show how the technique was further developed to provide healthy subjects with region-specific neurofeedback to modulate successfully predetermined components of their brain activity in targeted brain regions. Overall, our results positively indicate that neurofeedback based on time-resolved MEG imaging has the potential to become an innovative therapeutic approach in neurology and neuropsychiatry.

Interregional alpha-band synchrony supports temporal cross-modal integration	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cross-modal integration; Time perception; Alpha-band; Functional connectivity; Phase synchrony	PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; EEG DYNAMICS; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; FREQUENCY	In a continuously changing environment, time is a key property that tells us whether information from the different senses belongs together. Yet, little is known about how the brain integrates temporal information across sensory modalities. Using high-density EEG combined with a novel psychometric timing task in which human subjects evaluated durations of audiovisual stimuli, we show that the strength of alpha-band (8-12 Hz) phase synchrony between localizer-defined auditory and visual regions depended on cross-modal attention: during encoding of a constant 500 ms standard interval, audiovisual alpha synchrony decreased when subjects attended audition while ignoring vision, compared to when they attended both modalities. In addition, alpha connectivity during a variable target interval predicted the degree to which auditory stimulus duration biased time estimation while attending vision. This cross-modal interference effect was estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian model of a psychometric function that also provided an estimate of each individual's tendency to exhibit attention lapses. This lapse rate, in turn, was predicted by single-trial estimates of the stability of interregional alpha synchrony: when attending to both modalities, trials with greater stability in patterns of connectivity were characterized by reduced contamination by lapses. Together, these results provide new insights into a functional role of the coupling of alpha phase dynamics between sensory cortices in integrating cross-modal information over time.

By successively adding more physiological details to a basic corticothalamic model, it is determined which features are responsible for which effects. In particular, with the addition of a thalamic population, several changes occur in the spatiotemporal power spectrum: power increases at resonances of the corticothalamic loop, while the loop acts as a spatiotemporal low-pass filter, and synaptic and dendritic dynamics temporally low-pass filter the activity more generally. Investigation of the effect of altering parameters and gains reveals new parameter regimes where activity that corresponds to hallucinations is induced by both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous temporally oscillating modes. This suggests that the thalamus and corticothalamic loops are essential components of a model of oscillating visual hallucinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automatic Bias of Temporal Expectations following Temporally Regular Input Independently of High-level Temporal Expectation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; UNINTENTIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS; NONSPECIFIC PREPARATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INTERVAL; TIME; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; DURATION	Exposure to rhythmic stimulation results in facilitated responses to events that appear in-phase with the rhythm and modulation of anticipatory and target-evoked brain activity, presumably reflecting "exogenous," unintentional temporal expectations. However, the extent to which this effect is independent from intentional processes is not clear. In two EEG experiments, we isolated the unintentional component of this effect from high-level, intentional factors. Visual targets were presented either in-phase or out-of-phase with regularly flickering colored stimuli. In different blocks, the rhythm could be predictive (i.e., high probability for in-phase target) or not, and the color could be predictive (i.e., validly cue the interval to the target) or not. Exposure to nonpredictive rhythms resulted in faster responses for in-phase targets, even when the color predicted specific out-of-phase target times. Also, the contingent negative variation, an EEG component reflecting temporal anticipation, followed the interval of the nonpredictive rhythm and not that of the predictive color. Thus, rhythmic stimulation unintentionally induced expectations, even when this was detrimental. Intentional usage of predictive rhythms to form expectations resulted in a stronger behavioral effect, and only predictive cues modulated the latency of the target-evoked P3, presumably reflecting stimulus evaluation. These findings establish the existence of unintentional temporal expectations in rhythmic contexts, dissociate them from intentional expectations, and highlight the need to distinguish between the source of expectation (exogenous-endogenous) and the level of voluntary control involved in it (unintentional-intentional).

Dynamic peripheral visual performance relates to alpha activity in soccer players	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic peripheral vision; relationship; alpha activity; soccer player; individual alpha band	EEG ALPHA; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; POWER; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; EXCITABILITY; PERCEPTION; AWARENESS	Many studies have demonstrated the relationship between the alpha activity and the central visual ability, in which the visual ability is usually assessed through static stimuli. Besides static circumstance, however in the real environment there are often dynamic changes and the peripheral visual ability in a dynamic environment (i.e., dynamic peripheral visual ability) is important for all people. So far, no work has reported whether there is a relationship between the dynamic peripheral visual ability and the alpha activity. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate their relationship. Sixty-two soccer players performed a newly designed peripheral vision task in which the visual stimuli were dynamic, while their EEG signals were recorded from Cz, O1, and O2 locations. The relationship between the dynamic peripheral visual performance and the alpha activity was examined by the percentage-bend correlation test. The results indicated no significant correlation between the dynamic peripheral visual performance and the alpha amplitudes in the eyes-open and eyes-closed resting condition. However, it was not the case for the alpha activity during the peripheral vision task: the dynamic peripheral visual performance showed significant positive inter-individual correlations with the amplitudes in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and the individual alpha band (IAB) during the peripheral vision task. A potential application of this finding is to improve the dynamic peripheral visual performance by up-regulating alpha activity using neuromodulation techniques.

Methods: We included 18 patients. Peri-ictal periods (-15 to +5 s from the ictal onset) were divided into 4 periods of 5 s duration each in bandwidth from 1 to 700 Hz divided into 11 bins. Thereafter, we calculated the mean overlapping percentage of the maximum amplitude activity electrodes with the seizure onset zone in the total number of seizures in each patient. Significance was considered at an adjusted p-value of 0.05. Results: By the maximum amplitude method with the Bonferroni correction, only high-frequency activities (>60 Hz) during -5 to 0 s from the ictal onset were significantly related to seizure onset zones. In post hoc analyses, bands in 60-139 Hz and 4-7 Hz were significantly related to seizure onset zones in the Bonferroni correction. However, after the less conservative Benjamini-Yekutieli correction and with the epileptogenicity index, other bands and periods after -10 s from the ictal onset were also related with seizure onset zones. Significance: Detailed bands, timings and analytic methods of peri-ictal activities with high relationships to seizure onset zones were identified.

In contrast, the evidence that PMC contributes to the sequencing of non-biological events cannot be explained by the simulationist theory. Here we investigated how motor simulation and event sequencing coexist within the PMC and how these mechanisms interact when both functions are executed. We asked patients with depth electrodes implanted in the PMC to passively observe a randomized arrangement of images depicting biological actions and physical events and, in a second block, to sequence them in the correct order. This task allowed us to disambiguate between the simple observation of actions, their sequencing (recruiting different motor simulation processes), as well as the sequencing of non-biological events (recruiting a sequencer mechanism non dependant on motor simulation). We analysed the response of the gamma, alpha and beta frequency bands to evaluate the contribution of each brain rhythm to the observation and sequencing of both biological and non-biological stimuli. We found that motor simulation (biological>physical) and event sequencing (sequencing>observation) differently affect the three investigated frequency bands: motor simulation was reflected on the gamma and, partially, in the beta, but not in the alpha band. In contrast, event sequencing was also reflected on the alpha band.

Audience preferences are predicted by temporal reliability of neural processing	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUBJECTIVE VALUE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; FMRI; EEG; CORTEX	Naturalistic stimuli evoke highly reliable brain activity across viewers. Here we record neural activity from a group of naive individuals while viewing popular, previously-broadcast television content for which the broad audience response is characterized by social media activity and audience ratings. We find that the level of inter-subject correlation in the evoked encephalographic responses predicts the expressions of interest and preference among thousands. Surprisingly, ratings of the larger audience are predicted with greater accuracy than those of the individuals from whom the neural data is obtained. An additional functional magnetic resonance imaging study employing a separate sample of subjects shows that the level of neural reliability evoked by these stimuli covaries with the amount of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation in higher-order visual and auditory regions. Our findings suggest that stimuli which we judge favourably may be those to which our brains respond in a stereotypical manner shared by our peers.

Power line interference may severely corrupt neural recordings at 50/60 Hz and harmonic frequencies. The interference is usually non-stationary and can vary in frequency, amplitude and phase. To retrieve the gamma-band oscillations at the contaminated frequencies, it is desired to remove the interference without compromising the actual neural signals at the interference frequency bands. In this paper, we present a robust and computationally efficient algorithm for removing power line interference from neural recordings. Approach. The algorithm includes four steps. First, an adaptive notch filter is used to estimate the fundamental frequency of the interference. Subsequently, based on the estimated frequency, harmonics are generated by using discrete-time oscillators, and then the amplitude and phase of each harmonic are estimated by using a modified recursive least squares algorithm. Finally, the estimated interference is subtracted from the recorded data. Main results. The algorithm does not require any reference signal, and can track the frequency, phase and amplitude of each harmonic. When benchmarked with other popular approaches, our algorithm performs better in terms of noise immunity, convergence speed and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While minimally affecting the signal bands of interest, the algorithm consistently yields fast convergence (<100 ms) and substantial interference rejection (output SNR >30 dB) in different conditions of interference strengths (input SNR from 30 to 30 dB), power line frequencies (45-65 Hz) and phase and amplitude drifts. In addition, the algorithm features a straightforward parameter adjustment since the parameters are independent of the input SNR, input signal power and the sampling rate. A hardware prototype was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and tested. Software implementation of the algorithm has been made available for open access at https://github.com/mrezak/removePLI. Significance. The proposed algorithm features a highly robust operation, fast adaptation to interference variations, significant SNR improvement, low computational complexity and memory requirement and straightforward parameter adjustment. These features render the algorithm suitable for wearable and implantable sensor applications, where reliable and real-time cancellation of the interference is desired.

Words were presented during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Priming was assessed using a semantic and a perceptual priming test. These tests measured differences in the processing of words that had been or had not been played during sleep. Synonyms to sleep-played words were the targets in the semantic priming test that tapped the meaning of sleep-played words. All men responded to sleep-played words by producing up-states in their electroencephalogram. Up-states are NREM sleep-specific phases of briefly increased neuronal excitability. The word-evoked up-states might have promoted word processing during sleep. Yet, the mean performance in the priming tests administered following sleep was at chance level, which suggests that participants as a group failed to show priming following sleep. However, performance in the two priming tests was positively correlated to each other and to the magnitude of the word-evoked up-states. Hence, the larger a participant's word-evoked up-states, the larger his perceptual and semantic priming. Those participants who scored high on all variables must have encoded words during sleep. We conclude that some humans are able to encode words during sleep, but more research is needed to pin down the factors that modulate this ability.

How this information maintenance actually is implemented is still a matter of debate. Several independent theories of WM, derived, respectively, from behavioral studies and neural considerations, advance the idea that items in WM decay over time and must be periodically reactivated. In this proposal, we show how recent data from intracranial EEG and attention research naturally leads to a simple model of such reactivation in the case of sensory memories. Specifically, in our model the amplitude of high-frequency activity (>50 Hz, in the gamma-band) underlies the representation of items in high-level visual areas. This activity decreases to noise-levels within 500 ms, unless it is reactivated. We propose that top down attention, which targets multiple sensory items in a cyclical or rhythmic fashion at around 6-10 Hz, reactivates these decaying gamma-band representations. Therefore, working memory capacity is essentially the number of representations that can simultaneously be kept active by a rhythmically sampling attentional spotlight given the known decay rate. Since attention samples at 6-10 Hz, the predicted WM capacity is 3-5 items, in agreement with empirical findings.

These theories of awareness draw heavily on data from masking paradigms in which visibility of one stimulus is reduced due to the presence of another stimulus. More recently transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to study the temporal dynamics of visual awareness. TMS over occipital cortex affects performance on visual tasks at distinct time points and in a manner that is comparable to visual masking. We draw parallels between these two methods and examine evidence for the neural mechanisms by which visual masking and TMS suppress stimulus visibility. Specifically, both methods have been proposed to affect feedforward as well as feedback signals when applied at distinct time windows relative to stimulus onset and as a result modify visual awareness. Most recent empirical evidence, moreover, suggests that while visual masking and TMS impact stimulus visibility comparably, the processes these methods affect may not be as similar as previously thought. In addition to reviewing both masking and TMS studies that examine feedforward and feedback processes in vision, we raise questions to guide future studies and further probe the necessary conditions for visual awareness.

Coupling between gamma-band power and cerebral blood volume during recurrent acute neocortical seizures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurovascular coupling; Gamma; 4-AP; Focal epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; BOLD FMRI; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; EEG; BRAIN; MODEL; EPILEPTOGENESIS; PERFUSION	Characterization of neural and hemodynamic biomarkers of epileptic activity that can be measured using non-invasive techniques is fundamental to the accurate identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in the clinical setting. Recently, oscillations at gamma-band frequencies and above (>30 Hz) have been suggested to provide valuable localizing information of the EZ and track cortical activation associated with epileptogenic processes. Although a tight coupling between gamma-band activity and hemodynamic-based signals has been consistently demonstrated in non-pathological conditions, very little is known about whether such a relationship is maintained in epilepsy and the laminar etiology of these signals. Confirmation of this relationship may elucidate the underpinnings of perfusion-based signals in epilepsy and the potential value of localizing the EZ using hemodynamic correlates of pathological rhythms. Here, we use concurrent multi-depth electrophysiology and 2-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy to examine the coupling between multi-band neural activity and cerebral blood volume (CBV) during recurrent acute focal neocortical seizures in the urethane-anesthetized rat. We show a powerful correlation between gamma-band power (25-90 Hz) and CBV across cortical laminae, in particular layers, and a close association between gamma measures and multi-unit activity (MUA). Our findings provide insights into the laminar electrophysiological basis of perfusion-based imaging signals in the epileptic state and may have implications for further research using non-invasive multi-modal techniques to localize epileptogenic tissue.

Here we study the electrophysiological signatures of this intricate balance between temporal segregation and integration in vision. Within a forward masking paradigm with short and long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA), we manipulated the temporal overlap of the visual persistence of two successive transients. Human observers enumerated the items presented in the second target display as a measure of the informational capacity read-out from this partly temporally integrated visual percept. We observed higher beta-power immediately before mask display onset in incorrect trials, in which enumeration failed due to stronger integration of mask and target visual information. This effect was timescale specific, distinguishing between segregation and integration of visual transients that were distant in time (long SOA). Conversely, for short SOA trials, mask onset evoked a stronger visual response when mask and targets were correctly segregated in time. Examination of the target-related response profile revealed the importance of an evoked alpha-phase reset for the segregation of those rapid visual transients. Investigating this precise mapping of the temporal relationships of visual signals onto electrophysiological responses highlights how the stream of visual information is carved up into discrete temporal windows that mediate between segregated and integrated percepts. Fragmenting the stream of visual information provides a means to stabilize perceptual events within one instant in time.

This learning process relies on the probabilities with which events occur, and is a dynamic phenomenon. The aim of present study was to investigate the development of anticipatory processes during implicit learning. A decision making task was employed in which the frequency of trial types was manipulated such that one trial type was disproportionately prevalent as compared to the remaining three trial types. A 275 channel whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system was used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). The results revealed that oscillations within the alpha (10-12 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) frequencies were associated with anticipatory processes in distinct networks in the course of learning. During early phases of learning the contralateral motor cortex, the anterior cingulate, the caudate and the inferior frontal gyrus showed ERDs within beta and alpha frequencies, putatively reflecting preparation of next motor response. As the task progressed, alpha ERSs in occipitotemporal regions and putamen likely reflect perceptual anticipation of the forthcoming stimuli. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because chemical neuromodulation can cause changes in neuronal processing on the millisecond time-scale, the combination of MEG with pharmacological interventions (pharmaco-MEG) is a powerful tool for measuring the effects of experimental modulations of neurotransmission in the living human brain. Importantly, pharmaco-MEG can be used in both healthy humans to understand normal brain function and in patients to understand brain pathologies and drug-treatment effects. In this paper, the physiological and technical basis of pharmaco-MEG is introduced and contrasted with other pharmacological neuroimaging techniques. Ongoing developments in MEG analysis techniques such as source-localisation, functional and effective connectivity analyses, which have allowed for more powerful inferences to be made with recent pharmaco-MEG data, are described. Studies which have utilised pharmaco-MEG across a range of neurotransmitter systems (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin) are reviewed.

The main goals of genetic psychophysiology are to elucidate the neural pathways and mechanisms mediating genetic influences on cognition and emotion, identify intermediate brain-based phenotypes for psychopathology, and provide a functional characterization of genes being discovered by large association studies of behavioral phenotypes. Since the initiation of this neurogenetic approach to human individual differences in the 1970s, numerous twin and family studies have provided strong evidence for heritability of diverse aspects of brain function including resting-state brain oscillations, functional connectivity, and event-related neural activity in a variety of cognitive and emotion processing tasks, as well as peripheral psychophysiological responses. These data indicate large differences in the presence and strength of genetic influences across measures and domains, permitting the selection of heritable characteristics for gene finding studies. More recently, candidate gene association studies began to implicate specific gerietic variants in different aspects of neurocognition. However, great caution is needed in pursuing this line of research due to its demonstrated proneness to generate false-positive findings. Recent developments in methods for physiological signal analysis, hemodynamic imaging, and genomic technologies offer new exciting opportunities for the investigation of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of individual differences in behavior, both normal and abnormal.

Converging evidence suggests that not only the descending corticospinal pathway but the ascending sensory feedback pathway is involved in the generation of beta-band corticomuscular coherence. The present study aimed to investigate which pathway, descending vs. ascending, contributes more to the stability of muscle contraction, especially for human intrinsic hand muscles. Methods: In this study, we assessed directed transfer function (DTF) between magnetoencephalography signals over the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and rectified electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded during steady-state isometric contraction of the right thumb muscle (flexor pollicis brevis, FPB) or right little finger muscle (flexor digiti minimi brevis, FDMB) in 15 right-handed healthy subjects. Results: beta-Band DTF was statistically significant in both descending (SMC -> EMG) and ascending (EMG -> SMC) directions, and mean phase delays for each direction were in agreement with the conduction time for the descending corticospinal and ascending sensory feedback pathways. The strengths of the beta-band DTF (EMG -> SMC direction) were greater in the FPB muscle than in the FDMB muscle, while the strengths of the beta-band DTF (SMC -> EMG direction) were not different between the two muscles. Moreover, the beta-band DTF (EMG -> SMC direction) was greater in the "Stable'' period than in the "Less Stable'' period within the FDMB muscle. Greater DTF (EMG -> SMC direction) was positively associated with the stability of muscle contraction. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ascending beta-band oscillatory activity may promote a steady-state isometric contraction by efficiently transmitting sensory feedback from finger muscles to the sensorimotor cortex. Significance: The results show the differential contribution of the ascending part of the corticomuscular network depending on the functional organization.

AGE-RELATED CHANGES OF FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA IS PREDICTIVE OF EFFICIENT MEMORY MAINTENANCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; working memory; frontal-midline theta; sustained attention	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; AGING MIND; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; POWER; TASK	Frontal areas are thought to be the coordinators of working memory processes by controlling other brain areas reflected by oscillatory activities like frontal-midline theta (4-7 Hz). With aging substantial changes can be observed in the frontal brain areas, presumably leading to age-associated changes in cortical correlates of cognitive functioning. The present study aimed to test whether altered frontal-midline theta dynamics during working memory maintenance may underlie the capacity deficits observed in older adults. 33-channel EEG was recorded in young (18-26 years, N = 20) and old (60-71 years, N = 16) adults during the retention period of a visual delayed match-to-sample task, in which they had to maintain arrays of 3 or 5 colored squares. An additional visual odd-ball task was used to be able to measure the electrophysiological indices of sustained attentional processes. Old participants showed reduced frontal theta activity during both tasks compared to the young group. In the young memory maintenance-related frontal-midline theta activity was shown to be sensitive both to the increased memory demands and to efficient subsequent memory performance, whereas the old adults showed no such task-related difference in the frontal theta activity. The decrease of frontal-midline theta activity in the old group indicates that cerebral aging may alter the cortical circuitries of theta dynamics, thereby leading to age-associated decline of working memory maintenance function.

Prefrontal Oscillations during Recall of Conditioned and Extinguished Fear in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						conditioning; extinction; fear; theta	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; THETA-RHYTHM; EXTINCTION; BRAIN; MEMORY; AMYGDALA; HIPPOCAMPAL; RESPONSES; NEURONS	Human neuroimaging studies indicate that the anterior midcingulate cortex (AMC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) play important roles in the expression and extinction of fear, respectively. Electrophysiological rodent studies further indicate that oscillatory neuronal activity in homolog regions (i.e., prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) changes during fear expression and fear extinction recall. Whether similar processes occur in humans remains largely unexplored. By assessing scalp surface EEG in conjunction with LORETA source estimation of CS-related theta and gamma activity, we tested whether a priori defined ROIs in the human AMC and vmPFC similarly modulate their oscillatory activity during fear expression and extinction recall, respectively. To this end, 42 healthy individuals underwent a differential conditioning/differential extinction protocol with a Recall Test on the next day. In the Recall Test, nonextinguished versus extinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential (CS+ vs CS-) response with regard to skin conductance and AMC-localized theta power. Conversely, extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential response with regard to vmPFC-localized gamma power. Finally, individuals who failed to show a suppressed skin conductance response to the extinguished versus nonextinguished CS+ also failed to show the otherwise observed alterations in vmPFC gamma power to extinguished CS+. These results indicate that fear expression is associated with AMC theta activity, whereas successful fear extinction recall relates to changes in vmPFC gamma activity. The present work thereby bridges findings from prior rodent electrophysiological research and human neuroimaging studies and indicates that EEG is a valuable tool for future fear extinction research.

This could occur, for example, in an emergency situation in which one hears conflicting instructions and the loudest, instead of the wisest, voice prevails. Here, we used cortically-constrained oscillatory MEG/EEG estimates to examine how different brain regions, including caudal anterior cingulate (cACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), work together to resolve these kinds of auditory conflicts. During an auditory flanker interference task, subjects were presented with sound patterns consisting of three different voices, from three different directions (45 degrees left, straight ahead, 45 degrees right), sounding out either the letters "A'' or "O''. They were asked to discriminate which sound was presented centrally and ignore the flanking distracters that were phonetically either congruent (50%) or incongruent (50%) with the target. Our cortical MEG/EEG oscillatory estimates demonstrated a direct relationship between performance and brain activity, showing that efficient conflict resolution, as measured with reduced conflict-induced RT lags, is predicted by theta/alpha phase coupling between cACC and right lateral frontal cortex regions intersecting the right frontal eye fields (FEF) and DLPFC, as well as by increased pre-stimulus gamma (60-110 Hz) power in the left inferior fontal cortex. Notably, cACC connectivity patterns that correlated with behavioral conflict-resolution measures were found during both the pre-stimulus and the pre-response periods. Our data provide evidence that, instead of being only transiently activated upon conflict detection, cACC is involved in sustained engagement of attentional resources required for effective sound object selection performance.

To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 expert, 15 amateur and 15 young elite right-handed table tennis players. All subjects watched videos of a serve and imagined themselves responding with a specific table tennis stroke. With reference to a baseline period, power decrease/increase of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) during the pretask- and task period indexed the cortical activation/deactivation (event-related desynchronization/synchronization, ERD/ERS). Regarding hypothesis (1), 8-10 Hz SMR ERD was stronger in elite athletes than in amateurs with an intermediate ERD in young elite athletes in the motor cortex. Regarding hypothesis (2), there was no correlation between ERD/ERS in the motor cortex and world rank points in elite experts, but a weaker ERD in the fronto-parietal cortex was associated with higher world rank points. These results suggest that motor skill in table tennis is associated with focused excitability of the motor cortex during reaction, movement planning and execution with high attentional demands. Among elite experts, less activation of the fronto-parietal attention network may be necessary to become a world champion.

While some studies have emphasized the spatial differentiation of processing into discrete areas, others have emphasized the overlap of processing and the importance of distributed patterns of activity. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from subdural electrodes provides excellent temporal and spatial resolution of local neural activity, and thus provides an alternative method to fMRI for studying differences and commonalities in face and body processing. In this study we recorded iEEG from 12 patients while they viewed images of novel faces, isolated eyes, headless bodies, and flowers. Event-related potential analysis identified 69 occipitotemporal sites at which there was a face-, eye-, or body-selective response when contrasted to flowers. However, when comparing faces, eyes, and bodies to each other at these sites, we identified only 3 face-specific, 13 eye-specific, and 1 body-specific electrodes. Thus, at the majority of sites, faces, eyes, and bodies evoked similar responses. However, we identified ten locations at which the amplitude of the responses spatially varied across adjacent electrodes, indicating that the configuration of current sources and sinks were different for faces, eyes, and bodies. Our results also demonstrate that eye-sensitive regions are more abundant and more purely selective than face- or body-sensitive regions, particularly in lateral occipitotemporal cortex.

Network dynamics of the brain and influence of the epileptic seizure onset zone	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						focal epilepsy; seizure; localization; network analysis; eigenvector centrality; ECoG signals	EEG; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONY	The human brain is a dynamic networked system. Patients with partial epileptic seizures have focal regions that periodically diverge from normal brain network dynamics during seizures. We studied the evolution of brain connectivity before, during, and after seizures with graph-theoretic techniques on continuous electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings (5.4 +/- 1.7 d per patient, mean +/- SD) from 12 patients with temporal, occipital, or frontal lobe partial onset seizures. Each electrode was considered a node in a graph, and edges between pairs of nodes were weighted by their coherence within a frequency band. The leading eigenvector of the connectivity matrix, which captures network structure, was tracked over time and clustered to uncover a finite set of brain network states. Across patients, we found that (i) the network connectivity is structured and defines a finite set of brain states, (ii) seizures are characterized by a consistent sequence of states, (iii) a subset of nodes is isolated from the network at seizure onset and becomes more connected with the network toward seizure termination, and (iv) the isolated nodes may identify the seizure onset zone with high specificity and sensitivity. To localize a seizure, clinicians visually inspect seizures recorded from multiple intracranial electrode contacts, a time-consuming process that may not always result in definitive localization. We show that network metrics computed from all ECoG channels capture the dynamics of the seizure onset zone as it diverges from normal overall network structure. This suggests that a state space model can be used to help localize the seizure onset zone in ECoG recordings.

Understanding program comprehension is essential to understanding the inherent complexity of programming languages, and ultimately, having a measure of mental effort based on direct observation of the brain at work will illuminate the nature of the work of programming. We provide evidence of direct observation of the cognitive effort associated with programming tasks, through a carefully constructed empirical study using a cross-section of undergraduate computer science students and an inexpensive, off-the-shelf brain-computer interface device. This study presents a link between expertise and programming language comprehension, draws conclusions about the observed indicators of cognitive effort using recent cognitive theories, and proposes directions for future work that is now possible.

Moreover, little is known about the temporal dynamics of sensory information contained in LFPs following stimulus onset. Here we investigated the time course of the amount of stimulus information in LFPs and spikes from the gustatory cortex of awake rats subjected to tastants and water delivery on the tongue. We found that the phase and amplitude of multiple LFP frequencies carry information about stimuli, which have specific time courses after stimulus delivery. The information carried by LFP phase and amplitude was independent within frequency bands, since the joint information exhibited neither synergy nor redundancy. Tastant information in LFPs was also independent and had a different time course from the information carried by spikes. These findings support the hypothesis that the brain uses different frequency channels to dynamically code for multiple features of a stimulus.

Increasingly, these oscillations are of biological and clinical interest because of their role in development, learning and neurological disorders. We used an Internet interface to crowdsource spindle identification by human experts and non-experts, and we compared their performance with that of automated detection algorithms in data from middle- to older-aged subjects from the general population. We also refined methods for forming group consensus and evaluating the performance of event detectors in physiological data such as electroencephalographic recordings from polysomnography. Compared to the expert group consensus gold standard, the highest performance was by individual experts and the non- expert group consensus, followed by automated spindle detectors. This analysis showed that crowdsourcing the scoring of sleep data is an efficient method to collect large data sets, even for difficult tasks such as spindle identification.

Power Shifts Track Serial Position and Modulate Encoding in Human Episodic Memory	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; electrocorticography; gamma; memory; primacy	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FREE-RECALL; FREQUENCY; HIPPOCAMPAL; ATTENTION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA; DISTINCTIVENESS; COHERENCE	The first events in a series exert a powerful influence on cognition and behavior in both humans and animals. This is known as the law of primacy. Here, we analyze the neural correlates of primacy in humans by analyzing electrocorticographic recordings in 84 neurosurgical patients as they studied and subsequently recalled lists of common words. We found that spectral power in the gamma frequency band (28100 Hz) was elevated at the start of the list and gradually subsided, whereas lower frequency (28 Hz) delta and theta band power exhibited the opposite trend. This gradual shift in the power spectrum was found across a widespread network of brain regions. The degree to which the subsequent memory effect was modulated by list (serial) position was most pronounced in medial temporal lobe structures. These results suggest that globally increased gamma and decreased deltatheta spectral powers reflect a brain state that predisposes medial temporal lobe structures to enhance the encoding and maintenance of early list items.

Here we extended this work by recording both ERP and oscillatory EEG activity (event-related spectral perturbations, ERSPs) to line-drawn faces depicting eye and mouth movements (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) and non-face motion controls. Neural activity was measured in 2 occipito-temporal clusters of 9 electrodes, one in each hemisphere. Mouth opening generated larger N170s than mouth closing, replicating earlier work. Eye motion elicited robust N170s that did not differ between gaze conditions. Control condition differences were seen, and generated the largest N170. ERSP difference plots across conditions in the occipito-temporal electrode clusters (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) showed statistically significant differences in beta and gamma bands for gaze direction changes and mouth opening at similar post-stimulus times and frequencies. In contrast, control stimuli showed activity in the gamma ban with a completely different time profile and hemispheric distribution to facial stimuli. ERSP plots were generated in two 9 electrode clusters centered on central sites, C3 and C4. In the left cluster for a stimulus conditions, broadband beta suppression persisted from about 250 ms post-motion onset. In the cluster, beta suppression was seen for control conditions only. Statistically significant differences between conditions were confined between 4 and 15 Hz, unlike the occipito-temporal sites where differences occurred at much higher frequencies (high beta/gamma). Our data indicate that N170 amplitude is sensitive to the amount of movement in the visual field, independent of stimulus type. In contrast, occipito-temporal beta and gamma activity differentiates between facial am non-facial motion. Context and stimulus configuration likely plays a role in shaping neural responses, based on comparisons of the current data to previously reported studies. Broadband suppression of central beta activity, and significant low frequency differences were likely stimulus driven and not contingent on behavioral responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Mert, A; Akan, A				Mert, Ahmet; Akan, Aydin			Detrended fluctuation thresholding for empirical mode decomposition based denoising	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Signal denoising; Thresholding	EEG	Signal decompositions such as wavelet and Gabor transforms have successfully been applied in denoising problems. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a recently proposed method to analyze non-linear and non-stationary time series and may be used for noise elimination. Similar to other decomposition based denoising approaches, EMD based denoising requires a reliable threshold to determine which oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are noise components or noise free signal components. Here, we propose a metric based on detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to define a robust threshold. The scaling exponent of DFA is an indicator of statistical self-affinity. In our study, it is used to determine a threshold region to eliminate the noisy IMFs. The proposed DFA threshold and denoising by DFA-EMD are tested on different synthetic and real signals at various signal to noise ratios (SNR). The results are promising especially at 0 dB when signal is corrupted by white Gaussian noise (WGN). The proposed method outperforms soft and hard wavelet threshold method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Acute Stress Modulates Feedback Processing in Men and Women: Differential Effects on the Feedback-Related Negativity and Theta and Beta Power	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ANTICIPATORY STRESS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; GAMBLING TASK; REWARD; DEPRESSION	Sex-specific prevalence rates in mental and physical disorders may be partly explained by sex differences in physiological stress responses. Neural networks that might be involved are those underlying feedback processing. Aim of the present EEG study was to investigate whether acute stress alters feedback processing, and whether stress effects differ between men and women. Male and female participants performed a gambling task, in a control and a stress condition. Stress was induced by exposing participants to a noise stressor. Brain activity was analyzed using both event-related potential and time-frequency analyses, measuring the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback-related changes in theta and beta oscillatory power, respectively. While the FRN and feedback-related theta power were similarly affected by stress induction in both sexes, feedback-related beta power depended on the combination of stress induction condition and sex. FRN amplitude and theta power increases were smaller in the stress relative to the control condition in both sexes, demonstrating that acute noise stress impairs performance monitoring irrespective of sex. However, in the stress but not in the control condition, early lower beta-band power increases were larger for men than women, indicating that stress effects on feedback processing are partly sex-dependent. Our findings suggest that sex-specific effects on feedback processing may comprise a factor underlying sex-specific stress responses.

Recent computational, electrophysiological, and clinical studies have implicated two brain areas as being crucial in assuring sufficient time is taken for decision-making under conditions of conflict: the medial prefrontal cortex and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Both structures exhibit an elevation of activity at low frequencies (<10 Hz) during conflict that correlates with the amount of time taken to respond. This suggests that the two sites could become functionally coupled during conflict. To establish the nature of this interaction we recorded from deep-brain stimulation electrodes implanted bilaterally in the STN of 13 Parkinson's disease patients while they performed a sensory integration task involving randomly moving dots. By gradually increasing the number of dots moving coherently in one direction, we were able to determine changes in the STN associated with response execution. Furthermore, by occasionally having 10% of the dots move in the opposite direction as the majority, we were able to identify an independent increase in STN theta-delta activity triggered by conflict. Crucially, simultaneous midline frontal electroencephalographic recordings revealed an increase in the theta-delta band coherence between the two structures that was specific to high-conflict trials. Activity over the midline frontal cortex was Granger causal to that in STN. These results establish the cortico-subcortical circuit enabling successful choices to be made under conditions of conflict and provide support for the hypothesis that the brain uses frequency-specific channels of communication to convey behaviorally relevant information.

In the present study, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory brain responses induced by these factors, using a task in which participants named pictures after reading sentences. Sentence contexts were either constraining or nonconstraining towards the final word, which was presented as a picture. Picture names varied in their frequency of occurrence in the language. Naming latencies and electrophysiological responses were examined as a function of context and lexical frequency. Lexical frequency is an index of our cumulative learning experience with words, so lexical-frequency effects most likely reflect access to memory representations for words. Pictures were named faster with constraining than nonconstraining contexts. Associated with this effect, starting around 400 ms pre-picture presentation, oscillatory power between 8 and 30 Hz was lower for constraining relative to nonconstraining contexts. Furthermore, pictures were named faster with high-frequency than low-frequency names, but only for nonconstraining contexts, suggesting differential ease of memory access as a function of sentential context. Associated with the lexical-frequency effect, starting around 500 ms pre-picture presentation, oscillatory power between 4 and 10 Hz was higher for high-frequency than for low-frequency names, but only for constraining contexts. Our results characterise electrophysiological responses associated with lexical frequency and sentential constraint in spoken word production, and point to new avenues for studying these fundamental factors in language production.

Both these oscillations are markers of neuronal plasticity, and play a role in memory and cognition. Normal ageing is associated with spindle and slow wave decline and cognitive changes. The present study aimed to assess whether spindle and slow wave characteristics during a baseline night predict cognitive performance in healthy older adults the next morning. Specifically, we examined performance on tasks measuring selective and sustained visual attention, declarative verbal memory, working memory and verbal fluency. Fifty-eight healthy middle-aged and older adults (aged 50-91years) without sleep disorders underwent baseline polysomnographic sleep recording followed by neuropsychological assessment the next morning. Spindles and slow waves were detected automatically on artefact-free non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram. All-night stage N2 spindle density (no./min) and mean frequency (Hz) and all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep slow wave density (no./min) and mean slope (V/s) were analysed. Pearson's correlations were performed between spindles, slow waves, polysomnography and cognitive performance. Higher spindle density predicted better performance on verbal learning, visual attention and verbal fluency, whereas spindle frequency and slow wave density or slope predicted fewer cognitive performance variables. In addition, rapid eye movement sleep duration was associated with better verbal learning potential. These results suggest that spindle density is a marker of cognitive functioning in older adults and may reflect neuroanatomic integrity. Rapid eye movement sleep may be a marker of age-related changes in acetylcholine transmission, which plays a role in new information encoding.

However, the specific functional role of these bands within the mu rhythmis still unclear. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to analyze the spectral and temporal properties of the alpha and beta bands in healthy subjects during an action observation and execution task. We associated the modulation of the alpha and beta power to a broad action observation network comprising several parieto-frontal areas previously detected in fMRI studies. Of note, we observed a dissociation between alpha and beta bands with a slow-down of beta oscillations compared to alpha during action observation. We hypothesize that this segregation is linked to a different sequence of information processing and we interpret these modulations in terms of internal models (forward and inverse). In fact, these processes showed opposite temporal sequences of occurrence: anterior-posterior during action (both in alpha and beta bands) and roughly posterior-anterior during observation (in the alpha band). The observed differentiation between alpha and beta suggests that these two bands might pursue different functions in the action observation and execution processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Neural Responses to Target Features outside a Search Array Are Enhanced during Conjunction but Not Unique-Feature Search	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						feature-based attention; frequency tagging; neural oscillations; steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); visual search	CONTINGENT ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; VISUAL-SEARCH; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN; CONTROL SETTINGS; PARALLEL; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	The visual world is typically too complex to permit full apprehension of its content from a single fixation. Humans therefore use visual search to direct attention and eye movements to locations or objects of interest in cluttered scenes. Psychophysical investigations have revealed that observers can select target elements from within an array of distractors on the basis of their spatial location or simple features, such as color. It remains unclear, however, how stimuli that lie outside the current search array are represented in the visual system. To investigate this, we recorded continuous neural activity using EEG while participants searched a foveal array of colored targets and distractors, and ignored irrelevant objects in the periphery. Search targets were defined either by a unique feature within the array or by a conjunction of features. Objects outside the array could match the target or distractor color within the array, or otherwise possessed a baseline (neutral) color present only in the periphery. The search array and irrelevant peripheral objects flickered at unique rates and thus evoked distinct frequency-tagged neural oscillations. During conjunction but not unique-feature search, target-colored objects outside the array evoked enhanced activity relative to distractor-colored and neutral objects. The results suggest that feature-based selection applies to stimuli at ignored peripheral locations, but only when central targets compete with distractors within the array. Distractor-colored and neutral objects evoked equivalent oscillatory responses, suggesting that feature-based selection at ignored locations during visual search arises exclusively from enhancement rather than suppression of neural activity.

Whether this principle applies to human auditory attention is not yet fully clear. Here, we explicitly tested the differences in cross-hemispheric functional coupling between the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and auditory cortex (AC) using combined magnetoencephalography (MEG), EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI). Inter-regional pairwise phase consistency (PPC) was analyzed from data obtained during dichotic auditory selective attention task, where subjects were in 10-s trials cued to attend to sounds presented to one ear and to ignore sounds presented in the opposite ear. Using MEG/EEGAIVIRI source modeling, parietotemporal PPC patterns were (a) mapped between all AC locations vs. IPS seeds and (b) analyzed between four anatomically defined AC regions-of-interest (ROI) vs. IPS seeds. Consistent with our hypothesis, stronger cross-hemispheric PPC was observed between the right IPS and left AC for attended right-ear sounds, as compared to PPC between the left IPS and right AC for attended left-ear sounds. In the mapping analyses, these differences emerged at 7-13 Hz, i.e., at the theta to alpha frequency bands, and peaked in Heschl's gyrus and lateral posterior non-primary ACs. The ROI analysis revealed similarly lateralized differences also in the beta and lower theta bands. Taken together, our results support the view that the right parietal cortex dominates auditory spatial attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many psychiatric drugs bind to both types of receptors, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to be centrally involved with empathy. However, the relationship between the 5-HT/DA system in the ACC and empathic behavior is not yet well known. We investigated the role of 5-HT/DA in empathy-like behavior and in the regulation of ACC neural activity. An observational fear learning task was conducted following microinjections of 5-HT, DA, 5-HT and DA, methysergide (5-HT receptor antagonist), SCH-23390 (DA D-1 receptor antagonist), or haloperidol (DA D-2 receptor antagonist) into the mouse ACC. The ACC neural activity influenced by 5-HT and DA was electrophysiologically characterized in vitro and in vivo. The microinjection of haloperidol, but not methysergide or SCH-23390, decreased the fear response of observing mice. The administration of 5-HT and 5-HT and DA together, but not DA alone, reduced the freezing response of observing mice. 5-HT enhanced delta-band activity and reduced alpha- and gamma-band activities in the ACC, whereas DA reduced only alpha-band activity. Based on entropy, reduced complexity of ACC neural activity was observed with 5-HT treatment. The current results demonstrated that DA D-2 receptors in the ACC are required for observational fear learning, whereas increased 5-HT levels disrupt observational fear and alter the regularity of ACC neural oscillations.

A study on fear memory retrieval and REM sleep in maternal separation and isolation stressed rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Early maternal separation stress; Fear memory; Sleep; Theta-gamma oscillations; Hippocampus; Amygdala; Prefrontal cortex	NONPARAMETRIC GRANGER CAUSALITY; HPA AXIS HYPERACTIVITY; EEG POWER SPECTRUM; OCTODON-DEGUS; PREOPTIC AREA; CONSOLIDATION; AMYGDALA; HIPPOCAMPUS; BRAIN; NEUROBIOLOGY	As rapid brain development occurs during the neonatal period, environmental manipulation during this period may have a significant impact on sleep and memory functions. Moreover, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays an important role in integrating new information with the previously stored emotional experience. Hence, the impact of early maternal separation and isolation stress (MS) during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) on fear memory retention and sleep in rats were studied. The neonatal rats were subjected to maternal separation and isolation stress during postnatal days 5-7 (6 h daily/3 d). Polysomnographic recordings and differential fear conditioning was carried out in two different sets of rats aged 2 months. The neuronal replay during REM sleep was analyzed using different parameters. MS rats showed increased time in REM stage and total sleep period also increased. MS rats showed fear generalization with increased fear memory retention than normal control (NC). The detailed analysis of the local field potentials across different time periods of REM sleep showed increased theta oscillations in the hippocampus, amygdala and cortical circuits. Our findings suggest that stress during SHRP has sensitized the hippocampus amygdala cortical loops which could be due to increased release of corticosterone that generally occurs during REM sleep. These rats when subjected to fear conditioning exhibit increased fear memory and increased, fear generalization. The development of helplessness, anxiety and sleep changes in human patients, thus, could be related to the reduced thermal, tactile and social stimulation during SHRP on brain plasticity and fear memory functions.

Observing function-structure relationships, for example establishing an association between brain oscillations (defined in terms of amplitude or phase) and cortical gray matter, might inform models on the origins of psychosis. Given evidence of functional and structural abnormalities in primary/secondary auditory regions in SZ, the present study examined how superior temporal gyrus (STG) structure relates to auditory STG low-frequency and 40 Hz steady-state activity. Given changes in brain activity as a function of age, age-related associations in STG oscillatory activity were also examined. Methods: Thirty-nine individuals with SZ and 29 HC were recruited. 40 Hz amplitude-modulated tones of 1 s duration were presented. MEG and T1-weighted sMRI data were obtained. Using the sources localizing 40 Hz evoked steady-state activity (300 to 950 ms), left and right STG total power and inter-trial coherence were computed. Time-frequency group differences and associations with STG structure and age were also examined. Results: Decreased total power and inter-trial coherence in SZ were observed in the left STG for initial post-stimulus low-frequency activity (similar to 50 to 200 ms, similar to 4 to 16 Hz) as well as 40 Hz steady-state activity (similar to 400 to 1000 ms). Left STG 40 Hz total power and inter-trial coherence were positively associated with left STG cortical thickness in HC, not in SZ. Left STG post-stimulus low-frequency and 40 Hz total power were positively associated with age, again only in controls. Discussion: Left STG low-frequency and steady-state gamma abnormalities distinguish SZ and HC. Disease-associated damage to STG gray matter in schizophrenia may disrupt the age-related left STG gamma-band function-structure relationships observed in controls. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Depending on task requirements, they may analyze the fraction components separately (componential processing strategy, CPS) or consider the fraction as a whole (holistic processing strategy, HPS). It is so far unknown what is the brain coordination dynamics underlying these types of fraction processing strategies. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed oscillatory brain activity during a fraction comparison task, presenting pairs of fractions either with or without common components. Results show that CPS induces a left frontal-parietal alpha phase desynchronization after the onset of fraction pairs, while HPS induces an increase of phase synchrony on theta and gamma bands, over frontal and central-parietal sites, respectively. Additionally, the HPS evokes more negative ERPs around 400 ms over the right frontal scalp than the CPS. This ERP activity correlates with the increase of Theta phase synchrony. Our results reveal the emergence of different functional neural networks depending on the kind of cognitive strategy used for processing fractions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Lindsay, S				Lindsay, Shane			Can hyper-synchrony in meditation lead to seizures? Similarities in meditative and epileptic brain states	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							TRANSCENDENTAL-MEDITATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; MINDFULNESS MEDITATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG; DOPAMINE; DEFINITIONS; PREDISPOSE; ACTIVATION	Meditation is used worldwide by millions of people for relaxation and stress relief. Given sufficient practice, meditators may also experience a variety of altered states of consciousness. These states can lead to a variety of unusual experiences, including physical, emotional and psychic disturbances. This paper highlights the correspondences between brain states associated with these experiences and the symptoms and neurophysiology of epileptic simple partial seizures. Seizures, like meditation practice, can result in both positive and negative experiences. The neurophysiology and chemistry underlying simple partial seizures are characterised by a high degree of excitability and high levels of neuronal synchrony in gamma-band brain activity. Following a survey of the literature that shows that meditation practice is also linked to high power gamma activity, an account of how meditation could cause such activity is provided. This paper discusses the diagnostic challenges for the claim that meditation practices lead to brain states similar to those found in epileptic seizures, and seeks to develop our understanding of the range of pathological and non-pathological states that result from a hyper-excited and hyper-synchronous brain	Univ Hull, Dept Psychol, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England		Lindsay, S (corresponding author), Univ Hull, Dept Psychol, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.	shane.lindsay@gmail.com							75	0	0	2	20	CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE	EDINBURGH	JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND	0306-9877	1532-2777		MED HYPOTHESES	Med.

The present study explores whether a different pattern of response is observed when using non-infant affective pictures. We examined the event-related evoked potentials and induced delta, theta and alpha activity in 14 neglectful mothers and 14 control mothers elicited while categorizing positive, negative and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Self-reports of anhedonia and empathy were also recorded. Early posterior negativity, P200 and late positive potential components were modulated by the emotional content of pictures in both groups. However, the LPP waveform had a more delayed and more attenuated maximum in neglectful mothers than in control mothers. Oscillatory responses indicated lower power increases for neglectful mothers than for control mothers in delta (14 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz) and lower alpha (8-10 Hz) bands at frontal sites, and a more consistent increase for neglectful mothers in theta and lower alpha bands at occipital sites, especially for negative pictures. These findings help us to better understand the limits of emotional insensitivity in neglectful mothers.

Neural mirroring mechanisms and imitation in human infants	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						infancy; imitation; neural mirroring; electroencephalogram; mu rhythm	MU-RHYTHM; MOTOR ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; ACTION-PERCEPTION; EEG EVIDENCE; SYSTEM; OTHERS; ALPHA; CORTEX	Studying human infants will increase our understanding of the nature, origins and function of neural mirroring mechanisms. Human infants are prolific imitators. Infant imitation indicates observation-execution linkages in the brain prior to language and protracted learning. Investigations of neural aspects of these linkages in human infants have focused on the sensorimotor mu rhythm in the electroencephalogram, which occurs in the alpha frequency range over central electrode sites. Recent results show that the infant mu rhythm is desynchronized during action execution as well as action observation. Current work is elucidating properties of the infant mu rhythm and how it may relate to prelinguistic action processing and social understanding. Here, we consider this neuroscience research in relation to developmental psychological theory, particularly the 'Like-Me' framework, which holds that one of the chief cognitive tasks of the human infant is to map the similarity between self and other. We elucidate the value of integrating neuroscience findings with behavioural studies of infant imitation, and the reciprocal benefit of examining mirroring mechanisms from an ontogenetic perspective.

The majority of cases are medically refractory, necessitating surgical resection when possible. However, even resection of structures thought to be responsible for seizure generation may not leave a patient seizure free. While mesial temporal lobe limbic structures are centrally involved, there is growing evidence that the epileptogenic network consists of a broader area, involving structures outside of the temporal lobe and the limbic system. Information on structural, functional, and metabolic connectivity in patients with limbic epilepsy is available from a large body of studies employing methods such as MRI, EEG, MEG, fMRI, PET, and SPECT scanning, implicating the involvement of various brain regions in the epileptogenic network. To date, there are no consistent and conclusive findings to define the exact boundaries of this network, but it is possible that in the future studies of network connectivity in the individual patient may allow more tailored treatment and prognosis in terms of surgical resection.

Here, we show that in vivo elevation of IFNs by viral brain infection reduced hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) in cortical pyramidal neurons. In rodent brain slices directly exposed to type I IFNs, the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)-gated channel subunit HCN1 was specifically affected. The effect required an intact type I receptor (IFNAR) signaling cascade. Consistent with Ih inhibition, IFNs hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential, shifted the resonance frequency, and increased the membrane impedance. In vivo application of IFN-gamma to the rat and to the mouse cerebral cortex reduced the power of higher frequencies in the cortical electroencephalographic activity only in the presence of HCN1. In summary, these findings identify HCN1 channels as a novel neural target for type I IFNs providing the possibility to tune neural responses during the complex event of a CNS inflammation.

In this study, we employed an acute psycho-physiological laboratory stressor, which is similar to real life stressful conditions and is capable of reliably eliciting the normal range of stress effects. The primary goal of the present study was to investigate whether the effect of stress on working memory performance depends on the number of images that need to be maintained (memory load), and the duration of the retention interval. By manipulating the number of images and the length of the retention interval of the modified Stenberg working memory test, we altered the task difficulty and examined the consequent effects on behavior. Twelve young students were submitted to a stressful condition one day and a control condition on another day. The stressor used included a physiological factor (socially evaluated cold pressor test) and a psychosocial factor (modified version of trier social stress test). The sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activation were assessed by heart rate and salivary cortisol. It was found that this procedure, which involves exposure to a normal intensity level of psycho-physiological stress, can demonstrate the beneficial effect of stress on reaction time without decreasing accuracy at high memory loads, but not at low memory loads. Relevance to industry: Managing stress in the workplace is important for decreasing human errors. Workers' performances can be improved if they receive appropriate levels of stress and task difficulty. If so, they might gain an advantage as long-term memory can be supported in addition to working memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to investigate the alterations of functional connectivity in AD during auditory change detection processing by measuring the local neuronal activation and functional connectivity between cortical regions. Magnetoencephalographic responses to deviant and standard sounds were recorded in 16 AD patients, 18 young controls and 16 elderly controls. Larger source amplitudes and shorter peak latencies were found in the right temporal magnetic mismatch responses of young controls compared with elderly controls and AD patients. During deviant stimuli, the right theta temporal-frontal phase synchrony was significantly smaller in AD than in young controls and elderly controls. Moreover, the left temporal-frontal synchronization at theta and alpha bands was reduced in AD and elderly controls compared with young controls. In conclusion, the loss in temporo-frontal theta synchronization might be an electrophysiological hallmark of AD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5565-5577, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Anti-epileptogenic Effect of High-frequency Stimulation in the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus on PTZ-induced Seizures	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Thalamic reticular nucleus; Deep brain stimulation; Spike-wave discharges; Neuromodulation; Experimental epileptic seizures	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; SOLITARY TRACT; RATS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS	Background: Deep brain stimulation, specifically high-frequency stimulation (HFS), is an alternative and promising treatment for intractable epilepsies; however, the optimal targets are still unknown. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) occupies a key position in the modulation of the cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical pathways. Objective: We determined the efficacy of HFS in the TRN against tonic-clonic generalized seizures (TCGS) and status epilepticus (SE), which were induced by scheduled pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injections. Methods: Male Wistar rats were stereotactically implanted and assigned to three experimental groups: Control group, which received only PTZ injections; HFS-TRN group, which received HFS in the left TRN prior to PTZ injections; and HFS-Adj group, which received HFS in the left adjacent nuclei prior to VIZ injections. Results: The HFS-TRN group reported a significant increase in the latency for development of TCGS and SE compared with the HFS-Adj and Control groups (P < 0.009). The number of PTZ-doses required for SE was also significantly increased (P < 0.001). Spectral analysis revealed a significant decrease in the frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 4.5 Hz of the left motor cortex in the HFS-TRN and HFS-Adj groups, compared to the Control group. Conversely, HFS-TRN provoked a significant increase in all frequency bands in the TRN. EEG asynchrony was observed during spike-wave discharges by HFS-TRN. Conclusion: These data indicate that HFS-TRN has an anti-epileptogenic effect and is able to modify seizure synchrony and interrupt abnormal EEG recruitment of thalamo-cortical and, indirectly, corticothalamic pathways.

Neurophysiological Markers of Stress within a Recovery Period after Acute Complications of Cardiovascular Diseases	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						myocardial infarction; stroke; postmorbid stress; objective markers of stress; polygraphic data acquisition; biofeedback		In the course of rehabilitation in a sanatorium, we provided polygraphic examination of a group of 14 men who endured myocardial infarction or stroke one to three months ago. Fourteen men of a comparable age (55 years, on average), healthy from the aspect of diseases of the cardiovascular system, served as the control group. Examination was performed using a flexible data acquisition and feedback platform A << Nexus-10 Mark IIA >> (the Netherlands) allowing us to simultaneously record ECG, EMG, EEG, respiratory movements, pulse blood filling, skin temperature, electrodermal resistance, and a few other indices. It was found that patients suffering from complications of pathologies of the cardiovascular system were characterized by a significant increase in the electrodermal conductivity, clearly expressed tachypnea, and some trends toward tachycardia and decrease in the skin temperature. According to indices of the heart rate variability (HRV), the mean value of the Bayevskii stress index in patients was about three times higher than the analogous value in the control group, while the total power of the HRV spectrum was dramatically lower. The amplitude of tonic EMG activity recorded from mm. trapezii in the resting state considerably exceeded the respective value in control subjects. The amplitude of 8-13 Hz EEG oscillations in the Cz lead in patients was somewhat lower than in the control group, and increase in this index in the test with closing of the eyes in these subjects was manifested much slightly than in the control. Parallel recording of physiological (first of all, neurophysiological) indices allows researchers to effectively identify objective markers of the stress state developed after complications of diseases of the cardiovascular system; the respective data can be used in the curative procedures with the control of functions of the organism using a feedback technology by the parameters of activity of the functional systems (biofeedback control).

Whether sensory reafferences are accurately processed can be assessed based on the bimanual advantage in tapping: because of tapping with an additional hand increases kinesthetic reafferences, bimanual tapping is characterized by a reduced inter-tap interval variability than unimanual tapping. A suppression of the bimanual advantage would thus indicate a deficit in sensory reafference. We tested whether elderly indeed show a reduced bimanual advantage by measuring unimanual (UM) and bimanual (BM) self-paced tapping performance in groups of young (n = 29) and old (n = 27) healthy adults. Electroencephalogram was recorded to assess the underlying patterns of oscillatory activity, a neurophysiological mechanism advanced to support the integration of sensory reafferences. Behaviorally, there was a significant interaction between the factors tapping condition and age group at the level of the inter-tap interval variability, driven by a lower variability in BM than UM tapping in the young, but not in the elderly group. This result indicates that in self-paced tapping, the bimanual advantage is absent in elderly. Electrophysiological results revealed an interaction between tapping condition and age group on low beta band (14-20 Hz) activity. Beta activity varied depending on the tapping condition in the elderly but not in the young group. Source estimations localized this effect within left superior parietal and left occipital areas. We interpret our results in terms of engagement of different mechanisms in the elderly depending on the tapping mode: a 'kinesthetic' mechanism for UM and a 'visual imagery' mechanism for BM tapping movement.

Inferring resting-state connectivity is often based on correlations, which are sensitive to indirect connections, leading to an inaccurate representation of the real backbone of the network. The precision matrix is a better representation for whole brain connectivity, as it considers only direct connections. The network structure can be estimated using the graphical lasso (GL), which achieves sparsity through l(1)-regularization on the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a structural connectivity adaptive version of the GL, where weaker anatomical connections are represented as stronger penalties on the corresponding functional connections. We applied beamformer source reconstruction to the resting state MEG recordings of 81 subjects, where 29 were healthy controls, 22 were single-domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and 30 were multiple-domain amnestic MCI. An atlas-based anatomical parcellation of 66 regions was obtained for each subject, and time series were assigned to each of the regions. The fiber densities between the regions, obtained with deterministic tractography from diffusion-weighted MRI, were used to define the anatomical connectivity. Precision matrices were obtained with the region specific time series in five different frequency bands. We compared our method with the traditional GL and a functional adaptive version of the GL, in terms of log-likelihood and classification accuracies between the three groups. We conclude that introducing an anatomical prior improves the expressivity of the model and, inmost cases, leads to a better classification between groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cognitive decrements are commonly observed, possibly due to alterations in RSNs, which may vary according to microvascular complication status. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity in RSNs differs according to clinical status and correlates with cognition in T1DM patients, using an unbiased approach with high spatio-temporal resolution functional network. Methods: Resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data for T1DM patients with (n = 42) and without (n = 41) microvascular complications and 33 healthy participants were recorded. MEG time-series at source level were reconstructed using a recently developed atlas-based beamformer. Functional connectivity within classical frequency bands, estimated by the phase lag index (PLI), was calculated within eight commonly found RSNs. Neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive performance, and the relation with RSNs was evaluated. Results: Significant differences in terms of RSN functional connectivity between the three groups were observed in the lower alpha band, in the default-mode (DMN), executive control (ECN) and sensorimotor (SMN) RSNs. T1DM patients with microvascular complications showed the weakest functional connectivity in these networks relative to the other groups. For DMN, functional connectivity was higher in patients without microangiopathy relative to controls (all p < 0.05). General cognitive performance for both patient groups was worse compared with healthy controls. Lower DMN alpha band functional connectivity correlated with poorer general cognitive ability in patients with microvascular complications. Discussion: Altered RSN functional connectivity was found in T1DM patients depending on clinical status. Lower DMN functional connectivity was related to poorer cognitive functioning. These results indicate that functional connectivity may play a key role in T1DM-related cognitive dysfunction. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To investigate whether neuronal firing immediately upon arousal is different from the remaining part of the waking episode, we recorded and analyzed the dynamics of cortical neuronal activity in the first 15 min after spontaneous awakenings in freely moving rats and mice. Design: Intracortical recordings of the local field potential and neuronal activity in freely-moving mice and rats. Setting: Basic sleep research laboratory. Patients or Participants: WKY adult male rats, C57BL/6 adult male mice. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: In both species the average population spiking activity upon arousal was initially low, though substantial variability in the dynamics of firing activity was apparent between individual neurons. A distinct population of neurons was found that was virtually silent in the first min upon awakening. The overall lower population spiking initially after awakening was associated with the occurrence of brief periods of generalized neuronal silence (OFF periods), whose frequency peaked immediately after awakening and then progressively declined. OFF periods incidence upon awakening was independent of ongoing locomotor activity but was sensitive to immediate preceding sleep/wake history. Notably, in both rats and mice if sleep before a waking episode was enriched in rapid eye movement sleep, the incidence of OFF periods was initially higher as compared to those waking episodes preceded mainly by nonrapid eye movement sleep. Conclusion: We speculate that an intrusion of sleep-like patterns of cortical neuronal activity into the wake state immediately after awakening may account for some of the changes in the behavior and cognitive function typical of what is referred to as sleep inertia.

J	Botcharova, M; Farmer, SF; Berthouze, L				Botcharova, Maria; Farmer, Simon F.; Berthouze, Luc			Markers of criticality in phase synchronization	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						criticality; long-range temporal correlations; phase synchronization; detrended fluctuation analysis; oscillations; Kuramoto; Ising		The concept of the brain as a critical dynamical system is very attractive because systems close to criticality are thought to maximize their dynamic range of information processing and communication. To date, there have been two key experimental observations in support of this hypothesis: (i) neuronal avalanches with power law distribution of size and (ii) long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these maximize dynamic range of information processing and communication is still being made and because a significant substrate for information coding and transmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronization measures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterizing criticality in synchronization based on an analysis of the moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase synchrony in terms of the presence of LRTCs. This framework relies on an estimation of the rate of change of phase difference and a set of methods we have developed to detect LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of criticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these models aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these simulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of LRTCs in phase synchronization. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing pairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of corticomuscular phase synchronization can be detected in the resting state and experimentally manipulated. The existence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronization suggests that these fluctuations are governed by non-local behavior, with all scales contributing to system behavior. This has important implications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see LRTCs in phase synchronization. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit LRTCs reflecting a state of readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts toward and away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.

Phase-amplitude coupling and infraslow (<1 Hz) frequencies in the rat brain: relationship to resting state fMRI	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						DC potentials; cross-frequency coupling; functional MRI; multiscale activity; nested oscillations; resting state; slow cortical potentials; spontaneous activity	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; STIMULUS DETECTION; CORTEX; EEG; PREDICT; POWER	Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can identify network alterations that occur in complex psychiatric diseases and behaviors, but its interpretation is difficult because the neural basis of the infraslow BOLD fluctuations is poorly understood. Previous results link dynamic activity during the resting state to both infraslow frequencies in local field potentials (LFP) (<1 Hz) and band-limited power in higher frequency LFP (>1 Hz). To investigate the relationship between these frequencies, LFPs were recorded from rats under two anesthetics: isoflurane and dexmedetomidine. Signal phases were calculated from low-frequency LFP and compared to signal amplitudes from high-frequency LFP to determine if modulation existed between the two frequency bands (phase-amplitude coupling). Isoflurane showed significant, consistent phase-amplitude coupling at nearly all pairs of frequencies, likely due to the burst-suppression pattern of activity that it induces. However, no consistent phase-amplitude coupling was observed in rats that were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine. fMRI-LFP correlations under isoflurane using high frequency LFP were reduced when the low frequency LFP's influence was accounted for, but not vice-versa, or in any condition under dexmedetomidine. The lack of consistent phase-amplitude coupling under dexmedetomidine and lack of shared variance between high frequency and low frequency LFP as it relates to fMRI suggests that high and low frequency neural electrical signals may contribute differently, possibly even independently, to resting state fMRI. This finding suggests that researchers take care in interpreting the neural basis of resting state fMRI, as multiple dynamic factors in the underlying electrophysiology could be driving any particular observation.

Inter- and intra-individual variability in alpha peak frequency	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha; Beta; Oscillations; MEG	EEG-ALPHA; BAND ACTIVITY; MU RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Converging electrophysiological evidence suggests that the alpha rhythm plays an important and active role in cognitive processing. Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3 Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9 Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8 Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8-12 Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains unclear how those cortical regions are functionally integrated during novelty processing. Because theta oscillation has been assumed to have a crucial role in memory operations, we examined local and inter-regional neural synchrony of theta band activity during novelty processing. Fifteen right-handed healthy university students participated in this study. Subjects performed an auditory novelty oddball task that consisted of the random sequence of three types of stimuli such as a target (1000 Hz pure tone), novel (familiar environmental sounds such as dog bark, buzz, car crashing sound and so on), and standard sounds (950 Hz pure tone). Event-related spectra perturbation (ERSP) and the phase-locking value (PLV) were measured from human scalp EEG during task. Non-parametric statistical tests were applied to test for significant differences between stimulus novelty and stimulus targets in ERSP and PLV. The novelty P3 showed significant higher amplitude and shorter latency compared with target P3 in frontocentral regions. Overall, theta activity was significantly higher in the novel stimuli compared with the target stimuli. Specifically, the difference in theta power between novel and target stimuli was most significant in the right frontal region. This right frontal theta activity was accompanied by phase synchronization with the left temporal region. Our results imply that theta phase synchronization between right frontal and left temporal regions underlie the retrieval of memory traces for unexpected but familiar sounds from long term memory in addition to working memory retrieval or novelty encoding.

Such emotional intentionality calls for the integration between two streams of information; abstract hedonic value and its associated concrete content. In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we found that the combination of these two streams, as modeled by short emotional music excerpts and neutral film clips, was associated with synergistic activation in both temporal-limbic (TL) and ventral-lateral PFC (vLPFC) regions. This additive effect implies the integration of domain-specific 'affective' and 'cognitive' processes. Yet, the low temporal resolution of the fMRI limits the characterization of such cross-domain integration. To this end, we complemented the fMRI data with intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from twelve patients with intractable epilepsy. As expected, the additive fMRI activation in the amygdala and vLPFC was associated with distinct spatio-temporal iEEG patterns among electrodes situated within the vicinity of the fMRI activation foci. On the one hand, TL channels exhibited a transient (0-500 msec) increase in gamma power (61-69 Hz), possibly reflecting initial relevance detection or hedonic value tagging. On the other hand, vLPFC channels showed sustained (1-12 sec) suppression of low frequency power (2.3-24 Hz), possibly mediating changes in gating, enabling an on-going readiness for content-based processing of emotionally tagged signals. Moreover, an additive effect in delta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was found among the TL channels, possibly reflecting the integration between distinct domain specific processes. Together, this study provides a multi-faceted neurophysiological signature for computations that possibly underlie emotional intentionality in humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nakao, K; Nakazawa, K				Nakao, Kazuhito; Nakazawa, Kazu			Brain state-dependent abnormal LFP activity in the auditory cortex of a schizophrenia mouse model	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory steady-state responses; GABAergic interneurons; gamma oscillation; local field potentials; NMDA receptors; parvalbumin; schizophrenia; mouse models	STEADY-STATE; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; EEG; RAT; HALLUCINATIONS	In schizophrenia, evoked 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are impaired, which reflects the sensory deficits in this disorder, and baseline spontaneous oscillatory activity also appears to be abnormal. It has been debated whether the evoked ASSR impairments are due to the possible increase in baseline power. GABAergic interneuron-specific NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction mutant mice mimic some behavioral and pathophysiological aspects of schizophrenia. To determine the presence and extent of sensory deficits in these mutant mice, we recorded spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activity and its click-train evoked ASSRs from primary auditory cortex of awake, head-restrained mice. Baseline spontaneous LFP power in the pre-stimulus period before application of the first click trains was augmented at a wide range of frequencies. However, when repetitive ASSR stimuli were presented every 20s, averaged spontaneous LFP power amplitudes during the inter-ASSR stimulus intervals in the mutant mice became indistinguishable from the levels of control mice. Nonetheless, the evoked 40-Hz ASSR power and their phase locking to click trains were robustly impaired in the mutants, although the evoked 20-Hz ASSRs were also somewhat diminished. These results suggested that NMDAR hypofunction in cortical GABAergic neurons confers two brain state-dependent LFP abnormalities in the auditory cortex; (1) a broadband increase in spontaneous LFP power in the absence of external inputs, and (2) a robust deficit in the evoked ASSR power and its phase-locking despite of normal baseline LFP power magnitude during the repetitive auditory stimuli. The "paradoxically" high spontaneous LFP activity of the primary auditory cortex in the absence of external stimuli may possibly contribute to the emergence of schizophrenia-related aberrant auditory perception.

Recently, we described the presence of high threshold, voltage-dependent N- and P/O-type calcium channels in RAS nuclei that subserve gamma band oscillations in the mesopontine PPN, intralaminar parafascicular nucleus (Pf), and pontine subcoeruleus nucleus dorsalis (SubCD). Cortical gamma band activity participates in sensory perception, problem solving, and memory. Rather than participating in the temporal binding of sensory events as in the cortex, gamma band activity in the RAS may participate in the processes of preconscious awareness, and provide the essential stream of information for the formulation of many of our actions. That is, the RAS may play an early permissive role in volition. Our latest results suggest that (1) the manifestation of gamma band activity during waking may employ a separate intracellular pathway compared to that during REM sleep, (2) neuronal calcium sensor (NCS-1) protein, which is over expressed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, modulates gamma band oscillations in the PPN in a concentration-dependent manner, (3) leptin, which undergoes resistance in obesity resulting in sleep dysregulation, decreases sodium currents in PPN neurons, accounting for its normal attenuation of waking, and (4) following our discovery of electrical coupling in the RAS, we hypothesize that there are cell clusters within the PPN that may act in concert. These results provide novel information on the mechanisms controlling high-frequency activity related to waking and REM sleep by elements of the RAS.

However, the broader application of ECoG has been confounded by difficulties in accurately depicting individual data and performing statistically valid population-level analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed methods for accurately registering ECoG data to individual cortical topology. We integrated this technique with surface-based co-registration and a mixed-effects multilevel analysis (MEMA) to control for variable cortical surface anatomy and sparse coverage across patients, as well as intra-and inter-subject variability. We applied this surface-based MEMA (SB-MEMA) technique to a face-recognition task dataset (n = 22). Compared against existing techniques, SB-MEMA yielded results much more consistent with individual data and with meta-analyses of face-specific activation studies. We anticipate that SB-MEMA will greatly expand the role of ECoG in studies of human cognition, and will enable the generation of population-level brain activity maps and accurate multimodal comparisons.

The driver inputs to the HO nuclei arrive from the cortex, and the messages they deliver are then relayed to other cortical areas. As the origin of these inputs is the cortical layer V. whose axons branch and innervate lower motor centers in the CNS, the messages are copies of motor instructions issued to those lower motor centers. These copies are thus an integral part of perceptual processes. In schizophrenia, the HO nuclei are shrunken suggesting that a reduced ability to integrate copies of ongoing motor commands in perceptual processes may be one part of the underlying pathophysiology. The driver inputs in the thalamus utilize ionotropic glutamate receptors such as the NMDAR. NMDAR antagonists may exert their pro-psychotic effects by impairing the function of the HO nuclei. Here, we argue that such agents (or the proposed NMDAR hypofunction in schizophrenia) weaken the driver inputs in the HO nuclei, thereby producing a cortico-thalamo-cortical disconnection and impairing sensorimotor integration.

Current diagnostic guidelines encourage further research for the development of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, especially in its prodromal form (i.e. mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can provide essential information about AD brain dynamics; however, only a few studies have addressed the characterization of MEG in incipient AD. Approach. We analyzed MEG rhythms from 36 AD patients, 18 MCI subjects and 27 controls, introducing a new wavelet-based parameter to quantify their dynamical properties: the wavelet turbulence. Main results. Our results suggest that AD progression elicits statistically significant regional-dependent patterns of abnormalities in the neural activity (p < 0.05), including a progressive loss of irregularity, variability, symmetry and Gaussianity. Furthermore, the highest accuracies to discriminate AD and MCI subjects from controls were 79.4% and 68.9%, whereas, in the three-class setting, the accuracy reached 67.9%. Significance. Our findings provide an original description of several dynamical properties of neural activity in early AD and offer preliminary evidence that the proposed methodology is a promising tool for assessing brain changes at different stages of dementia.

Often these findings exist at different scales of observation, and are not reconciled into a common understanding. Here we develop a new, multiscale mathematical model of cortical electric activity with realistic mesoscopic connectivity. Relating the model dynamics to experimental and clinical findings leads us to propose three classes of dynamical mechanisms for the onset of focal seizures in a unified framework. These three classes are: (i) globally induced focal seizures; (ii) globally supported focal seizures; (iii) locally induced focal seizures. Using model simulations we illustrate these onset mechanisms and show how the three classes can be distinguished. Specifically, we find that although all focal seizures typically appear to arise from localised tissue, the mechanisms of onset could be due to either localised processes or processes on a larger spatial scale. We conclude that although focal seizures might have different patient-specific aetiologies and electrographic signatures, our model suggests that dynamically they can still be classified in a clinically useful way. Additionally, this novel classification according to the dynamical mechanisms is able to resolve some of the previously conflicting experimental and clinical findings.

We assessed oscillatory modulation during visual presentation of single verbs and localized cortical motor regions by means of isometric contraction of hand and foot muscles. Analogously to oscillatory activation patterns accompanying voluntary movements, we expected a somatotopically distributed suppression of beta and alpha frequencies in the motor cortex during processing of body-related action verbs. Magnetoencephalographic data were collected during presentation of verbs that express actions performed using the hands (H) or feet (F). Verbs denoting no bodily movement (N) were used as a control. Between 150 and 500 msec after visual word onset, beta rhythms were suppressed in H and F in comparison with N in the left hemisphere. Similarly, alpha oscillations showed left-lateralized power suppression in the H-N contrast, although at a later stage. The cortical oscillatory activity that typically occurs during voluntary movements is therefore found to somatotopically accompany the processing of body-related verbs. The combination of a localizer task with the oscillatory investigation applied to verb reading as in the present study provides further methodological possibilities of tracking language processing in the brain.

However, recent evidence suggests that this relationship may also vary across cortical areas. Detailed knowledge of the possible spectral diversity between electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses across the human cortex would be essential for neural-level interpretation of fMRI data and for informative multimodal combination of electromagnetic and hemodynamic imaging data, especially in cognitive tasks. We applied multivariate partial least squares correlation analysis to MEG-fMRI data recorded in a reading paradigm to determine the correlation patterns between the data types, at once, across the cortex. Our results revealed heterogeneous patterns of high-frequency correlation between MEG and fMRI responses, with marked dissociation between lower and higher order cortical regions. The low-frequency range showed substantial variance, with negative and positive correlations manifesting at different frequencies across cortical regions. These findings demonstrate the complexity of the neurophysiological counterparts of hemodynamic fluctuations in cognitive processing. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reflectional symmetry is more quickly detected when it is a property of a single object than when it is formed by a gap between two objects. Translational symmetry shows the reverse effect, being more quickly detected when it is a gap between objects. We investigated the neural correlates of this interaction. Electroencephalographic data was recorded from 40 participants who were presented with reflected and translated contours in one-or two-object displays. Half of the participants discriminated regularity, half distinguished number of objects. An event-related potential known as the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN) distinguished between reflection and translation. A similar ERP distinguished between one and two object presentations, but these waves summed with the SPN, rather than altering it. All stimuli produced desynchronization of 8-13 Hz alpha oscillations over the bilateral parietal cortex. In the Discriminate Regularity group, this effect was right lateralized. The SPN and alpha desynchronization index different stages of visual symmetry discrimination. However, neither component displayed the Regularity X Objecthood interaction that is observed in speeded discrimination tasks, suggesting that integration of visual regularity with objectness is not inevitable. Instead, both attributes may be processed in parallel and independently.	[Makin, Alexis D.

A valid murine SAH injection model is not yet available but would be the prerequisite for further transgenic studies assessing the mechanisms following SAH. Using the murine single injection model, we examined the effects of SAH on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the somatosensory (S1) and cerebellar cortex, neuro-behavioural and morphological integrity and changes in quantitative electrocorticographic and electrocardiographic parameters. Micro CT imaging verified successful blood delivery into the cisterna magna. An acute impairment of rCBF was observed immediately after injection in the SAH and after 6, 12 and 24 hours in the S1 and 6 and 12 hours after SAH in the cerebellum. Injection of blood into the foramen magnum reduced telemetric recorded total ECoG power by an average of 65%. Spectral analysis of ECoGs revealed significantly increased absolute delta power, i.e., slowing, cortical depolarisations and changes in ripples and fast ripple oscillations 12 hours and 24 hours after SAH. Therefore, murine single-blood-injection SAH model is suitable for pathophysiological and further molecular analysis following SAH.

In everyday life, we apply the process of insight to problems that are difficult to solve at first glance or that we perceive as ambiguous; however the brain dynamics underlying the disambiguation process remains elusive. Beta-band oscillatory brain activity has been hypothesized to reflect the transition of cognitive states. To elucidate the neural mechanism of insight, we recorded electroencephalograms while subjects were presented with hidden figures followed by unambiguous, gray images. We identified oscillatory activity to detect temporal changes, and compared brain activity that occurred during a perceptual transition with activity that occurred when no perceptual transition occurred. Statistical comparison confirmed stronger beta-power decrease during perceptual transition. Source analysis indicated that the beta-power decrease was around the parietal-posterior regions, mainly in the precuneus. We propose that beta-band desynchronization in the parietal-posterior regions reflects the disambiguation process, and our findings provide additional support for the theory that beta-band activity is related to the transition of cognitive state.

Many studies have demonstrated that, in addition to the premotor, supplementary motor, and primary sensorimotor areas, the prefrontal area contributes to generating such responses. However, most brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have focused on the primary sensorimotor area and have estimated movements using postonset period brain signals. Our aim was to determine whether the prefrontal area could contribute to the prediction of voluntary movement types before movement onset. In our study, electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded from six epilepsy patients while performing two self-paced tasks: hand grasping and elbow flexion. The prefrontal area was sufficient to allow classification of different movements through the area's premovement signals (-2.0 s to 0 s) in four subjects. The most pronounced power difference frequency band was the beta band (13-30Hz). The movement prediction rate during single trial estimation averaged 74% across the six subjects. Our results suggest that premovement signals in the prefrontal area are useful in distinguishing different movement tasks and that the beta band is the most informative for prediction of movement type before movement onset.

NEURAL PROCESSES IN PSEUDO PERCEPTUAL RIVALRY: AN ERP AND TIME-FREQUENCY APPROACH	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta-band activity; EEG; Necker cube; perceptual rivalry	NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; OCCIPITAL ALPHA-BAND; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; OSCILLATION; FRAMEWORK; INFERENCE; AWARENESS; STIMULI	Necker cube is one of the ambiguous figures that is physically a static image but can be alternately perceived in two different perspectives. A great deal of debate exists regarding ambiguous figures that induce spontaneous switching between rival percepts. To investigate the time course of neural processes underlying such perceptual rivalry, we recorded electroencephalograms associated with participants' perceptions of a Necker cube under ambiguous and unambiguous conditions, using a modified discontinuous-presentation method. Each condition consisted of two stimuli presented consecutively, starting with an unambiguous stimulus in both conditions. The second stimulus was either ambiguous (ambiguous condition) or unambiguous (control condition). We compared endogenous reversal activity of ambiguous stimuli with exogenous reversals. As a result, we found that the right-occipital beta-band activity (16-26 Hz) increased 100-150 ms and 350-450 ms after the onset of the ambiguous stimulus only when the perception of the ambiguous stimulus differed from that of the first stimulus. These results indicate that activity in the right-occipital total beta band reflects endogenous switching between rivaling percepts. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamic analysis can be sensitive to changes that occur in psychiatric or neurologic disorders and can detect variations related to performance on individual trials in healthy subjects. However, the appearance of time-varying connectivity can also arise in signals that share no temporal information, complicating the interpretation of dynamic functional connectivity studies. Researchers have begun utilizing simultaneous imaging and electrophysiological recording to elucidate the neural basis of the networks and their variability in animals and in humans. In this article, we review findings that link changes in electrically recorded brain states to changes in the networks obtained with rsMRI and discuss some of the challenges inherent in interpretation of these studies. The literature suggests that multiple brain processes may contribute to the dynamics observed, and we speculate that it may be possible to separate particular aspects of the rsMRI signal to enhance sensitivity to certain types of neural activity, providing new tools for basic neuroscience and clinical research.

Therefore, many journals and theories about neuroscience, psychology, neuroimaging and physiotherapy have played a key role in brain enhancement. Virtual reality is well known as an efficient motivation to enhance motor function. However, much research only proved that there were more immerse and motivate method than conventional way. Hence, which kinds of a procedure have an absolute outcome in brain enhancement? This research will focus on a method that has a high quality in memory development to improve neuroplasticity. Moreover, virtual reality will be developed via Unity which is game engine for developing 2D and 3D game to support a neuronal activity. Quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) will be used to prove the result of memory enhancement during training because QEEG reveals topography of frequency band as well as the brain connectivity. Finally, virtual reality game, which is integrated with the neural activity, is compared with the conventional game via QEEG. The aim of this research is to develop the virtual reality that is supported with the neuronal activity for memory skill and to create the simple virtual reality for real brain enhancement.

CURRENT OPINION IN PULMONARY MEDICINE			English	Review						cyclic alternating pattern; sleep instability; sleep microstructure	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; UPPER AIRWAY-RESISTANCE; AROUSAL FLUCTUATIONS; MOTOR EVENTS; NREM SLEEP; CAP; EEG; INSTABILITY; SLOW	Purpose of review The relevance of sleep instability is poorly appreciated among the metrics of sleep physiology. The cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is a periodic electroencephalogram activity of non-REM sleep, characterized by sequences of transient electrocortical events that are distinct from the tonic background and recur at up to 1-min intervals. In the dynamic organization of sleep, CAP expresses a condition of instability that reflects the brain's effort in preserving and regulating the physiological structure of sleep. Recent findings CAP quantification is a topical feature in the evaluation of sleep quality. In addition to duration, depth, and continuity, sleep restorative properties depend on the brain's capacity to determine the periods of sustained stable sleep. This issue is not confined only to the electroencephalogram activities but reverberates upon the ongoing autonomic and behavioral functions, which are mutually entrained in a synchronized oscillation. As a master clock involved in the dynamic organization of sleep, CAP plays a crucial role in numerous sleep disorders and is powerfully influenced by medication and appropriate treatment. Summary This article reviews the scoring, significance, and clinical applications of CAP.

Altered right frontal cortical connectivity during facial emotion recognition in children with autism spectrum disorders	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorders; Facial emotion; Social; Connectivity; Theta; Coherence	HIGH-FUNCTIONING ADULTS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; BASIC EMOTIONS; EXPRESSIONS; FACES	A growing body of evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is associated with altered functional connectivity of the brain and with impairment in recognizing others' emotions. To better understand the relationships among these neural and behavioral abnormalities, we examined cortical connectivity which was indicated by theta coherence during tasks of facial emotion recognition in 18 children with ASD and 18 typically developing (TD) children who were between 6 and 18 years of age. We found that the children with ASD had general impairment in recognizing facial emotions, after controlling for response bias. Additionally, we found that the TO children demonstrated significant modulation of right frontal theta coherence in response to emotional faces compared to neutral faces, whereas children with ASD did not exhibit any modulation of theta coherence. The extent of modulation of theta coherence to emotions was further found to be related to the severity of social impairments in ASD. Our findings of a general impairment in facial emotion recognition and the involvement of disordered cortical connectivity in social deficits in children with ASD have shed light for future exploration of interventions regarding emotional processing and social functioning in ASD.

J	Gloss, D; Nolan, SJ; Staba, R				Gloss, David; Nolan, Sarah J.; Staba, Richard			The role of high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy surgery	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; INTERICTAL FAST RIPPLES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; UNPROVOKED SEIZURES; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; ONSET; RESECTION; NETWORK; EPILEPTOGENICITY	Background Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Approximately two-thirds of seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic medications (Kwan 2000). For some of the others, surgery can completely eliminate or significantly reduce the occurrence of disabling seizures. Localization of epileptogenic areas for resective surgery is far from perfect, and new tools are being investigated to more accurately localize the epileptogenic zone (the zone of the brain where the seizures begin) and improve the likelihood of freedom from postsurgical seizures. Recordings of pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be one such tool. Objectives To assess the ability of HFOs to improve the outcomes of epilepsy surgery by helping to identify more accurately the epileptogenic areas of the brain. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (15 April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 15 April 2013), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (15 April 2013), Web of Knowledge (Thomson Reuters) (15 April 2013), www.clinicaltrials.gov (15 April 2013), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 April 2013). Selection criteria We included studies that provided information on the outcomes of epilepsy surgery at at least six months and which used high-frequency oscillations in making decisions about epilepsy surgery. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome of the review was the Engel Class Outcome System. Secondary outcomes were responder rate, International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) epilepsy surgery outcome, frequency of adverse events from any source and quality of life outcomes. We intended to analyse outcomes via an aggregated data fixed-effect model meta-analysis. Main results Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were small non-randomised trials, with no control group and no blinding. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. The combination of these two studies resulted in 11 participants who prospectively used ictal HFOs for epilepsy surgery decision making. Results of the postsurgical seizure freedom Engel class I to IV outcome were determined over a period of 12 to 38 months (average 23.4 months) and indicated that six participants had an Engel class I outcome (seizure freedom), two had class II (rare disabling seizures), three had class III (worthwhile improvement). No adverse effects were reported. Neither study compared surgical results guided by HFOs versus surgical results guided without HFOs. Authors' conclusions No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of using HFOs in epilepsy surgery decision making at present.

We recently showed that KCs are isolated downstates characterized by widespread cortical silence. We demonstrate here that KCs can be quasi-synchronous across scalp EEG and across much of the cortex using electrocorticography (ECOG) and localized transcortical recordings (bipolar SEEG). We examine the mechanism of synchronous KC production by creating the first conductance based thalamocortical network model of N2 sleep to generate both spontaneous spindles and KCs. Spontaneous KCs are only observed when the model includes diffuse projections from restricted prefrontal areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus (RE), consistent with recent anatomical findings in rhesus monkeys. Modeled KCs begin with a spontaneous focal depolarization of the prefrontal neurons, followed by depolarization of the RE. Surprisingly, the RE depolarization leads to decreased firing due to disrupted spindling, which in turn is due to depolarization-induced inactivation of the low-threshold Ca2+ current (I-T). Further, although the RE inhibits thalamocortical (TC) neurons, decreased RE firing causes decreased TC cell firing, again because of disrupted spindling. The resulting abrupt removal of excitatory input to cortical pyramidal neurons then leads to the downstate. Empirically, KCs may also be evoked by sensory stimuli while maintaining sleep. We reproduce this phenomenon in the model by depolarization of either the RE or the widely-projecting prefrontal neurons. Again, disruption of thalamic spindling plays a key role. Higher levels of RE stimulation also cause downstates, but by directly inhibiting the TC neurons. SEEG recordings from the thalamus and cortex in a single patient demonstrated the model prediction that thalamic spindling significantly decreases before KC onset. In conclusion, we show empirically that KCs can be widespread quasi-synchronous cortical downstates, and demonstrate with the first model of stage 2 NREM sleep a possible mechanism whereby this widespread synchrony may arise.

Here we want to understand the immediate effects of 1-session NMES on the coherence between brain and muscles and motor performance in patients with stroke. EEG (16 channels) of bilateral sensorimotor cortical area and surface EMG of the stroke-affected flexor pollicis brevis were recorded while the subjects performed a 20-second steady hold contraction at 50% maximal voluntary before and after a 40-minute electrical stimulation session on median nerve. The stimulation (1-ms rectangular pulse, 100 Hz) was delivered with a 20 s-on-20 s-off cycle. The intensity was set at the subjects' highest tolerable level without causing pain. Our preliminary results from 8 stroke subjects (3 in sham-ES group) showed that coherence between contralateral primary motor cortex (hand area) and flexor pollicis brevis muscle increased in lower gamma-band after using NMES. Subjects performed better in force-maintenance task after receiving NMES. Based on our preliminary results, NMES appears to increase corticomuscular coherence and motor performance. Greater gamma-band coherence after repetitive electrical stimulation might indicate enhanced cortical activity level and sensorimotor integration during voluntary motor task.

We used the PDMs to analyze the dynamic transformations of spike train activity from Layer 2 (input) to Layer 5 (output) of the prefrontal cortex in primates performing a Delayed-Match-to-Sample task. The PDM-based models reduce the complexity of representing large-scale neural MIMO systems that involve large numbers of neurons, and also offer the prospect of improved biological/physiological interpretation of the obtained models. PDM analysis of neuronal connectivity in this system revealed "input-output channels of communication" corresponding to specific bands of neural rhythms that quantify the relative importance of these frequency-specific PDMs across a variety of different tasks. We found that behavioral performance during the Delayed-Match-to-Sample task (correct vs. incorrect outcome) was associated with differential activation of frequency-specific PDMs in the prefrontal cortex.

It consists of the perception of 2 visual stimuli upon the presentation of a single visual stimulus alongside 2 auditory stimuli. We used magnetoencephalography to assess the influence of prestimulus oscillatory activity on varying the perception of invariant stimuli. We compared cortical activity from trials in which subjects perceived an illusion with trials in which subjects did not perceive the illusion, keeping the stimulation fixed. Subjects perceived the illusion in approximately 50 of trials. Prior to the illusion, we found stronger beta-band power in left temporal sensors, localized to the left middle temporal gyrus. Illusory perceptions were preceded by increased beta-band phase synchrony between the left middle temporal gyrus and auditory areas as well as by decreased phase synchrony with visual areas. Alpha-band phase synchrony between visual and temporal, parietal, and frontal cortical areas as well as alpha-band phase synchrony between auditory and visual areas were modulated. This supports and extends reports on the influence of brain states prior to stimulation on subsequent perception. We suggest that prestimulus local and network activities form predispositions if sensory streams will be integrated.

We here compare the facilitation of visual perception induced by transient (target-synchronized) sounds to the facilitation provided by continuous background noise like sounds. Specifically, we show that continuous acoustic noise improves visual contrast detection by systematically shifting psychometric curves in an amplitude-dependent manner. This multisensory benefit was found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that induced by a transient and target synchronized sound in the same paradigm. Studying the underlying neural mechanisms using electric neuroimaging (EEG), we found that acoustic noise alters occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) power and decreases beta-band (14-20 Hz) coupling of occipital and temporal sites. Task-irrelevant and continuous sounds thereby have an amplitude-dependent effect on cortical mechanisms implicated in shaping visual cortical excitability. The same oscillatory mechanisms also mediate visual facilitation by transient sounds, and our results suggest that task-related sounds and task-irrelevant background noises could induce perceptually and mechanistically similar enhancement of visual perception. Given the omnipresence of sounds and noises in our environment, such multisensory interactions may affect perception in many everyday scenarios.

This network is attracting increasing interest in the AD community, as it seems to play an important role in cognitive functioning and in beta amyloid deposition. Attention has been particularly drawn to how different DMN regions are connected using functional or structural connectivity. To this end, most studies have used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). In this study we evaluated (1) functional connectivity from resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and (2) structural connectivity from DTI in 26 MCI patients and 31 age-matched controls. Compared to controls, the DMN in the MCI group was functionally disrupted in the alpha band, while no differences were found for delta, theta, beta and gamma frequency bands. In addition, structural disconnection could be assessed through a decreased fractional anisotropy along tracts connecting different DMN regions. This suggests that the DMN functional and anatomical disconnection could represent a core feature of MCI. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Theta Dynamics in Rat: Speed and Acceleration across the Septotemporal Axis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; VESTIBULAR LESIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; RUNNING SPEED; SLOW WAVES; RHYTHM; EEG; FREQUENCY; BEHAVIOR; NEURONS	Theta (6-12 Hz) rhythmicity in the local field potential (LFP) reflects a clocking mechanism that brings physically isolated neurons together in time, allowing for the integration and segregation of distributed cell assemblies. Variation in the theta signal has been linked to locomotor speed, sensorimotor integration as well as cognitive processing. Previously, we have characterized the relationship between locomotor speed and theta power and how that relationship varies across the septotemporal (long) axis of the hippocampus (HPC). The current study investigated the relationship between whole body acceleration, deceleration and theta indices at CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) sites along the septotemporal axis of the HPC in rats. Results indicate that whole body acceleration and deceleration predicts a significant amount of variability in the theta signal beyond variation in locomotor speed. Furthermore, deceleration was more predictive of variation in theta amplitude as compared to acceleration as rats traversed a linear track. Such findings highlight key variables that systematically predict the variability in the theta signal across the long axis of the HPC. A better understanding of the relative contribution of these quantifiable variables and their variation as a function of experience and environmental conditions should facilitate our understanding of the relationship between theta and sensorimotor/cognitive functions.

J	Hameroff, S; Penrose, R				Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger			Consciousness in the universe A review of the 'Orch OR' theory	PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS			English	Review							QUANTUM COMPUTATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN MICROTUBULES; CURRENT SITUATION; ENERGY-TRANSFER; GAP-JUNCTIONS; COHERENCE; MODEL; REDUCTION; OSCILLATIONS	The nature of consciousness, the mechanism by which it occurs in the brain, and its ultimate place in the universe are unknown. We proposed in the mid 1990's that consciousness depends on biologically 'orchestrated' coherent quantum processes in collections of microtubules within brain neurons, that these quantum processes correlate with, and regulate, neuronal synaptic and membrane activity, and that the continuous Schrodinger evolution of each such process terminates in accordance with the specific Diosi-Penrose (DP) scheme of 'objective reduction' ('OR') of the quantum state. This orchestrated OR activity ('Orch OR') is taken to result in moments of conscious awareness and/or choice. The DP form of OR is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and space-time geometry, so Orch OR suggests that there is a connection between the brain's biomolecular processes and the basic structure of the universe. Here we review Orch OR in light of criticisms and developments in quantum biology, neuroscience, physics and cosmology. We also introduce a novel suggestion of 'beat frequencies' of faster microtubule vibrations as a possible source of the observed electro-encephalographic ('EEG') correlates of consciousness. We conclude that consciousness plays an intrinsic role in the universe. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abnormal Early Gamma Responses to Emotional Faces Differentiate Unipolar from Bipolar Disorder Patients	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION; COMPONENTS; EXPLICIT; HUMANS; EEG	This study investigates the cortical abnormalities of early emotion perception in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) using gamma oscillations. Twenty-three MDD patients, twenty-five BD patients, and twenty-four normal controls were enrolled and their event-related magneto encephalographic responses were recorded during implicit emotional tasks. Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions (amygdala, orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex, anterior insula (AI), and superior temporal pole) in the MDD patients, suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity biases in perceptual binding of emotional features at very early stage. Decreased left superior medial frontal cortex (smFC) responses to happy faces in the MDD patients were correlated with their serious level of depression symptoms, indicating that decreased smFC activity perhaps underlies irregular positive emotion processing in depressed patients. In the BD patients, we showed abnormal activation in visual regions (inferior/middle occipital and middle temporal cortices) which responded to emotional faces within 100 ms, supporting that the BD patients may hyperactively respond to emotional features in perceptual binding. The discriminant function of gamma activation in the left smFC, right medial OFC, right AI/inferior OFC, and the right precentral cortex accurately classified 89.6% of patients as unipolar/bipolar disorders.

Event-related mu-rhythm desynchronization during movement observation is impaired in Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Event-related synchronization; Event-related desynchronization; Mu-rhythm; Mirror neuron system	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; BASAL GANGLIA; BETA OSCILLATIONS; L-DOPA; MODULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; CONNECTIVITY; STIMULATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective: Patients with Parkinson's disease often experience difficulties in adapting movements and learning alternative movements to compensate for symptoms. Since observation of movement has been demonstrated to lead to the formation of a lasting specific motor memory that resembled that elicited by physical training we hypothesize that mu-rhythm desynchronization in response to movement observation is impaired in Parkinson's disease. Method: In a pilot study with nine patients with Parkinson's disease at a Hoehn and Yahr stage of I or II and eleven age-matched controls, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the event related desynchronization (ERD) patterns from the EEG recorded during the observation of hand action and baseline videos. Results: Healthy subjects showed normal bilateral ERD of the mu-rhythm. In patients with Parkinson's disease this distinct ERD pattern was lacking. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that event-related mu-rhythm desynchronization is impaired in Parkinson's disease, even at early stages of the disease. Significance: Studying event-related mu-rhythm desynchronization dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients may enhance our understanding of symptoms as impaired motor learning.

Design: Healthy, prepubertal children (n = 63; mean age 9.56 +/- 0.76 y); ambulatory all-night polysomnography (2 nights); investigating the effect of prior learning (word pair association task; experimental night) versus nonlearning (baseline night) on sleep spindle activity; general cognitive abilities assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). Measurements and Results: Analysis of spindle activity during nonrapid eye movement sleep (N2 and N3) evidenced predominant peaks in the slow (11-13 Hz) but not in the fast (13-15 Hz) sleep spindle frequency range (baseline and experimental night). Analyses were restricted to slow sleep spindles. Changes in spindle activity from the baseline to the experimental night were not associated with the overnight change in the number of recalled words reflecting declarative memory consolidation. Children with higher sleep spindle activity as measured at frontal, central, parietal, and occipital sites during both baseline and experimental nights exhibited higher general cognitive abilities (WISC-IV) and declarative learning efficiency (i.e., number of recalled words before and after sleep). Conclusions: Slow sleep spindles (11-13 Hz) in children age 8-11 y are associated with inter-individual differences in general cognitive abilities and learning efficiency.

The Effects of Individualized Theta Burst Stimulation on the Excitability of the Human Motor System	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Cortical plasticity; Primary motor cortex; Electroencephalography	INTERVAL INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTEX EXCITABILITY; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; NETWORKS; INDUCTION; BRAIN; POLYMORPHISM	Background: Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a pattern of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation that has been demonstrated to facilitate or suppress human corticospinal excitability when applied intermittently (iTBS) or continuously (cTBS), respectively. While the fundamental pattern of TBS, consisting of bursts of 50 Hz stimulation repeated at a 5 Hz theta frequency, induces synaptic plasticity in animals and in vitro preparations, the relationship between TBS and underlying cortical firing patterns in the human cortex has not been elucidated. Objective: To compare the effects of 5 Hz iTBS and cTBS with individualized TBS paradigms on corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibitory circuits. Methods: Participants received standard and individualized iTBS (iTBS 5; iTBS I) and cTBS (cTBS 5; cTBS I), and sham TBS, in a randomised design. For individualized paradigms, the 5 Hz theta component of the TBS pattern was replaced by the dominant cortical frequency (4-16 Hz; upper frequency restricted by technical limitations) for each individual. Results: We report that iTBS 5 and iTBS I both significantly facilitated motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude to a similar extent. Unexpectedly, cTBS 5 and cTBS I failed to suppress MEP amplitude. None of the active TBS protocols had any significant effects on intracortical circuits when compared with sham TBS. Conclusion: In summary, iTBS facilitated MEP amplitude, an effect that was not improved by individualizing the theta component of the TBS pattern, while cTBS, a reportedly inhibitory paradigm, produced no change, or facilitation of MEP amplitude in our hands.

Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state,These-equally-important but complementary objectives require differentanalysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming bacicward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Face to phase: pitfalls in time delay estimation from coherency phase	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Coherence; DTF; PDC; Time delay; Phase; Sensory feedback	MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; INFORMATION-FLOW; EEG DATA; MUSCLE; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; AREAS	Coherency phase is often interpreted as a time delay reflecting a transmission delay between spatially separated neural populations. However, time delays estimated from corticomuscular coherency are conflicting and often shorter than expected physiologically. Recent work suggests that corticomuscular coherence is influenced by afferent sensory feedback and bidirectional interactions. We investigated how bidirectional interaction affects time delay estimated from coherency, using a feedback model of the corticomuscular system. We also evaluated the effect of bidirectional interaction on two popular directed connectivity measures: directed transfer function (DTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC). The model is able to reproduce the range of time delays found experimentally from coherency phase by varying the strengths of the efferent and afferent pathways and the recording of sensory feedback in the cortical signal. Both coherency phase and DTF phase were affected by sensory feedback, resulting in an underestimation of the transmission delay. Coherency phase was altered by the recording of sensory feedback in the cortical signals and both measures were affected by the presence of a closed loop feedback system. Only PDC phase led to the correct estimation of efferent transmission delay in all simulated model configurations. Coherency and DTF phase should not be used to estimate transmission delays in neural networks as the estimated time delays are meaningless in the presence of sensory feedback and closed feedback loops.

J	Sakimoto, Y; Sakata, S				Sakimoto, Yuya; Sakata, Shogo			Hippocampal theta activity during behavioral inhibition for conflicting stimuli	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Serial feature negative task; Hippocampal theta activity; Learning; Behavioral inhibition theory; Rat	OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; AMPLITUDE; DECLINE; RHYTHM; RATS; MOVEMENT; URETHANE; POWER; EEG	A recent behavioral inhibitory theory proposed that the hippocampus plays an important role in response inhibition to conflicting stimuli composed of simple inhibitory associations between events embedded in concurrent simple excitatory associations. In addition, the theory states that a serial feature negative (FN) task is a hippocampal-dependent task requiring the formation of a simple inhibitory association; on the other hand, a simple discrimination (SD) task is a typical hippocampus-independent task. In the present study, we recorded hippocampal theta activity from rats during FN and SD tasks to identify any potential differences. In the FN (A+, B -> A-) task used in this study, rats were required to press a lever to present stimulus A (A+) and avoid pressing a lever to present a serial compound stimulus (B -> A-). In the simple discrimination task (A+, B-), rats were required to press a lever to present stimulus A (A+) and avoid pressing a lever to present stimulus B (B-). We observed a transient decline of hippocampal theta power during response inhibition for a serial compound stimulus in the FN task. Thus, we conclude that the transient decline in hippocampal theta power reflects response inhibition for a conflicting stimulus. The results of the present study strongly support the behavioral inhibition theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent research on compressive sensing has shown promising results for sub-Nyquist sampling of sparse biological signals. Still, any large-scale implementation of this technique faces critical issues caused by the increased hardware intensity. The cost of implementing compressive sensing in a multichannel system in terms of area usage can be significantly higher than a conventional data acquisition system without compression. To tackle this issue, a new multichannel compressive sensing scheme which exploits the spatial sparsity of the signals recorded from the electrodes of the sensor array is proposed. The analysis shows that using this method, the power efficiency is preserved to a great extent while the area overhead is significantly reduced resulting in an improved power-area product. The proposed circuit architecture is implemented in a UMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Extensive performance analysis and design optimization has been done resulting in a low-noise, compact and power-efficient implementation. The results of simulations and subsequent reconstructions show the possibility of recovering fourfold compressed intracranial EEG signals with an SNR as high as 21.8 dB, while consuming 10.5 mu W of power within an effective area of 250 mu m x 250 mu m per channel.

On the basis of network characteristics across frequency bands, we provide evidence for the full dissociation of the corresponding cognitive processes. Movement-memory trial types exhibited higher degree nodes during the first 2s of the delay period, mainly at central, left frontal and right-parietal areas. Change detection-memory trial types resulted in a three-peak temporal pattern of the total degree with higher degree nodes emerging mainly at central, right frontal, and occipital areas. Functional connectivity networks resulting from non-memory trial types were characterized by more sparse structures for both tasks. The movement-memory trial types encompassed an apparent coarse flow from frontal to parietal areas while the opposite flow from occipital, parietal to central and frontal areas was evident for the change detection-memory trial types. The differences among tasks and conditions were more profound in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) and less in gamma (30-45 Hz) band. Our results favor the hypothesis which considers spatial working memory as a by-product of specific mental processes that engages common brain areas under different network organizations.

J	Sela, I				Sela, Itamar			Visual and auditory synchronization deficits among dyslexic readers as compared to non-impaired readers: a cross-correlation algorithm analysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dyslexia; asynchrony; crossmodal integration; EEG; ERP; cross-correlation analysis	MODAL BINDING; SPECIAL-ISSUE; SPEECH; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; RESPONSES; PRINT; DISCRIMINATION; OSCILLATIONS	Visual and auditory temporal processing and crossmodal integration are crucial factors in the word decoding process. The speed of processing (SOP) gap (Asynchrony) between these two modalities, which has been suggested as related to the dyslexia phenomenon, is the focus of the current study. Nineteen dyslexic and 17 non-impaired University adult readers were given stimuli in a reaction time (RT) procedure where participants were asked to identify whether the stimulus type was only visual, only auditory or crossmodally integrated. Accuracy, RT, and Event Related Potential (ERP) measures were obtained for each of the three conditions. An algorithm to measure the contribution of the temporal SOP of each modality to the crossmodal integration in each group of participants was developed. Results obtained using this model for the analysis of the current study data, indicated that in the crossmodal integration condition the presence of the auditory modality at the pre-response time frame (between 170 and 240 ms after stimulus presentation), increased processing speed in the visual modality among the non-impaired readers, but not in the dyslexic group. The differences between the temporal SOP of the modalities among the dyslexics and the non-impaired readers give additional support to the theory that an asynchrony between the visual and auditory modalities is a cause of dyslexia.

Using magneto-encephalogram (MEG) signals, the authors investigate differences of complexity of functional connectivity network between MCI and normal elderly subjects during a working memory task. Methods: MEGs are obtained from 18 right handed patients with MCI and 19 age-matched elderly participants without cognitive impairment used as the control group. The brain networks' complexities are measured by Graph Index Complexity (C-r) and Efficiency Complexity (C-e). Results: The results obtained by both measurements show complexity of functional networks involved in the working memory function in MCI subjects is reduced at alpha and theta bands compared with subjects with control subjects, and at the theta band this reduction is more pronounced in the whole brain and intra left hemisphere. Conclusions: Ce would be a better measurement for showing the global differences between normal and MCI brains compared with Cr. Significance: The high accuracy of the classification shows Ce at theta band can be used as an index for assessing deficits associated with working memory, a good biomarker for diagnosis of MCI.

Considerable research demonstrates electrophysiological differences between correct and incorrect feedback, but how we learn from small versus large errors is usually overlooked. This study investigated electrophysiological differences when processing small or large error feedback during a time estimation task. Data from high-learners and low-learners were analyzed separately. In both high- and low-learners, large error feedback was associated with higher feedback-related negativity (FRN) and small error feedback was associated with a larger P300 and increased amplitude over the motor related areas of the left hemisphere. In addition, small error feedback induced larger desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands with distinctly different topographies between the two learning groups: The high-learners showed a more localized decrease in beta power over the left frontocentral areas, and the low-learners showed a widespread reduction in the alpha power following small error feedback. Furthermore, only the high-learners showed an increase in phase synchronization between the midfrontal and left central areas. Importantly, this synchronization was correlated to how well the participants consolidated the estimation of the time interval. Thus, although large errors were associated with higher FRN, small errors were associated with larger oscillatory responses, which was more evident in the high-learners. Altogether, our results suggest an important role of the motor areas in the processing of error feedback for skill consolidation.

Here, potential alterations of oscillatory activity in the somatosensory system were investigated. Methods: 21 patients with liver cirrhosis and varying HE severity and 7 control subjects received electrical stimulation of the right median nerve while brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Oscillatory activity within the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its stimulus-induced modulation were analyzed as a function of disease severity. Results: Median nerve stimuli evoked an early broadband power increase followed by suppression and then rebound of S1 alpha and beta activity. Increasing HE severity as quantified by the critical flicker frequency (CFF) was associated with a slowing of the alpha peak frequency and a delay of the alpha rebound. Conclusion: The present results provide the first evidence for a slowing of oscillatory activity in the somatosensory system in HE in combination with a previously unknown deficit of S1 in adjusting activation levels back to baseline. Significance: These findings advance the understanding of the manifold symptoms of HE by strengthening the theory that disease related slowing of oscillatory brain activity also affects the somatosensory system.

Here we aim to explore brain disturbances underlying extraversion and neuroticism in 87 healthy individuals using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two different frequency bands, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) exhibiting higher power and involving larger brain regions, and Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) exhibiting less power and emerging locally, were analyzed. Our results showed a positive correlation between LFF amplitude at Slow-5 and extraversion in medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, important portions of the default mode network, thus suggesting a link between default network activity and personality traits. LFF amplitude at Slow-5 was correlated positively with neuroticism in right posterior portion of the frontal lobe, further validating neuroticism with frontal lateralization. In addition, LFF amplitude at Slow-4 was negatively associated with extraversion and neuroticism in left hippocampus (HIP) and bilateral superior temporal cortex (STC) respectively, supporting the hypothesized (inverse) relationship between extraversion and resting arousal, also implying neural circuit underlying emotional process influencing on personality. Overall, these findings suggest the important relationships, between personality and LFF amplitude dynamic, depend on specific frequency bands. Hum Brain Mapp 35:331-339, 2014.

Subdivisions within prefrontal cortex are implicated to encode attentional task sets and to update changing task rules, particularly when changing task demands require top-down control. Here, we tested whether these top-down processes precede stimulus processing and constitute a preparatory attentional state that functionally couples with parietal cortex. We examined this functional coupling by recording from intracranial EEG electrodes in macaques during performance of a task-switching paradigm that separates task performance that is based on controlled top-down guidance from automatic, stimulus-triggered processing modes. We identify a prefrontal-parietal network that phase synchronizes at 5-10 Hz, particularly during preparatory states that indicate top-down controlled task-processing modes. Phase relations in the network suggest that medial and lateral prefrontal cortices synchronize bidirectionally, with medial prefrontal cortex showing a phase-lead relative to left parietal recorded 5- to 10-Hz preparatory signals. These findings reveal a 5- to 10-Hz coordinated, long-range fronto-parietal network prior to actual task-relevant stimulus processing, particularly when subjects engage in controlled task processing modes.

Recent advances in understanding how each of the epileptic zones is functionally organized strengthened the importance of the network concept. It has been shown that neuronal networks underlying the individual epileptic zone may involve multiple brain structures with complex interactions between them. The network concept has impact not only for better understanding of pathophysiology of partial epilepsy but also for clinical practice, particularly for epilepsy surgery. This review examines recent reports on the use of advanced imaging techniques which enable to map the epileptic zones and their structural and functional organization. Magnetic resonance postprocessing substantially improved the accuracy in detection of the epileptogenic lesions. The seizure-onset zone is primarily determined by electrophysiology but can also be localized using single photon emission computed tomography. The functional deficit zone is commonly assessed by a number of tests including methods of functional neuroimaging (positron emission tomography) which can delineate hypometabolic cortical areas and subcortical structures. Hemodynamic fluctuations associated with interictal epileptiform discharges can be detected by novel functional magnetic resonance technique which is nowadays widely used for the irritative zone localization. These techniques open new prospect for epilepsy surgery in patients who were previously considered as not suitable candidates of surgical treatment.

CONTRIBUTION OF I-h TO THE RELATIVE FACILITATION OF SYNAPTIC RESPONSES INDUCED BY CARBACHOL IN THE ENTORHINAL CORTEX DURING REPETITIVE STIMULATION OF THE PARASUBICULUM	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						parasubiculum; entorhinal cortex; acetylcholine; I-h; IKir; NMDA	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; LAYER-II; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; DENDRITIC EXCITABILITY; MUSCARINIC MODULATION; POSTRHINAL CORTICES; HCN CHANNELS; THETA; RAT	Neurons in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex provide the hippocampus with the majority of its cortical sensory input, and also receive the major output projection from the parasubiculum. This puts the parasubiculum in a position to modulate the activity of entorhinal neurons that project to the hippocampus. These brain areas receive cholinergic projections that are active during periods of theta- and gamma-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate how cholinergic receptor activation affects the strength of repetitive synaptic responses at these frequencies in the parasubiculo-entorhinal pathway and the cellular mechanisms involved. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of rat layer II medial entorhinal neurons were conducted using an acute slice preparation, and responses to 5-pulse trains of stimulation at theta- and gamma-frequency delivered to the parasubiculum were recorded. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed the amplitude of single synaptic responses, but also produced a relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during stimulation trains. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker APV did not significantly reduce the relative facilitation effect. However, the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (I-h) channel blocker ZD7288 mimicked the relative facilitation induced by CCh, suggesting that CCh-induced inhibition of Ih could produce the effect by increasing dendritic input resistance (Rin). Inward-rectifying and leak K+ currents are known to interact with Ih to affect synaptic excitability. Application of the K+ channel antagonist Ba2+ depolarized neurons and enhanced temporal summation, but did not block further facilitation of train-evoked responses by ZD7288. The I-h-dependent facilitation of synaptic responses can therefore occur during reductions in inward-rectifying potassium current (IKir) associated with dendritic depolarization. Thus, in addition to cholinergic reductions in transmitter release that are known to facilitate train-evoked responses, these findings emphasize the role of inhibition of I-h in the integration of synaptic inputs within the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically-induced oscillatory states, likely due to enhanced summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced by increases in dendritic Rin.

In the quiet conditions, a single speech stream was presented and the subjects paid attention to the speech stream (active listening) or watched a silent movie instead (passive listening). In the competing speaker (CS) conditions, two speakers of opposite genders were presented diotically. Ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were measured in each condition and cross-correlated with the speech envelope of each speaker at different time lags. In quiet, active and passive listening resulted in similar neural responses to the speech envelope. In the CS conditions, however, the shape of the cross-correlation function was remarkably different between the attended and unattended speech. The cross-correlation with the attended speech showed stronger N1 and P2 responses but a weaker P1 response compared to the cross-correlation with the unattended speech. Furthermore, the N1 response to the attended speech in the CS condition was enhanced and delayed compared with the active listening condition in quiet, while the P2 response to the unattended speaker in the CS condition was attenuated compared with the passive listening in quiet. Taken together, these results demonstrate that top-down attention differentially modulates envelope-tracking neural activity at different time lags and suggest that top-down attention can both enhance the neural responses to the attended sound stream and suppress the responses to the unattended sound stream.

Schizophrenia can also be characterized by a functional abnormality of the brain activity that is reflected in the resting state. Oscillatory analysis provides an important understanding of resting brain activity. However, conventional methods using electroencephalography are restricted because of low spatial resolution, despite their excellent temporal resolution. The aim of this study was to investigate resting brain oscillation and the default mode network based on a source space in various frequency bands such as theta, alpha, beta, and gamma using magnetoencephalography. In addition, we investigated whether these resting and DMN activities could distinguish schizophrenia patients from normal controls. To do this, the power spectral density of each frequency band at rest was imaged and compared on a spatially normalized brain template in 20 patients and 20 controls. Results: The spatial distribution of DMN activity in the alpha band was similar to that found in previous fMRI studies. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and lateral inferior parietal cortex were activated at rest, while the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was deactivated at rest rather than during the task. Although the MPFC and PCC regions exhibited contrasting activation patterns, these two regions were significantly coherent at rest. The DMN and resting activities of the PCC were increased in schizophrenia patients, predominantly in the theta and alpha bands. Conclusions: By using MEG to identify the DMN regions, predominantly in the alpha band, we found that both resting and DMN activities were augmented in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased coherence between the PCC and MPFC in the gamma band at rest.

Magnetoencephalographic Signatures of Right Prefrontal Cortex Involvement in Response Inhibition	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						event-related fields; executive function; magnetoencephalography; prefrontal cortex; oscillatory activity	GO/NO-GO TASKS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PHASE; AREA; EEG; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; ATTENTION	The prefrontal cortex has a pivotal role in top-down control of cognitive and sensory functions. In complex go-nogo tasks, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is considered to be important for guiding the response inhibition. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics and neurophysiological nature of this activity. To address this issue, we recorded magnetoencephalographic brain activity in 20 women during a visual go-nogo task. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed an increase for the amplitude of the event-related fields and an increase in induced alpha frequency band activity for nogo in comparison to go trials. The peak of this prefrontal activity preceded the mean reaction time of around 360 ms for go trials, and thus supports the proposed role of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in gating the response inhibition and further suggests that right prefrontal alpha band activity might be involved in this gating. However, the results in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were similar for both successful and unsuccessful response inhibition. In these conditions, we instead observed pre- and poststimulus differences in alpha band activity in occipital and central areas. Thus, successful response inhibition seemed to additionally depend on prestimulus anticipatory alpha desynchronization in sensory areas as it was reduced prior to unsuccessful response inhibition. In conclusion, we suggest a role for functional inhibition by alpha synchronization not only in sensory, but also in prefrontal areas. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5236-5248, 2014.

To create or to recall? Neural mechanisms underlying the generation of creative new ideas	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Creativity; fMRI; Human cognition; Memory retrieval; Inferior parietal cortex	EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DIVERGENT THINKING; EPISODIC MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SYSTEM; COMMON; TIME; INTELLIGENCE; OSCILLATIONS	This fMRI study investigated brain activation during creative idea generation using a novel approach allowing spontaneous self-paced generation and expression of ideas. Specifically, we addressed the fundamental question of what brain processes are relevant for the generation of genuinely new creative ideas, in contrast to the mere recollection of old ideas from memory. In general, creative idea generation (i.e., divergent thinking) was associated with extended activations in the left prefrontal cortex and the right medial temporal lobe, and with deactivation of the right temporoparietal junction. The generation of new ideas, as opposed to the retrieval of old ideas, was associated with stronger activation in the left inferior parietal cortex which is known to be involved in mental simulation, imagining, and future thought. Moreover, brain activation in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyms was found to increase as a function of the creativity (Le., originality and appropriateness) of ideas pointing to the role of executive processes for overcoming dominant but uncreative responses. We conclude that the process of idea generation can be generally understood as a state of focused internally-directed attention involving controlled semantic retrieval. Moreover, left inferior parietal cortex and left prefrontal regions may subserve the flexible integration of previous knowledge for the construction of new and creative ideas. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Despite the ongoing efforts to improve the treatment for this condition, a trial-and-error approach until an individually effective treatment is established still dominates clinical practice. Searching for clinically useful treatment response predictors is one of the most promising strategies to change this quandary therapeutic situation. This study evaluated the predictive value of a biological and a clinical predictor, as well as a combination of both. Pretreatment EEGs of 31 patients with a major depressive episode were analyzed with neuroelectric brain imaging technique to assess cerebral oscillations related to treatment response. Early improvement of symptoms served as a clinical predictor. Treatment response was assessed after 4 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Responders showed more slow-frequency power in the right anterior cingulate cortex compared to non-responders. Slow-frequency power in this region was found to predict response with good sensitivity (82 %) and specificity (100 %), while early improvement showed lower accuracy (73 % sensitivity and 65 % specificity). Combining both parameters did not further improve predictive accuracy. Pretreatment activity within the anterior cingulate cortex is related to antidepressive treatment response. Our results support the search for biological treatment response predictors using electric brain activity. This technique is advantageous due to its low individual and socioeconomic burden. The benefits of combining both, a clinically and a biologically based predictor, should be further evaluated using larger sample sizes.

The primary somatosensory cortex contributes to the latest part of the cortical response elicited by nociceptive somatosensory stimuli in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); Nociceptive system; Functional microstate analysis; Primary somatosensory cortex (S1)	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; A DIRECT; AFFERENTS; ERPS; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS	Nociceptive laser pulses elicit temporally-distinct cortical responses (the N1, N2 and P2 waves of laser-evoked potentials, LEPs) mainly reflecting the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contralateral to the stimulated side, and of the bilateral operculoinsular and cingulate cortices. Here, by performing two different EEG experiments and applying a range of analysis approaches (microstate analysis, scalp topography, single-trial estimation), we describe a distinct component in the last part of the human LEP response (P4 wave). We obtained three main results. First, the LEP is reliably decomposed in four main and distinct functional microstates, corresponding to the N1, N2, P2, and P4 waves, regardless of stimulus territory. Second, the scalp and source configurations of the P4 wave follow a clear somatotopical organization, indicating that this response is likely to be partly generated in contralateral Sl. Third, single-trial latencies and amplitudes of the P4 are tightly coupled with those of the N1, and are similarly sensitive to experimental manipulations (e.g., to crossing the hands over the body midline), suggesting that the P4 and N1 may have common neural sources. These results indicate that the P4 wave is a clear and distinct LEP component, which should be considered in LEP studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the brain response to nociceptive stimulation.

Patients are considered to have refractory epilepsy if disabling seizures continue despite appropriate trials of two antiseizure drugs, either alone or in combination. At this point, patients should be referred to multidisciplinary epilepsy centers that perform specialized diagnostic testing to first determine whether they are, in fact, pharmacoresistant, and then, if so, offer alternative treatments. Apparent pharmacoresistance can result from a variety of situations, including noncompliance, seizures that are not epileptic, misdiagnosis of the seizure type or epilepsy syndrome, inappropriate use of medication, and lifestyle issues. For patients who are pharmacoresistant, surgical treatment offers the best opportunity for complete freedom from seizures. Surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes have been identified, but patients with more complicated epilepsy can also benefit from surgical treatment and require more specialized evaluation, including intracranial EEG monitoring. For patients who are not surgical candidates, or who are unwilling to consider surgery, a variety of other alternative treatments can be considered, including peripheral or central neurostimulation, ketogenic diet, and complementary and alternative approaches. When such alternative treatments are not appropriate or effective, quality of life can still be greatly improved by the psychological and social support services offered by multidisciplinary epilepsy centers. A major obstacle remains the fact that only a small proportion of patients with refractory epilepsy are referred for expert evaluation and treatment.

However, little is known about the consistency of MEG RSNs at the individual level. This paper investigates the inter- and intra-subject variability of three MEG RSNs (sensorimotor, auditory and visual) using seed-based source space envelope correlation analysis applied to 5 min of resting state MEG data acquired from a 306-channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer (Elekta Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and source projected with minimum norm estimation. The main finding is that these three MEG RSNs exhibit substantial variability at the single-subject level across and within individuals, which depends on the RSN type, but can be reduced after averaging over subjects or sessions. Over- and under-estimations of true RSNs variability are respectively obtained using template seeds, which are potentially mislocated due to inter-subject variations, and a seed optimization method minimizing variability. In particular, bounds on the minimal number of subjects or sessions required to obtain highly consistent between- or within-subject averages of MEG RSNs are derived. Furthermore, MEG RSN topography positively correlates with their mean connectivity at the inter-subject level. These results indicate that MEG RSNs associated with primary cortices can be robustly extracted from seed-based envelope correlation and adequate averaging. MEG thus appears to be a valid technique to compare RSNs across subjects or conditions, at least when using the current methods.

The objective of the present study was to investigate macroscopic (EEG) oscillatory brain response patterns that contribute to an auditory (Zwicker tone, if) illusion. Three different analysis approaches were chosen: 1) a parametric variation of the ZT illusion intensity via three different notch widths of the ZT-inducing noise; 2) contrasts of high-versus-low-intensity ZT illusion trials, excluding physical stimuli differences; 3) a representational similarity analysis to relate source activity patterns to loudness ratings. Depending on the analysis approach, levels of alpha to beta activity (10-20 Hz) reflected illusion intensity, mainly defined by reduced power levels co-occurring with stronger percepts. Consistent across all analysis approaches, source level analysis implicated auditory cortices as main generators, providing evidence that the activity level in the alpha and beta range - at least in part - contributes to the strength of the illusory auditory percept. This study corroborates the notion that alpha to beta activity in the auditory cortex is linked to functionally similar states, as has been proposed for visual, somatosensory and motor regions. Furthermore, our study provides certain theoretical implications for pathological auditory conscious perception (tinnitus). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

New method: We record electrophysiological signals using a novel high-density micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) grid that covers almost the whole somatosensory system. We dealt with the well-known difficulty that the rat uses its whisker system in an active (motor-controlled) way to explore its environment by designing a head-mounted device that stimulates the rat's snout in a way unaffected by whisker movements. Results: We replicate the spatial specificity of early evoked responses in somatosensory and auditory cortex. In a companion paper (Cognitive Neurophysiology in Rats, Part 2: Validation and Demonstration) we validate our setup and show for the first time that the ECoG can be used to record evoked responses in a signal that reflects neural output (spiking activity). Comparison with existing methods: Compared with high-density wire recordings, micro-ECoG offers a much more stable signal without readjustments, and a much better scalability. Compared with head-fixed preparations, our head-mounted stimulator allows to stay closer to the rat's natural way of collecting sensory information. Conclusions: For perceptual and cognitive research, our setup provides a unique combination of possibilities that cannot be achieved in other setups for rodents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To study the neural correlates of congenital prosopagnosia, we measured the face-sensitive N170 component of the event-related potential in three members of the same family (father (56 y), son (25 y) and daughter (22 y)) and in age-matched neurotypical participants (young controls: n = 14; 24.5 y +/- 2.1; old controls: n = 6; 57.3 y +/- 5.4). To compare the face sensitivity of N170 in congenital prosopagnosic and neurotypical participants we measured the event-related potentials for faces and phase-scrambled random noise stimuli. In neurotypicals we found significantly larger N170 amplitude for faces compared to noise stimuli, reflecting normal early face processing. The congenital prosopagnosic participants, by contrast, showed reduced face sensitivity of the N170, and this was due to a larger than normal noise-elicited N170, rather than to a smaller face-elicited N170. Interestingly, single-trial analysis revealed that the lack of face sensitivity in congenital prosopagnosia is related to a larger oscillatory power and phase-locking in the theta frequency-band (4-7 Hz, 130-190 ms) as well as to a lower intertrial jitter of the response latency for the noise stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that congenital prosopagnosia is due to the deficit of early, structural encoding steps of face perception in filtering between face and non-face stimuli.

Methods: We designed a controllable near-field LTE RF-EMF exposure environment. Eighteen subjects participated in a double-blind, crossover, randomized and counterbalanced experiment including two sessions (real and sham exposure). The radiation source was close to the right ear. Then the resting state fMRI signals of human brain were collected before and after the exposure in both sessions. We measured the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) to characterize the spontaneous brain activity. Results: We found the decreased ALFF value around in left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus and right paracentral lobule after the real exposure. And the decreased fALFF value was also detected in right medial frontal gyrus and right paracentral lobule. Conclusions: The study provided the evidences that 30 min LTE RF-EMF exposure modulated the spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in some brain regions. Significance: With resting state fMRI, we found the alteration of spontaneous low frequency fluctuations induced by the acute LTE RF-EMF exposure.

J	Abeles, IY; Gomez-Ramirez, M				Abeles, Ilana Y.; Gomez-Ramirez, Manuel			Impairments in Background and Event-Related Alpha-Band Oscillatory Activity in Patients with Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL EVOKED-RESPONSE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Studies show that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired responses to sensory stimuli, especially at the early stages of neural processing. In particular, patients' alpha-band (8-14 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) and visual P1 event-related potential (ERP) component tend to be significantly reduced, with P1 ERP deficits greater for visual stimuli biased towards the magnocellular system. In healthy controls, studies show that pre-stimulus alpha (background alpha) plays a pivotal role in sensory processing and behavior, largely by shaping the neural responses to incoming stimuli. Here, we address whether patients' ERD and P1 deficits stem from impairments in pre-stimulus alpha mechanisms. To address this question we recorded electrophysiological activity in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while they engaged in a visual discrimination task with low, medium, and high contrast stimuli. The results revealed a significant decrease in patients' ERDs, which was largely driven by reductions in pre-stimulus alpha. These reductions were most prominent in right-hemispheric areas. We also observed a systematic relationship between pre-stimulus alpha and the P1 component across different contrast levels. However, this relationship was only observed in healthy controls. Taken together, these findings highlight a substantial anomaly in patients' amplitude-based alpha background activity over visual areas. The results provide further support that pre-stimulus alpha activity plays an active role in perception by modulating the neural responses to incoming sensory inputs, a mechanism that seems to be compromised in schizophrenia.

Modulation of early cortical processing during divided attention to non-contiguous locations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha-band oscillations; EEG; event-related potential; spatial attention; spotlight; visual evoked potential (VEP)	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; ZOOM LENS; SUPPRESSION; SHIFTS; MECHANISMS; INCREASES; SERIAL; SPACE; FIELD; COMPONENTS	We often face the challenge of simultaneously attending to multiple non-contiguous regions of space. There is ongoing debate as to how spatial attention is divided under these situations. Whereas, for several years, the predominant view was that humans could divide the attentional spotlight, several recent studies argue in favor of a unitary spotlight that rhythmically samples relevant locations. Here, this issue was addressed by the use of high-density electrophysiology in concert with the multifocal m-sequence technique to examine visual evoked responses to multiple simultaneous streams of stimulation. Concurrently, we assayed the topographic distribution of alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms, a measure of attentional suppression. Participants performed a difficult detection task that required simultaneous attention to two stimuli in contiguous (undivided) or non-contiguous parts of space. In the undivided condition, the classic pattern of attentional modulation was observed, with increased amplitude of the early visual evoked response and increased alpha amplitude ipsilateral to the attended hemifield. For the divided condition, early visual responses to attended stimuli were also enhanced, and the observed multifocal topographic distribution of alpha suppression was in line with the divided attention hypothesis. These results support the existence of divided attentional spotlights, providing evidence that the corresponding modulation occurs during initial sensory processing time-frames in hierarchically early visual regions, and that suppressive mechanisms of visual attention selectively target distracter locations during divided spatial attention.

Despite the recent increase of interest in network approaches derived from graph theory on epilepsy, resting state network analysis of the FCD brain has not been adequately investigated. In this study, we investigated the difference in the resting state functional network between epilepsy patients with FCD and healthy controls using whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Methods: Global mutual information (MIglob) and global efficiency (E-glob) were calculated for theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-45 Hz) bands in 35 epilepsy patients with FCD and 23 healthy controls. Results: Resting state FCD brains had stronger functional connectivity (MIglob) in the beta and gamma bands and higher functional efficiency (E-glob) in the beta and gamma bands than those of the controls (p < 0.05). The MIglob and E-glob values of FCD type I and II brains in the beta band were higher than those of healthy control brains (p < 0.05). In the gamma band, the values of FCD type II brains were higher than those of control and FCD type I brains (p < 0.05). Conclusions: FCD brains had increased functional connectivity in the beta and gamma frequency bands at the resting state compared with those in healthy controls. In addition, patients exhibited different network characteristics depending on the type of FCD. The resting state network analysis could be useful in a clinical setting because we observed network differences even when there was no prominent interictal spike activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that in this condition the connectivity patterns are altered in the resting state and during cognitive tasks, where an extra effort seems to be necessary to overcome cognitive decline. We aimed to determine the functional connectivity pattern required to deal with an internally directed cognitive state (IDICS) in healthy aging and MCI. This task differs from the most commonly employed ones in neurophysiology, since inhibition from external stimuli is needed, allowing the study of this control mechanism. To this end, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were acquired from 32 healthy individuals and 38 MCI patients, both in resting state and while performing a subtraction task of two levels of difficulty. Functional connectivity was assessed with phase locking value (PLV) in five frequency bands. Compared to controls, MCIs showed higher PLV values in delta, theta, and gamma bands and an opposite pattern in alpha, beta, and gamma bands in resting state. These changes were associated with poorer neuropsychological performance. During the task, this group exhibited a hypersynchronization in delta, theta, beta, and gamma bands, which was also related to a lower cognitive performance, suggesting an abnormal functioning in this group. Contrary to controls, MCIs presented a lack of synchronization in the alpha band which may denote an inhibition deficit. Additionally, the magnitude of connectivity changes rose with the task difficulty in controls but not in MCIs, in line with the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH) model.

JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						action observation; F5; mirror neurons; repetition suppression	EXECUTION; BRAIN; PREMOTOR; CORTEX; AREAS; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; REPETITION; GRASP; EEG	Mirror neurons were first discovered in area F5 of macaque monkeys. In humans, noninvasive studies have demonstrated an increased blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in homologous motor areas during action observation. One approach to demonstrating that this indicates the existence of mirror neurons in humans has been to employ functional (f)MRI adaptation to test whether the same population of neurons is active during both observation and execution conditions. Although a number of human studies have reported fMRI adaptation in these areas, a recent study has shown that macaque mirror neurons do not attenuate their firing rate with two repetitions. Here we investigated whether mirror neurons modulate their firing rate when monkeys observed the same repeated natural action multiple times. We recorded from 67 mirror neurons in area F5 of two macaque monkeys while they observed an experimenter perform a reach-tograsp action on a small food reward using a precision grip. Although no changes were detectable for the first two repetitions, we show that both the firing rate and the latency at which mirror neurons discharged during observation were subtly modulated by the repetition of the observed action over 7-10 trials. Significant adaption was mostly found in the period immediately before the grasp was performed. We also found that the local field potential activity in F5 (beta-frequency range, 16-23 Hz), which is attenuated during action observation, also showed systematic changes with repeated observation. These LFP changes occurred well in advance of the mirror neuron adaptation. We conclude that macaque mirror neurons can show intra-modal adaptation, but whether this is related to fMRI adaptation of the BOLD signal requires further investigation.	[Kilner, J.

Here, we tested whether this alpha modulation facilitates the processing of attended faces in the presence of distracters. Face processing was tested in a match-to-sample task, in which participants matched a target face in a cued hemifield to a previously seen sample face. The target faces in the cued hemifield were presented together with a distracter face (intact or scrambled faces) in the other hemifield. The behavioral data indicated a larger impairment of matching performance when the distracter was another face, rather than a scrambled face. We hypothesized that enhanced alpha power contralateral to the distracter would enhance target matching by decreasing the interference from similar distracters. We found this effect, but only in the left hemisphere. Moreover, we found that with targets contralateral from the left hemisphere, a down-regulation of relative alpha power in the left hemisphere also correlated with increased target matching performance. Hence, the left hemisphere could protect the target from distracter interference either by decreasing alpha power in response to a contralateral target, or increasing alpha power to a contralateral distracter. Remarkably, alpha power in the right hemisphere was not predictive for matching performance. These findings support the hypothesis that alpha modulations contribute to the suppression of task-irrelevant information, but suggest a dominant role herein of the left hemisphere during face matching in the presence of distracters.

In particular, facilitation and inhibition of information processing are basic functions of selective attention. Such mechanisms can be investigated by analyzing brain potentials under conditions of externally directed attention (intake of environmental information) versus internally directed attention (rejection of environmental stimuli and focusing on memory/planning processes). This study investigated brain direct current (DC) potential shifts-which are discussed to represent different states of cortical activation-of tasks that require intake and rejection of environmental information under noise. It was hypothesized that without background noise rejection tasks would show more positive DC potential changes compared to intake tasks and that under noise both kinds of tasks would show positive DC shifts as an expression of cortical inhibition caused by noise. DC potential shifts during intake and rejection tasks were analyzed at 16 standard locations in 45 persons during irrelevant speech or white noise vs. control condition. Without noise, rejection tasks were associated with more positive DC potential changes compared to intake tasks. During background noise, however, this difference disappeared and both kinds of tasks led to positive DC shifts. Results suggest-besides some limitations-that noise modulates selective attention mechanisms by switching to an environmental information processing and noise rejection mode, which could represent a suggested "attention shift". Implications for fMRI studies as well as for public health in learning and performance environments including susceptible persons are discussed.

A thalamo-cortical neural mass model for the simulation of brain rhythms during sleep	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural mass model; Thalamus; Sleep; Burst firing; Spindle; Slow wave sleep	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; THALAMIC NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; EPILEPSY; CORTEX; STATES; EEG	Cortico-thalamic interactions are known to play a pivotal role in many brain phenomena, including sleep, attention, memory consolidation and rhythm generation. Hence, simple mathematical models that can simulate the dialogue between the cortex and the thalamus, at a mesoscopic level, have a great cognitive value. In the present work we describe a neural mass model of a cortico-thalamic module, based on neurophysiological mechanisms. The model includes two thalamic populations (a thalamo-cortical relay cell population, TCR, and its related thalamic reticular nucleus, TRN), and a cortical column consisting of four connected populations (pyramidal neurons, excitatory interneurons, inhibitory interneurons with slow and fast kinetics). Moreover, thalamic neurons exhibit two firing modes: bursting and tonic. Finally, cortical synapses among pyramidal neurons incorporate a disfacilitation mechanism following prolonged activity. Simulations show that the model is able to mimic the different patterns of rhythmic activity in cortical and thalamic neurons (beta and alpha waves, spindles, delta waves, K-complexes, slow sleep waves) and their progressive changes from wakefulness to deep sleep, by just acting on modulatory inputs. Moreover, simulations performed by providing short sensory inputs to the TCR show that brain rhythms during sleep preserve the cortex from external perturbations, still allowing a high cortical activity necessary to drive synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. In perspective, the present model may be used within larger cortico-thalamic networks, to gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms beneath synaptic changes during sleep, to investigate the specific role of brain rhythms, and to explore cortical synchronization achieved via thalamic influences.

Evidence reveals how healthy aging depends on three main behavioral factors: social lifestyle, cognitive activity, and physical activity. In this study, we focused on the role of cognitive activity, concentrating specifically on educational and occupational attainment factors, which were considered two of the main pillars of cognitive reserve (CR). Twenty-one subjects with similar rates of social lifestyle, physical and cognitive activity were selected from a sample of 55 healthy adults. These subjects were divided into two groups according to their level of CR; one group comprised subjects with high CR (9 members) and the other one contained those with low CR (12 members). To evaluate the cortical brain connectivity network, all participants were recorded by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed a memory task (modified version of the Sternberg's Task). We then applied two algorithms [Phase Locking Value (PLV) and Phase Lag Index (PLO] to study the dynamics of functional connectivity. In response to the same task, the subjects with lower CR presented higher functional connectivity than those with higher CR. These results may indicate that participants with low CR needed a greater "effort" than those with high CR to achieve the same level of cognitive performance. Therefore, we conclude that CR contributes to the modulation of the functional connectivity patterns of the aging brain.	[Lopez, Maria.

Different patterns of local field potentials from limbic DBS targets in patients with major depressive and obsessive compulsive disorder	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						alpha oscillations; deep brain stimulation; depressive disorder; local field potential; obsessive compulsive disorder	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; EEG ALPHA ASYMMETRY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; CINGULATE; DESYNCHRONIZATION	The role of distinct limbic areas in emotion regulation has been largely inferred from neuroimaging studies. Recently, the opportunity for intracranial recordings from limbic areas has arisen in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we test the hypothesis that distinct temporal patterns of local field potential (LFP) activity in the human limbic system reflect disease state and symptom severity in MDD and OCD patients. To this end, we recorded LFPs via implanted DBS electrodes from the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST area) in 12 patients (5 OCD, 7 MDD) and from the subgenual cingulate cortex in 7 MDD patients (CG25 area). We found a distinct pattern of oscillatory activity with significantly higher a-power in MDD compared with OCD in the BNST area (broad a-band 8-14 Hz; P<0.01) and a similar level of alpha-activity in the CG25 area as in the BNST area in MDD patients. The mean alpha-power correlated with severity of depressive symptoms as assessed by the Beck depression inventory in MDD (n = 14, r = 0.55, P = 0.042) but not with severity of obsessive compulsive symptoms in OCD. Here we show larger alpha-band activity in MDD patients compared with OCD recorded from intracranial DBS targets. Our results suggest that a-activity in the limbic system may be a signature of symptom severity in MDD and may serve as a potential state biomarker for closed loop DBS in MDD.

J	Engell, AD; McCarthy, G				Engell, Andrew D.; McCarthy, Gregory			Repetition Suppression of Face-Selective Evoked and Induced EEG Recorded From Human Cortex	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						ECoG; ERP; face; alpha; gamma; vision; repetition suppression	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; BOLD SIGNAL; ADAPTATION; FMRI; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATIONS; STIMULATION; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY	In functional MRI studies, repetition suppression refers to the reduction of hemodynamic activation to repeated stimulus presentation. For example, the repeated presentation of a face reduces the hemodynamic response evoked by faces in the fusiform gyrus. The neural events that underlie repetition suppression are not well understood. Indeed, in contrast to the hemodynamic response, the face-specific N200 recorded from subdural electrodes on the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, primarily along the fusiform gyrus, has been reported to be insensitive to face-identity repetition. We have previously described a face-specific broadband gamma (30-100 Hz) response at ventral face-specific N200 sites that is functionally dissociable from the N200. In this study, we investigate whether gamma and other components of the electroencephalogram spectrum are affected by face-identity repetition independently of the N200. Participants viewed sequentially presented identical faces. At sites on and around the fusiform gyrus, we found that face repetition modulated alpha (8-12 Hz), low-gamma (30-60 Hz), and high-gamma (60-100 Hz) synchrony, but not the N200. These findings provide evidence of a spatially co-localized progression of face processing. Whereas the N200 reflects an initial obligatory response that is less sensitive to face-identity repetition, the subsequent spectral fluctuations reflect more elaborative face processing and are thus sensitive to face novelty. It is notable that the observed modulations were different for different frequency bands. We observed repetition suppression of broadband gamma, but repetition enhancement of alpha synchrony. This difference is discussed with regard to an existing model of repetition suppression and behavioral repetition priming. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However none of these modalities can measure directly either the neuro-electrical or neuro-chemical processes that mediate brain function. This means that metrics directly reflecting brain 'activity' must be inferred from other metrics (e. g. magnetic fields (MEG) or haemodynamics (fMRI)). To overcome this limitation, many studies seek to combine multiple complementary modalities and an excellent example of this is the combination of MEG (which has high temporal resolution) with fMRI (which has high spatial resolution). However, the full potential of multi-modal approaches can only be truly realised in cases where the relationship between metrics is known. In this paper, we explore the relationship between measurements made using fMRI and MEG. We describe the origins of the two signals as well as their relationship to electrophysiology. We review multiple studies that have attempted to characterise the spatial relationship between fMRI and MEG, and we also describe studies that exploit the rich information content of MEG to explore differing relationships between MEG and fMRI across neural oscillatory frequency bands. Monitoring the brain at "rest" has become of significant recent interest to the neuroimaging community and we review recent evidence comparing MEG and fMRI metrics of functional connectivity. A brief discussion of the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to probe the relationship between MEG/fMRI and neurochemistry is also given. Finally, we highlight future areas of interest and offer some recommendations for the parallel use of fMRI and MEG. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

At high levels of complexity, this may involve the extraction of associative regularities between higher order entities such as objects, concepts and environments across events that are separated in space and time. We propose that such a mechanism provides an important route towards the formation of higher order semantic knowledge. The present study assessed whether subjects were able to extract complex regularities from multiple associative memories and whether they could generalize this regularity knowledge to new items. We used a memory task in which subjects were required to learn face-location associations, but in which certain facial features were predictive of locations. We assessed generalization, as well as memory for arbitrary stimulus components, over a 4-h post-encoding consolidation period containing wakefulness or sleep. We also assessed the stability of regularity knowledge across a period of several weeks thereafter. We found that subjects were able to detect the regularity structure and use it in a generalization task. Interestingly, the performance on this task increased across the 4hr post-learning period. However, no differential effects of cerebral sleep and wake states during this interval were observed. Furthermore, it was found that regularity extraction hampered the storage of arbitrary facial features, resulting in an impoverished memory trace. Finally, across a period of several weeks, memory for the regularity structure appeared very robust whereas memory for arbitrary associations showed steep forgetting. The current findings improve our understanding of how regularities across memories impact memory (trans)formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Sweegers, Carly C.

A challenge that neurosurgeons across the world face is accurate localization of epileptogenic zone. A significant number of patients who have undergone resective brain surgery for epilepsy still continue to have seizures. The reason behind this therapy resistance still eludes us. Thus to develop a cure for the difficult to treat epilepsy, we need to comprehensively study epileptogenesis. Till date, most of the studies on DRE is focused on undermining the abnormal functioning of receptors involved in synaptic transmission and reduced levels of antiepileptic drugs around there targets. But recent advances in imaging and electrophysiological techniques have suggested the role epileptogenic networks in the process of epileptogenesis. According to this hypothesis, the local neurons recruit distant neurons through complex oscillatory circuits, which further recruit more distant neurons, thereby generating a hypersynchronus neuronal activity. The epileptogenic networks may be confined to the lesion or could propagate to distant focus. The success of surgery depends on the precision by which the epileptogenic network is determined while planning a surgical intervention. Here, we summarize various modalities of electrophysiological and imaging techniques to determine the functionally active epileptogenic networks. We also review evidence pertaining to the proposed role of epileptogenic network in abnormal synaptic transmission which is one of the major causes of epileptiform activity. Elucidation of current concepts in regulation of synaptic transmission by networks will help develop therapies for epilepsy cases that cannot be managed pharmacologically.

Multimodal neuroimaging investigations of alterations to consciousness: The relationship between absence epilepsy and sleep	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Epilepsy; Sleep; Consciousness; Multimodal neuroimaging	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GENERALIZED SPIKE; EEG-FMRI; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS; POSTERIOR CINGULATE	The link between epilepsy and sleep is well established on many levels. The focus of the current review is on recent neuroimaging investigations into the alterations of consciousness that are observed during absence seizures and the descent into sleep. Functional neuroimaging provides simultaneous cortical and subcortical recording of activity throughout the brain, allowing a detailed definition and characterization of large-scale brain networks and the interactions between them. This has led to the identification of a set of regions which collectively form the consciousness system, which includes contributions from the default mode network (DMN), ascending arousal systems, and the thalamus. Electrophysiological and neuroimaging investigations have also clearly demonstrated the importance of thalamocortical and corticothalamic networks in the evolution of sleep and absence epilepsy, two phenomena in which the subject experiences an alteration to the conscious state and a disconnection from external input. However, the precise relationship between the consciousness system, thalamocortical networks, and consciousness itself remains to be clarified. One of the fundamental challenges is to understand how distributed brain networks coordinate their activity in order to maintain and implement complex behaviors such as consciousness and how modifications to this network activity lead to alterations in consciousness. By taking into account not only the level of activation of individual brain regions but also their connectivity within specific networks and the activity and connectivity of other relevant networks, a more specific quantification of brain states can be achieved. This, in turn, may provide a more fundamental understanding of the alterations to consciousness experienced in sleep and epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous research suggests that skill acquisition via MI is facilitated by repetitive activation of brain regions in the sensorimotor network similar to that of motor execution, however this evidence is conflicting. Further, many studies do not control for overt muscle activity and thus the activation patterns reported for MI may be driven in part by actual movement. The purpose of the current research is to further establish MI as a secondary modality of skill acquisition by providing electrophysiological evidence of an overlap between brain areas recruited for motor execution and imagery. Non-disabled participants (N=18; 24.7 +/- 3.8 years) performed both execution and imagery of a unilateral sequence button-press task. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was utilized to capture neural activity, while electromyography used to rigorously monitor muscle activity. Event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) analysis was conducted in the beta frequency band (15-30 Hz). Whole head dual-state beamformer analysis was applied to MEG data and 3D t-tests were conducted after Talairach normalization. Source-level analysis showed that MI has similar patterns of spatial activity as ME, including activation of contralateral primary motor and somatosensory cortices. However, this activation is significantly less intense during MI (p<0.05). As well, activation during ME was more lateralized (i.e., within the contralateral hemisphere). These results confirm that ME and MI have similar spatial activation patterns. Thus, the current research provides direct electrophysiological evidence to further establish MI as a secondary form of skill acquisition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sleep spindle and slow wave frequency reflect motor skill performance in primary school-age children	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						children; learning; motor skill; memory; sleep; spindles; slow waves; frequency	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; INTELLECTUAL ABILITY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; SEQUENCE; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Background and Aim: The role of sleep in the enhancement of motor skills has been studied extensively in adults. We aimed to determine involvement of sleep and characteristics of spindles and slow waves in a motor skill in children. Hypothesis: We hypothesized sleep-dependence of skill enhancement and an association of interindividual differences in skill and sleep characteristics. Methods: 30 children (19 females, 10.7 +/- 0.8 years of age; mean +/- SD) performed finger sequence tapping tasks in a repeated-measures design spanning 4 days including 1 polysomnography (PSG) night. Initial and delayed performance were assessed over 12 h of wake; 12 h with sleep; and 24 h with wake and sleep. For the 12 h with sleep, children were assigned to one of three conditions: modulation of slow waves and spindles was attempted using acoustic perturbation, and compared to yoked and no-sound control conditions. Analyses: Mixed effect regression models evaluated the association of sleep, its macrostructure and spindles and slow wave parameters with initial and delayed speed and accuracy. Results and Conclusions: Children enhance their accuracy only over an interval with sleep. Unlike previously reported in adults, children enhance their speed independent of sleep, a capacity that may to be lost in adulthood. Individual differences in the dominant frequency of spindles and slow waves were predictive for performance: children performed better if they had less slow spindles, more fast spindles and faster slow waves. On the other hand, overnight enhancement of accuracy was most pronounced in children with more slow spindles and slower slow waves, i.e., the ones with an initial lower performance. Associations of spindle and slow wave characteristics with initial performance may confound interpretation of their involvement in overnight enhancement. Slower frequencies of characteristic sleep events may mark slower learning and immaturity of networks involved in motor skills.	[Astill, Rebecca G.; Piantoni, Giovanni; Raymann, Roy J. E.

J	Li, XQ; Zhao, HY; Lu, Y				Li, Xiaoqing; Zhao, Haiyan; Lu, Yong			The Relation between Thematic Role Computing and Semantic Relatedness Processing during On-Line Sentence Comprehension	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORLD KNOWLEDGE; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE; RETRIEVAL; ANIMACY; ENGLISH; SYSTEM; VERBS; POWER	Sentence comprehension involves timely computing different types of relations between its verbs and noun arguments, such as morphosyntactic, semantic, and thematic relations. Here, we used EEG technique to investigate the potential differences in thematic role computing and lexical-sematic relatedness processing during on-line sentence comprehension , and the intraction between these two types of processes. Mandarin Chinese sentences were used as materials. The basic structure of those sentences is "Noun+Verb+'le'+a two-character word", with the Noun being the initial argument. The verb disambiguates the initial argument as an agent or a patient, Meanwhile, the initial argument and the verb are highly or lowly semantically related. The ERPs at the verbs revealed that: relative to the agent condition, the patient condition evoked a larger N400 only when the argument and verb were lowly semantically related; however, relative to the high-relatedness condition, the low-relatedness condition elicited a larger N400 regardless of the thematic relation; although both thematic role variation and sematic relatedness variation elicited N400 effects, the N400 effect elicited by the former was broadly distributed and reached maximun over the frontal electrodes, and the N400 effect elicited by the latter had a posterior distribution. In addition, the brain oscillations results showed that, although thematic role variation (patient vs. agent) induced power decreases around the beta frequency band (15-30 Hz), semantic relatedness variation (low-relatedness vs. high-relatedness) induced power increases in the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz). These results suggested that, in the sentence context, thematic role computing is modulated by the sematic relatedness between the verb and its argument; semantic relatedness processing, however, is in some degree independent from the thematic relations. Moreover, our results indicated that, during on-line sentence comprehension, thematic role computing and sematic relatedness processing are mediated by distinct neural systems.

Among other theories, it has been suggested that cerebellar dysfunction may be involved in dyslexia. This theory has been supported by findings from anatomical and functional imaging. A possible rationale for cerebellar involvement in dyslexia could lie in the cerebellum's role as an oscillator, producing synchronized activity within neuronal networks including sensorimotor networks critical for reading. If these findings are causally related to dyslexia, a training regimen that enhances cerebellar oscillatory activity should improve reading performance. We examined the cognitive and neural effects of Quadrato Motor Training (QMT), a structured sensorimotor training program that involves sequencing of motor responses based on verbal commands. Twenty-two adult Hebrew readers (12 dyslexics and 10 controls) were recruited for the study. Using Magnetoencephalography (MEG), we measured changes in alpha power and coherence following QMT in a within-subject design. Reading performance was assessed pre- and post-training using a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests. Our results demonstrate improved performance on a speeded reading task following one month of intensive QMT in both the dyslexic and control groups. Dyslexic participants, but not controls, showed significant increase in cerebellar oscillatory alpha power following training. In addition, across both time points, inter-hemispheric alpha coherence was higher in the dyslexic group compared to the control group. In conclusion, the current findings suggest that the combination of motor and language training embedded in QMT increases cerebellar oscillatory activity in dyslexics and improves reading performance. These results support the hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a role in skilled reading, and begin to unravel the underlying mechanisms that mediate cerebellar contribution in cognitive and neuronal augmentation.

We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate such interplay in a highly selected group of "virtuoso" meditators (Theravada Buddhist monks), with long-term training in the two main meditation styles: focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) meditation. Specifically, we investigated the differences between FA meditation, OM meditation and resting state in the coupling between the posterior cingulate cortex, core node of the Default Mode Network (DMN) implicated in mind wandering and self-related processing, and the whole brain, with a recently developed phase coherence approach. Our findings showed a state dependent coupling of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to nodes of the DMN and of the executive control brain network in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz), related to different attentional and cognitive control processes in FA and OM meditation, consistently with the putative role of alpha band synchronization in the functional mechanisms for attention and consciousness. The coupling of PCC with left medial prefrontal cortex (ImPFC) and superior frontal gyrus characterized the contrast between the two meditation styles in a way that correlated with meditation expertise. These correlations may be related to a higher mindful observing ability and a reduced identification with ongoing mental activity in more expert meditators. Notably, different styles of meditation and different meditation expertise appeared to modulate the dynamic balance between fronto-parietal (FP) and DMN networks. Our results support the idea that the interplay between the DMN and the FP network in the alpha band is crucial for the transition from resting state to different meditative states.

Seizure expression, behavior, and brain morphology differences in colonies of Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg; Absence seizures; Behavioral comorbidities; Brain morphology; Ca(V)3; 2 R1584P mutation; Cacna1h	GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; WAVE DISCHARGES; PAROXYSMAL OSCILLATIONS; MODEL; CACNA1H; NEURONS; GAERS; COMORBIDITY; VARIANTS; ANXIETY	ObjectiveOriginally derived from a Wistar rat strain, a proportion of which displayed spontaneous absence-type seizures, Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) represent the most widely utilized animal model of genetic generalized epilepsy. Here we compare the seizure, behavioral, and brain morphometric characteristics of four main GAERS colonies that are being actively studied internationally: two from Melbourne (MELB and STRAS-MELB), one from Grenoble (GREN), and one from Istanbul (ISTAN). MethodsElectroencephalography (EEG) recordings, behavioral examinations, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were conducted on GAERS and Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) rats to assess and compare the following: (1) characteristics of spike-and-wave discharges, (2) anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and (3) MRI brain morphology of regions of interest. ResultsSeizure characteristics varied between the colonies, with MELB GAERS exhibiting the least severe epilepsy phenotype with respect to seizure frequency, and GREN GAERS exhibiting four times more seizures than MELB. MELB and STRAS-MELB colonies both displayed consistent anxiety and depressive-like behaviors relative to NEC. MELB and GREN GAERS showed similar changes in brain morphology, including increased whole brain volume and increased somatosensory cortical width. A previously identified mutation in the Cacna1h gene controlling the Ca(V)3.2 T-type calcium channel (R1584P) was present in all four GAERS colonies, but absent in all NEC rats. SignificanceThis study demonstrates differences in epilepsy severity between GAERS colonies that were derived from the same original colony in Strasbourg. This multi-institute study highlights the potential impact of environmental conditions and/or genetic drift on the severity of epileptic and behavioral phenotypes in rodent models of epilepsy.

Thus, when combined with recordings of neuronal ensemble activity in freely moving animals optogenetics can provide an unprecedented snapshot of the contribution of neuronal assemblies to (patho)physiological conditions in vivo. Still, the combination of optogenetic and silicone probe (or tetrode) recordings does not allow investigation of the role played by voltage- and transmitter-gated channels of the opsin-transfected neurons and/or other adjacent neurons in controlling neuronal activity. New method and results: We demonstrate that optogenetics and silicone probe recordings can be combined with intracerebral reverse microdialysis for the long-term delivery of neuroactive drugs around the optic fiber and silicone probe. In particular, we show the effect of antagonists of T-type Ca2+ channels, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors on silicone probe-recorded activity of the local opsin-transfected neurons in the ventrobasal thalamus, and demonstrate the changes that the block of these thalamic channels/receptors brings about in the network dynamics of distant somatotopic cortical neuronal ensembles. Comparison with existing methods: This is the first demonstration of successfully combining optogenetics and neuronal ensemble recordings with reverse microdialysis. This combination of techniques overcomes some of the disadvantages that are associated with the use of intracerebral injection of a drug-containing solution at the site of laser activation. Conclusions: The combination of reverse microdialysis, silicone probe recordings and optogenetics can unravel the short and long-term effects of specific transmitter- and voltage-gated channels on lasermodulated firing at the site of optogenetic stimulation and the actions that these manipulations exert on distant neuronal populations.

Circadian modulation of motor-related beta oscillatory responses	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Movement; Circadian; Desynchronization; Magnetoencephalography; Motor planning	BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; INFECTED OLDER-ADULTS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HEALTHY-ADULTS; HAND AREA; MOVEMENT; EEG; MEG	Previous electrophysiological investigations have evaluated movement-related beta (14-28 Hz) oscillatory activity in healthy participants. These studies have described an abrupt decrease in beta activity that starts before movement onset, and a sharp increase in beta power that peaks after movement termination. These neural responses have been respectively termed the event-related beta desynchronization or pre-movement beta ERD, and the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). Previous studies have shown that a variety of movement parameters and demographic factors (e.g., age) modulate the amplitude of these oscillatory responses, and in the current study we evaluated whether the amplitudes follow a biological temporal rhythm (e.g., circadian), as it is known that spontaneous beta levels increase from morning to afternoon in some brain areas. To this end, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate oscillatory activity during a right hand finger-tapping task in four participants who were recorded at three different times (09:00, 12:00, 16:00) on three consecutive days (i.e., 36 total MEG sessions). All MEG data were corrected for head motion and examined in the time-frequency domain using beamforming methods. We found a significant linear increase in beta ERD amplitude from 09:00 to 16:00 h in the left precentral gyrus, left premotor cortices, left supplementary motor area (SMA), and right precentral and postcentral gyri. In contrast, the amplitude of the PMBR was very steady across the day in all brain regions except the left SMA, which exhibited a linear increase from morning to afternoon. Finally, beta levels during the baseline period also increased from 09:00 to 16:00 in most regions of the cortical sensorimotor network. These data show that both the pre-movement beta ERD and spontaneous beta levels strongly increase from morning to afternoon in the motor cortices, which may indicate that the amplitude of the beta ERD response is determined by the spontaneous beta level during the motor planning period.

Design: Participants undergoing overnight high-density electroencephalographic recordings were awakened at 15- to 30-min intervals. One hundred forty-one falling-asleep periods were analyzed at the scalp and source level. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Six healthy participants. Interventions: Serial awakenings. Results: The number and amplitude of slow waves followed two dissociated, intersecting courses during the transition to sleep: slow wave number increased slowly at the beginning and rapidly at the end of the falling-asleep period, whereas amplitude at first increased rapidly and then decreased linearly. Most slow waves occurring early in the transition to sleep had a large amplitude, a steep slope, involved broad regions of the cortex, predominated over frontomedial regions, and preferentially originated from the sensorimotor and the posteromedial parietal cortex. Most slow waves occurring later had a smaller amplitude and slope, involved more circumscribed parts of the cortex, and had more evenly distributed origins. Spindles were initially sparse, fast, and involved few cortical regions, then became more numerous and slower, and involved more areas. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence for two types of slow waves, which follow dissociated temporal courses in the transition to sleep and have distinct cortical origins and distributions. We hypothesize that these two types of slow waves result from two distinct synchronization processes: (1) a''bottom-up,'' subcorticocortical, arousal system-dependent process that predominates in the early phase and leads to type I slow waves, and (2) a ''horizontal,'' corticocortical synchronization process that predominates in the late phase and leads to type II slow waves. The dissociation between these two synchronization processes in time and space suggests that they may be differentially affected by experimental manipulations and sleep disorders.

Genesis of interictal spikes in the CA1: a computational investigation	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						interictal spikes; hippocampal CA1 region; computational models; paroxysmal depolarization shift; temporal lobe epilepsy	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SYNCHRONIZED GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; INTERNEURON NETWORKS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC INHIBITION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Interictal spikes (IISs) are spontaneous high amplitude, short time duration <400 ms events often observed in electroencephalographs (EEG) of epileptic patients. In vitro analysis of resected mesial temporal lobe tissue from patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy has revealed the presence of IIS in the CA1 subfield. In this paper, we develop a biophysically relevant network model of the CA1 subfield and investigate how changes in the network properties influence the susceptibility of CA1 to exhibit an IIS. We present a novel template based approach to identify conditions under which synchronization of paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) events evoked in CA1 pyramidal (Py) cells can trigger an IIS. The results from this analysis are used to identify the synaptic parameters of a minimal network model that is capable of generating PDS in response to afferent synaptic input. The minimal network model parameters are then incorporated into a detailed network model of the CA1 subfield in order to address the following questions: (1) How does the formation of an IIS in the CA1 depend on the degree of sprouting (recurrent connections) between the CA1 Py cells and the fraction of CA3 Shaffer collateral (SC) connections onto the CA1 Py cells? and (2) Is synchronous afferent input from the SC essential for the CA1 to exhibit IIS? Our results suggest that the CA1 subfield with low recurrent connectivity (absence of sprouting), mimicking the topology of a normal brain, has a very low probability of producing an IIS except when a large fraction of CA1 neurons (>80%) receives a barrage of quasi-synchronous afferent input (input occurring within a temporal window of <= 24 ms) via the SC. However, as we increase the recurrent connectivity of the CA1 (P-sprout > 40); mimicking sprouting in a pathological CA1 network, the CA1 can exhibit IIS even in the absence of a barrage of quasi-synchronous afferents from the SC (input occurring within temporal window >80 ms) and a low fraction of CA1 Py cells (approximate to 30%) receiving SC input. Furthermore, we find that in the presence of Poisson distributed random input via SC, the CA1 network is able to generate spontaneous periodic IISs(approximate to 3Hz) for high degrees of recurrent Py connectivity (P-sprout > 70). We investigate the conditions necessary for this phenomenon and find that spontaneous IISs closely depend on the degree of the network's intrinsic excitability.

Clinical signs evolve as the epileptic discharge spreads in both time and space. Studying the relation between these, of which the temporal component is at least as important as the spatial one, is possible using anatomo-electro-clinical correlations of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data. The period of semiology production occurs with variable time lag after seizure onset and signs then emerge more or less rapidly depending on seizure type (temporal seizures generally propagating more slowly and frontal seizures more quickly). The subset of structures involved in semiological production, the "early spread network", is tightly linked to those constituting the epileptogenic zone. The level of complexity of semiological features varies according to the degree of involvement of the primary or associative cortex, with the former having a direct relation to peripheral sensory and motor systems with production of hallucinations (visual and auditory) or elementary sensorimotor signs. Depending on propagation pattern, these signs can occur in a "march" fashion as described by Jackson. On the other hand, seizures involving the associative cortex, having a less direct relation with the peripheral nervous system, and necessarily involving more widely distributed networks manifest with altered cognitive and/or behavioral signs whose neural substrate involves a network of cortical structures, as has been observed for normal cognitive processes. Other than the anatomical localization of these structures, the frequency of the discharge is a crucial determinant of semiological effect since a fast (gamma) discharge will tend to deactivate normal function, whereas a slower theta discharge can mimic physiological function. In terms of interaction between structures, the degree of synchronization plays a key role in clinical expression, as evidenced, for example, by studies of ictal fear-related behavior (decorrelation of activity between structures inducing "release" phenomena) and of deja vu (increased synchronization). Studies of functional coupling within networks underlying complex ictal behavior indicate that the clinical semiology of a given seizure depends upon neither the anatomical origin of ictal discharge nor the target areas of its propagation alone but on the dynamic interaction between these. Careful mapping of the ictal network in its full spread offers essential information as to the localization of seizure onset, by deducing that a given network configuration could only be generated by a given area or group of areas.

Retigabine calms seizure-induced behavior following status epilepticus	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Anticonvulsant; Seizure; Anxiety; Hyperexcitability; Amygdala; Hippocampus; Retigabine	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; RAT ENTORHINAL CORTEX; ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE; ANTICONVULSANT RETIGABINE; KAINIC ACID; CHANNEL OPENER; DIFFERENTIAL CONTRIBUTION; INTERICTAL EMOTIONALITY; EZOGABINE RETIGABINE; ANXIETY DISORDERS	In adult rats, intraperitoneal injection of kainate (KA) results in sustained status epilepticus and persistent behavioral comorbidities such as hyperexcitability, anxiety, and altered response to environmental cues. Intrahippocampal KA also results in sustained status epilepticus and continuous high frequency oscillations in the electroencephalograph (EEG), although subsequent behavioral side effects are unknown. We hypothesized that retigabine, a recently discovered anticonvulsant and potent positive modulator of 1(v7 channels, may attenuate seizure-induced behavioral abnormalities. Status epilepticus was induced by administration of KA either intraperitoneally (15 mg/kg) or by single intrahippocampal injection (1.0 mu g/0.5 mu L. After 24 h, half of systemically KA-treated animals that reached stage 6 seizures were injected once daily with retigabine (5 mg/kg) for 14 continuous days. All groups underwent three behavioral tests - capture and handling, open field, and elevated plus maze - 24 h following the last retigabine treatment and were sacrificed at 25-28 days. In the capture and handling test, systemic KA treatment resulted in frisky behavior and resistance to capture with wild attempts to escape during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks of the observation period. In contrast, these behaviors were attenuated in HA + retigabine-treated animals. In the open-field test, KA-treated animals spent more time in the center zone, but KA + retigabine-treated rats had greater overall activity compared with those having vehicle, KA, or retigabine-only treatment. In the elevated plus maze, KA + retigabine-treated animals traveled greater distances in open and closed arms (proximal and distal) compared with controls, also signifying anxiety reduction. Retigabine-only-treated rats traveled more in the open proximal arms compared with controls, indicating increased hyperlocomotion in normotensive rats. Although treatment with KA + retigabine resulted in anxiolytic-like effects in all three behavioral tasks compared with vehicle, this group did not significantly differ from systemically KA-treated rats in most measurements in open-field and elevated plus maze tasks, suggesting that retigabine may also cause hyperlocomotion unrelated to anxiety level. Despite that intrahippocampal KAtreated rats displayed comparable seizure behavior, epileptiform activity, and hippocampal injury, their behavior resembled the controls, suggesting that molecular and subsequent cellular changes are also partially responsible for anxiolytic-like effects and that these results are likely independent of the hippocampus.

Using a canonical model ('Epileptor') and experimental validation, they demonstrate that seizures with focal onset mostly fall into one particular class that is universal across brain regions and species, from flies to humans.Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant properties exist that characterize seizures under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control of time course, including the alternation between 'normal' and ictal periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system. We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the conditions necessary for those transitions.
