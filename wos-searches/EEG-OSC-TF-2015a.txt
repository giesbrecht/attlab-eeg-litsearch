Previous studies using time-frequency decomposition of Electroencephalography (EEG) data have revealed an increase of midfrontal beta oscillatory activity (BOA) after reward delivery, which could be a potential mechanism in the coordination of the different areas engaged during reward processing. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, twenty subjects performed a monetary gambling paradigm in two separate sessions (EEG and fMRI). Time-frequency oscillatory EEG data and fMRI activity were fused using Joint Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The present results showed that mid-frontal BOA elicited by monetary gains is associated with the engagement of a fronto-striatal-hippocampal network previously involved in reward-related memory enhancement, supporting the role of this activity during reward processing.

This study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how word class differences influence semantic retrieval and identification of semantic relationships. Participants identified whether the final word in a triplet (noun or verb) was related to the first two words (both nouns). Time frequency analysis of the EEG revealed word class and relatedness effects in theta, beta and gamma. Decreases in beta power were found during action verbs, which may be related to motor processing. Theta exhibited a word class by relatedness interaction in which unrelated verbs elicited a greater power increase compared to other conditions. These data indicate that action verbs require more neural activity when identifying the absence of relationships than object nouns, likely due to the abstract, flexible nature of verb meanings and the shallow structure of verb organisation.

Phase-Amplitude Cross-Frequency Coupling in EEG-derived Cortical Time Series upon an Auditory Perception Task	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; ALPHA	Recent evidence suggests that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) plays an essential role in multi-scale communication across the brain. The amplitude of the high frequency oscillations, responsible for local activity, is modulated by the phase of the lower frequency activity, in a task and region-relevant way. In this paper, we examine this phase-amplitude coupling in a two-tone oddball paradigm for the low frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) and determine the most prominent CFCs. Data consisted of cortical time series, extracted by applying three-dimensional vector field tomography (3D-VFT) to high density (256 channels) electroencephalography (HD-EEG), and CFC analysis was based on the phase-amplitude coupling metric, namely PAC. Our findings suggest CFC spanning across all brain regions and low frequencies. Stronger coupling was observed in the delta band, that is closely linked to sensory processing. However, theta coupling was reinforced in the target tone response, revealing a taskdependent CFC and its role in brain networks communication.

J	de Cheveigne, A; Arzounian, D				de Cheveigne, Alain; Arzounian, Dorothee			Scanning for oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; brain oscillations; ICA; DSS; JD; joint decorrelation; MEG	BRAIN; EEG	Objective. Oscillations are an important aspect of brain activity, but they often have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to source-to-electrode mixing with competing brain activity and noise. Filtering can improve the SNR of narrowband signals, but it introduces ringing effects that may masquerade as genuine oscillations, leading to uncertainty as to the true oscillatory nature of the phenomena. Likewise, time-frequency analysis kernels have a temporal extent that blurs the time course of narrowband activity, introducing uncertainty as to timing and causal relations between events and/or frequency bands. Approach. Here, we propose a methodology that reveals narrowband activity within multichannel data such as electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, electrocorticography or local field potential. The method exploits the between-channel correlation structure of the data to suppress competing sources by joint diagonalization of the covariance matrices of narrowband filtered and unfiltered data. Main results. Applied to synthetic and real data, the method effectively extracts narrowband components at unfavorable SNR. Significance. Oscillatory components of brain activity, including weak sources that are hard or impossible to observe using standard methods, can be detected and their time course plotted accurately. The method avoids the temporal artifacts of standard filtering and time-frequency analysis methods with which it remains complementary.

Comparison of EEG and MEG in source localization of induced human gamma-band oscillations during visual stimulus	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			FREQUENCY; HZ	High frequency gamma oscillations are indications of information processing in cortical neuronal networks. Recently, non-invasive detection of these oscillations have become one of the main research areas in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies. The aim of this study, which is a continuation of our previous MEG study, is to compare the capability of the two modalities (EEG and MEG) in localizing the source of the induced gamma activity due to a visual stimulus, using a spatial filtering technique known as dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS). To do this, the brain activity was recorded using simultaneous MEG and EEG measurement and the data were analyzed with respect to time, frequency, and location of the strongest response. The spherical head modeling technique, such as, the three-shell concentric spheres and an overlapping sphere (local sphere) have been used as a forward model to calculate the external electromagnetic potentials and fields recorded by the EEG and MEG, respectively. Our results from the time-frequency analysis, at the sensor level, revealed that the parieto-occipital electrodes and sensors from both modalities showed a clear and sustained gamma-band activity throughout the post-stimulus duration and that both modalities showed similar strongest gamma-band peaks. It was difficult to interpret the spatial pattern of the gamma-band oscillatory response on the scalp, at the sensor level, for both modalities. However, the source analysis result revealed that MEG3 sensor type, which measure the derivative along the longitude, showed the source more focally and close to the visual cortex (cuneus) as compared to that of the EEG.

One of the challenges is to distinguish rhythmic discharges from nonstationary patterns occurring during seizures. The proposed approach is based on an adaptive and localized time-frequency representation of EEG signals by means of rational functions. The corresponding rational discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a novel feature extraction technique for epileptic EEG data. A multilayer perceptron classifier is fed by the coefficients of the rational DSTFT in order to separate seizure epochs from seizure-free epochs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with several state-of-art feature extraction algorithms used in offline epileptic seizure detection. The results of the comparative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms competing techniques in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, it provides a compact representation of EEG time-series.

To extend the clinical applicability of this finding, we retrospectively investigated routine electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 19 patients with ASD and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Relative resting-state condition gamma spectral power was variable, but on average significantly increased in children with ASD. This effect remained when excluding electrodes associated with myogenic gamma activity. These findings further indicate that increased resting-state gamma activity characterizes a subset of ASD and may also be detected by routine EEG as a clinically accessible and well-tolerated investigation.

Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) signals are split into oscillatory (spindles) and transient (K-complex) components. This decomposition is conveniently achieved by applying morphological component analysis (MCA) to a sparse representation of EEG segments obtained by the recently introduced discrete tunable 0-factor wavelet transform (TQVVT). Tuning the 0-factor provides a convenient and elegant tool to naturally decompose the signal into an oscillatory and a transient component. The actual detection step relies on thresholding (i) the transient component to reveal K-complexes and (ii) the time-frequency representation of the oscillatory component to identify sleep spindles. Optimal thresholds are derived from ROC-like curves (sensitivity vs. FDR) on training sets and the performance of the method is assessed on test data sets. We assessed the performance of our method using full-night sleep EEG data we collected from 14 participants. In comparison to visual scoring (Expert 1), the proposed method detected spindles with a sensitivity of 83.18% and false discovery rate (FDR) of 39%, while K-complexes were detected with a sensitivity of 81.57% and an FDR of 29.54%. Similar performances were obtained when using a second expert as benchmark. In addition, when the TQVVT and MCA steps were excluded from the pipeline the detection sensitivities dropped down to 70% for spindles and to 76.97% for K-complexes, while the FDR rose up to 43.62 and 49.09%, respectively. Finally, we also evaluated the performance of the proposed method on a set of publicly available sleep EEG recordings. Overall, the results we obtained suggest that the TQVVT-MCA method may be a valuable alternative to existing spindle and K-complex detection methods. Paths for improvements and further validations with large-scale standard open-access benchmarking data sets are discussed.

ERP components, such as the P300 wave, which are involved in the process of decision-making, help scientists diagnose specific cognitive disabilities. New method: In this study, we utilize the angles between multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) subspaces in different frequency bands, as a similarity factor for studying the spatial coherency between ERP frequency responses. A matched filter is used to enhance the ERP from background EEG. Results: While previous researches have focused on frequencies below 10 Hz, as the major frequency band of ERP, it is shown that by using the proposed method, significant ERP-related information can also be found in the 25-40 Hz band. These frequency bands are selected by calculating the correlation coefficient between P300 response segments and synthetic EEG, and ERP segments without P300 waves, and by rejecting the bands having the most association with background EEG and non-P300 components. Comparison with existing methods: The significance of the results is assessed by real EEG acquired in brain computer interface experiments versus synthetic EEG produced by existing methods in the literature, to assure that the results are not systematic side effects of the proposed framework. Conclusions: The overall results show that the equivalent dipoles corresponding to narrow-band events in the brain are spatially coherent within different (not necessarily adjacent) frequency bands. The results of this study can lead into novel perspectives in ERP studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, localization of cortical activity in such users via qEEG is confounded by the presence of artifacts produced by the device itself. Typically, independent component analysis (ICA) is used to remove CI artifacts in auditory evoked EEG signals collected upon brief stimulation and it is effective for auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). However, AEPs do not reflect the daily environments of patients, and thus, continuous EEG data that are closer to such environments are desirable. In this case, device-related artifacts in EEG data are difficult to remove selectively via ICA due to over-completion of EEG data removal in the absence of preprocessing. New methods: EEGs were recorded for a long time under conditions of continuous auditory stimulation. To obviate the over-completion problem, we limited the frequency of CI artifacts to a significant characteristic peak and apply ICA artifact removal. Results: Topographic brain mapping results analyzed via band-limited (BL)-ICA exhibited a better energy distribution, matched to the CI location, than data obtained using conventional ICA. Also, source localization data verified that BL-ICA effectively removed Cl artifacts. Comparison with existing method: The proposed method selectively removes Cl artifacts from continuous EEG recordings, while ICA removal method shows residual peak and removes important brain activity signals. Conclusion: Cl artifacts in EEG data obtained during continuous passive listening can be effectively removed with the aid of BL-ICA, opening up new EEG research possibilities in subjects with Cls.

It is possible to analyze each component of a multi-component signal by using the IMFs. Thus, detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) which is suggested to characterize the auto-correlation properties of non-stationary signals. Frequency and time-frequency domain methods are successfully employed to analyze EEG signals during epileptic seizure. In this study, however, we present a time domain method to analyze and classify EEG signals by investigating the auto-correlation properties of their IMFs extracted by EMD. In the proposed method the IMF features are analyzed by using DFA to determine the epileptic EEG signals.

Electroencephalography (EEG) modifications of cortical activity in healthy subjects were evaluated using time-frequency event-related EEG and task-related coherence (TRCoh). Twenty-one channel EEG was recorded in eight subjects during protocols of active, passive, and imagined movements. The subjects performed robot-assisted tasks using the Bi-Manu-Track robot-assisted arm trainer. We applied time-frequency event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) and TRCoh approaches to investigate where movement-related decreases in power were localized and to study the functional relationships between areas. Our results showed ERD of sensorimotor (SM) area over the contralateral side before the movement and bilateral ERD during execution of the movement. ERD during passive movements was similar in topography to that observed during voluntary movements, but without pre-movement components. No significant difference in time course ERD was observed among the three types of movement over the two SM areas. The TRCoh topography was similar for active and imagined movement; before passive movement, the frontal regions were uncoupled from the SM regions and did not contribute to task performance. This study suggests new perspectives for the evaluation of brain oscillatory activity and the neurological assessment of motor performance by means of quantitative EEG to better understand the planning and execution of movement.

The source of EEG activity is the voltage differences within neurons of the brain. Therefore, it is a reflection of the synchronous activity of neurons. EEG activity shows oscillations at a variety of frequencies. This rhythmic activity is divided into bands by frequency and usually associated with different states of brain functioning. EEG is a valuable tool for clinical and research uses in many scientific fields. However, traditional devices are usually cost thousands of dollars and the preparation process is time-consuming. In recent years, newer EEG devices are introduced for consumer use and currently available on the market. The devices use dry electrodes and send signal via wireless, thus easier to use and more comfortable to wear. They are also considerably cheaper, cost around a few hundred dollars. In this paper, we used a consumer EEG device to record the brainwave of Buddhist monks during meditation and other activities. We then analyzed the recordings and demonstrated that an inexpensive device has enough features and can also be used as a tool for research as well. Muse from InteraXon Inc. was chosen as a consumer EEG device for our experiment. The device has a total of seven EEG sensors capable of reading four channels of data with active noise suppression. It also provides additional information, such as eye blink and jaw clench, for further analysis. The preliminary results show that the device can effectively record an EEG signal and could potentially be used as a research tool.

REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						attention; response inhibition; source localization; source separation; time-frequency analyses	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUTOMATIC MOTOR ACTIVATION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TOP-DOWN; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS	Response inhibition is a pivotal component of executive control, which is especially difficult to assess. Indeed, it is a substantial challenge to gauge brain-behavior relationships because this function is precisely intended to suppress overt measurable behaviors. A further complication is that no single neuroimaging method has been found that can disentangle the accurate time-course of concurrent excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Here, we argue that this objective can be achieved with electroencephalography (EEG) on some conditions. Based on a systematic review, we emphasize that the standard event-related potential N2 (N200) is not an appropriate marker of prepotent response inhibition. We provide guidelines for assessing the cortical brain dynamics of response inhibition with EEG. This includes the combined use of inseparable data processing steps (source separation, source localization, and single-trial and time-frequency analyses) as well as the amendment of the classical experimental designs to enable the recording of different kinds of electrophysiological activity predicted by different models of response inhibition. We conclude with an illustration based on recent findings of how fruitful this approach can be.

Your Brain on Art: Emergent Cortical Dynamics During Aesthetic Experiences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; machine learning; functional connectivity (FC); aesthetics; freely moving	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; APPRECIATION; POTENTIALS; NETWORKS; DELTA	The brain response to conceptual art was studied with mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural basis of aesthetic experiences. In contrast to most studies of perceptual phenomena, participants were moving and thinking freely as they viewed the exhibit The Boundary of Life is Quietly Crossed by Dario Robleto at the Menil Collection-Houston. The brain activity of over 400 subjects was recorded using dry electrode and one reference gel based EEG systems over a period of 3 months. Here, we report initial findings based on the reference system. EEG segments corresponding to each art piece were grouped into one of three classes (complex, moderate, and baseline) based on analysis of a digital image of each piece. Time, frequency, and wavelet features extracted from EEG were used to classify patterns associated with viewing art, and ranked based on their relevance for classification. The maximum classification accuracy was 55% (chance = 33%) with delta and gamma features the most relevant for classification. Functional analysis revealed a significant increase in connection strength in localized brain networks while subjects viewed the most aesthetically pleasing art compared to viewing a blank wall. The direction of signal flow showed early recruitment of broad posterior areas followed by focal anterior activation. Significant differences in the strength of connections were also observed across age and gender. This work provides evidence that EEG, deployed on freely behaving subjects, can detect selective signal flow in neural networks, identify significant differences between subject groups, and report with greater-than-chance accuracy the complexity of a subject's visual percept of aesthetically pleasing art. Our approach, which allows acquisition of neural activity "in action and context," could lead to understanding of how the brain integrates sensory input and its ongoing internal state to produce the phenomenon which we term aesthetic experience.

Comparative Analysis of Wavelet Based Approaches for Reliable Removal of Ocular Artifacts from Single Channel EEG	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	MAY 21-23, 2015	Dekalb, IL	IEEE		Electroencephalogram; Wavelet Transform; Ocular Artifact; Artifact Removal	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DOMAIN	For biomedical and scientific fields, Electroencephalography (EEG) has turned out to be an important tool to understand, study, and utilize brain functionalities. To fully utilize EEG signals in real-life closed-loop applications, artifacts such as ocular must be removed. Wavelet transform is one of the powerful methods to remove ocular artifacts from single channel EEG devices. In this study, both stationary and discrete wavelet transforms (SWT and DWT, respectively) have been compared with various wavelet basis functions, such as sym3, haar, coif3, and bior4.4 using either universal threshold (UT) or statistical threshold (ST). Different combinations of wavelet transform techniques, mother wavelets, and thresholds are compared to identify an optimum combination for ocular artifact removal. Performance metrics like Correlation Coefficient (CC), Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE), Time Frequency Analysis, and execution time have been calculated for measuring the effectiveness of each combination. According to CC, DWT+UT combination turned out to be a good option for the ocular artifact removal. However, according to NMSE and time frequency analysis, SWT+ST has generated better performance in keeping neural segments of EEG unaffected. According to the measurement of execution times, DWT+ST is faster compared to other combinations. The study shows that wavelet transform is suitable in artifact removal from single channel EEG data to implement in ambulatory real-time EEG systems.

Significant progress has been made since the first landmark EEG study on affective disorders by Davidson 35 years ago. A systematic account of these data is important and necessary for building a consistent neuropsychophysiologic model of MDD and other affective disorders. Given the extensive data on frequency-dependent functional significance of EEG oscillations, a frequency domain approach may reveal the types of brain functions involved and disturbed in MDD. In this review, we systematize and integrate diverse and often unconnected observations on the content, topography, neurochemistry, and functions of EEG oscillations involved in MDD within the general concept of an EEG oscillatory pattern.

Multiple linear regression to estimate time-frequency electrophysiological responses in single trials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Single-trial analysis; Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Multiple linear regression; Neuronal oscillations	LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PAIN PERCEPTION; EEG RESPONSES; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS	Transient sensory, motor or cognitive event elicit not only phase-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), but also induce non-phase-locked modulations of ongoing EEG oscillations. These modulations can be detected when single-trial waveforms are analysed in the time-frequency domain, and consist in stimulus-induced decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) or increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) of synchrony in the activity of the underlying neuronal populations. ERD and ERS reflect changes in the parameters that control oscillations in neuronal networks and, depending on the frequency at which they occur, represent neuronal mechanisms involved in cortical activation, inhibition and binding. ERD and ERS are commonly estimated by averaging the time-frequency decomposition of single trials. However, their trial-to-trial variability that can reflect physiologically-important information is lost by across-trial averaging. Here, we aim to (1) develop novel approaches to explore single-trial parameters (including latency, frequency and magnitude) of ERP/ERD/ERS; (2) disclose the relationship between estimated single-trial parameters and other experimental factors (e.g., perceived intensity). We found that (1) stimulus-elicited ERP/ERD/ERS can be correctly separated using principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition with Varimax rotation on the single-trial time-frequency distributions; (2) time-frequency multiple linear regression with dispersion term (TF-MLRd) enhances the signal-tonoise ratio of ERP/ERD/ERS in single trials, and provides an unbiased estimation of their latency, frequency, and magnitude at single-trial level; (3) these estimates can be meaningfully correlated with each other and with other experimental factors at single-trial level (e.g., perceived stimulus intensity and ERP magnitude). The methods described in this article allow exploring fully non-phase-locked stimulus-induced cortical oscillations, obtaining single-trial estimate of response latency, frequency, and magnitude. This permits within-subject statistical comparisons, correlation with pre-stimulus features, and integration of simultaneously-recorded EEG and fMRI. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

While many studies have been carried out in order to assess daytime sleepiness, automatic EDS detection still remains an open problem. In this work, a detection approach based on the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. Multichannel EEG signals were recorded during five maintenance of wakefulness (MWT) and multiple sleep latency tests alternated throughout the day from patients suffering from sleep-disordered breathing. A group of 20 patients with EDS was compared with a group of 20 patients without daytime sleepiness (WDS) by analyzing 60-s EEG windows in the waking state. Measures obtained from the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) and the cross-CWD were calculated in the EEG frequency bands delta (0.1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and total band (TB, 0.1-45 Hz). Statistical differences between EDS and WDS groups were found in the delta and theta bands during MWT events (p < 0.0001). The results show that the EDS group presented more power in the theta band, while the WDS group presented higher spectral and cross-spectral entropy in the frontal zone in the delta band. In general, CWD and cross-CWD measures yielded sensitivities and specificities of above 80 %. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was above 0.85 for classifying EDS and WDS patients.

This paper proposes a novel recognition method for Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) from electroencephalography (EEG). In this approach, EEG signals are pre-processed using spectral and time domain filters in order to enhance Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Features are then extracted from the spectral representation after obtaining the spectral principle components. SSVEP target frequency that corresponds to the frequency of a flickering object is determined using a linear classification process. We examined the performance of the proposed approach using two datasets. Results demonstrate a high detection accuracy of an average 96.12% for a 4-second time window and 92.85% for a 2-second time window. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves better detection accuracy compared to traditional methods including canonical correlation analysis and its variants.

Reliability of fully automated versus visually controlled pre- and post-processing of resting-state EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Automated processing; Reliability	INTERRATER RELIABILITY; CLINICAL EEG	Objective: To compare the reliability of a newly developed Matlab (R) toolbox for the fully automated, pre-and post-processing of resting state EEG (automated analysis, AA) with the reliability of analysis involving visually controlled pre-and post-processing (VA). Methods: 34 healthy volunteers (age: median 38.2 (20-49), 82% female) had three consecutive 256-channel resting-state EEG at one year intervals. Results of frequency analysis of AA and VA were compared with Pearson correlation coefficients, and reliability over time was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: Mean correlation coefficient between AA and VA was 0.94 +/- 0.07, mean ICC for AA 0.83 +/- 0.05 and for VA 0.84 +/- 0.07. Conclusion: AA and VA yield very similar results for spectral EEG analysis and are equally reliable. AA is less time-consuming, completely standardized, and independent of raters and their training. Significance: Automated processing of EEG facilitates workflow in quantitative EEG analysis. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we examined the role of these induced brain responses in categorical speech perception (CP), a phenomenon in which similar features are mapped to discrete, common identities despite their equidistant/continuous physical spacing. We recorded neuroelectric activity while participants rapidly classified sounds along a vowel continuum (/u/ to /a/). Time-frequency analyses applied to the EEG revealed distinct temporal dynamics in induced (non-phase locked) oscillations; increased beta (15-30 Hz) coded prototypical vowel sounds carrying well-defined phonetic categories whereas increased gamma (50-70 Hz) accompanied ambiguous tokens near the categorical boundary. Notably, changes in beta activity were strongly correlated with the slope of listeners' psychometric identification functions, a measure of the "steepness" of their categorical percept. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to previously observed evoked (phase-locked) correlates of CP, induced brain activity in the beta-band codes the ambiguity and strength of categorical speech percepts.

Traditional phase synchronisation studies are mostly based on time average synchrony measures, and hence do not preserve the temporal evolution of the phase difference. Here we propose a new method to show the existence of a small set of unique phase synchronised patterns or 'states' in multi-channel EEG recordings, each 'state' being stable of the order of ms, from typical and pathological subjects during face perception tasks. The proposed methodology bridges the concepts of EEG microstates and phase synchronisation in the time and frequency domain, respectively. The analysis is reported for four groups of children including typical, autism spectrum disorder, low and high anxiety subjects-a total of 44. In all cases, we observe consistent existence of these states-termed as synchrostates-within specific cognition-related frequency bands (beta and gamma bands), though the topographies of these synchrostates differ for different subject groups with different pathological conditions. The inter-synchrostate switching follows a well-defined sequence capturing the underlying inter-electrode phase relation dynamics in a stimulus-and person-centric manner. Our study is motivated by the well-known EEG microstate exhibiting stable potential maps over the scalp. However, here we report a similar observation of quasi-stable phase synchronised states in multichannel EEG. The existence of the synchrostates coupled with their unique switching sequence characteristics could be considered as a potentially new field over contemporary EEG phase synchronisation studies.

Apart from CSP analysis's traditional application in time domain, it is extended to consider frequency domain information of EEG signal. After an artifact removal through the independent component analysis (ICA), the multichannel EEG signals are decomposed into a set of spatial patterns by CSP analysis, and the logarithmic frequency domain and time domain power distributions are calculated. Time-frequency power features are extracted on these distributions and optimized by a F-score method. Comparing with the traditional CSP methods, the proposed method not only retained the time domain variance features, but also induced the frequency band power features. Since F-score is easy and fast to calculate, and the F-score based method can quickly select more effective features from high dimensional data, depending on the importance and the discriminative ability of each data pattern. In our method, the F-score algorithm is also used to solve the traditional CSP problems such as the definition of common pattern number. The proposed method was tested on a five-task cognitive state analysis problem, and a recognition accuracy of 89.4% was achieved, that well approved the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Methods: Subjects included six patients with the SB EEG pattern related to OS or EME (Group SB). The results were evaluated in comparison to trace alternant (TA) observed during the neonatal period in nine patients to rule out possible nonspecific relationships between high-frequency activity and periodic EEG patterns (Group TA). EEG was digitally recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz and the analysis was performed in each of the particular bipolar channel-pairs. We visually selected 20 typical consecutive burst sections and 160 inter-burst sections for comparison from the sleep record of each patient and performed the time frequency analysis. We investigated the maximum frequencies of power enhancement in each derivation in both groups. Results: In Group SB, a significant increase in power at a frequency of 80-150 Hz was observed in association with the bursts, particularly in the bilateral parieto-occipital. derivations, in all patients. In Group TA, on the contrary, no significant increase in high-frequency power was found. The maximum frequencies of power enhancement were significantly higher in Group SB than in Group TA (p < 0.001 by repeated-measures ANOVA). Conclusion: Interictal high frequencies of up to 150 Hz were detected in the suppression-burst EEG patterns in epileptic encephalopathy in early infancy. Further studies will be necessary to identify the role of the interictal high-frequency activity in the pathophysiology of such early epileptic encephalopathy.

This provides the possibility to use statistical methods to extract even weak signal components, which occur with each stimulus. For electroencephalographic recordings this concept is limited by inevitable time jitter, which cannot be controlled in all cases. Our study is based on a cross-correlation analysis of trials to alignment trials based on the recorded data. This is demonstrated both with simulated signals and with clinical EEG data, which were recorded intracranially. Special attention is given to the evaluation of the time-frequency resolved phase-locking across multiple trails.	[Testorf, M. E.] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Testorf, M.

Neurofeedback training (NFT) may cause participants to better regulate their brain EEG oscillations. The present study is a double-blind sham-controlled design investigating the effect of NFT on memory. NFT included up-training upper alpha (UA) band, up-training sensory-motor rhythm (SMR) band and sham protocol. Thirty healthy adult volunteers were randomly divided into three treatment groups. NFT sessions (30 min each) took place twice weekly for a total of 10 sessions while memory testing took place pre- and post-training. The results indicate dissociation between SMR and UA NFT and different memory processes. While the SMR protocol resulted in improving automatic, item-specific and familiarity-based processes in memory, the UA protocol resulted in improved strategic and controlled recollection. The implications of the results are discussed.

Although neurons interact across disparate scales, from cortical columns to whole-brain networks, research has been restricted to one scale at a time. We measured local interactions through multi-neuronal recordings while accessing global networks using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in rhesus macaques. We measured spike count correlation, an index of functional connectivity with computational relevance, and EEG oscillations, which have been linked to various cognitive functions. We found a non-monotonic relationship between EEG oscillation amplitude and spike count correlation, contrary to the intuitive expectation of a direct relationship. With a widely used network model, we replicated these findings by incorporating a private signal targeting inhibitory neurons, a common mechanism proposed for gain modulation. Finally, we found that spike count correlation explained nonlinearities in the relationship between EEG oscillations and response time in a spatial selective attention task.

The present study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological features of BN rats, particularly EEG/event-related potential (ERP). EEG activity was recorded at rest and during the auditory sensory gating paradigm under an awake, freely moving condition. Frequency and ERP analysis were performed along with time-frequency analysis of evoked power and intertrial coherence. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats, a well-documented control line, EN rats showed increased EEG power at rest, particularly in the theta and gamma ranges. In ERP analysis, BN rats showed reduced N40-P20 amplitude but normal sensory gating. The rats also showed reduced evoked power and intertrial coherence against auditory stimuli. These results suggest that EN rats show features of EEG/ERP measures clinically relevant to schizophrenia and may provide additional opportunities for translational research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cohen, MX				Cohen, Michael X.			Comparison of different spatial transformations applied to EEG data: A case study of error processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Spatial transformations; Laplacian; Current source density; Beamforming; Connectivity; Time-frequency; Independent components analysis	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; THETA; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ACCURACY; PATTERNS	The purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of different spatial transformations applied to the same scalp-recorded EEG data. The spatial transformations applied are two referencing schemes (average and linked earlobes), the surface Laplacian, and beamforming (a distributed source localization procedure). EEG data were collected during a speeded reaction time task that provided a comparison of activity between error vs. correct responses. Analyses focused on time-frequency power, frequency band-specific inter-electrode connectivity, and within-subject cross-trial correlations between EEG activity and reaction time. Time-frequency power analyses showed similar patterns of midfrontal delta-theta power for errors compared to correct responses across all spatial transformations. Beamforming additionally revealed error-related anterior and lateral prefrontal beta-band activity. Within-subject brain-behavior correlations showed similar patterns of results across the spatial transformations, with the correlations being the weakest after beamforming. The most striking difference among the spatial transformations was seen in connectivity analyses: linked earlobe reference produced weak inter-site connectivity that was attributable to volume conduction (zero phase lag), while the average reference and Laplacian produced more interpretable connectivity results. Beamforming did not reveal any significant condition modulations of connectivity. Overall, these analyses show that some findings are robust to spatial transformations, while other findings, particularly those involving cross-trial analyses or connectivity, are more sensitive and may depend on the use of appropriate spatial transformations.

Measuring Brain Stimulation Induced Changes in Cortical Properties Using TMS-EEG	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Review						Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS); Electroencephalography (EEG); TMS-Evoked potential (TEP); Cortical excitability; Neuromodulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOW-FREQUENCY RTMS; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Neuromodulatory brain stimulation can induce plastic reorganization of cortical circuits that persist beyond the period of stimulation. Most of our current knowledge about the physiological properties has been derived from the motor cortex. The integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for directly probing excitability, connectivity and oscillatory dynamics of regions throughout the brain. Offering in depth measurement of cortical reactivity, TMS-EEG allows the evaluation of TMS-evoked components that may act as a marker for cortical excitation and inhibition. A growing body of research is using concurrent TMS and EEG (TMS-EEG) to explore the effects of different neuromodulatory techniques such as repetitive TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation on cortical function, particularly in non-motor regions. In this review, we outline studies examining TMS-evoked potentials and oscillations before and after, or during a single session of brain stimulation. Investigating these studies will aid in our understanding of mechanisms involved in the modulation of excitability and inhibition by neuroplasticity following different stimulation paradigms.

Thirty male participants completed three 10-min. simulated multitasks: MATB (Multi-Attribute Task Battery) with three workload levels. Twenty-five commonly used mental workload measures were collected, including heart rate, 12 HRV (heart rate variability), 10 EEG (electroencephalography) indices (alpha, beta, theta, alpha/theta, theta/beta from O1-O2 and F4-C4), and two subjective measures. Analyses of index sensitivity showed that two EEG indices, theta and alpha/theta (F4-C4), one time-domain HRV-SDNN (standard deviation of inter-beat intervals), and four frequency-domain HRV: VLF (very low frequency), LF (low frequency), % HF (percentage of high frequency), and LF/HF were sensitive to differentiate high workload. EEG alpha/theta (F4-C4) and LF/HF were most effective for monitoring high mental workload. LF/HF showed the highest correlations with other physiological indices. EEG alpha/theta (F4-C4) showed strong correlations with subjective measures across different mental workload levels. Operation strategy would affect the sensitivity of EEG alpha (F4-C4) and HF.

Thus, there is a need to detect driver drowsiness to counter it. This study analyzes the changes in the electroencephalography (EEG) collected from 4 subjects driving under monotonous road conditions using a driving simulator. The drowsiness level of the subjects is inferred from the time taken to react to events. The results from the analysis of the reaction time shows that drowsiness occurs in cycles, which correspond to short sleep cycles known as 'microsleeps'. The results from a time-frequency analysis of the four frequency bands' power reveals differences between trials with fast and slow reaction times; greater beta band power is present in all subjects, greater alpha power in 2 subjects, greater theta power in 2 subjects, and greater delta power in 3 subjects, for fast reaction trials. Overall, this study shows that reaction time can be used to infer the drowsiness, and subject-specific changes in the EEG band power may be used to infer drowsiness. Thus the study shows a promising prospect of developing Brain-Computer Interface to detect driver drowsiness.

Developing a valid measurement of visual fatigue caused by 3D display remains a big challenge and is beneficial for optimizing the system design. This paper assessed three electroencephalography (EEG) activities, theta, alpha and beta, during a monotonous and repetitive random dot stereogram (RDS) based task in a conventional stereoscopic 3D display. Six types of ratio indices were computed based on EEG data and assessed as possible indicators for stereoscopic visual fatigue detection. The results of critical flicker frequency (CFF) and accommodative amplitude (ACC) showed that the proposed experiment setup can induce visual fatigue. According to the subjective ratings, the visual fatigue accumulated in this task was mostly related to the binocular vision stress of 3D display. Results of EEG data showed stable theta activity, a significant increase of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity over time (p < 0.05). In addition, the effectiveness of EEG indices was evaluated to measure stereoscopic visual fatigue by using grey relation analysis (GRA) and verified by correlating with CFF. The results of analysis suggest that among all nine types of EEG indices (theta, alpha,beta,theta/beta, alpha/beta,alpha/theta,theta/(alpha + beta), (alpha + theta)/beta, (alpha + theta)/(alpha + beta)), alpha is the most promising indicator for detecting stereoscopic visual fatigue.

Although some macro effects are known, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. tDCS in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) could help to understand these mechanisms from a neural point of view. However, simultaneous tDCS-EEG still remains challenging because of the artifacts that affect the recorded signals. In this paper, an automated artifact cancelation method based on adaptive filtering is proposed. Using independent component analysis (ICA), the artifacts were characterized using data from both a phantom and a group of healthy subjects. The resulting filter can successfully remove tDCS-related artifacts during anodal and cathodal stimulations.

To be of added value, neural measures should significantly increase predictive power, beyond conventional measures. In the present study, the authors obtain both stated preference measures and neural measures (electroencephalography; EEG) in response to advertisements for commercially released movies (i.e., movie trailers) to probe their potential to provide insight into participants' individual preferences as well as movie sales in the general population. The results show that EEG measures (beta and gamma oscillations), beyond stated preference measures, provide unique information regarding individual and population-wide preference and can thus, in principle, be used as a neural marker for commercial success. As such, these results provide the first evidence that EEG measures are related to real-world outcomes and that these neural measures can significantly add to models predicting choice behavior relative to models that include only stated preference measures.

A cortical source localization analysis of resting EEG data after remifentanil infusion	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Analgesics; Cognitive; EEG; Remifentanil; Source localization	CONTINUOUS REACTION-TIMES; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; PAIN; BRAIN; RESOLUTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SLORETA; ATLAS	Objective: To explore changes in current source density locations after remifentanil infusion in healthy volunteers using source localization of the electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: EEG data was collected from 21 males using a 62-electrode system. Additionally, cognitive performance was evaluated by a continuous reaction time paradigm, and pain scores were obtained for experimental bone and heat stimuli. Data were recorded before and during treatment with remifentanil and placebo. Source localization was performed by sLORETA at delta (1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta1 (12.1-18 Hz), and beta2 (18.1-30 Hz) frequency bands. Results: Pre-treatment recordings demonstrated reproducible source characteristics. The alterations (i.e., pre-versus post-treatment) due to remifentanil were significantly and robustly different from placebo infusions. The results indicated that neurons in several brain areas including inferior frontal gyrus and insula at frontal lobe oscillated more strongly after remifentanil infusion compared to placebo. Furthermore, the source activity at delta band was correlated with continuous reaction time index. Conclusions: These results indicate that alterations in brain oscillations during remifentanil are mostly localized to frontal, fronto-temporal and fronto-central lobes and related to cognitive function. Significance: The approach offers the potential to be used for understanding the underlying mechanism of action of remifentanil on brain activity.

This approach facilitates realistic characterization of the oscillations observed in living systems, including the observation of transitions in dynamics which were not considered previously. The novelty of this approach necessitated the development of a new set of methods for the inference of the dynamics and interactions present in chronotaxic systems. These methods, based on Bayesian inference and detrended fluctuation analysis, can identify chronotaxicity in phase dynamics extracted from a single time series. Here, they are applied to numerical examples and real experimental electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We also review the current methods, including their assumptions and limitations, elaborate on their implementation, and discuss future perspectives.

J	Basar, E; Tulay, E; Guntekin, B				Basar, Erol; Tulay, Elif; Guntekin, Bahar			Multiple gamma oscillations in the brain: A new strategy to differentiate functional correlates and P300 dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Event related oscillations; Gamma; P300; ITC; ERSP	COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; BAND RESPONSES; ATTENTION; STIMULATION; CORTEX; MEMORY	Brain oscillations in the gamma frequency band, - i.e. oscillations greater than 25 Hz - have attracted increasing attention over the last few decades in the research of sensory-cognitive processes. In the neuroscience research literature, a great number of reports aim to describe the functional correlates of oscillatory responses in the gamma frequency window. However, analysis using a broadband frequency window often leads to divergent functional interpretations and controversies. In order to provide a more exact approach, we have used a strategy by defining multiple frequency and multiple time windows according to the combined analysis of conventional power spectral windows, frequency adaptive multiple filters, and inter-trial coherence. The analysis in frequency windows of 25-30 Hz, 30-35 Hz, and 4048 Hz enables the investigator to provide a distinction of cognitive and/or sensory responses. Moreover, according to topological differentiation and the consideration of neuroanatomic pathways, more reliable interpretations of gamma responses are reached. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, the origin of spontaneous BOLD oscillations remains elusive. Specifically, the coupling of regional hemodynamic LFOs to neuronal activity in a resting brain is rarely examined directly. Here we present a method based on instantaneous-frequency (IF) analysis to detect regional LFOs of cerebral blood flow (CBF) along with local-field potential (LFP) changes of neurons in resting state to study neurovascular coupling. CBF and LFP were simultaneously acquired using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and electroencephalography in the rat's somatosensory cortex with high temporal resolution (i.e., 20Hz for CBF and 2kHz for LDF, respectively). Instead of fast Fourier transform analysis, a peak-detection algorithm was used to define the LFP activities and CBF spontaneous oscillations in the time domain and the time lapses were used to calculate the IFs of hemodynamic (i.e., CBF) oscillations and neuronal (i.e., LFP) activities. Our results showed that the CBF mostly oscillated at similar to 0.1Hz with a full-half-bandwidth of [0.08Hz, 0.15Hz]. In addition, the maximal frequency of LFP firings was also approximately at 0.1Hz, which collaborated with to the frequency of CBF oscillations. Interestingly, CBF increased linearly with the LFP activity up to 0.15Hz (r=0.93), and both signals then decreased rapidly as a function of activity frequency. This indicates the spontaneous hemodynamic LFOs were associated with neuronal activities, thus confirming the neuronal origin of the hemodynamic oscillations.

Most studies utilizing the HHT for extracting features in seizure prediction have used intracranial EEG recordings. Invasive implants in the cortex have unknown long term consequences and pose the risk of complications during surgery. This added risk dimension makes them unsuitable for continuous monitoring as would be the requirement in a Body Area Network. We present an HHT-based system on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for predicting epileptic seizures using scalp EEG. We use bandwidth features of Intrinsic Mode Functions and obtain a classification accuracy of close to 100% using patient-specific classifiers in software.

The aim of this study was to determine if time-frequency (TF) analysis, followed by EEG source localization, would improve the detection and identification of epileptogenic and related activity. Seventeen patients with refractory frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) were studied using video EEG recording. TF analysis identified the first epileptogenic EEG changes. Using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, we compared brain electromagnetic tomographic (BET) images, constructed from the TF domain, with BET images constructed from the time domain only. We determined if the localization identified by BET images was concordant with the localization from medical history and video EEG recording. TF analysis provided a clear display of subtle EEG features, including EEG lateralization, and more concordant and delimited epileptogenic zones, compared with time-domain source analysis. In conclusion, EEG TF analysis improves source localization. After a thorough validation, this methodology could become a useful noninvasive tool for localizing the epileptogenic zone in clinical practice.

These abilities lay the foundation for effective language acquisition; allowing infants to hone in on the sounds of their native language. Invasive procedures in animals and scalp-recorded potentials from human adults suggest that simultaneous, rhythmic activity (oscillations) between and within brain regions are fundamental to sensory development; determining the resolution with which incoming stimuli are parsed. At this time, little is known about oscillatory dynamics in human infant development. However, animal neurophysiology and adult EEG data provide the basis for a strong hypothesis that rapid auditory processing in infants is mediated by oscillatory synchrony in discrete frequency bands. In order to investigate this, 128-channel, high-density EEG responses of 4-month old infants to frequency change in tone pairs, presented in two rate conditions (Rapid: 70 msec ISI and Control: 300 msec ISI) were examined. To determine the frequency band and magnitude of activity, auditory evoked response averages were first co-registered with ageappropriate brain templates. Next, the principal components of the response were identified and localized using a two-dipole model of brain activity. Single-trial analysis of oscillatory power showed a robust index of frequency change processing in bursts of Theta band (3 - 8 Hz) activity in both right and left auditory cortices, with left activation more prominent in the Rapid condition. These methods have produced data that are not only some of the first reported evoked oscillations analyses in infants, but are also, importantly, the product of a well-established method of recording and analyzing clean, meticulously collected, infant EEG and ERPs. In this article, we describe our method for infant EEG net application, recording, dynamic brain response analysis, and representative results.

However, the question of the presence of the true alpha rhythm in the case of visual dysfunctions is controversial. We performed an autocorrelation analysis of the rhythmic parameters of alpha activity in the occipital cortical areas of children, teenagers, and youths (age from 8 to 20 years) having different visual acuity. Five types of rhythmicity of alpha activity, the character of which was dependent on the shaping time of visual dysfunctions, have been differentiated. We found that congenital bilateral visual dysfunctions determine significant decreases in the periodicity and stability of alpha activity; a low-steady aperiodical alpha-like activity was observed in 45% of the recpective cases.

Real-Time Hybrid Ocular Artifact Detection and Removal for Single Channel EEG	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	MAY 21-23, 2015	Dekalb, IL	IEEE		Algebraic Method; Electroencephalograph (EEG); Ocular Artifact; Online removal; Wavelet Transform		Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising technique to record brain activities in natural settings. However, EEG signals are usually contaminated by Ocular Artifacts (OA) such as eye blink activities. Removal of OA is critical to obtain clean EEG signals required for the feature extraction and classification. With the increasing interest in wearable technologies, single channel EEG systems are becoming more prevalent. Such ambulatory devices require real-time signal processing for immediate feedback. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm to detect and remove OA from single channel EEG signal using NeuroMonitor hardware platform. The algorithm first detects the eye blinks (OA zone) using Algebraic approach, and then removes artifact from OA zone using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition method. De-noising technique is applied only to the OA zone to keep the critical neural information intact. The OA removal algorithm is applied to the online data for 0.5 sec epoch length. The performance evaluation is carried out qualitatively and quantitatively using time-frequency analysis, mean square coherence and other statistical parameters, i.e. Correlation Coefficient and Mutual Information. Processing time for DWT was significantly lower (x25) to that of SWT. This proposed hybrid OA removal algorithm demonstrates real-time execution with sufficient accuracy.

Time-Varying Spectral Analysis of Single-Channel EEG: Application in Affective Protocol	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Emotions; Single-channel EEG; Adaptive autoregressive model (AAR); Affective protocol	MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; REMOVAL; EMOTION; BRAIN; BAND	Neural correlates of emotions have been widely investigated using noninvasive sensor modalities. These approaches are often characterized by a low level of usability and are not practical for real-life situations. The aim of this study is to show that a single electroencephalography (EEG) electrode placed in the central region of the scalp is able to discriminate emotionally characterized events with respect to a baseline period. Emotional changes were induced using an imagery approach based on the recall of autobiographical events characterized by four basic emotions: "Happiness", "Fear", "Anger", and "Sadness". Data from 17 normal subjects were recorded at the Cz position according to the International 10-20 system. After preprocessing and artifact detection phases, raw signals were analyzed through a time-variant adaptive autoregressive model to extract EEG characteristic spectral components. Five frequency bands, i.e., the classical EEG rhythms, were considered, namely the delta band (delta) (1-4 Hz), the theta band (theta) (4-6 Hz), the alpha band (alpha) (6-12 Hz), the beta band (beta) (12-30 Hz), and the gamma band (gamma) (30-50 Hz). The relative powers of the EEG rhythms were used as features to compare the experimental conditions. Our results show statistically significant differences when comparing the power content in the gamma band of baseline events versus emotionally characterized events. Particularly, a significant increase in gamma band relative power was found in 3 out of 4 emotionally characterized events ("Happiness", "Sadness", and "Anger"). In agreement with previous studies, our findings confirm the presence of a possible correlation between broader high-frequency cortical activation and affective processing of the brain. The present study shows that a single EEG electrode could potentially be used for the assessment of the emotional state with a minimally invasive setup.

The object of study is the process of extracting the EEG phenomena. The subject of study is time-frequency analysis methods of EEG signals. The purpose of the work is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of psychological, psycho-somatic, neurotic and cognitive disorders. A review of electroencephalographic process and EEG artifacts was given. Types of EEG rhythms and phenomena, that have specific timefrequency characteristics, were considered. A method for electroencephalographic phenomena selection that is based on the extreme values analysis of spectral density function of smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution was proposed. Proposed method was compared with the short-time Fourier transform. As a quality criteria for analyzed methods was chosen the time-frequency resolution of obtained spectral density functions. Computational experiments on EEG epochs set that contains high-frequency phenomena were made. Software that automates EEG analysis process and builds results visualization was developed. The experimental results show the advantages of this approach in the time-frequency resolution compared with short-time Fourier transform, and allow to recommend the proposed method for practical use for EEG rhythms separation and high-frequency phenomena selection.

The outcome of the clinical tests and the evaluation of the kinematic parameters recorded with the robotic device concurred to highlight an improved motor recovery of the impaired limb despite the age of the patient, his compromised motor function, and the start of rehabilitation at the 3rd week post stroke. The time frequency and functional source analysis of the HR-EEG signals permitted to quantify the functional changes occurring in the brain in association with the rehabilitation motor tasks, and to highlight the recovery of the neuro-motor function.

Bilinguals perform these transformations in native and non-native languages, deriving unified semantic concepts from equivalent, but acoustically different words. Here we exploit this capacity of bilinguals to investigate input invariant semantic representations in the brain. We acquired EEG data while Dutch subjects, highly proficient in English listened to four monosyllabic and acoustically distinct animal words in both languages (e.g., "paard" - "horse"). Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was applied to identify EEG response patterns that discriminate between individual words within one language (within-language discrimination) and generalize meaning across two languages (across-language generalization). Furthermore, employing two EEG feature selection approaches, we assessed the contribution of temporal and oscillatory EEG features to our classification results. MVPA revealed that within-language discrimination was possible in a broad time-window (similar to 50-620 ms) after word onset probably reflecting acoustic-phonetic and semantic-conceptual differences between the words. Most interestingly, significant across-language generalization was possible around 550-600 ms, suggesting the activation of common semantic-conceptual representations from the Dutch and English nouns. Both types of classification, showed a strong contribution of oscillations below 12 Hz, indicating the importance of low frequency oscillations in the neural representation of individual words and concepts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of MVPA to decode individual spoken words from EEG responses and to assess the spectro-temporal dynamics of their language invariant semantic-conceptual representations. We discuss how this method and results could be relevant to track the neural mechanisms underlying conceptual encoding in comprehension and production.

As with many signal processing algorithms, a larger time window results in more accurate and less noisy results but at the cost of a lower temporal resolution. In this paper, a range of window sizes (in samples per second) is examined using a synthetic test signal and, based on this analysis, the window size selection is made for a hardware implementation of the modulation index CFC algorithm. We found the optimized window length is 512 samples/second for EEG signals. An ASIC has been created from this design using the IBM 0.18 micron process with a chip size of 3mm x 3mm with 191mW power consumption and is currently being tested.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we explored whether resonant responses of sensorimotor cortex to the pain of others are modulated by the ethnicity of these others. White participants watched video clips of ethnic ingroup and outgroup hands, being either penetrated by a needle syringe or touched by a cotton swab, while EEG was recorded. Time/frequency analysis was applied to Laplacian-transformed signals from the sensors overlying sensorimotor cortex in order to assess event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) of sensorimotor mu (7-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms. When watching needle injections, beta ERD was significantly stronger for ingroup compared with outgroup hands. This ethnicity bias was restricted to painful actions, as beta ERD for ingroup and outgroup hands neither differed when observing no-pain videos, nor during presentation of the hands without any treatment. Such vicarious sensorimotor activation could play a role in social interaction by enhancing the understanding of the feelings and reactions of others and hence facilitating behavioral coordination among group members.

Discrete Scale Invariance of Human Large EEG Voltage Deflections is More Prominent in Waking than Sleep Stage 2	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; neuronal avalanche; scale invariance; discrete scale invariance; EEG; human; sleep; electroencephalography	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS; CORTEX	Electroencephalography (EEG) is typically viewed through the lens of spectral analysis. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that the underlying neuronal dynamics are characterized by scale-free avalanches. These results suggest that techniques from statistical physics may be used to analyze EEG signals. We utilized a publicly available database of fourteen subjects with waking and sleep stage 2 EEG tracings per subject, and observe that power-law dynamics of critical-state neuronal avalanches are not sufficient to fully describe essential features of EEG signals. We hypothesized that this could reflect the phenomenon of discrete scale invariance (DSI) in EEG large voltage deflections (LVDs) as being more prominent in waking consciousness. We isolated LVDs, and analyzed logarithmically transformed LVD size probability density functions (PDF) to assess for DSI. We find evidence of increased DSI in waking, as opposed to sleep stage 2 consciousness. We also show that the signatures of DSI are specific for EEG LVDs, and not a general feature of fractal simulations with similar statistical properties to EEG. Removing only LVDs from waking EEG produces a reduction in power in the alpha and beta frequency bands. These findings may represent a new insight into the understanding of the cortical dynamics underlying consciousness.

However, less has been investigated in infant EEG, and EEG rhythms in infants at early ages have not been well characterized in terms of their frequency ranges. In the present pilot study, we investigated rhythmic activities in infant EEG recorded weekly from 4-8 months using high-density EEG sensor nets. The developmental changes of EEG rhythms in different frequency bands along maturation were evaluated through spectral analysis. Their longitudinal scalp maps were also studied to understand their plausible functional correlates. The present study aims to enrich the sparse knowledge about the developing patterns of EEG rhythms within the first year of life from EEG recordings of high temporal and spatial resolutions.

The aim of this study was to compare visual-motor integrated processing between execution and inhibition of a motor response using event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in the 15- to 80-Hz range and to investigate a relationship between event-related potentials (ERPs) and ERS/ERD in 10 normal young subjects. Methods: EEGs were recorded from 21 scalp sites during a visual go/no-go paradigm. For ERPs, 40 artifact-free trials were averaged off-line referenced to linked ear lobes. In the beta and gamma bands, ERS and ERD were calculated by time-frequency analysis. Results: Go N2 and no-go N2 were elicited 200-250 ms after stimuli, and their distributions were predominant at Fz. Go P3 was predominantly elicited 340-360 ms after stimuli at Pz, whereas no-go P3 was predominantly elicited 360-380 ms after stimuli at Cz. ERD of the beta band at Fz and Cz during 300-600 ms showed in the go condition, whereas ERD showed between 39 and 42 Hz at F3 in the no-go condition. Conclusion: Oscillatory cortical response-related beta and gamma activities differ between the processing of execution and inhibition in motor responses. beta ERDs in the sensorimotor areas with go stimuli may be related to motor responses, and gamma ERDs in the left frontal area with no-go stimuli may be involved in the processing of inhibition of motor responses.

A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS, etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multiscale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multiway (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or "atoms.'' We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams-an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via multiway partial least squares and coupled matrix-tensor factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other scientific domains.

The present study uses time-frequency analysis to determine the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) characteristics underlying emotional conflict processing. Our behavioral results replicate previous findings of shorter response times and fewer response errors under the congruent condition relative to the incongruent condition, indicating a robust interference effect. Theta oscillatory activity was larger for the incongruent than for the congruent condition over frontal and frontal-central midline areas, reflecting a greater need for control under conditions of conflict. Moreover, the theta power difference was negatively associated with the RT difference, indicating that greater theta power leads to better behavioral performance. The present findings provide evidence that the theta oscillation is necessary for the control of emotional conflict. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wavelet-based analysis of spectral rearrangements of EEG patterns and of non-stationary correlations	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Correlation of EEG channels; Continuous wavelet transform; Spectral integrals	COHERENCE ANALYSIS; SLEEP SPINDLES; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSFORM; DYNAMICS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DISCHARGES	In this paper we present a novel technique of studying EEG signals taking into account their essential nonstationarity. The bursts of activity in EEG rhythm are modeled as a superposition of specially designed elementary signals against the background of a real EEG record at rest. To calculate the time variation of quantitative characteristics of EEG patterns we propose the algorithm based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) followed by the analysis of spectral integral dynamics in a given frequency range. We introduce new quantitative parameters to describe the dynamics of spectral properties both for each burst of brain activity and for their ensemble. Based on the given model we have identified the appearance and disappearance of patterns in EEG rhythm. The problem of non-stationary correlation of different EEG channels is solved. The use of the techniques for analyzing and classifying transient processes related to the activity of human central nervous system is also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chaitanya, G; Sinha, S; Narayanan, M; Satishchandra, P				Chaitanya, Ganne; Sinha, Sanjib; Narayanan, Mariyappa; Satishchandra, Parthasarthy			Scalp high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in absence epilepsy: An independent component analysis (ICA) based approach	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Absence seizures; High frequency oscillations; Independent component analysis; Ripples	SEIZURE ONSET ZONE; FULL-BAND EEG; INFRASLOW ACTIVITY; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; WAVE DISCHARGES; 80-500 HZ; CHILDHOOD; GENERATORS; MARKER; SPIKE	Background: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have provided a new insight in understanding ictogenesis and seizure localization. In absence seizures, HFOs were predominantly localized in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in MEG studies. Methods: We studied HFOs (80-250 Hz) in scalp EEGs in patients with absence epilepsy, and evaluated their frequency bandwidth and spatial-temporal distribution. EEG of 9 patients with absence epilepsy (CAE:JAE-8:1; M:F=7:2; age: 8.1 +/- 2.1 years; age at onset: 6.6 +/- 1.3 years) were evaluated with scalp EEG (sampling rate: 2048 Hz). Finite impulse response filters on the unipolar or longitudinal bipolar montages were band-passed between 80 and 250 Hz using Cartool (R) and EEGLAB (R). Sensitivity and paper speed were modified accordingly to study the HFOs. Thousand four hundred and thirty eight artifact free 'spike-wave' epileptiform discharges were analyzed. Sleep ictal SW discharges, defined as runs of 3 Hz GSWDs lasting >= 4s in stages 1 and 2 sleep, were analyzed by independent component analysis and component time-frequency and channel time-frequency maps using cyclical tapering wavelet transform. A total of 926 HFOs were identified of 1438 GSWDS. Results: The HFOs were associated with inter-ictal generalized spike-wave discharges (IiGSWDs-241/454), ictal GSWDs (IcGSWD-634/884), sporadic SWDs (sSWDs-51/100). The percentage of HFOs was higher in IcGSWD when compared to both IiGSWDs and sporadic SWDs together (chi(2) = 52.864, d.o.f = 1, p < 0.0001). The mean frequency of HFOs was 96.4 +/- 10.4 Hz. A channel wise analysis showed the maximum HFO band width in the right fronto-central region (F4 = 28 Hz, C4 = 24 Hz). Conclusion: Narrow bandwidth interictal and ictal HFOs can be identified in scalp EEG of patients with absence epilepsy. Further characterization of the various properties of pHFOs will be helpful in opening up a domain of clinical evaluation and interpretation of the various epileptic disorders. To improve the insights into the onset and spread of absence seizures, and to study the network properties, one could analyze the HFOs in high density EEG arrays with multimodal integration using MEG or fMRI.

Nonlinear approaches such as time-variant bispectral analysis are able to provide information about phase relations between oscillatory signal components. Methods: Time-variant QPC analysis is commonly performed using Gabor transform (GT) or Morlet wavelet transform (MWT), and is affected by either constant or frequency-dependent time-frequency resolution (TFR). The matched Gabor transform (MGT), which emerges from the incorporation of GT into MP, can overcome this obstacle by providing a complex time-frequency plane with an individually tailored TFR for each transient oscillatory component. QPC analysis was performed by MGT, and MWT was used as the state-of-the-art method for comparison. Results: Results were demonstrated using simulated data, which present the general case of QPC, and biomedical benchmark data with a priori knowledge about specific signal components. HRV of children during temporal lobe epilepsy and EEG during burst-interburst pattern of neonates during quiet sleep were used for the biomedical signal analysis to investigate the two main areas of biomedical signal analysis: The cardiovascular-cardiorespiratory system and neurophysiological brain activities, respectively. Simulations were able to show the applicability and reliability of the MGT for bispectral analysis. HRV and EEG analysis demonstrate the general validity of the MGT for QPC detection by quantifying statistically significant time patterns of QPC. Conclusion and Significance: Results confirm that MGT-based bispectral analysis provides significant benefits for the analysis of QPC in biomedical signals.

As the trial-to-trial variation is evitable in EEG signals, it is a challenge to capture the consistent classification features distribution. Clustering EEG trials with similar features and utilizing a specific classifier adjusted to each cluster can improve EEG classification. In this paper, instead of measuring the similarity of ERP features, the brain states during image stimuli presentation that evoked N1 responses were used to group EEG trials. The correlation between momentary phases of pre-stimulus EEG oscillations and N1 amplitudes was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the phases of time-frequency points about 5.3 Hz and 0.3 s before the stimulus onset have significant effect on the ERP classification accuracy. Our findings revealed that N1 components in ERP fluctuated with momentary phases of EEG. We also further studied the influence of pre-stimulus momentary phases on classification of N1 features. Results showed that linear classifiers demonstrated outstanding classification performance when training and testing trials have close momentary phases. Therefore, this gave us a new direction to improve EEG classification by grouping EEG trials with similar pre-stimulus phases and using each to train unit classifiers respectively.

Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring. New method: Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EGG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results: The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class "one-against-all" SVM and linear-discriminant analysis. Conclusion: The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.

This assumption, although fundamental, has never been tested. We used intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the human hippocampus in two independent experiments to investigate the neural dynamics underlying WM maintenance. We observed periodic fluctuations between two different oscillatory regimes: Periods of "memory activation'' were reflected by load-dependent alpha power reductions and lower levels of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). They occurred interleaved with periods characterized by load-independent high levels of alpha power and CFC. During memory activation periods, a relevant CFC parameter (load-dependent changes of the peak modulated frequency) correlated with individual WM capacity. Fluctuations between these two periods predicted successful performance and were locked to the phase of endogenous delta oscillations. These results show that hippocampal maintenance is a dynamic rather than constant process and depends critically on a hierarchy of oscillations.

The DMN is routinely identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). However, both of these methods impose restrictions on the groups of patients that can be examined. We show that the DMN can also be identified by electroencephalography (EEG). Instructing subjects to alternate between self-referential memory recall and focusing on their breathing induces a spatial pattern of spectral band power modulation in the theta- and alpha-band (4-16 Hz) that is consistent with the DMN pattern observed with PET and fMRI. Since EEG is a portable, cheap, and safe technology, our work enables the characterization of DMN alterations in patient groups that are difficult to study with fMRI or PET.

Cortical inhibition of distinct mechanisms in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is related to working memory performance: A TMS-EEG study	CORTEX			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Electroencephalography; Cortical inhibition; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Working memory	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; RESPONSES; GABA(B); OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION; DEPRESSION; SYNCHRONIZATION; ARTIFACTS	Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is a method for studying cortical inhibition from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs) from this region, let alone inhibition of these components. The aim of this study was to assess cortical inhibition of distinct TEPs and oscillations in the DLPFC using TMS-EEG and to investigate the relationship of these mechanisms to working memory. 30 healthy volunteers received single and paired (interstimulus interval = 100 msec) TMS to the left DLPFC. Variations in long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) of different TEP peaks (N40, P60, N100) and different TMS-evoked oscillations (alpha, lower beta, upper beta, gamma) were compared between individuals. Variation in N100 slope following single pulse TMS, another putative marker of inhibition, was also compared with LICI of each measure. Finally, these measures were correlated with performance of a working memory task. LICI resulted in significant suppression of all TEP peaks and TMS-evoked oscillations (all p < .05). There were no significant correlations between LICI of different TEP peaks or TMS-evoked oscillations with the exception of P60 and N100. Variation in N100 slope correlated with LICI of N40 and beta oscillations. In addition, LICI of P60 and N100 were differentially correlated with working memory performance. The results suggest that both the LICI paradigm and N100 following single pulse TMS reflect complementary methods for assessing GABA(B)-mediated cortical inhibition in the DLPFC. Furthermore, these measures demonstrate the importance of prefrontal GABA(B)-mediated inhibitory control for working memory performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Distinguishing rhythmic from non-rhythmic brain activity during rest in healthy neurocognitive aging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Rhythms; Resting activity; Electroencephalography; Aging; Theta oscillations; Delta oscillations; Alpha oscillations	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OSCILLATION DETECTION METHOD; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EEG RHYTHMS; ALPHA; POWER; SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZATION	Rhythmic brain activity at low frequencies (<12 Hz) during rest are thought to increase in neurodegenerative disease, but findings in healthy neurocognitive aging are mixed. Here we address two reasons conventional spectral analyses may have led to inconsistent results. First, spectral-power measures are compared to a baseline condition; when resting activity is the signal of interest, it is unclear what the baseline should be. Second, conventional methods do not clearly differentiate power due to rhythmic versus non-rhythmic activity. The Better OSCillation detection method (BOSC; Caplan et al., 2001; Whitten et al., 2011) avoids these problems by using the signal's own spectral characteristics as a reference to detect elevations in power lasting a few cycles. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signal during rest, alternating eyes open and closed, in healthy younger (18-25 years) and older (60-74 years) participants. Topographic plots suggested the conventional and BOSC analyses measured different sources of activity, particularly at frequencies, like delta (1-4 Hz), at which rhythms are sporadic; topographies were more similar in the 8-12 Hz alpha band. There was little theta-band activity meeting the BOSC method's criteria, suggesting prior findings of theta power in healthy aging may reflect non-rhythmic signal. In contrast, delta oscillations were present at higher levels than theta in both age groups. In summary, applying strict and standardized criteria for rhythmicity, slow rhythms appear present in the resting brain at delta and alpha, but not theta frequencies, and appear unchanged in healthy aging.

The methodology relies on short-time analysis with time and frequency domain features followed by unsupervised feature subspace clustering. For each cluster of the feature space a different classification setup is adopted thus fine-tuning the classification algorithm to the specifics of the corresponding feature subspace area. The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology achieved a sleep stage classification accuracy equal to 92.53%, which corresponds to an improvement of approximately 3% compared to the best performing single classifier without applying clustering of the feature space.

Analysis and Prediction of the Freezing of Gait Using EEG Brain Dynamics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomedical signal processing; electroencephalogram; freeing of gait (FOG); movement disorders; Parkinson's disease (PD)	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR; ENTROPY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PATHOGENESIS; COMPLEXITY; FEATURES	Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a common symptom in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), which significantly affects patients' quality of life. Treatment options offer limited benefit and there are currently no mechanisms able to effectively detect FOG before it occurs, allowing time for a sufferer to avert a freezing episode. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a novel technique that may be able to address this problem. In this paper, we investigated the univariate and multivariate EEG features determined by both Fourier and wavelet analysis in the confirmation and prediction of FOG. The EEG power measures and network properties from 16 patients with PD and FOG were extracted and analyzed. It was found that both power spectral density and wavelet energy could potentially act as biomarkers during FOG. Information in the frequency domain of the EEG was found to provide better discrimination of EEG signals during transition to freezing than information coded in the time domain. The performance of the FOG prediction systems improved when the information from both domains was used. This combination resulted in a sensitivity of 86.0%, specificity of 74.4%, and accuracy of 80.2% when predicting episodes of freezing, outperforming current accelerometry-based tools for the prediction of FOG.

Frontal-posterior theta oscillations reflect memory retrieval during sentence comprehension	CORTEX			English	Article						Sentence comprehension; Time-frequency analysis; Source localization; Theta oscillations; Verbal working memory	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-ORDER; MIDLINE THETA; LONG-TERM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LINGUISTIC COMPLEXITY; INTEGRATIVE FUNCTIONS	Successful working-memory retrieval requires that items be retained as distinct units. At the neural level, it has been shown that theta-band oscillatory power increases with the number of to-be-distinguished items during working-memory retrieval. Here we hypothesized that during sentence comprehension, verbal-working-memory retrieval demands lead to increased theta power over frontal cortex, supposedly supporting the distinction amongst stored items during verbal-working-memory retrieval. Also, synchronicity may increase between the frontal cortex and the posterior cortex, with the latter supposedly supporting item retention. We operationalized retrieval by using pronouns, which refer to and trigger the retrieval of antecedent nouns from a preceding sentence part. Retrieval demand was systematically varied by changing the pronoun antecedent: Either, it was non-embedded in the preceding main clause, and thus easy-to-retrieve across a single clause boundary, or embedded in the preceding subordinate clause, and thus hard-to-retrieve across a double clause boundary. We combined electroencephalography (EEG), scalp-level time frequency analysis, source localization, and source-level coherence analysis, observing a frontal-midline and broad left-hemispheric theta-power increase for embedded-antecedent compared to non-embedded-antecedent retrieval. Sources were localized to left-frontal, left-parietal, and bilateral-inferior-temporal cortices. Coherence analyses suggested synchronicity between left-frontal and left-parietal and between left-frontal and right-inferior-temporal cortices. Activity of an array of left-frontal, left-parietal, and bilateral-inferior-temporal cortices may thus assist retrieval during sentence comprehension, potentially indexing the orchestration of item distinction, verbal working memory, and long-term memory. Our results extend prior findings by mapping prior knowledge on the functional role of theta oscillations onto processes genuine to human sentence comprehension. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to their low amplitude, short duration, and variability in patterns, the visual identification of HFOs in long-term continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) is cumbersome. The aim of our study is to improve and automatize the detection of HFO patterns by developing analysis tools based on an unsupervised k-means clustering method exploring the time-frequency content of iEEG. The clustering approach successfully isolated HFOs from noise, artifacts, and arbitrary spikes. We tested this technique on three subjects. Using this algorithm we were able to localize the seizure onset area in all of the subjects. The channel with maximum number of HFOs was associated with the seizure onset.

In this paper, we have extracted electroencephalography (EEG) signals from Broca's area with an EEG headband which consists of two inexpensive stainless steel electrodes without employing any noise treating hardware. Broca's area is a center in brain that stores language related knowledge. Sensory signals from skin act as interferences while a user is operating a BCI in real time environment. In this paper, the characterization of those unwanted sensory signals is done in a much simpler way. By passing the amplitude normalized neural signals through low pass filters with different cut off frequencies, it is found that transient response of neural networks in Broca's area is an under damped response. From the results of this analysis, corresponding neural network is modeled as a control system with second order transfer function by using natural frequency and damping ratio values.	[Kumar, T.

In order to quantitatively analyze the nonlinear functional coupling characteristics of EEG and EMG on a multiple time scale, a multiscale transfer entropy (MSTE) method based on the transfer entropy theory is proposed. Considering the multiscale characteristics of EEG and EMG signals, the EEG and EMG signals are firstly decomposed into multiscale ones, respectively, to show the information on different time scales. Then the signals on different time scales are decomposed into different frequency bands to show the frequency domain characteristics. Finally, the EEG and EMG in different frequency bands on different scales are calculated by the MSTE method to obtain the FCMC characteristics on different time scales and in coupling frequency bands. In this study the MSTE is used to quantitatively analyze the nonlinear functional connection between EEG over the brain scalp and the surface EMG from the flexor digitorum surerficialis (FDS), which are recorded simultaneously during grip task with steady-state force output. In the process of data processing, the coarse graining method is introduced firstly to decompose the EEG and EMG recorded in the task. Secondly, MSTEs between EEG and EMG on various scales are calculated to describe the nonlinear FCMC characteristics in different pathways (EEG -> EMG and EMG -> EEG). Furthermore, a significant indicator of MSTE is defined to quantitatively analyze the discrepancy between FCMC interaction strengths in the specific frequency band. The results show that the functional corticomuscular coupling is significant in both descending (EEG -> EMG) and ascending (EMG -> EEG) directions in the beta-band (15-35 Hz) in the static force output stage, especially that the interaction strength in descending direction is stronger in beta2-band (15-35 Hz) than that in the ascending direction. Meanwhile, the maximum FCMC strength value and the maximum or minimum discrepancy value between coupling directions on different scales almost occur on the high scales (15-30). Our study confirms that beta oscillations of EEG travel bidirectionally between the sensorimotor cortex and contralateral muscles in the sensorimotor loop system, and beta2 band is likely to reflect the motor control commands from the cortex to the muscle. Additionally, the discrepancy varies on different time scales and in different coupling frequency bands. The results show that the MSTE can quantitatively estimate the nonlinear interconnection and functional corticomuscular coupling between the sensorimotor cortex and the muscle.

A decision about the presence of epileptiform activity in EEG signals is made by quadratic classifiers designed in the reduced two-dimensional feature space. The accuracy of the technique was tested on three sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded at the University Hospital Bonn: surface EEG signals from healthy volunteers, intracranial EEG signals from the epilepsy patients during the seizure free interval from within the seizure focus and intracranial EEG signals of epileptic seizures also from within the seizure focus. An overall detection accuracy of 98.7% was achieved.

We can monitor the DoA by observing the patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the surgical procedure. Typically high frequency EEG signals indicates the patient is conscious, while low frequency signals mean the patient is in a general anaesthetic state. If the anaesthetist is able to observe the instantaneous frequency changes of the patient's EEG signals during surgery this can help to better regulate and monitor DoA, reducing surgical and post-operative risks. This paper describes an approach towards the development of a 3D real-time visualization application which can show the instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of EEG simultaneously by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). HHT uses the EMD method to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The Hilbert spectral analysis method is then used to obtain instantaneous frequency data. The HHT provides a new method of analyzing non-stationary and nonlinear time series data. We investigate this approach by analyzing EEG data collected from patients undergoing surgical procedures. The results show that the EEG differences between three distinct surgical stages computed by using sample entropy (SampEn) are consistent with the expected differences between these stages based on the bispectral index (BIS), which has been shown to be a quantifiable measure of the effect of anaesthetics on the central nervous system. Also, the proposed filtering approach is more effective compared to the standard filtering method in filtering out signal noise resulting in more consistent results than those provided by the BIS. The proposed approach is therefore able to distinguish between key operational stages related to DoA, which is consistent with the clinical observations. SampEn can also be viewed as a useful index for evaluating and monitoring the DoA of a patient when used in combination with this approach.

However, little is known about the psychometrics of commonly used functional connectivity indices. We examined the internal consistency of two different connectivity metrics: magnitude squared coherence and phase synchrony. EEG was recorded during visual entrainment to elicit a strong oscillatory component of known frequency. We found acceptable to good split-half reliability for the connectivity metrics when computing all possible pairwise interactions and after selecting an a priori seed reference. We also compared reliability estimates when using average referenced sensor versus reference independent current source density EEG data. Additional considerations were given to determining how reliability was influenced by factors including trial number, signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency content.

However, some particular exercise types, even though comparable based on physical efforts, have distinct cognitive and sensorimotor features. In this study, the effects of different types of exercise, such as fast ball sports and dance training, on brain electrical activity were investigated. Electroencephalography (EEG) scans were recorded in professional dancer, professional fast ball sports athlete (FBSA) and healthy control volunteer groups consisting of twelve subjects each. In FBSA, power of delta and theta frequency activities of EEG was significantly higher than those of the dancers and the controls. Conversely, dancers had significantly higher amplitudes in alpha and beta bands compared to FBSA and significantly higher amplitudes in the alpha band in comparison with controls. The results suggest that cognitive features of physical training can be reflected in resting brain electrical oscillations. The differences in resting brain electrical oscillations between the dancers and the FBSA can be the result of innate network differences determining the talents and/or plastic changes induced by physical training.

Age-dependency of sevoflurane-induced electroencephalogram dynamics in children	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						electroencephalography; pediatric; sevoflurane	BISPECTRAL INDEX; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK; SPECTRAL ENTROPY; EEG BISPECTRUM; PROPOFOL; CONSCIOUSNESS; DENSITY; IMPACT	Background: General anaesthesia induces highly structured oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in adults, but the anaesthesia-induced EEG in paediatric patients is less understood. Neural circuits undergo structural and functional transformations during development that might be reflected in anaesthesia-induced EEG oscillations. We therefore investigated age-related changes in the EEG during sevoflurane general anaesthesia in paediatric patients. Methods: We analysed the EEG recorded during routine care of patients between 0 and 28 yr of age (n=54), using power spectral and coherence methods. The power spectrum quantifies the energy in the EEG at each frequency, while the coherence measures the frequency-dependent correlation or synchronization between EEG signals at different scalp locations. We characterized the EEG as a function of age and within 5 age groups: <1 yr old(n=4), 1-6yrold(n=12), >6-14 yr old(n=14), >14-21 yr old(n=11), >21-28 yr old(n=13). Results: EEG power significantly increased from infancy through similar to 6 yr, subsequently declining to a plateau at approximately 21 yr. Alpha (8-13 Hz) coherence, a prominent EEG feature associated with sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness in adults, is absent in patients <1 yr. Conclusions: Sevoflurane-induced EEG dynamics in children vary significantly as a function of age. These age-related dynamics likely reflect ongoing development within brain circuits that are modulated by sevoflurane. These readily observed paediatric-specific EEG signatures could be used to improve brain state monitoring in children receiving general anaesthesia.	[Akeju, O.; Pavone, K. J.; Firth, P.

It has been shown that spatial and feature-based attentional selection result in increased alpha oscillations over the cortical regions representing sensory input originating from the unattended visual field and task-irrelevant visual features, respectively. However, whether attentional gating in the case of object based selection is also associated with alpha oscillations has not been investigated before. Here we measured anticipatory electroencephalography (EEG) alpha oscillations while participants were cued to attend to foveal face or word stimuli, the processing of which is known to have right and left hemispheric lateralization, respectively. The results revealed that in the case of simultaneously displayed, overlapping face and word stimuli, attending to the words led to increased power of parieto-occipital alpha oscillations over the right hemisphere as compared to when faces were attended. This object category-specific modulation of the hemispheric lateralization of anticipatory alpha oscillations was maintained during sustained attentions' selection of sequentially presented face and word stimuli. These results imply that in the case of object based attentional selection-similarly to spatial and feature-based attention-gating of visual information processing might involve visual cortical alpha oscillations.

Time-frequency (t-f) analysis of electrooculogram-corrected EEG was used to explore event-related synchronization (ERS)/desynchronization (ERD) in four EEG bands using arbitrarily selected time epochs and traditional frequency ranges. ERS in delta, theta, and alpha, and subsequent ERD in theta, alpha, and beta, showed substantial decrement over trials, yet effects of stimulus significance (count vs. no-task) were minimal. Here, we used principal components analysis (PCA) of the t-f data to investigate the natural frequency and time combinations involved in such stimulus processing. We identified four ERS and four ERD t-f components: six showed decrement over trials, four showed count > no-task effects, and six showed SignificancexTrial interactions. This increased sensitivity argues for the wider use of our data-driven t-f PCA approach.

Stimulation, signal analysis and pattern recognition are three most important units in BCI system. But it is very confusing to select a stimulation technique, to select a domain to analysis EEG signal and to choose a definite rhythm for pattern recognition for most effective BCI system. In this paper, motor activity (eye movement), visual and audio stimulation both for time and frequency domain are analyzed to get highest recognition rate. Support Vector Machines algorithm is used to calculate accuracy of recognition. It is seen that, motor activity (Eye movement) is most dominant for BCI system with 87.5% accuracy of recognition for frequency domain analysis. Visual stimulation is better comparing to audio stimulation with 83.33% recognition rate in frequency domain. Theta and alpha rhythms, i.e., the frequency range (4-13) Hz, is main significant frequency band for pattern recognition, though it varies with different stimulations and mental status. So most effective BCI based cursor control system can be implemented by the combination of visual stimulation and motor activity through frequency domain analysis, because higher rate of recognition is possible by this combination.

In the proposed approach, different frequency components (i) real value; (ii) imaginary value; (iii) magnitude; (iv) phase angle and (v) power spectral density of the EEG data samples during different mental task performed to assess seven types of human cognitive states - relax, mental task, memory related task, motor action, pleasant, fear and enjoying music on the three channels of BIOPAC EEG data acquisition system - EEG, Alpha and Alpha RMS signal. Also the time and time-frequency-based features were extracted to compare the performance of the system. After feature extraction, the channel efficacy is evaluated by support vector machine (SVM) based on the classification rate in different cognitive states. From the experimental results and classification accuracy, it is determined that the overall accuracy for alpha channel shows much improved result for power spectral density than the other frequency based features and other channels. The classification rate is 69.17% for alpha channel whereas for EEG and alpha RMS channel it is found 47.22% and 32.21%, respectively. For statistical analysis standard deviation shows better result for alpha channel and it is found 65.4%. The time-frequency analysis shows much improved result for alpha channel also. For the mean value of DWT coefficients the accuracy is highest and it is 81.3%. Besides the classification accuracy, SVM shows better performance in compare with kNN classifier.

While p-EEG in humans and animals has been shown to be closely related in terms of underlying neuronal substrates, both translational and back-translational approaches are being used to address extrapolation issues and optimize the translational validity of preclinical animal p-EEG paradigms and data. Present applications build further on animal p-EEG and pharmaco-sleep EEG findings, but also on stimulation protocols, more specifically pharmaco-event-related potentials. Pharmaceutical research into novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases has employed an increasing number of pharmacological as well as transgenic models to assess the potential therapeutic involvement of different neurochemical systems and novel drug targets as well as underlying neuronal connectivity and synaptic function. Consequently, p-EEG studies, now also readily applied in modeled animals, continue to have an important role in drug discovery and development, with progressively more emphasis on its potential as a central readout for target engagement and as a (translational) functional marker of neuronal circuit processes underlying normal and pathological brain functioning. In a similar vein as was done for human p-EEG studies, the contribution of animal p-EEG studies can further benefit by adherence to guidelines for methodological standardization, which are presently under construction by the International Pharmaco-EEG Society (IPEG).

Time-frequency dynamics during sleep spindles on the EEG in rodents with a genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy (WAG/Rij rats)	SARATOV FALL MEETING 2014: OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOPHYSICS AND MEDICINE XVI; LASER PHYSICS AND PHOTONICS XVI; AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Optics and Biophotonics / Saratov Fall Meeting (SFM)	SEP 23-26, 2014	Saratov, RUSSIA	SPIE, Opt Soc, Russian Fdn Basic Res, SPE Nanostructured Glass Technol Ltd, Russian Technol Platforms Med Future & Photon, NG Chernyshevsky Saratov State Univ, Saratov State Univ, Res Educ Inst Opt & Biophoton, Minist Educ & Sci RF, Res Educ Ctr Nonlinear Dynam & Biophys CRDF, Saratov State Univ, Int Res Educ Ctr Opt Technologies Ind & Med Photon, Inst Biochemistry & Physiol Plants & Microorganisms RAS, Inst Precis Mech & Control, RAS, VI Razumovsky Saratov State Med Univ, Yuri Gagarin Saratov State Tech Univ, Volga Reg Ctr New Informat Technologies, Biomed Photon Comm Chinese Opt Soc, Univ Oulu, Saratov State Univ, SPIE Student Chapter, Saratov State Univ, OSA Student Chapter, Saratov Reg Div, Acad Nat Sci, Russian Soc Photobiol, Saratov Sci Ctr, RAS, Photonics4Life Consortium, Biophotonics4Life Worldwide Consortium		Sleep spindles; absence epilepsy; time-frequency analysis; continuous wavelet transform; instantaneous frequency dynamics	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; SEIZURES	Sleep spindles are known to appear spontaneously in the thalamocortical neuronal network of the brain during slow-wave sleep; pathological processes in the thalamocortical network may be the reason of the absence epilepsy. The aim of the present work is to study developed changes in the time-frequency structure of sleep spindles during the progressive development of the absence epilepsy in WAG/Rij rats. EEG recordings were made at age 7 and 9 months. Automatic recognition and subsequent analysis of sleep spindles on the EEG were performed using the continuous wavelet transform. The duration of epileptic discharges and the total duration of epileptic activity were found to increase with age, while the duration of sleep spindles, conversely, decreased. In terms of the mean frequency, sleep spindles could be divided into three classes: 'slow' (mean frequency 9.3 Hz), 'medium' (11.4 Hz), and 'fast' (13.5 Hz). Slow and medium (transitional) spindles in five-month-old animals showed increased frequency from the beginning to the end of the spindle. The more intense the epilepsy is, the shorter are the durations of spindles of all types. The mean frequencies of 'medium' and 'fast' spindles were higher in rats with more intense signs of epilepsy. Overall, high epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats was linked with significant changes in spindles of the transitional type, with less marked changes in the two traditionally identified types of spindle, slow and fast.

If the two images are flickering at two distinct frequencies, electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to track the frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) driven by each image as they compete for awareness, providing an objective measure of the subjective perceptual state. This spontaneous alternation in perceptual dominance is believed to be driven by neural processes across widespread regions in the brain, but the real-time mechanisms of these processes remain unclear. New Method: The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of investigating binocular rivalry using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach in order to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high spatial resolution of fMRI. Results: We have developed novel techniques for artifact removal and signal optimization for the rivalry-related SSVEP data collected simultaneously during fMRI. Comparison with Existing Methods: Our methods address several significant technical challenges of recording SSVEP data in the noisy fMRI environment, and enabled us to successfully reconstruct SSVEP signatures of rivalry in a group of healthy human subjects. Conclusion: Further development and application of these techniques will enable more comprehensive integration of EEG and fMRI data collected simultaneously and could have significant implications for EEG-fMRI studies of brain activity in general.

As the nonstationary EEG signal contains multiple frequencies, the conventional frequency based methods cannot be used for their analysis. In this paper, we propose window width optimized S-transform based method for epileptic seizure detection and compare its performance with standard S-transform and Short time Fourier transform (STFT) based detection methods. The detection of epileptic seizure is performed in five stages- (i) Optimization of S-transform, (ii) Time-frequency representation of EEG segments using window width optimization of S-transform, (iii) Calculation of Power spectrum density (PSD), (iv) Feature extraction, and (v) Classification of seizure containing EEG segment using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The performance of proposed method has been evaluated for three classification problems along with a comparison with other time-frequency methods.	[Ambulkar, Narendra Kumar; Sharma, S.

Network representation of EEG time series can be an efficient vehicle to understand the underlying mechanisms of brain function. Brain functional networks whose nodes are brain regions and edges correspond to functional links between them are characterized by neurobiologically meaningful graph theory metrics. This study investigates the degree to which graph theory metrics are sex dependent. To this end, EEGs from 24 healthy female subjects and 21 healthy male subjects were recorded in eyes-closed resting state conditions. The connectivity matrices were extracted using correlation analysis and were further binarized to obtain binary functional networks. Global and local efficiency measures as graph theory metrics were computed for the extracted networks. We found that male brains have significantly greater global efficiency (i.e., global communicability of the network) across all frequency bands for a wide range of cost values in both hemispheres. Furthermore, for a range of cost values, female brains showed significantly greater right-hemispheric local efficiency (i.e., local connectivity) than male brains.

The IEDs can also be mapped by electrical source imaging (ESI) which has been demonstrated to be useful in presurgical evaluation in a high proportion of cases with focal IEDs. ICA advantageously does not require IEDs or a model of haemodynamic responses but its use in EEG-fMRI of epilepsy has been limited by its ability to separate and select epileptic components. Here, we evaluated the performance of a classifier that aims to filter all non-BOLD responses and we compared the spatial and temporal features of the selected independent components (ICs). The components selected by the classifier were compared to those components selected by a strong spatial correlation with ESI maps of IED sources. Both sets of ICs were subsequently compared to a temporal model derived from the convolution of the IEDs (derived from the simultaneously acquired EEG) with a standard haemodynamic response. Selected ICs were compared to the patients' clinical information in 13 patients with focal epilepsy. We found that the misclassified ICs clearly related to IED in 16/25 cases. We also found that the classifier failed predominantly due to the increased spectral range of fMRIs temporal responses to IEDs. In conclusion, we show that ICA can be an efficient approach to separate responses related to epilepsy but that contemporary classifiers need to be retrained for epilepsy data. Our findings indicate that, for ICA to contribute to the analysis of data without IEDs to improve its sensitivity, classification strategies based on data features other than IC time course frequency is required.

J	Noh, NA; Fuggetta, G; Manganotti, P				Noh, Nor Azila; Fuggetta, Giorgio; Manganotti, Paolo			Theta-burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Alters the Functional Topography of the Cortical Motor Network	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						electroencephalogram; long-term depression; motor cortex; neuromodulation; neuroplasticity	HIGH-FREQUENCY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITIES; EEG COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; CORTEX; PLASTICITY; AREA	Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool that is able to modulate the electrical activity of the brain depending upon its protocol of stimulation. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a high-frequency TMS protocol that is able to induce prolonged plasticity changes in the brain. The induction of plasticity-like effects by TBS is useful in both experimental and therapeutic settings; however, the underlying neural mechanisms of this modulation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous TBS (cTBS) on the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric functional connectivity of the resting and active brain. Methods: A total of 26 healthy humans were randomly divided into two groups that received either real cTBS or sham (control) over the left primary motor cortex. Surface electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to quantify the changes of neural oscillations after cTBS at rest and after a choice reaction time test. The cTBS-induced EEG oscillations were computed using spectral analysis of event-related coherence (ERCoh) of theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-9.5 Hz), high alpha (10-12.5 Hz), low beta (13-19.5 Hz), and high beta (20-30 Hz) brain rhythms. Results: We observed a global decrease in functional connectivity of the brain in the cTBS group when compared to sham in the low beta brain rhythm at rest and high beta brain rhythm during the active state. In particular, EEG spectral analysis revealed that high-frequency beta, a cortically generated brain rhythm, was the most sensitive band that was modulated by cTBS. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that cTBS, a TMS protocol that mimics the mechanism of long-term depression of synaptic plasticity, modulates motor network oscillations primarily at the cortical level and might interfere with cortical information coding.

Delay Differential Analysis of Electroencephalographic Data	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							BISPECTRUM ESTIMATION; EEG; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS	We propose a time-domain approach to detect frequencies, frequency couplings, and phases using nonlinear correlation functions. For frequency analysis, this approach is a multivariate extension of discrete Fourier transform, and for higher-order spectra, it is a linear and multivariate alternative to multidimensional fast Fourier transform of multidimensional correlations. This method can be applied to short and sparse time series and can be extended to cross-trial and cross-channel spectra (CTS) for electroencephalography data where multiple short data segments from multiple trials of the same experiment are available. There are two versions of CTS. The first one assumes some phase coherency across the trials, while the second one is independent of phase coherency. We demonstrate that the phase-dependent version is more consistent with event-related spectral perturbation analysis and traditional Morlet wavelet analysis. We show that CTS can be applied to short data windows and yields higher temporal resolution than traditional Morlet wavelet analysis. Furthermore, the CTS can be used to reconstruct the event-related potential using all linear components of the CTS.

Deep Brain Stimulation Modulates Gamma Oscillations and Theta-Gamma Coupling in Treatment Resistant Depression	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; Subcallosal cingulate gyrus; Treatment resistant depression; Gamma oscillations; Theta-gamma coupling; Electroencephalography	MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EEG DYNAMICS; ASYMMETRY; COGNITION; RHYTHMS; POWER	Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG) is becoming an effective therapeutic option for treatment resistant depression (TRD). Objective/hypothesis: Identifying the neurophysiological mechanisms altered by DBS may lead to more tailored treatment parameters and enhanced efficacy. Methods: Twenty TRD patients with implanted DBS in the SCG were recruited. Patients participated in three EEG recording sessions, one with DBS ON, one with DBS randomized to ON or OFF, and one with DBS OFF. During each session, subjects performed N-back working memory tasks, namely the 0-back and 3-back. Fourteen subjects with valid EEG were included in the analysis. Changes in frontal gamma oscillations (30-50 Hz) and coupling between theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma oscillations as a result of DBS stimulation were quantified and correlated with depressive symptoms. Results: DBS stimulation resulted in suppression of frontal oscillations in the ON state relative to the OFF state during the N-back tasks. Greatest suppression was demonstrated in beta and gamma oscillations and most pronounced during the 3-back. Suppression of gamma oscillations in the 3-back correlated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. DBS ON relative to OFF in the 3-back also resulted in an increase in theta-gamma coupling that correlated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Suppression of gamma oscillations and increased theta-gamma coupling through DBS is likely mediated by both SCG activation of inhibitory circuits and an enhancement of plasticity in the frontal cortex. Activation of both pathways may explain the therapeutic properties of DBS in TRD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is still unclear exactly which brain sites are affected by beat stimulation. In particular, an impact of beat stimulation on mediotemporal brain areas could possibly provide new options for memory enhancement or seizure control. Therefore, we examined how electroencephalography (EEG) power and phase synchronization are modulated by auditory stimulation with beat frequencies corresponding to dominant EEG rhythms based on intracranial recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients. Monaural and binaural beat stimuli with beat frequencies of 5, 10, 40 and 80Hz and non-superposed control signals were administered with low amplitudes (60dBSPL) and for short durations (5s). EEG power was intracranially recorded from mediotemporal, temporo-basal and temporo-lateral and surface sites. Evoked and total EEG power and phase synchronization during beat vs. control stimulation were compared by the use of Bonferroni-corrected non-parametric label-permutation tests. We found that power and phase synchronization were significantly modulated by beat stimulation not only at temporo-basal, temporo-lateral and surface sites, but also at mediotemporal sites. Generally, more significant decreases than increases were observed. The most prominent power increases were seen after stimulation with monaural 40-Hz beats. The most pronounced power and synchronization decreases resulted from stimulation with monaural 5-Hz and binaural 80-Hz beats. Our results suggest that beat stimulation offers a non-invasive approach for the modulation of intracranial EEG characteristics.

Indeed, at the very beginning of seizures, ictal EEG has a low amplitude and its morphology in the time domain is quite similar to muscular activity. Contrary to the time domain, ictal signals have specific characteristics in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we use the time-frequency signature of ictal discharges as a priori information on the sources of interest. To extract the time-frequency signature of ictal sources, we use the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method. Then, we propose two time-frequency based semi-blind source separation approaches, namely the Time-Frequency-Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (TF-GEVD) and the Time-Frequency-Denoising Source Separation (TF-DSS), for the denoising of ictal signals based on these time-frequency signatures. The performance of the proposed methods is compared with that of CCA and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approaches for the denoising of simulated ictal EEGs and of real ictal data. The results show the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with CCA and ICA.

Understanding what they are thinking about or how they feel is thus difficult. This study focused on brain responses to hearing their own names to clarify the situation in these patients. Methods: We performed and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) for six patients with SMID and eleven healthy subjects. All subjects were presented with auditory stimuli including calling the subject's own name (SON) and reading words. EEG was analyzed by time frequency analysis, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) to detect EEG power changes caused by EEG amplitude, and inter-trial coherence (ITC) to investigate phase-locked changes. Results: ERSP results from healthy subjects showed significant theta power increases as a specific response to SON. While we could not identify a similar pattern in the responses of patients with SMID, analysis of ITC revealed that theta phase-locked activity increased in response to SON not only in all healthy subjects, but also in four patients. Discussion: These results indicate that theta phase-locked activity in some patients with SMID was strongly associated with SON, as in healthy subjects. Our study suggests the existence of specific neural markers that signal an attentional shift in patients upon hearing SON. (C) 2014 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Gamma oscillations precede interictal epileptiform spikes in the seizure onset zone	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES	Objective:To investigate the generation, spectral characteristics, and potential clinical significance of brain activity preceding interictal epileptiform spike discharges (IEDs) recorded with intracranial EEG.Methods:Seventeen adult patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy were implanted with intracranial electrodes as part of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery. IEDs detected on clinical macro- and research microelectrodes were analyzed using time-frequency spectral analysis.Results:Gamma frequency oscillations (30-100 Hz) often preceded IEDs in spatially confined brain areas. The gamma-IEDs were consistently observed 35 to 190 milliseconds before the epileptiform spike waveforms on individual macro- and microelectrodes. The gamma oscillations associated with IEDs had longer duration (p < 0.001) and slightly higher frequency (p = 0.045) when recorded on microelectrodes compared with clinical macroelectrodes. Although gamma-IEDs comprised only a subset of IEDs, they were strongly associated with electrodes in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) compared with the surrounding brain regions (p = 0.004), in sharp contrast to IEDs without preceding gamma oscillations that were often also detected outside of the SOZ. Similar to prior studies, isolated pathologic high-frequency oscillations in the gamma (30-100 Hz) and higher (100-600 Hz) frequency range, not associated with an IED, were also found to be associated with SOZ.Conclusions:The occurrence of locally generated gamma oscillations preceding IEDs suggests a mechanistic role for gamma in pathologic network activity generating IEDs. The results show a strong association between SOZ and gamma-IEDs. The potential clinical application of gamma-IEDs for mapping pathologic brain regions is intriguing, but will require future prospective studies.

J	Hari, R; Parkkonen, L				Hari, Riitta; Parkkonen, Lauri			The brain timewise: how timing shapes and supports brain function	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						brain imaging; hierarchical order; magnetoencephalography; networks; prediction; time	TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE WINDOWS; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; SENSITIVITY; CONNECTOME; HIERARCHY	We discuss the importance of timing in brain function: how temporal dynamics of the world has left its traces in the brain during evolution and how we can monitor the dynamics of the human brain with non-invasive measurements. Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulusor task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity. Merging both spatial and temporal information with increasing accuracy and carrying out recordings in naturalistic conditions, including social interaction, will bring much new information about human brain function.

A statistical comparison of EEG time- and time-frequency domain representations of error processing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Error processing; ERP; Time-frequency; ERN; Theta	NEURAL SYSTEM; THETA; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS	Successful behavior relies on error detection and subsequent remedial adjustment of behavior. Researchers have identified two electrophysiological signatures of error processing: the time-domain error-related negativity (ERN), and the time-frequency domain increased power in the delta/theta frequency bands (similar to 2-8 Hz). The relationship between these two signatures is not entirely clear: on the one hand they occur after the same type of event and with similar latency, but on the other hand, the time-domain ERP component contains only phase-locked activity whereas the time-frequency response additionally contains non-phase-locked dynamics. Here we examined the ERN and error-related delta/theta activity in relation to each other, focusing on within-subject analyses that utilize single-trial data. Using logistic regression, we constructed three statistical models in which the accuracy of each trial was predicted from the ERN, delta/theta power, or both. We found that both the ERN and delta/theta power worked roughly equally well as predictors of single-trial accuracy (similar to 70% accurate prediction). Furthermore, a model including both measures provided a stronger overall prediction compared to either model alone. Based on these findings two conclusions are drawn: first, the phase-locked part of the EEG signal appears to be roughly as predictive of single-trial response accuracy as the non-phase-locked part; second, the single-trial ERP and delta/theta power contain both overlapping, and independent information.

However, current knowledge about the exact relationship between scaling properties in EEG and fMRI signals is very limited. To address this question, we collected simultaneous EEG-fMRI data in healthy individuals during resting wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. For either of these conditions, we found that both EEG and fMRI power spectra followed a power-law distribution. Furthermore, the EEG and fMRI scaling exponents were highly variable across subjects, and sensitive to the choice of reference and nuisance variables in EEG and fMRI data, respectively. Interestingly, the EEG exponent of the whole brain selectively corresponded to the fMRI exponent of the thalamus during NREM sleep. Together, our findings suggest that scale-free brain activity is characterized by robust temporal structures and behavioral significance. This motivates future studies to unravel its physiological mechanisms, as well as its relevance to behavior.

It requires the usage of a convenient electroencephalograph (EEG) system and an adequate model that can characterize cognitive states and state changes reflected in the electrical activity of the brain. This paper studies EEG during cognitive relaxation and cognitive engagement in eyes open and eyes closed conditions. It explores the effects cognitive states have on alpha brain activity captured by different alpha activity models. The analysis revealed that models that characterize not only the spectral power but also the alpha peak frequency and the width and the power of the alpha peak provide better insights into the cognitive engagement of a person. Furthermore, personal differences are observed in the alpha peak parameters with respect to different cognitive states. We argue that using alpha peak modeling, instead of traditionally used power in the fixed alpha frequency band is required for proper characterization of human brain activity in cognitive studies.

The role of EEG oscillations in human information processing has been intensively investigated. Purpose: To study the quantitative EEG correlates of short term memory load as assessed through Sternberg memory test. Methods: The study was conducted on 34 healthy male student volunteers. The intervention consisted of Sternberg memory test, which runs on a version of the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm software on a computer. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations according to 10-20 international system of electrode placement. EEG signals were analyzed offline. To overcome the problems of fixed band system, individual alpha frequency (IAF) based frequency band selection method was adopted. The outcome measures were FFT transformed absolute powers in the six bands at 19 electrode positions. Results: Sternberg memory test served as model of short term memory load. Correlation analysis of EEG during memory task was reflected as decreased absolute power in Upper alpha band in nearly all the electrode positions; increased power in Theta band at Fronto-Temporal region and Lower 1 alpha band at Fronto-Central region. Lower 2 alpha, Beta and Gamma band power remained unchanged. Conclusions: Short term memory load has distinct electroencephalographic correlates resembling the mentally stressed state. This is evident from decreased power in Upper alpha band (corresponding to Alpha band of traditional EEG system) which is representative band of relaxed mental state. Fronto-temporal Theta power changes may reflect the encoding and execution of memory task.

Here, noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from able-bodied volunteers during a novel treadmill walking paradigm was used to assess neural correlates of walking. A systematic processing method, including a recently developed subspace reconstruction algorithm, reduced movement-related EEG artifact prior to independent component analysis and dipole source localization. We quantified cortical activity while participants tracked slow and fast target speeds across two treadmill conditions: an active mode that adjusted belt speed based on user movements and a passive mode reflecting a typical treadmill. Our results reveal frequency specific, multi-focal task related changes in cortical oscillations elicited by active walking. Low gamma band power, localized to the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, was significantly increased during double support and early swing phases, critical points in the gait cycle since the active controller adjusted speed based on pelvis position and swing foot velocity. These phasic gamma band synchronizations provide evidence that prefrontal and posterior parietal networks, previously implicated in visuo-spatial and somotosensory integration, are engaged to enhance lower limb control during gait. Sustained mu and beta band desynchronization within sensorimotor cortex, a neural correlate for movement, was observed during walking thereby validating our methods for isolating cortical activity. Our results also demonstrate the utility of EEG recorded during locomotion for probing the multi-regional cortical networks which underpin its execution. For example, the cortical network engagement elicited by the active treadmill suggests that it may enhance neuroplasticity for more effective motor training.

Reliable activation to novel stimuli predicts higher fluid intelligence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Fluid intelligence; Time-frequency analysis; Inter-trial phase clustering; Neural variability	AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; FRONTAL-INTEGRATION-THEORY; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; CONTOUR LENGTH; FMRI ACTIVITY; EEG; COMPONENT; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY	The ability to reliably respond to stimuli could be an important biological determinant of differences in fluid intelligence (Gf). However, most electrophysiological studies of Gf employ event-related potential (ERP) measures that average brain activity over trials, and hence have limited power to quantify neural variability. Time-frequency analyses can capture cross-trial variation in the phase of neural activity, and thus can help address the importance of neural reliability to differences in Gf. This study recruited a community sample of healthy adults and measured inter-trial phase clustering (ITPC), total spectral power, and ERP amplitudes elicited by Repeated and Novel non-target stimuli during two visual oddball tasks. Condition effects, relations among the EEG measures, and relations with Gf were assessed. Early visual responses to Repeated stimuli elicited higher ITPC, yet only ITPC elicited by Novel stimuli was associated with Gf.

EEG correlates of spatial orientation in the human retrosplenial complex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN NAVIGATION; REFERENCE FRAMES; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; PATH-INTEGRATION; VIRTUAL-REALITY; BRAIN DYNAMICS; NEURAL BASIS; CORTEX; MEMORY; THETA	Studies on spatial navigation reliably demonstrate that the retrosplenial complex (RSC) plays a pivotal role for allocentric spatial information processing by transforming egocentric and allocentric spatial information into the respective other spatial reference frame (SRF). While more and more imaging studies investigate the role of the RSC in spatial tasks, high temporal resolution measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) are missing. To investigate the function of the RSC in spatial navigation with high temporal resolution we used EEG to analyze spectral perturbations during navigation based on allocentric and egocentric SRF. Participants performed a path integration task in a clearly structured virtual environment providing allothetic information. Continuous EEG recordings were decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) with subsequent source reconstruction of independent time source series using equivalent dipole modeling. Time-frequency transformation was used to investigate reference frame-specific orientation processes during navigation as compared to a control condition with identical visual input but no orientation task. Our results demonstrate that navigation based on an egocentric reference frame recruited a network including the parietal, motor, and occipital cortices with dominant perturbations in the alpha band and theta modulation in frontal cortex. Allocentric navigation was accompanied by performance-related desynchronization of the 8-13 Hz frequency band and synchronization in the 12-14 Hz band in the RSC. The results support the claim that the retrosplenial complex is central to translating egocentric spatial information into allocentric reference frames. Modulations in different frequencies with different time courses in the RSC further provide first evidence of two distinct neural processes reflecting translation of spatial information based on distinct reference frames and the computation of heading changes.

To this end, a novel scheme combining two SSVEP's features is proposed to control the simulated cart in a relatively continuous and accurate way. More specifically, the phase locking index (PLI) feature is sequentially combined with the standard canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based frequency detection method, which allows the use of multiple channel EEG signals in this design. To evaluate the proposed design, twenty subjects were invited to play this game three times. The overall results demonstrated that the subjects could control the simulated cart in a relatively continuous way to the expected locations in the game.

The Ageing Brain: Age-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram during propofol and sevoflurane general anaesthesia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						ageing; brain monitoring; EEG; elderly; electroencephalography; propofol; sevoflurane	BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; BURST SUPPRESSION; STATE; EEG; DYNAMICS; HEALTHY; TRANSITION; MECHANISMS; MODEL; POWER	Background: Anaesthetic drugs act at sites within the brain that undergo profound changes during typical ageing. We postulated that anaesthesia-induced brain dynamics observed in the EEG change with age. Methods: We analysed the EEG in 155 patients aged 18-90 yr who received propofol (n=60) or sevoflurane (n=95) as the primary anaesthetic. The EEG spectrum and coherence were estimated throughout a 2 min period of stable anaesthetic maintenance. Age-related effects were characterized by analysing power and coherence as a function of age using linear regression and by comparing the power spectrum and coherence in young (18-to 38-yr-old) and elderly (70- to 90-yr-old) patients. Results: Power across all frequency bands decreased significantly with age for both propofol and sevoflurane; elderly patients showed EEG oscillations similar to 2- to 3-fold smaller in amplitude than younger adults. The qualitative form of the EEG appeared similar regardless of age, showing prominent alpha (8-12 Hz) and slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillations. However, alpha band dynamics showed specific age-related changes. In elderly compared with young patients, alpha power decreased more than slow power, and alpha coherence and peak frequency were significantly lower. Older patients were more likely to experience burst suppression. Conclusions: These profound age-related changes in the EEG are consistent with known neurobiological and neuroanatomical changes that occur during typical ageing. Commercial EEG-based depth-of-anaesthesia indices do not account for age and are therefore likely to be inaccurate in elderly patients. In contrast, monitoring the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram can account for age and individual patient characteristics.	[Purdon, P. L.; Pavone, K. J.; Akeju, O.; Sampson, A. L.; Zhou, D.

When Problem Size Matters: Differential Effects of Brain Stimulation on Arithmetic Problem Solving and Neural Oscillations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL DC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MENTAL ADDITION; UPPER ALPHA; EEG; RETRIEVAL	The problem size effect is a well-established finding in arithmetic problem solving and is characterized by worse performance in problems with larger compared to smaller operand size. Solving small and large arithmetic problems has also been shown to involve different cognitive processes and distinct electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations over the left posterior parietal cortex (LPPC). In this study, we aimed to provide further evidence for these dissociations by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Participants underwent anodal (30min, 1.5 mA, LPPC) and sham tDCS. After the stimulation, we recorded their neural activity using EEG while the participants solved small and large arithmetic problems. We found that the tDCS effects on performance and oscillatory activity critically depended on the problem size. While anodal tDCS improved response latencies in large arithmetic problems, it decreased solution rates in small arithmetic problems. Likewise, the lower-alpha desynchronization in large problems increased, whereas the theta synchronization in small problems decreased. These findings reveal that the LPPC is differentially involved in solving small and large arithmetic problems and demonstrate that the effects of brain stimulation strikingly differ depending on the involved neuro-cognitive processes.

Since HE is not reflected in the MELD score and is an important prognostic parameter, we assess the prognostic benefit of the addition of an EEG-based HE index to the MELD. MethodsThree hundred and ninety-two patients with cirrhosis underwent EEG and automated determination of its mean dominant frequency (MDF). MELD was calculated at the time of EEG recording. Patients were monitored for up to 18months in relation to the occurrence of death/transplantation. The prognostic value of the stand-alone/combined MELD and MDF was calculated using standard survival analysis techniques. Patients transplanted for hepatic decompensation were considered dead on the day of transplantation, those transplanted for hepatocellular carcinoma were censored. The findings were validated using a split-sample technique (reference group: n=256; test group: n=136). During the follow-up period, 107 patients died/were transplanted for hepatic decompensation. ResultsBoth MELD and MDF predicted mortality on Kaplan-Meier analysis, and both were independent predictors of mortality on a Cox model. Based on Cox regression parameters, a novel prognostic index was devised, as follows: MELD-EEG=0.087*MELD-0.306*MDF. On ROC curve analysis, MELD-EEG had higher prognostic accuracy in predicting 12- and 18-month mortality compared to MELD (P=0.016 and P=0.018, respectively). In addition, it had better sensitivity and reduced the misclassification rate for given levels of specificity. On validation, no significant differences were observed between the reference/test groups. ConclusionsThe addition of an automatically obtained EEG-based index improves the prognostic accuracy of the MELD score.

Processing of information by the brain is reflected in dynamical changes of the electrical activity in time, frequency, and space. EEG signal processing tends to describe and quantify these variations in such a way that they are localized in temporal, spectral and spatial domain. Here we use multi-way (Tensor) analysis for localizing the EEG events. We used EMD process for decomposing EEG into distinct oscillatory modes, which are then mapped to TF plane using the near optimal Reassigned Spectrogram. Temporal, Spatial and Spectral information of the Multichannel EEG are then used to generate a three-way Frequency-Time-Space EEG tensor. Exploiting EMD also enables us to detrend the EEG recordings. Simulation results on both synthetic and real EEG data show that tensor analysis greatly improve separation and localization of overlapping events in EEG and it could be effectively exploited for detecting and characterizing the evoked potentials.

Hypothesizing gamma oscillatory activity as a potential EEG biomarker to antipsychotic response in schizophrenia, the present study aimed at measuring baseline spontaneous gamma activity in schizophrenia patients, and evaluating its response to antipsychotic treatment over 8 weeks. MethodsFifteen drug-free/naive patients were recruited, compared at baseline with 15 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls, and were followed up for 8 weeks' treatment on antipsychotics. Resting state EEG waves were recorded using high (192-channel) resolution EEG at admission, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Spectral power was calculated using fast Fourier transformation, Hanning window. The power was averaged region-wise over nine regions in three frequency ranges (30-50Hz, 50-70Hz, 70-100Hz). ResultsPatients and controls differed significantly at intake in terms of left temporal and parietal high (70-100Hz) gamma power. Consequently, no significant differences were seen over the course of antipsychotic treatment on gamma spectral power in any of the regions. ConclusionsLack of significant effect of treatment on gamma power suggests that these gamma oscillations may be trait markers in schizophrenia.

Objectives: An efficient way to investigate the neural basis of nociceptive responses is the analysis of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The main objective of this work was to study how adaptation and fatigue affect the ERPs to stimuli of different modalities, by characterizing the responses to infrequent and frequent stimulation in different recording periods. Methods: In this work, series of averaged EEG epochs recorded after thermal, electrical and auditory stimulation were analyzed with time-frequency representation and non-linear measures as spectral entropy and automutual information function. The study was performed by considering the traditional EEG frequency bands. Results: The defined measures presented a statistical significance p-value < 0.01 and accuracy higher than 60% by differentiating windows of response to infrequent (I) and frequent (F) stimuli between the start and end of the EEG recording. Conclusions: These measures permitted to observe some aspects of the subject's adaptation and the nociceptive response.

Of note, an increase of electroencephalography (EEG) upper/low alpha frequency power ratio has also been associated with these major landmarks of prodromal AD. Methods: Clinical and neuropsychological assessment, EEG recording, and high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging were done in 74 grown up subjects with mild cognitive impairment. This information was gathered and has been assessed 3 years postliminary. EEG recording and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography assessment was done in 27 subjects. Alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio, including cortical thickness, was figured for every subject. Contrasts in cortical thickness among the groups were assessed. Pearson's r relationship coefficient was utilized to evaluate the quality of the relationship between cortical thinning, brain perfusion, and EEG markers. Results: The higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group corresponded with more prominent cortical decay and a lower perfusional rate in the temporoparietal cortex. In a subsequent meetup after 3 years, these patients had AD. Conclusion: High EEG upper/low alpha power ratio was connected with cortical diminishing and lower perfusion in the temporoparietal brain area. The increase in EEG upper/low alpha frequency power ratio could be helpful in recognizing people in danger of conversion to AD dementia and this may be quality information in connection with clinical assessment.

The purpose of this electroencephalographic (EEG) study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TGC by comparing the power spectra and TGC at rest between ADHD and control children. Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded from 97 volunteers (including 53 subjects with ADHD attending a camp for hyperactive children). The EEG power spectra and TGC data were analyzed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted on the quantitative EEG results between the groups to adjust for sex. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to examine the discriminating ability of each parameter for ADHD diagnosis. The ADHD group exhibited significantly decreased TGC in multiple areas, including frontal (Fp1, F3, F7, F6), temporal (T3), and occipital (02) areas, compared with the control group. The ROC analysis performed on the TGC data generated the most accurate result among the EEG measures, with an overall classification accuracy of 71.7%. TGC, which reflects the degree of neuronal interactions between functional systems, provides information about an individual's attentional network. Therefore, resting-state TGC is a promising neurophysiological marker of ADHD in children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The focus of this study is to propose a methodology to define new (tf) features by extending time-only and frequency-only features to the joint (tf) domain for detecting changes in non-stationary signals. The (4) features are used as a representative subset characterizing the status of the observed non-stationary signal. Change in the signal is then reflected as a change in the (tf) features. This (tf) approach is applied to the problem of detecting abnormal brain activity in newborns (e.g. seizure) using measurements of the EEG for diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, a pre-processing stage for detecting artifacts in EEG signals for signal enhancement is studied and implemented separately. Overall results indicate that, in general, the (tf) approach results in an improved performance in detecting artifacts and seizures in newborn EEG signals as compared to time-only or frequency-only features.

In this paper discrete wavelet transform is used for the time-frequency analysis of EEG signal. Using discrete wavelet transform, EEG signal is decomposed into five different frequency bands namely delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Only theta, alpha and beta carry seizure information. Statistical feature like energy, variance and zero crossing rate and nonlinear feature like fractal dimension is extracted from each of the three sub bands and fed to support vector machine classifier. Support vector machine classifies the input EEG signal into seizure free and seizure signal.

This study aims to assess the quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as a predictive biomarker for the development of cognitive impairment, post-cerebral infarcts, in subjects from the Department of Neurology. They underwent biennial EEG recording. Cerebral infarct subjects, with follow-up cognitive evaluation, were analyzed for qEEG measures of background rhythm frequency (BRF) and relative , , , and band power. The relationship between cognitive impairment and qEEG, and other possible predictors, was assessed by Cox regression. The results showed that the risk hazard of developing cognitive impairment was 14 times higher for those with low BRF than for those with high BRF (P < .001). Hazard ratio (HR) was also significant for more than median band power (HR = 5, P = .002) compared with less than median band power. The HRs for , , and bands were equal to the baseline demographic, and clinical characteristics were not significantly different. In conclusion, qEEG measures of BRF, and relative power in band, are potential predictive biomarkers for cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral infarcts. These biomarkers might be valuable in early prediction of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral infarcts.

High and low gamma EEG oscillations in central sensorimotor areas are conversely modulated during the human gait cycle	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging; Human gait; High gamma oscillations; Sensorimotor system; Robotic gait training	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TREADMILL WALKING; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RHYTHMS; ORIGIN; SYSTEM	Investigating human brain function is essential to develop models of cortical involvement during walking. Such models could advance the analysis of motor impairments following brain injuries (e.g., stroke) and may lead to novel rehabilitation approaches. In this work, we applied high-density EEG source imaging based on individual anatomy to enable neuroimaging during walking. To minimize the impact of muscular influence on EEG recordings we introduce a novel artifact correction method based on spectral decomposition. High gamma oscillations (>60 Hz) were previously reported to play an important role in motor control. Here, we investigate high gamma amplitudes while focusing on two different aspects of a walking experiment, namely the fact that a person walks and the rhythmicity of walking. We found that high gamma amplitudes (60-80 Hz), located focally in central sensorimotor areas, were significantly increased during walking compared to standing. Moreover, high gamma (70-90 Hz) amplitudes in the same areas are modulated in relation to the gait cycle. Since the spectral peaks of high gamma amplitude increase and modulation do not match, it is plausible that these two high gamma elements represent different frequency-specific network interactions. Interestingly, we found high gamma (70-90 Hz) amplitudes to be coupled to low gamma (24-40 Hz) amplitudes, which both are modulated in relation to the gait cycle but conversely to each other. In summary, our work is a further step towards modeling cortical involvement during human upright walking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

What remain less clear are the underlying mechanisms of the meditative process. A large impediment to this clarity is attributable to the lack of a unified and comprehensive taxonomy, as well as to the absence of clear differentiation within the literature between method of practice and resulting state. The present study discusses and then attempts to identify within our sample a theoretically universal culminating meditative state known as Nondual Awareness, which is differentiated from the method or practice state. Participants completed an in-lab meditation, during which neurological patterns were analyzed using electroencephalography (EEG). Analyses indicated significantly higher EEG power among slower wave frequencies (delta, theta, alpha) during the reported nondual events. These events appear neurologically distinct from meditation sessions as a whole, which interestingly demonstrated significant elevation within the gamma range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The probability of seizures during EEG monitoring in critically ill adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Continuous electroencephalography; ICU EEG monitoring; Nonconvulsive seizures	NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; DISCHARGES; FREQUENCY; IMPACT	Objective: To characterize the risk for seizures over time in relation to EEG findings in hospitalized adults undergoing continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG). Methods: Retrospective analysis of cEEG data and medical records from 625 consecutive adult inpatients monitored at a tertiary medical center. Using survival analysis methods, we estimated the time-dependent probability that a seizure will occur within the next 72-h, if no seizure has occurred yet, as a function of EEG abnormalities detected so far. Results: Seizures occurred in 27% (168/625). The first seizure occurred early (< 30 min of monitoring) in 58% (98/168). In 527 patients without early seizures, 159 (30%) had early epileptiform abnormalities, versus 368 (70%) without. Seizures were eventually detected in 25% of patients with early epileptiform discharges, versus 8% without early discharges. The 72-h risk of seizures declined below 5% if no epileptiform abnormalities were present in the first two hours, whereas 16 h of monitoring were required when epileptiform discharges were present. 20% (74/388) of patients without early epileptiform abnormalities later developed them; 23% (17/74) of these ultimately had seizures. Only 4% (12/294) experienced a seizure without preceding epileptiform abnormalities. Conclusions: Seizure risk in acute neurological illness decays rapidly, at a rate dependent on abnormalities detected early during monitoring. This study demonstrates that substantial risk stratification is possible based on early EEG abnormalities. Significance: These findings have implications for patient-specific determination of the required duration of cEEG monitoring in hospitalized patients.

A review of longitudinal studies of children and adolescents with ADHD showed that the majority will have continued cognitive and functional impairments into adulthood. The thalamus likely plays a prominent role in ADHD symptomatology, based on evidence that the thalamus generates waking-state electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms along with extensive thalamic neural circuitry connections with cortical and subcortical areas. Research demonstrates a specific abnormality in the thalamic pulvinar nucleus in ADHD populations. The thalamus can also play a role in ADHD treatment, based on solid evidence that both animals and humans can learn to self-regulate EEG oscillations. Given the underarousal and sleep disturbance commonly seen in ADHD, along with data that indicate an increased dosage of ADHD medication may improve behavioral control at a cost of lowered cognitive functioning, further investigation of the role for self-regulation through EEG training is warranted.				tbaileyphd@me.com		Joyce, Arthur/0000-0001-7233-9036					44	12	12	0	22	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	2162-2965	2162-2973		APPL NEUROPSYCH-CHIL	Appl.

Complex wavelet algorithm for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article						electroencephalography; diseases; wavelet transforms; wavelet neural nets; signal classification; medical signal processing; time-frequency analysis; computer-aided diagnosis; Alzheimer disease; electroencephalography signals; complex wavelet algorithm; time-frequency analysis; multiresolution capability; Tsallis entropy; neural network classification		Electroencephalography signals are used for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, extracting critical features that belong to Alzheimer's signals are useful and tedious for neural network classification due to the high-frequency non-stationary components. For this purpose, time-frequency analysis and the multi-resolution capability of wavelets represent an attractive choice. However, fluctuations of the transformed coefficients and the absence of phase information make the process less accurate in certain scenarios. Because of this, complex wavelet transform has been selected to handle Alzheimer's signals. Moreover, the importance of calculating an optimal threshold value has been highlighted, usually by means of Shannon entropy as a helpful threshold identifier of the complex wavelet transform used to produce significant results. The effectiveness of Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy in handling Alzheimer's signals is evaluated, the former giving place to better features for neural network classification. As a result, accuracy has been improved from 90 to 95% using Tsallis entropy. Hence, this new proposal boosts the opportunity to reduce mortality rates by detecting the disease accurately.

The subjects included 90 patients with schizophrenia and 90 normal controls. Spectral analysis was performed on the absolute power of all of the electrodes across five frequency bands following artifact removal. We conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA to examine group differences within the five frequency bands across several brain regions and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses to examine the discrimination ability of each frequency band. Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia showed increased delta and theta activity and decreased alpha 2 activity, particularly in the frontocentral area. There were no significant differences in the alpha 1 and beta activity. The ROC analysis performed on the delta frequency band generated the best result, with an overall classification accuracy of 62.2%. The results of this study confirmed the characteristics of the QEEG power in un-medicated schizophrenia patients compared with normal controls. These findings suggest that a resting EEG test can be a supportive tool for evaluating patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is extensively used in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and can be used for disease diagnosis, disease treatment, etc. The two main technologies of EEG signal analysis is feature extraction and pattern recognition. The key features of EEG signals can be obtained through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The wavelet analysis is one kind of time-frequency analysis and has been considered very promising for data compression. The conventional method find wavelet synopsis to minimize the total mean squared error (L-2). It cannot control the approximation error of each single data element in the data vector. Usually, the nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linears, also more time-consuming in the meantime. In this paper, one method is provided to realize the feature extraction and pattern recognition of EEG signals. The data compression algorithm Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) proposed by Pang et al. takes a novel method to construct unrestricted Haar wavelet synopsis under uniform norm (L-infinity) error bound. In their algorithm, the maximum approximation error of each individual element can be bounded by an given error bound. We apply this method to EEG signal compression, thus the key features are obtained. Then a fast nonlinear classification algorithm, one Randomize Neural Network (RNN), is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals. The experiments indicate that (1) the F-Shift algorithm can compress EEG signals effectively and obtain the key features at the same time and (2) the RNN can discriminate different patterns of EEG signals based on the extracted features.

EEG and solution latencies (SLs) were recorded as 11 neurologically healthy volunteers worked on intellectually challenging math puzzles that involved combining four single-digit numbers through basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) to create an arithmetic expression equaling 24. Estimates of EEG spectral power were computed in three frequency bands - theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) - over a widely distributed montage of scalp electrode sites. The magnitude of power estimates was found to change in a linear fashion with SLs - that is, relative to a base of power spectrum, theta power increased with longer SLs, while alpha and beta power tended to decrease. Further, the topographic distribution of spectral fluctuations was characterized by more pronounced asymmetries along the left-right and anterior-posterior axes for solutions that involved a longer search phase. These findings reveal for the first time the topography and dynamics of EEG spectral activities important for sustained solution search during arithmetical problem solving.

Independent Component Analysis of Gait-Related Movement Artifact Recorded using EEG Electrodes during Treadmill Walking	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						walking; cortical sources; blind source separation; artifact removal; electroencephalography	OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; INVERSE; FOCUSS; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION; COGNITION; RHYTHMS	There has been a recent surge in the use of electroencephalography (EEG) as a tool for mobile brain imaging due to its portability and fine time resolution. When EEG is combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as arising from temporally independent signals located in spatially distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a 256-channel EEG system. We first blocked true electrocortical activity using a silicone swim cap. Over the silicone layer, we placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties similar to real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as non neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99% of the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked dipolar characteristics. The remaining 1% of sources had locations within the brain volume and low residual variances, but had topographical maps, power spectra, time courses, and event related spectral perturbations typical of non neural sources. Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that includes semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from human walking. Alternative methods are needed for the identification and separation of movement artifact in mobile EEG signals, especially methods that can be performed in real time. Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear the way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during mobile activities, such as walking.

Firstly, we show that the suppression of the negative frequency of the signal due of the use of Hilbert transform causes low Time-Frequency Distribution (TFD) resolution in the very low frequency band. To remedy this artifact, a frequency shifting of the signal to the mid frequency hand is used so that the negative and positive frequencies are taken into account in the time frequency domain. This process enhances the TFD resolution in the very low frequency band. Secondly, we derived a new separable kernel TFD with a high auto-terms energy concentration based on the localization of the auto-terms and cross-terms of the EEG spike signal in the ambiguity domain. The proposed kernel uses only two parameters and offers high TFD resolution compared to the existing ones.

In a previous study, a macroscopic model has been used to model various waveforms of EEG signal and to optimize its parameters by means of a genetic algorithm (GA). In the GA-based method for EEG parameters estimation, an optimization procedure is used. The aim of the optimization procedure is to minimize an objective function. The minimized error function compares the desired waveform (real EEG signal) and the waveform of the signal provided by the model both in the time domain and frequency domain. In the present study, we propose a time-scale based representation for the objective function as an alternative to the time and frequency based objective function used in the early study. The proposed objective function takes into account the non-stationary nature of the EEG signal. The performance of the proposed wavelet-based objective function is compared to that of the spectral objective function.

There exists a pressing need for an approach to accurately and uniquely capture the features without loss or destruction of the interactions amongst the modes (typically) of space, time, and frequency. Moreover, the approach must be able to quickly analyze the neural data of exponentially growing scales and sizes, in tens or even hundreds of channels, so that timely conclusions and decisions may be made. A salient approach to multi-way data analysis is the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) that manifests its effectiveness in the decomposition of the electroencephalography (EEG). However, the conventional PARAFAC is only suited for offline data analysis due to the high complexity, which computes to be O(n(2)) with the increasing data size. In this study, a large-scale PARAFAC method has been developed, which is supported by general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU). Comparing to the PARAFAC running on conventional CPU-based platform, the new approach dramatically excels by >360 times in run-time performance, and effectively scales by >400 times in all dimensions. Moreover, the proposed approach forms the basis of a model for the analysis of electrocochleography (ECoG) recordings obtained from epilepsy patients, which proves to be effective in the epilepsy state detection. The time evolutions of the proposed model are well correlated with the clinical observations. Moreover, the frequency signature is stable and high in the ictal phase. Furthermore, the spatial signature explicitly identifies the propagation of neural activities among various brain regions. The model supports real-time analysis of ECoG in >1; 000 channels on an inexpensive and available cyber-infrastructure.

Mechanistically, consolidation processes have been hypothesized to rely on systematic interactions between the three cardinal neuronal oscillations characterizing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Under global control of de- and hyperpolarizing slow oscillations (SOs), sleep spindles may cluster hippocampal ripples for a precisely timed transfer of local information to the neocortex. We used direct intracranial electroencephalogram recordings from human epilepsy patients during natural sleep to test the assumption that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. Employing cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that spindles were modulated by the up-state of SOs. Notably, spindles were found to in turn cluster ripples in their troughs, providing fine-tuned temporal frames for the hypothesized transfer of hippocampal memory traces.

J	Metzner, P; von der Malsburg, T; Vasishth, S; Rosler, F				Metzner, Paul; von der Malsburg, Titus; Vasishth, Shravan; Roesler, Frank			Brain Responses to World Knowledge Violations: A Comparison of Stimulus- and Fixation-triggered Event-related Potentials and Neural Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENTS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; EEG; FREQUENCY; CONTEXT; MEMORY; ALPHA; N400; PLAUSIBILITY; BAND	Recent research has shown that brain potentials time-locked to fixations in natural reading can be similar to brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We attempted two replications of Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, and Petersson [Hagoort, P., Hald, L., Bastiaansen, M., & Petersson, K. M. Integration of word meaning and world knowledge in language comprehension. Science, 304, 438-441, 2004] to determine whether this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain responses. Hagoort et al. reported an N400 effect and synchronization in the theta and gamma range following world knowledge violations. Our first experiment (n = 32) used RSVP and replicated both the N400 effect in the ERPs and the power increase in the theta range in the time-frequency domain. In the second experiment (n = 49), participants read the same materials freely while their eye movements and their EEG were monitored. First fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates were increased, and the ERP showed an N400 effect. An analysis of time-frequency representations showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. The results suggest that oscillatory EEG changes elicited by world knowledge violations are different in natural reading and RSVP. This may reflect differences in how representations are constructed and retrieved from memory in the two presentation modes.

It is a critical limitation to broader neurophysiological study of hf-SEPs in that hundreds of responses have to be averaged to detect hf-SEPs reliably. Here, we establish a framework for detecting human hf-SEPs non-invasively in single trials. Methods: Spatio-temporal features were extracted from band-pass filtered (400-900 Hz) hf-SEPs by bilinear Common Spatio-Temporal Patterns (bCSTP) and then classified by a weighted Extreme Learning Machine (w-ELM). The effect of varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of trials, and degree of w-ELM re-weighting was characterized using surrogate data. For practical demonstration of the algorithm, median nerve hf-SEPs were recorded inside a shielded room in four subjects, spanning the hf-SEP signal-to-noise ratio characteristic for a larger population, utilizing a custom-built 29-channel low-noise EEG amplifier. Results: Using surrogate data, the SNR proved to be pivotal to detect hf-SEPs in single trials efficiently, with the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm being obtained by the w-ELM re-weighting parameter. In practice, human hf-SEPs were detected non-invasively in single trials with a sensitivity of up to 99% and a specificity of up to 97% in two subjects, even without any recourse to knowledge of stimulus timing. Matching with the results of the surrogate data analysis, these rates dropped to 62-79% sensitivity and 18-31% specificity in two subjects with lower SNR. Conclusions: Otherwise buried in background noise, human high-frequency EEG components can be extracted from low-noise recordings. Specifically, refined supervised filter optimization and classification enables the reliable detection of single-trial hf-SEPs, representing non-invasive correlates of cortical population spikes. Significance: While low-frequency EEG reflects summed postsynaptic potentials, and thereby neuronal input, we suggest that high-frequency EEG (>400 Hz) can provide non-invasive access to the unaveraged output of neuronal computation, i.e., single-trial population spike activity evoked in the responsive neuronal ensemble.

The commonly observed oscillatory waves recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG) in normal adult humans can be grouped into five main categories according to the frequency and amplitude, namely delta(1-4 Hz, 20-200 mu V), theta(4-8 Hz, 10 mu V), alpha(8-12 Hz, 20-200 mu V), beta(12-30 Hz, 5-10 V), and gamma(30-80 Hz, low amplitude). Emerging evidence from experimental and human studies suggests that groups of function and behavior seem to be specifically associated with the presence of each oscillation band, although the complex relationship between oscillation frequency and function, as well as the interaction between brain oscillations, are far from clear. Changes of brain oscillation patterns have long been implicated in the diseases of the central nervous system including ischemic stroke, in which the reduction of cerebral blood flow as well as the progression of tissue damage have direct spatiotemporal effects on the power of several oscillatory bands and their interactions. This review summarizes the current knowledge in behavior and function associated with each brain oscillation, and also in the specific changes in brain electrical activities that correspond to the molecular events and functional alterations observed after experimental and human stroke. We provide the basis of the generations of brain oscillations and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying stroke-induced perturbation. We will also discuss the implications of using brain oscillation patterns as biomarkers for the prediction of stroke outcome and therapeutic efficacy.

As the EEG signal is highly nonlinear and nonstationary, the traditional Fourier analysis which expands signals in terms of sinusoids cannot appropriately represent the amplitude contribution from each frequency value. The HMS is derived from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which decomposes signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Since this decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal, it can be well applied to nonlinear and nonstationary processes. In this work, the spectral entropies and energy features of frequency-bands of the rhythms using HMS analysis are extracted and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) for seizure detection of EEG signals. A final comparison between the results obtained with the developed technique and results adopted by Polat and coworkers using Fourier analysis with the same database is given to show the effectiveness of this technique for seizure detection.

The aim of this study was to reveal quantitative changes in brain activity during emotional information processing related to psychosomatic states and to determine electrophysiological features of neuroticism. Twenty-two healthy subjects (mean age 25 years, 14 males and 8 females) were registered. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured during an emotional audiovisual memory task under three conditions (neutral, pleasant and unpleasant sessions). We divided the subjects into two groups using the Cornell Medical Index (CMI): (CMI-I: control group, n = 10: CMI-II, III or IV: neuroticism group, n = 12). We analyzed the digital EEG data using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) current source density (CSD) and functional connectivity analysis in several frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and whole band). In all subjects, bilateral frontal a CSD in the unpleasant session increased compared to the pleasant session, especially in the control group (p < 0.05). CSD of the neuroticism group was significantly higher than that of the control group in the full band at the amygdala and inferior temporal gyrus, and in the a band at the right temporal lobe (p < 0.05). Additionally, we found an increase in functional connectivity between the left insular cortex and right superior temporal gyrus in all subjects during the unpleasant session compared to the pleasant session (p < 0.05). In this study, using EEG analysis, we could find a novel cortical net work related to brain mechanisms underlying emotion regulation. Overall findings indicate that it is possible to characterize neuroticism electrophysiologically, which may serve as a neurophysiological marker of this personality trait. (C) 2015 S.

The goal of this work is to recognize different numbers using salient features of EEG signal. Using data acquisition system, EEG signal is recorded applying visual stimulation. Visual stimulation of different numbers produces different patterns in human brain that are basically reflected in EEG signal as well as its different rhythms. EEG signal with different rhythms is collected using Microsoft PowerPoint and significant features are extracted using frequency domain and time-frequency domain analysis. It is observed that the analysis of beta rhythmic EEG signal gives better results than other rhythms for number recognition. Wavelet transform analysis of beta rhythm can't distinguish different numbers whereas fast Fourier transforms and power spectral density can provide unique pattern for each number. Finally, power spectral density provides superior features than fast Fourier transform for number recognition. Beta rhythmic EEG signal based number recognition has direct impacts in neurologically disorder persons as well as in robotics.

As individual difference in response to nicotine may be related to a functional polymorphism in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that strongly influences cortical dopamine metabolism, this study examined the modulatory effects of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on the neural response to acute nicotine as measured with resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. In a sample of 62 healthy non-smoking adult males, a single dose (6 mg) of nicotine gum administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was shown to affect oscillatory activity, increasing power of upper oscillations in frontocentral regions of Met/Met homozygotes and in parietal/occipital regions of Val/Met heterozygotes. Peak frequency was also found to be faster with nicotine (vs. placebo) treatment in Val/Met heterozygotes, who exhibited a slower frequency compared to Val/Val homozygotes.

Electroencephalography (EEG) activities were recorded in 10 MCI patients and 17 healthy subjects when they performed a color match task. We calculated the phase synchrony index between each possible pairs of EEG channels in alpha and beta frequency bands and analyzed the local interconnectedness, overall connectedness and small-world characteristic of brain network in different degree for two groups. Relative to healthy normal controls, the properties of cortical networks in MCI patients tend to be a shift of randomization. Lower sigma of MCI had suggested that patients had a further loss of small-world attribute both during active and resting states. Our results provide evidence for the functional disconnection of brain regions in MCI. Furthermore, we found the properties of cortical networks could reflect the processing of conflict information in the selective attention task. The human brain tends to be a more regular and efficient neural architecture in the late stage of information processing. In addition, the processing of conflict information needs stronger information integration and transfer between cortical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This platform obtains EEG signal from electrode sensors, analyzes the signal and transmits the result to mobile device via Wi-Fi. Because the changes of EEG signal on the scalp received by electrode are in very small range, the signal is amplified by designed circuits. Low pass filter is applied in order to eliminate the component of breathing and high-pass filter is used to remove power supply noise. The digital logic in FPGA transforms time domain signal into frequency domain signal using 256 point radix-2 decimation-in-frequency as an FFT algorithm.

J	Cohen, MX				Cohen, Michael X.			Effects of time lag and frequency matching on phase-based connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG connectivity; Phase clustering; Phase-locking value; Phase lag index; Laplacian; Oscillations	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; DYNAMICS; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; INDEX	The time- and frequency-varying dynamics of how brain regions interact is one of the fundamental mysteries of neuroscience. In electrophysiological data, functional connectivity is often measured through the consistency of oscillatory phase angles between two electrodes placed in or over different brain regions. However, due to volume conduction, the results of such analyses can be difficult to interpret, because mathematical estimates of connectivity can be driven both by true inter-regional connectivity, and by volume conduction from the same neural source. Generally, there are two approaches to attenuate artifacts due to volume conduction: spatial filtering in combination with standard connectivity methods, or connectivity methods such as the weighted phase lag index that are blind to instantaneous connectivity that may reflect volume conduction artifacts. The purpose of this paper is to compare these two approaches directly in the presence of different connectivity time lags (5 or 25 ms) and physiologically realistic frequency non-stationarities. The results show that standard connectivity methods in combination with Laplacian spatial filtering correctly identified simulated connectivity regardless of time lag or changes in frequency, although residual volume conduction artifacts were seen in the vicinity of the "seed" electrode. Weighted phase lag index under-estimated connectivity strength at small time lags and failed to identify connectivity in the presence of frequency mismatches or non-stationarities, but did not misidentify volume conduction as "connectivity." Both approaches have strengths and limitations, and this paper concludes with practical advice for when to use which approach in context of hypothesis testing and exploratory data analyses.

FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS OF OSCILLATORY-tDCS ON EEG OSCILLATIONS: A STUDY WITH BETTER OSCILLATION DETECTION METHOD (BOSC)	ARCHIVES ITALIENNES DE BIOLOGIE			English	Article						transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); resting EEG; EEG synchronization; EEG oscillations; frontal cortex; Better OSCillation method (BOSC)	ELECTRIC-FIELDS; CURRENT STIMULATION; RHYTHMS; SLEEP; RAT; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY; EXTRACTS; NEURONS	Oscillating transcranial direct current stimulation (osc-tDCS) modulates the spontaneous brain activity in a frequency-specific manner. Most studies evaluated cortical effects of osc-tDCS through measures spectral analysis, without differentiating components associated with rhythmic and non-rhythmic activity. Since osc-tDCS mainly affects brain oscillatory activity, our aim was to investigate on the specific changes of EEG oscillations following a frontal osc-tDCS at 0.8 and at 5 Hz. 20 healthy subjects (26.8 +/- 2.5 years) participated in one of two experiments (Exp. 1= 0.8-Hz tDCS, n = 10; Exp. 2 = 5-Hz tDCS, n = 10), consisting of 3 within-subject sessions: two active conditions with different stimulation polarity (anodal osc-tDCS, cathodal osc-tDCS), and a control condition (sham). EEG oscillatory components (28 cortical derivations) at the stimulation frequency were measured by the Better OSCillation detection method (BOSC). Variations between before and after the osc-tDCS were compared between conditions as a function of polarity (anodal vs. cathodal vs. sham) and frequency (0.8 vs. 5 Hz) of stimulation. The main finding is a significant local increase of 0.81-Hz slow oscillations (F-1,F-18 = 19.97; p = 0.0004) and 5.3-Hz theta oscillations (F-1,F-18 = 26.93; p = 0.0001) after 5 Hz compared to 0.8-Hz tDCS. Our study shows larger frequency-specific and cross-frequency effects of 5-Hz compared to 0.8-Hz stimulation, not revealed by conventional FFT analyses. This finding is consistent with a more effective induction of EEG synchronization during wakefulness by means of a stimulation in the theta range, and it suggests to combine measurement of EEG power and EEG oscillations in future studies involving transcranial stimulations.

Altered Frequency Distribution in the Electroencephalogram is Correlated to the Analgesic Effect of Remifentanil	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							WAVELET ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; EEG; PAIN; PHARMACODYNAMICS; PHARMACOKINETICS; PROPOFOL	Opioids alter resting state brain oscillations by multiple and complex factors, which are still to be elucidated. To increase our knowledge, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was subjected to multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), to identify the most descriptive frequency bands and scalp locations altered by remifentanil in healthy volunteers. Sixty-two channels of resting EEG followed by independent measures of pain scores to heat and bone pain were recorded in 21 healthy males before and during remifentanil infusion in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. EEG frequency distributions were extracted by a continuous wavelet transform and normalized into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Alterations relative to pre-treatment responses were calculated for all channels and used as input to the MVPA. Compared to placebo, remifentanil increased the delta band and decreased the theta and alpha band oscillations as a mean over all channels (all p0.007). The most discriminative channels in these frequency bands were F1 in delta (83.33%, p=0.0023) and theta bands (95.24%, p<0.0001), and C6 in the alpha band (80.95%, p=0.0054). These alterations were correlated to individual changes in heat pain in the delta (p=0.045), theta (p=0.038) and alpha (p=0.039) bands and to bone pain in the alpha band (p=0.0092). Hence, MVPA of multi-channel EEG was able to identify frequency bands and corresponding channels most sensitive to altered brain activity during remifentanil treatment. As the EEG alterations were correlated to the analgesic effect, the approach may prove to be a novel methodology for monitoring individual efficacy to opioids.

Due to historical reasons and preconceptions about the limitations of this brain imaging method, most studies have focused on assessing connectivity over extended periods of time. It is now clear that fMRI can resolve the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity, like other faster imaging techniques such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (albeit on a different temporal scale). However, the indirect nature of fMRI measurements can hinder the interpretability of the results. After briefly summarizing recent advances in the field, we discuss how the simultaneous combination of fMRI with electrophysiological activity measurements can contribute to a better understanding of dynamic functional connectivity in humans both during rest and task, wakefulness, and other brain states.

The EEG wave pattern and frequency vary during five stages of sleep. These subtle variations in sleep EEG signals cannot be easily detected through visual inspection. Summary: A range of time, frequency, time-frequency and nonlinear analysis methods can be applied to understand the complex physiological signals and their chaotic behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative review and analysis of 29 nonlinear dynamics measures for EEG-based sleep stage detection. Key Messages: The characteristic ranges of these features are reported for the five different sleep stages. All nonlinear measures produce clinically significant results, that is, they can discriminate the individual sleep stages. Feature ranking based on the statistical F-value, however, shows that the third order cumulant of higher order spectra yields the most discriminative result. The distinct value ranges for each sleep stage and the discriminative power of the features can be used for sleep disorder diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and drug efficacy assessment. (C) 2015 S.

J	Plikynas, D				Plikynas, Darius			Oscillating Agent Model: Quantum Approach	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						oscillating agent model; wave function; basic mind states; electroencephalography	BRAIN ACTIVITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; SIMULATION; ASYMMETRY; COHERENCE; FIELDS; ENERGY; SLEEP; CHAOS	Enabled by recent neuroscience and especially electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, this paper describes a conceptually novel modeling approach, based on quantum theory, to basic human mind states as systems of coherent oscillation. The aim is to bridge the gap between fundamental theory, experimental observation and the simulation of agents' mind states. The proposed approach, i.e., an oscillating agent model (OAM), reveals possibilities of employing wave functions and quantum operators for a stylized description of basic mind states and the transitions between them. In the OAM the basic mind states are defined using experimentally observed EEG spectra, i.e., brainwaves (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma), which reveal an oscillatory nature of agents' mind states. Such an approach provides an opportunity to model the dynamics of basic mind states by employing stylized oscillation-based representations of the characteristic EEG power spectral density (PSD) distributions of brainwaves observed in experiments. In other words, the proposed OAM describes a probabilistic mechanism for transitions between basic mind states characterized by unique sets of brainwaves.

However, it is still not fully understood how this essential combinatory process is represented in the human brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have unanimously attested the relevance of activation in the posterior superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus (pSTS/MTG), while electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands to be associated with multisensory integration. In the current study, we used fMRI and EEG to separately investigate the anatomical and oscillatory neural signature of integrating intrinsically meaningful gestures (IMG; e.g. "Thumbs-up gesture") and corresponding speech (e.g., "The actor did a good job"). In both the fMRI (n=20) and EEG (n=20) study, participants were presented with videos of an actor either: performing IMG in the context of a German sentence (GG), IMG in the context of a Russian (as a foreign language) sentence (GR), or speaking an isolated German sentence without gesture (SG). The results of the fMRI experiment confirmed that gesture-speech processing of IMG activates the posterior MTG (GG > GRnGG > SG). In the EEG experiment we found that the identical integration process (GG > GRnGG > SG) is related to a centrally-distributed alpha (7-13 Hz) power decrease within 700-1400 ms post-onset of the critical word. These new findings suggest that BOLD response increase in the pMTG and alpha power decrease represent the neural correlates of integrating intrinsically meaningful gestures with their corresponding speech.

This combination, however, leads to a distortion of the EEG signal by the so-called cardio-ballistic artefacts. The aim of the present study was developing an approach to restore meaningful physiological EEG data from recordings at different magnetic fields. New methods: The distortions introduced by the magnetic field were corrected using a combination of concepts from independent component analysis (ICA) and mutual information (MI). Thus, the components were classified as either related to the cardio-ballistic artefacts or to the signals of interest. EEG data from two experimental paradigms recorded at different magnetic field strengths up to 9.4T were analyzed: (i) spontaneous activity using an eyes-open/eyes-closed alternation, and (ii) responses to auditory stimuli, i.e. auditory evoked potentials. Results: Even at ultra-high magnetic fields up to 9.4T the proposed artefact rejection approach restored the physiological time-frequency information contained in the signal of interest and the data were suitable for subsequent analyses. Comparison with existing methods: Blind source separation (BSS) has been used to retrieve information from EEG data recorded inside the MR scanner in previous studies. After applying the presented method on EEG data recorded at 4T, 71, and 9.4T, we could retrieve more information than from data cleaned with the BSS method. Conclusions: The present work demonstrates that EEG data recorded at ultra-high magnetic fields can be used for studying neuroscientific research question related to oscillatory activity.

Frequency of gamma oscillations in humans is modulated by velocity of visual motion	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; visual cortex; frequency of gamma oscillations; electroencephalography; spatial suppression	CENTER-SURROUND ANTAGONISM; CONTOUR INTEGRATION; NMDA RECEPTORS; PEAK FREQUENCY; CORTEX; PARVALBUMIN; RAT; EEG; INTERNEURONS; RHYTHM	Gamma oscillations are generated in networks of inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons and pyramidal cells. In animals, gamma frequency is modulated by the velocity of visual motion; the effect of velocity has not been evaluated in humans. In this work, we have studied velocity-related modulations of gamma frequency in children using MEG/EEG. We also investigated whether such modulations predict the prominence of the "spatial suppression" effect (Tadin D, Lappin JS, Gilroy LA, Blake R. Nature 424: 312-315, 2003) that is thought to depend on cortical center-surround inhibitory mechanisms. MEG/EEG was recorded in 27 normal boys aged 8-15 yr while they watched high-contrast black-and-white annular gratings drifting with velocities of 1.2, 3.6, and 6.0 degrees/s and performed a simple detection task. The spatial suppression effect was assessed in a separate psychophysical experiment. MEG gamma oscillation frequency increased while power decreased with increasing velocity of visual motion. In EEG, the effects were less reliable. The frequencies of the velocity-specific gamma peaks were 64.9, 74.8, and 87.1 Hz for the slow, medium, and fast motions, respectively. The frequency of the gamma response elicited during slow and medium velocity of visual motion decreased with subject age, whereas the range of gamma frequency modulation by velocity increased with age. The frequency modulation range predicted spatial suppression even after controlling for the effect of age. We suggest that the modulation of the MEG gamma frequency by velocity of visual motion reflects excitability of cortical inhibitory circuits and can be used to investigate their normal and pathological development in the human brain.

Imagination of left and right hand movements results in spatially distinct brain activation patterns that can be used as control signals for the BCI. Motor imagery (MI) results in the attenuation (event related desynchronization, ERD) or enhancement (event related synchronization, ERS) of amplitude in a certain frequency band of electroencephalogram (EEG). This frequency band can vary between different participants. Therefore time-frequency (TF) analysis is performed in order to extract interesting features from EEG. A simple way of performing TF analysis is by using band power features. In this paper we investigate the perspective of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for extracting TF information used for MI classification. HHT is a method that allows calculation of instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the signal. It does that by decomposing the signal into components for which these parameters can be calculated by means of Hilbert transform. We compare classification accuracy of simple band power features and features obtained by means of HHT on BCI competition IV dataset 2b.

In this paper, an electroencephalography (EEG) study is presented regarding the cognitive processes of an instructed liar/truth-teller during the time window of stimulus (question) delivery period (SDP) prior to their deceptive/truthful responses towards questions related to authentic (WE: with prior experience) and fictional experience (NE: no prior experience). To investigate deception in non-experienced events, the subjects were given stimuli in a mock interview scenario that induced them to fabricate lies. To analyze the data, frequency domain network and connectivity analysis was performed in the source space in order to provide a more systematic level understanding of deception during SDP. This study reveals several groups of neuronal generators underlying both the instructed lying (IL) and the instructed truth-telling (IT) conditions for both tasks during the SDP. Despite the similarities existed in these group components, significant differences were found in the intra- and inter-group connectivity between the IL and IT conditions in either task. Additionally, the response time was found to be positively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the inferior frontal gyrus (44R) in the WE-IL condition and positively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the precuneus (7L) and the angular gyrus (39R) in the WE-IT condition. However, the response time was found to be marginally negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the secondary auditory cortex (42L) in the NE-IL condition and negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the somatosensory association cortex (5L, R) in the NE-IT condition. Therefore, these results provide complementary and intuitive evidence for the differences between the IL and IT conditions in SDP for two types of deception tasks, thus elucidating the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying SDP of deception from regional, inter-regional, network, and inter-network scale analyses.

Preclinical studies on animal models of epilepsy are mainly based on the analysis of brain electrical activity to detect seizures, when they are not just limited to behavioral tests like the Racine scale. Methods: In the present review, we discuss the importance of using time-locked video and EEG recordings (Video-EEG) coupled with behavioral tests as tools to monitor and analyze the effects of anti-epileptic drugs in pre-clinical research. Particularly, we focus on the utility of a multimodal approach based on EEG/behavioral analysis to study the beneficial effects of chronic rapamycin treatment as a potential anti-epileptogenic therapy for a broad spectrum of epilepsy, including both genetic (as in tuberous sclerosis complex) and acquired diseases. Results: Changes and synchronization of neuronal activity of different areas have been correlated with specific behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions. In the epileptic brain, during a seizure there is an abnormal activation of many cells all at once, altering different networks. Conclusion: A multimodal approach based on video, EEG analysis and behavioral tests would be the best option in preclinical studies of epilepsy. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association.

Event-Related Potential and Time-Frequency Endophenotypes for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Auditory Oddball; ERP; P300; PCA; Psychosis; Time-Frequency	P300 AMPLITUDE; AUDITORY P300; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; NEURAL ACTIVATIONS; ABNORMALITIES; RELATIVES; PROBANDS; TARGET; FAMILY	BACKGROUND: The investigators compared event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes and event-related oscillations across a broad frequency range during an auditory oddball task using a comprehensive analysis approach to describe shared and unique neural auditory processing characteristics among healthy subjects (HP), schizophrenia probands (SZ) and their first-degree relatives, and bipolar disorder I with psychosis probands (BDP) and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: This Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes sample consisted of clinically stable SZ (n = 229) and BDP (n = 188), HP (n = 284), first-degree relatives of schizophrenia probands (n = 264), and first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder I with psychosis probands (n = 239). They were administered an auditory oddball task in the electroencephalography environment. Principal components analysis derived data-driven frequency bands evoked power. Spatial principal components analysis reduced ERP and frequency data to component waveforms for each subject. Clusters of time bins with significant group differences on response magnitude were assessed for proband/relative differences from HP and familiality. RESULTS: Nine variables survived a linear discriminant analysis between HP, SZ, and BDP. Of those, two showed evidence (deficit in relatives and familiality) as genetic risk markers more specific to SZ (N1, P3b), one was specific to BDP (P2) and one for psychosis in general (N2). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports for both shared and unique deficits in early sensory and late cognitive processing across psychotic diagnostic groups. Additional ERP and time-frequency component alterations (frontal N2/P2, late high, early, mid, and low frequency) may provide insight into deficits in underlying neural architecture and potential protective/compensatory mechanisms in unaffected relatives.

So far, it is not known to what extent different devices display similar index values while processing identical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. OBJECTIVE To compare BIS and state entropy during analysis of identical EEG data. Inspection of raw EEG input to detect potential causes of erroneous index calculation. DESIGN Offline re-analysis of EEG data from a randomised, single-centre controlled trial using the Entropy Module and an Aspect A-2000 monitor. SETTING Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich. PATIENTS Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prediction probability (P-K) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/ high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts. RESULTS P-K of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSION High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.

Neuronal mechanisms supporting the maintenance of feature-specific information have remained unidentified. Synchronized oscillations in the gamma band (30-120 Hz) characterize VWM retention and predict task performance, but whether these oscillations are specific to memorized features and VWM contents or underlie general executive VWM functions is not known. In the present study, we investigated whether gamma oscillations reflect the maintenance of feature-specific information in VWM. Concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography was recorded while subjects memorized different object features or feature conjunctions in identical VWM experiments. Using a data-driven source analysis approach, we show that the strength, load-dependence, and source topographies of gamma oscillations in the visual cortex differentiate these memorized features. Load-dependence of gamma oscillations in feature-specific visual and prefrontal areas also predicts VWM accuracy. Furthermore, corroborating the hypothesis that gamma oscillations support the perceptual binding of feature-specific neuronal assemblies, we also show that VWM for color-location conjunctions is associated with stronger gamma oscillations than that for these features separately. Gamma oscillations hence support the maintenance of feature-specific information and reflect VWM contents. The results also suggest that gamma oscillations contribute to feature binding in the formation of memory representations.	[Honkanen, Roosa; Rouhinen, Santeri; Wang, Sheng H.; Palva, J.

In this work, we propose to use the functional boxplot (FBP) to analyze log periodograms of EEG time series data in the spectral domain. The functional bloxplot approach produces a median curve-which is not equivalent to connecting medians obtained from frequency-specific boxplots. In addition, this approach identifies a functional median, summarizes variability, and detects potential outliers. By extending FBPs analysis from one-dimensional curves to surfaces, surface boxplots are also used to explore the variation of the spectral power for the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-32 Hz) frequency bands across the brain cortical surface. By using rank-based nonparametric tests, we also investigate the stationarity of EEG traces across an exam acquired during resting-state by comparing the spectrum during the early vs. late phases of a single resting-state EEG exam.

Specifically, little is known about how these effects are reflected in the time-frequency domain. This study thus assessed the relationship between aerobic fitness and neural oscillations during visuo-spatial attention. A between-subjects design that included 20 participants with higher aerobic fitness (age = 21.95 +/- A 2.24 years; VO2max = 58.98 +/- A 6.94 ml/kg/min) and 20 age- and gender-matched lower aerobic fitness participants (age = 23.25 +/- A 2.07 years; VO2max = 35.87 +/- A 3.41 ml/kg/min) was used to examine the fitness-related differences in performance and neuroelectric indexes during a Posner visuo-spatial attention paradigm. The results demonstrated that high-fitness participants, in comparison with their low-fitness counterparts, showed faster reaction times as well as greater modulation of oscillatory theta and beta power during target processing, regardless of cue types. Moreover, the neurocognitive correlation showed that higher theta power was related to better task performance. Collectively, these findings suggest that aerobic fitness is associated with general enhanced attentional control in relation to visuo-spatial processing, as evidenced through greater motor preparation and in particular the up-regulation of attentional processing in healthy young adults. The present study may contribute to current knowledge by revealing the relationship between aerobic fitness and modulation of brain oscillations.

We used a combined Stroop-task-switching paradigm and recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to explore the neural mechanism underlying the phenomenon of asymmetrical switch costs. The results revealed that a fronto-central N2 component demonstrated greater negativity in word switch (cW) trials relative to word repeat (wW) trials, and both First P3 and P3b components over the parieto-central region exhibited greater positivity in color switch (wC) trials relative to color repeat (cC) trials, whereas a contrasting switch-related fronto-central SP effect was found to have an opposite pattern for each task. Moreover, the time-frequency analysis showed a right-frontal lower alpha band (9-11 Hz) modulation in the word task, whereas a fronto-central upper alpha band (11-13 Hz) modulation was exclusively found in the color task. These results provide evidence for dissociable neural processes, which are related to inhibitory control and endogenous control, contributing to the generation of asymmetrical switch costs.

Nineteen EEG electrodes were placed on the scalp following the 10-20 system. These electrodes were then grouped into five recording regions corresponding to the scalp area of the cerebral cortex. Sixty-second WM task data were recorded from ten control subjects. Forty-five MWT basis functions from orthogonal families were investigated. These functions included Daubechies (db1-db20), Symlets (sym1-sym20), and Coiflets (coif1-coif5). Using ANOVA, we determined the MWT basis functions with the most significant differences in the ability of the five scalp regions to maximize their cross-correlation with the EEG signals. The best results were obtained using sym9 across the five scalp regions. Therefore, the most compatible MWT with the EEG signals should be selected to achieve wavelet denoising, decomposition, reconstruction, and sub-band feature extraction. This study provides a reference of the selection of efficient MWT basis functions.

The present study investigates the neurophysiology of attentional capture by salient stimuli in the visual modality. Evoked oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range (40 Hz) was assessed during visual processing of physically salient distracters and evaluated in relation to schizotypy and its positive, negative and disorganized dimension. The early evoked visual gamma-band response (GBR) was assessed for 24 healthy participants using EEG time-frequency analysis. Physical salience was constituted by colored stimuli diverting from an ongoing baseline condition. schizotypal personality traits were measured by the schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ; Raine in Schizophr Bull 17:555-564, 1991). The early evoked visual GBR was significantly pronounced in the physically salient distracter condition. GBR signal power was significantly correlated with positive schizotypal personality traits (r = 0.588; p = 0.024*). Our results indicate that the early evoked GBR in visual processing of physically salient distracters is associated with schizotypy. These findings refer to the phenomenology of aberrant salience by bridging the gap to neurophysiological research on early sensory selection and attentional capture in the schizophrenia spectrum.

I	eLearning and Software for Education		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE)	APR 23-24, 2015	Bucharest, ROMANIA			brain- computer interface; emotional state; EEG headset; affective learning; valence - arousal model; classification		In the last decade, the interest in the development of tools and devices for recognizing human emotions in learning process has increased continuously. It was proved that the electrical brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) represents a useful methodological tool in understanding cortical processes that underlie performance and students' engagement in learning activities. Specific emotional states, like mental stress, concentration, relaxation, fatigue, and cognitive increase activation in Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-7 Hz), Alpha 1 and 2 (8-12 Hz), Beta 1 and 2 (12-30 Hz), Gamma (30-70 Hz) frequencies. For example, the increase of frontal Beta-1 spectral power is associated with cognitive tasks demands and the decrease of Beta-1 power values reflects relaxation. Alpha is the dominant frequency in the human EEG and is generated in widespread areas of the cortex through corticocortical and thalamo-cortical interactions reflecting emotions. The EEG-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely studied in different medical labs with high quality EEG recording devices which are much too expensive and need special employment. As an alternative to these professional equipment, several low-cost EEG devices were developed for out of the lab applications e.g. schools, universities, sports medicine, psychology or even neurophysiology. Two pertinent and detailed studies developed at Princeton University (http://compmem.princeton.edu/experimenter) and University of Mons (www.biomedical-engineeringonline.com/content/12/1/56) reveal that the Emotiv Epoc headset could be taken into account. This low-cost EEG device has higher relative operational and maintenance costs than its medical-grade competitor, it "is able to record EEG data in a satisfying manner" but it should only be chosen for non critical applications such as games, communication or feedback evaluation in a well-known scenarios. Our study aims to use the Emotiv headset for evaluating the students' emotional state in learning process. For this goal, some steps were completed: EEG data acquisition and analysis. The headset connects wirelessly to any PC via a USB dongle allowing freedom of movement, has 14 channels/sensors and the data sample rate is 128Hz. Due to the problem of eye/head movements automatic artefact detection must be completed and only artefact-free segments must be used for analysis. A good option is to use the Matlab toolbox EEGLAB, freely available open source research software (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab) and the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method for general EEG analysis and artifacting. Spectral power for each frequency band is computed and used for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis. Mean values and standard deviation could be calculated and relevant statistical values tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA or Mauchley) have to be performed for different learning status, like reading a very simple text or a very difficult one, discussion on a subject, playing a game, programming under time restrictions. The obtained row data of the acquired signal should be compared with those provided by MIT-BIH Database Distribution (http://ecg.mit.edu/). Based on this EEG feedback approach, some conclusions can be formulated regarding students' implication in learning or the difficulty of the teaching materials.

Detection of focal EEG signals locates the epileptogenic area which is an important task for successful surgery. The proposed method is based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) that uses the ratio of amplitude modulation bandwidth (B-AM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (B-FM), as a feature for identification of focal EEG signals. The feature average bandwidths ratio (AvgB(ratio)) extracted from analytic intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is set to input in k-Means and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) unsupervised learning. Statistical test Kruskal-Wallis shows the effective discrimination ability of the feature. The experimental results shows that proposed method is precisely proficient to classify focal and non-focal EEG signals using single narrow frequency band. A comparative analysis of both unsupervised learning techniques is performed by elapsed time, time complexity, and accuracy.

When evaluated using 10 insomniacs and 10 healthy subjects, we found significant differences in the feature values between the two groups. Participants with primary insomnia were observed to have significantly elevated Hjorth's parameters particularly complexity, high zero crossing rates specifically during wake and sleep stage 1 and high gamma power in all sleep stages. Given the significant differences between the two groups, these features can be used to better understand the sleep dynamics of insomniacs and accurately discriminate insomniac EEG data from that of healthy subjects.

This is usually achieved by looking at the pattern of brain activity across many trials while the subject is imagining the performance of an instructed action - the process known as motor imagery. Nevertheless, existing motor imagery classification algorithms do not always achieve good performances because of the noisy and non-stationary nature of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability. Thus, current EEG BCI takes a considerable upfront toll on patients, who have to submit to lengthy training sessions before even being able to use the BCI. In this study, we developed a data-efficient classifier for left/right hand motor imagery by combining in our pattern recognition both the oscillation frequency range and the scalp location. We achieve this by using a combination of Morlet wavelet and Common Spatial Pattern theory to deal with non-stationarity and noise. The system achieves an average accuracy of 88% across subjects and was trained by about a dozen training (10-15) examples per class reducing the size of the training pool by up to a 100-fold, making it very data-efficient way for EEG BCI.

Surface EEG measurements from 20 children (8-12 years) and 25 students (21-26 years) were analyzed. Interregional synchronization of brain activity was quantified by means of Phase Lag Index and for various frequency bands. Based on these pairwise estimates of functional connectivity, we formed graphs which were then characterized in terms of local structure [local efficiency (LE)] and overall integration (global efficiency). The overall data analytic scheme was applied twice, in a static and time-varying mode. Our results showed a characteristic trend: functional segregation dominates the network organization of younger brains. Moreover, in childhood, the overall functional network possesses more prominent small-world network characteristics than in early acorrect in xmldulthood in accordance with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis. The above trends were intensified by the time-varying approach and identified for the whole set of tested frequency bands (from delta to low gamma). By mapping the time-indexed connectivity patterns to multivariate timeseries of nodal LE measurements, we carried out an elaborate study of the functional segregation dynamics and demonstrated that the underlying network undergoes transitions between a restricted number of stable states, that can be thought of as "network-level microstates". The rate of these transitions provided a robust marker of developmental and task-induced alterations, that was found to be insensitive to reference montage and independent component analysis denoising.

Here we explore the neurophysiology of food-related visual cue processing in weight reduced and weight relapsed women by assessing differences in cortical arousal and attentional processing using a food-Stroop paradigm. Methods: 51 women were recruited into 4 groups: reduced-weight participants (RED, n = 14) compared to BMI matched low-weight controls (LW-CTL, n = 18); and weight relapsed participants (REL, n = 10) compared to BMI matched high-weight controls (HW-CTL, n = 9). Eating behaviour and body image questionnaires were completed. Two Stroop tasks (one containing food images, the other containing neutral images) were completed with record of electroencephalography (EEG). Results: Differences in cortical arousal were found in RED versus LW-CTL women, and were seen during food task execution only. Compared to their controls, RED women exhibited lower relative delta band power (p = 0.01) and higher relative beta band power (p = 0.01) over the right frontal cortex (F-4). Within the RED group, delta band oscillations correlated positively with self-reported habitual fat intake and with body shape dissatisfaction. Conclusions: As compared to women matched for phenotype but with no history of weight reduction, reduced-overweight/obese women show increased neurobehavioural control over external food cues and the inhibition of reward-orientated feeding responses. Insight into these self-regulatory mechanisms which attenuate food cue saliency may aid in the development of cognitive remediation therapies which facilitate long-term weight loss.

Compared with non-meditators, the power of delta band was lower while high frequency band was higher for a meditator. Alpha band over the scalp was much more active in normal state for meditator with decreased dominant alpha frequency. Obvious transient process between normal eyes-closed rest and meditation was observed after EEG analysis. The active time and the power of beta and gamma band increased significantly in meditation. The inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric coherence beta and low gamma bands for meditative state were higher than normal state.

They have recently been used as a reliable biomarker of epileptogenic zones. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of discriminating between the different classes of HFOs which physiological/pathological value is critical for diagnostic but remains to be clarified. The proposed method is based on the definition of a relevant feature vector built from energy ratios (computed using Wavelet Transform-WT) in a-priori- defined frequency bands. It makes use of a multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and is applied to iEEG signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. Results obtained from bootstrap on training/test datasets indicate high performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Group A included 15 refractory epileptic patients who had undergone an epileptic surgery; group B consisted of 15 outpatient epileptic patients who had a seizure type of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. All patients had no abnormalities detected in their routine brain MRI examinations. The methodology that leads to the lateralization is based on several processing steps: interictal spikes selection, full frequency adaptive directed transfer function analysis, significant causal connections extraction, and then lateralization.Results:Ninety-six of 104 spikes' sources lateralized by full frequency adaptive directed transfer function were consistent with their corresponding surgery side in group A, with the accuracy of 92.31%. Ninety-seven of 101 spikes' sources were lateralized correctly in group B, according to technicians' judgments from ictal scalp video-EEG recordings, with the accuracy of 96.04%.Conclusions:The results demonstrated the feasibility of correctly lateralizing the epileptic foci by using full frequency adaptive directed transfer function to scalp EEG interictal spike activity.

Comparative study of Poincare plot analysis using short electroencephalogram signals during anaesthesia with spectral edge frequency 95 and bispectral index	ANAESTHESIA			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CEREBRAL STATE; TIME-DELAY; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NARCOTREND INDEXES; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; AWARENESS; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; SEVOFLURANE	The return or Poincare plot is a non-linear analytical approach in a two-dimensional plane, where a timed signal is plotted against itself after a time delay. Its scatter pattern reflects the randomness and variability in the signals. Quantification of a Poincare plot of the electroencephalogram has potential to determine anaesthesia depth. We quantified the degree of dispersion (i.e. standard deviation, SD) along the diagonal line of the electroencephalogram-Poincare plot (named as SD1/SD2), and compared SD1/SD2 values with spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95) and bispectral index values. The regression analysis showed a tight linear regression equation with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.904 (p<0.0001) between the Poincare index (SD1/SD2) and SEF95, and a moderate linear regression equation between SD1/SD2 and bispectral index (R-2=0.346, p<0.0001). Quantification of the Poincare plot tightly correlates with SEF95, reflecting anaesthesia-dependent changes in electroencephalogram oscillation.

The performance on easy (divisibility by 2, 3, or 5) and hard tasks (divisibility by 9 or by 11) was compared. In a behavioral experiment on 52 adults we found a significant increase in performance from 67% to 90% correct responses induced by rule learning. Subsequently, the EEG data recorded from 30 additional volunteers were analyzed. EEG recordings were performed in two parts: First, subjects had to solve 200 tasks without knowing the divisibility rules. Then the rules were explained, followed by another set of 200 tasks. EEG was measured simultaneously in 30 channels, artifacts were removed offline, and the data before and after rule learning were compared. A wavelet transformation with the Morlet-5 wavelet was computed, and the scalp topography of the maximal frequency and its occurrence time was compared. Largest effects were observed with frequencies between about 6 and 18 Hz. In the frequency band between 12 and 30 Hz maximal frequencies were significantly different after successful learning over frontal and centro-parietal scalp areas of the right hemisphere. These changes were paralleled by decreased response times. In summary, our data illustrate a significant relation between successful learning divisibility rules and changes in the frequency content of the task-related EEG. Significant effects were observed after a very short training period of less than 10 min. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain and Memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Cumulative evidence suggests that both stimulus and response conflict contribute to the Stroop interference effect. However, it remains unclear whether there are dissociable event-related potential (ERP) or frequency band-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) power changes associated with stimulus conflict and response conflict. To investigate potential markers for each form of conflict, we applied a Stroop 2-1 mapping task in 20 healthy young adults. Results showed that a negative deflection in the 350-500 ms time window (N450) and a positive deflection in the 600-900 ms time window (late positive component, LPC) were associated with response conflict and stimulus conflict, respectively. Time-frequency analyses found that both stimulus and response conflict induced theta band power changes and that response conflict additionally induced a beta band power change. These results indicate that stimulus and response conflict in the Stroop task are associated with different ERP effects and brain oscillatory features. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Brain Network Connectivity During Language Comprehension: Interacting Linguistic and Perceptual Subsystems	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						gamma oscillations; MEG; morphology; speech comprehension	OSCILLATORY GAMMA-ACTIVITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY; TOP-DOWN; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; EEG-DATA; SPEECH; MEG	The dynamic neural processes underlying spoken language comprehension require the real-time integration of general perceptual and specialized linguistic information. We recorded combined electro- and magnetoencephalographic measurements of participants listening to spoken words varying in perceptual and linguistic complexity. Combinatorial linguistic complexity processing was consistently localized to left perisylvian cortices, whereas competition-based perceptual complexity triggered distributed activity over both hemispheres. Functional connectivity showed that linguistically complex words engaged a distributed network of oscillations in the gamma band (20-60 Hz), which only partially overlapped with the network supporting perceptual analysis. Both processes enhanced cross-talk between left temporal regions and bilateral pars orbitalis (BA47). The left-lateralized synchrony between temporal regions and pars opercularis (BA44) was specific to the linguistically complex words, suggesting a specific role of left frontotemporal cross-cortical interactions in morphosyntactic computations. Synchronizations in oscillatory dynamics reveal the transient coupling of functional networks that support specific computational processes in language comprehension.

J	Becker, R; Knock, S; Ritter, P; Jirsa, V				Becker, Robert; Knock, Stuart; Ritter, Petra; Jirsa, Viktor			Relating Alpha Power and Phase to Population Firing and Hemodynamic Activity Using a Thalamo-cortical Neural Mass Model	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; BRAIN ACTIVITY; METABOLIC-RATE; FMRI; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHM; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; MECHANISMS	Oscillations are ubiquitous phenomena in the animal and human brain. Among them, the alpha rhythm in human EEG is one of the most prominent examples. However, its precise mechanisms of generation are still poorly understood. It was mainly this lack of knowledge that motivated a number of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This approach revealed how oscillatory neuronal signatures such as the alpha rhythm are paralleled by changes of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Several such studies revealed a negative correlation between the alpha rhythm and the hemodynamic BOLD signal in visual cortex and a positive correlation in the thalamus. In this study we explore the potential generative mechanisms that lead to those observations. We use a bursting capable Stefanescu-Jirsa 3D (SJ3D) neural-mass model that reproduces a wide repertoire of prominent features of local neuronal-population dynamics. We construct a thalamo-cortical network of coupled SJ3D nodes considering excitatory and inhibitory directed connections. The model suggests that an inverse correlation between cortical multi-unit activity, i.e. the firing of neuronal populations, and narrow band local field potential oscillations in the alpha band underlies the empirically observed negative correlation between alpha-rhythm power and fMRI signal in visual cortex. Furthermore the model suggests that the interplay between tonic and bursting mode in thalamus and cortex is critical for this relation. This demonstrates how biophysically meaningful modelling can generate precise and testable hypotheses about the underpinnings of large-scale neuroimaging signals.

If non-invasive methods alone do not allow to delineate the epileptogenic brain areas the surgical candidates undergo long-term monitoring with intracranial EEG. Visual EEG analysis is then used to identify the seizure onset zone for targeted resection as a standard procedure. Methods Despite of its great potential to assess the epileptogenicty of brain tissue, quantitative EEG analysis has not yet found its way into routine clinical practice. To demonstrate that quantitative EEG may yield clinically highly relevant information we retrospectively investigated how post-operative seizure control is associated with four selected EEG measures evaluated in the resected brain tissue and the seizure onset zone. Importantly, the exact spatial location of the intracranial electrodes was determined by coregistration of pre-operative MRI and post-implantation CT and coregistration with post-resection MRI was used to delineate the extent of tissue resection. Using data-driven thresholding, quantitative EEG results were separated into normally contributing and salient channels. Results In patients with favorable post-surgical seizure control a significantly larger fraction of salient channels in three of the four quantitative EEG measures was resected than in patients with unfavorable outcome in terms of seizure control (median over the whole peri-ictal recordings). The same statistics revealed no association with post-operative seizure control when EEG channels contributing to the seizure onset zone were studied. Conclusions We conclude that quantitative EEG measures provide clinically relevant and objective markers of target tissue, which may be used to optimize epilepsy surgery. The finding that differentiation between favorable and unfavorable outcome was better for the fraction of salient values in the resected brain tissue than in the seizure onset zone is consistent with growing evidence that spatially extended networks might be more relevant for seizure generation, evolution and termination than a single highly localized brain region (i.e. a "focus") where seizures start.

The neural substrates of SA have been investigated in many neuroimaging studies, but the functional connectivity of identified regions has rarely been investigated. The goal of this study is to investigate the neural network related to SA. Methods SA of hand movements was modulated with virtual reality. We examined the cortical network relating to SA modulation with electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum and phase coherence of alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands in 16 right-handed, healthy volunteers. Results In the alpha band, significant relative power changes and phase coherence of alpha band were associated with SA modulation. The relative power decrease over the central, bilateral parietal, and right temporal regions (C4, Pz, P3, P4, T6) became larger as participants more effectively controlled the virtual hand movements. The phase coherence of the alpha band within frontal areas (F7-FP2, F7-Fz) was directly related to changes in SA. The functional connectivity was lower as the participants felt that they could control their virtual hand. In the other frequency bands, significant phase coherences were observed in the frontal (or central) to parietal, temporal, and occipital regions during SA modulation (Fz-O1, F3-O1, Cz-O1, C3-T4L in beta band; FP1-T6, FP1-O2, F7-T4L, F8-Cz in gamma band). Conclusions Our study suggests that alpha band activity may be the main neural oscillation of SA, which suggests that the neural network within the anterior frontal area may be important in the generation of SA.

Previous studies have demonstrated that thalamus originated spindle waves are regulated by cortically generated slow oscillations through cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic connections. To investigate the changes of coupling between slow oscillations and higher rhythms during different NREM sleep stages, we analyzed scalp EEG data measured from two bipolar electrodes (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) in 15 healthy adults, with accompanying expert annotations of sleep stages. A normalized modulation index (MI) of statistical significance was used to measure the phase-amplitude interaction between phase of slow oscillations (0.1-1.5 Hz) and amplitude of spindle waves (12-16 Hz). It is found that the normalized MI increased from NREM1 to NREM4 for both anterior and posterior channels, and statistically significant coupling occurs in slow wave sleep (p<0.05). Further, the coupling strength is correlated with the power of slow oscillations [Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.79 (Fpz-Cz) and 0.61 (Pz-Oz)], which might contribute to the dominant role of slow oscillations in the neuronal modulation mechanism.

However, thus far, only low-level sensory stimuli have been used as targets. The current human electroencephalography (EEG) study examined the influence of neural oscillatory phase on a lexical-decision task performed for stimuli embedded in noise. Neural phase angles were compared for correct versus incorrect lexical decisions using a phase bifurcation index (BI), which quantifies differences in mean phase angles and phase concentrations between correct and incorrect trials. Neural phase angles in the alpha frequency range (8 - 12 Hz) over right anterior sensors were approximately antiphase in a prestimulus time window, and thus successfully distinguished between correct and incorrect lexical decisions. Moreover, alpha-band oscillations were again approximately antiphase across participants for correct versus incorrect trials during a later peristimulus time window (similar to 500 ms) at left-central electrodes. Strikingly, lexical decision accuracy was not predicted by either event-related potentials (ERPs) or oscillatory power measures. We suggest that correct lexical decisions depend both on successful sensory processing, which is made possible by the alignment of stimulus onset with an optimal alpha phase, as well as integration and weighting of decisional information, which is coupled to alpha phase immediately following the critical manipulation that differentiated words from pseudowords. The current study constitutes a first step toward characterizing the role of dynamic oscillatory brain states for higher cognitive functions, such as spoken word recognition.

We focus on identifying brain state transitions between intentions, and classifying a user's implicit intentions while viewing an image on a web page, based on an EEG experiment. We measure brain state changes between a navigational intention and an informational intention by using phase synchrony; i.e., the phase locking value (PLV) in an EEG. Comparing: PLVs that correspond to the two intention states is useful for determining a human's implicit intention. In order to discriminate between a user's implicit intentions using a PLV, we must extract features based On an EEG analysis. For this purpose, we identify the most reactive band within the full band of brain signals. Theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta-1 (14-22 Hz), and beta-2 (23-30 Hz) bands are used to extract the EEG features from the most reactive EEG band. Subsequently, we select the most significant pairs (MSPs) that are highly reactive and correspond to the intention. According to the proposed method, these features are useful for: (i) showing the brain state transitions regarding intentions, and (ii) classifying a human's implicit intention using several classifiers such as a support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes. We then compare the results of these classifiers. This study demonstrates the potential uses of these identified brain electrode pairs for cognitive detection and task classification in future brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this improvement are unknown. We investigated the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of Ro 10-5824 in common marmosets. The effects of Ro 10-5824 on cognitive function were evaluated using the ORD task. The neurophysiological effects of Ro 10-5824 were investigated by quantitative electroencephalography, especially on baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex. The effects of Ro 10-5824 on spontaneous locomotion were also assessed. Systemic administration of Ro 10-5824 at 3 mg/kg significantly increased the success rate in the ORD task. At doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, Ro 10-5824 increased baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex. Ro 10-5824 had no effect on spontaneous locomotion. Activation of D4R by Ro 10-5824 improves the success rate in the ORD task and increases baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex without affecting locomotion in common marmosets. These findings highlight the role of D4R in gamma oscillations of non-human primates. As gamma oscillations are thought to be involved in attention and behavioral inhibition, our results suggest D4R agonists may improve these cognitive functions by modulating baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have close relations with human vigilance level and thus are widely used in relevant research. In this paper, a novel approach for real-time drowsiness detection based on EEG signals is proposed. In comparison with previously proposed methods based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) or continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the proposed one makes use of the advantage of Hilber-Huang transform (HHT) in processing nonlinear and non-stationary signals, especially biological signals like EEG, to achieve more reliable time-frequency analysis results. The experiment shows that the HHT-based method actually renders more precise drowsiness detection results than the other two. Also, the proposed method uses single-channel EEG signals instead of multi-channel ones entailing cumbersome sensor systems. Such a characteristic facilitates the development of wearable drowsiness detection devices for daily use.

IMPACT OF ANESTHETIC REGIMEN ON THE RESPIRATORY PATTERN, EEG MICROSTRUCTURE AND SLEEP IN THE RAT MODEL OF CHOLINERGIC PARKINSON'S DISEASE NEUROPATHOLOGY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ketamine/diazepam; pentobarbital; electroencephalography; respiratory pattern; sleep; pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus	PEDUNCULOPONTINE TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; HIGUCHI FRACTAL DIMENSION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REM-SLEEP; NORADRENALINE RELEASE; TRANSITIONS STRUCTURE; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; LOCUS COERULEUS; KETAMINE	Objectives: We hypothesized that the impact of distinct anesthetic regimens could be differently expressed during anesthesia and on post-anesthesia sleep in the neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we followed the impact of ketamine/diazepam and pentobarbital anesthesia in a rat model of the severe Parkinson's disease cholinergic neuropathology on the electroencephalographic (EEG) microstructure and respiratory pattern during anesthesia, and on the post-anesthesia sleep. Methods: We performed the experiments on adult, male, spontaneously breathing Wistar rats chronically instrumented for sleep recording. The bilateral pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) lesion was done by ibotenic acid microinfusion. Following postoperative recovery, we recorded sleep for 6 h, induced anesthesia 24 h later using ketamine/diazepam or pentobarbital, and repeated sleep recordings sessions 48 h and 6 days later. During 20 min of each anesthesia we recorded both the EEG and respiratory movements. For sleep and EEG analysis, Fourier analysis was applied on 6-h recordings, and each 10-s epoch was differentiated as a state of wakefulness (Wake), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM). Additionally, the group probability density distributions of all EEG frequency band relative amplitudes were calculated for each state, with particular attention during anesthesia. For respiratory pattern analysis we used Monotone Signal Segments Analysis. The PPT lesion was identified through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase histochemistry. Results and conclusions: Our data show that the ketamine/diazepam anesthetic regimen in the PPT-lesioned rats induces more alterations in the EEG microstructure and respiratory pattern than does the pentobarbital anesthesia. In addition, the equal time required to establish an anesthetized state, and the long-term effect on postanesthesia sleep in the PPT-lesioned vs. control rats suggest this anesthetic regimen as potentially more beneficial both for anesthesia induction and for post-anesthesia sleep in the surgical procedures of the elderly, and Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's patients.

The aim of the present study was to investigate resting-state EEG-SFC in 77 stable, medicated patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) compared to 78 healthy volunteers (HV). In order to study the effect of illness duration, SCZ were divided in those with a short duration of disease (SDD; n = 25) and those with a long duration of disease (LDD; n = 52). Resting-state EEG recordings in eyes closed condition were analyzed and lagged phase synchronization (LPS) indices were calculated for each ROI pair in the source-space EEG data. In delta and theta bands, SCZ had greater EEG-SFC than HV; a higher theta band connectivity in frontal regions was observed in LDD compared with SDD. In the alpha band, SCZ showed lower frontal EEG-SFC compared with HV whereas no differences were found between LDD and SDD. In the betal band, SCZ had greater EEG-SFC compared with HVs and in the beta2 band, LDD presented lower frontal and parieto-temporal EEG-SFC compared with HV. In the gamma band, SDD had greater connectivity values compared with LDD and HV. This study suggests that resting state brain network connectivity is abnormally organized in schizophrenia, with different patterns for the different EEG frequency components and that EEG can be a powerful tool to further elucidate the complexity of such disordered connectivity.

Methods: 17 normoacousic chronic, unilateral high-pitched tinnitus sufferers (6 females, 43.6 +/- 9.8 y.o, disease duration 22 +/- 35 months) underwent a 29-channel resting-state electroencephalography (EEG - 5 min opened-eyes, 5 min closed-eyes) and auditory oddball paradigm for event-related potentials analyses (ERPs - N1, P2 and P300). Cortical 3D distribution of current source density was computed with sLORETA. Results were compared with 17 controls (9 females, 45.7 +/- 15.1 y.o). Results: Eyes opened, tinnitus sufferers had lower alpha and beta sources in the left inferior parietal lobule. Eyes closed, tinnitus sufferers had decreased alpha sources in the left inferior temporal and post-central gyri, and low gamma sources in the left middle temporal gyrus. EEG data did not correlate with tinnitus sufferers' clinical features. Subjects with tinnitus had shorter N1 and P2 latencies. P300 did not differ between groups. sLORETA solutions showed decreased sources of these ERPs in the left inferior temporal gyrus in the tinnitus group. Conclusions: We showed cortico-thalamo-cortical involvements in normoacousic tinnitus with hyperexcitability of the left auditory cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. Significance: This might reflect processes of maladaptive cortical plasticity and memory consolidation. Further validation is needed to establish the value of this tool in customizing therapeutic approach. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study tested the hypothesis that it reflects a modality and/or frequency specific mechanism. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (64 channels) were performed on 18 healthy subjects during visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain oddball paradigms. Low- and high-frequency a-rhythm were analyzed on individual basis, and their sources were estimated by low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). alpha-ERD, served as an index of cortical activation, was computed on the cortical voxel level and compared across the conditions (target vs. non-target), a sub-bands (lower vs. higher frequency), and modalities (visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain). The results showed that visual alpha-ERD was mainly generated from occipital cortex for both target and non-target conditions. Its magnitude was enhanced across widespread cortical regions (e.g., bilateral occipital, parietal, and frontal areas) in the target condition and was greater in high-frequency alpha-band. Finally, alpha-ERD difference between target and non-target conditions was not higher in visual than that in other control modalities. All these findings indicated that human high-frequency alpha-ERD reflects cognitive attention processes underlying reaction to oddball target stimuli regardless of stimulus modality.

Thus, coherent auditory perception depends on "hearing" back in time: retrospectively attending that which was lost externally but preserved in short-term memory (STM). Current theories of auditory attention assume that sound features are integrated into a perceptual object, that multiple objects can coexist in STM, and that attention can be deployed to an object in STM. Recording electroencephalography from humans, we tested these assumptions, elucidating feature-general and feature-specific neural correlates of auditory attention to STM. Alpha/beta oscillations and frontal and posterior event-related potentials indexed feature-general top-down attentional control to one of several coexisting auditory representations in STM. Particularly, task performance during attentional orienting was correlated with alpha/low-beta desynchronization (i.e., power suppression). However, attention to one feature could occur without simultaneous processing of the second feature of the representation. Therefore, auditory attention to memory relies on both feature-specific and feature-general neural dynamics.

The electrical activities of brain fluctuate frequently and can be analyzed using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Therefore, the EEG signals are commonly used signals for obtaining the information related to the pathological states of brain. The EEG recordings of an epileptic patient contain a large amount of EEG data which may require time-consuming manual interpretations. Thus, automatic EEG signal analysis using advanced signal processing techniques plays a significant role to recognize epilepsy in EEG recordings. In this work, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been applied for analysis of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. The EMD generates the set of amplitude and frequency modulated components known as intrinsic mode functions (IIVIEs). Two area measures have been computed, one for the graph obtained as the analytic signal representation of IIVIEs in complex plane and another for second-order difference plot (SODP) of IMFs of EEG signals. Both of these area measures have been computed for first four IMFs of the normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. These eight features obtained from both area measures of first four IMFs have been used as input feature set for classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals using least square support vector machine (LS-SVIVI) classifier. Among all three kernel functions namely, linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) used for classification, the RBF kernel has provided best classification accuracy in the classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. The proposed method based on the two area measures of IMFs obtained using EMD process, together with LS-SVM classifier has been studied on EEG dataset publicly available by the University of Bonn, Germany. Experimental results have been included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to other existing methods.

The spatial-spectral-temporal patterns in event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activities (i.e., power and phase) were measured at four selected channels, i.e., FCz, Pz, O1 and O2, from original EEG data after preprocessing, EEG data after additional current source density (CSD) transform, and back-projected EEG data from individual ICs after additional ICA analysis. Pair-wise correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI), calculated from three EEG data at four selected channels, were compared to examine mutual correlations in EEG signals obtained through three different means. Thereafter, EEG signatures of errors from these three means were statistically compared at multiple time windows in the contrast of error and correct responses. Significantly decreased CC and MI values were observed in CSD- and ICA-processed EEGs as compared with original EEG, with the smallest CC and MI in ICA EEG. Similar error patterns in ERPs and peri-response oscillatory activities were detected in all three EEGs, whereas the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus error-related oscillatory patterns identified in ICA EEG were either not or only partially detected in both original EEG and CSD EEGs in general. Both CSD and ICA processes can largely reduce signal correlations due to the volume conduction effect in original EEG, and EEG signatures of errors are better detected by ICA-based method than channel-based method (i.e., original and CSD EEGs). ICA provides the best sensitivity to detect EEG signatures linked to specific neural processes via disentangling superimposed channel-level EEG signals into distinct neurocognitive process-related component signals.

Modulation of cortical activity in 2D versus 3D virtual reality environments: An EEG study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Virtual reality; 2D versus 3D immersion; EEG theta power	THETA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	There is a growing empirical evidence that virtual reality (VR) is valuable for education, training, entertaining and medical rehabilitation due to its capacity to represent real-life events and situations. However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral confounds in VR environments are still poorly understood. In two experiments, we examined the effect of fully immersive 3D stereoscopic presentations and less immersive 2D VR environments on brain functions and behavioral outcomes. In Experiment 1 we examined behavioral and neural underpinnings of spatial navigation tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). In Experiment 2, we examined EEG correlates of postural stability and balance. Our major findings showed that fully immersive 3D VR induced a higher subjective sense of presence along with enhanced success rate of spatial navigation compared to 2D. In Experiment 1 power of frontal midline EEG (FM-theta) was significantly higher during the encoding phase of route presentation in the 3D VR. In Experiment 2, the 3D VR resulted in greater postural instability and modulation of EEG patterns as a function of 3D versus 2D environments. The findings support the inference that the fully immersive 3D enriched-environment requires allocation of more brain and sensory resources for cognitive/motor control during both tasks than 2D presentations. This is further evidence that 3D VR tasks using EEG may be a promising approach for performance enhancement and potential applications in clinical/rehabilitation settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In comparison with other neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography (EEG) provides high temporal resolution. Therefore, EEG is useful to analyze transient dynamics in neural activity, even in the range of milliseconds. In this study, EEG activity from 31 patients with SCH and 38 controls was analyzed using Shannon spectral entropy (SE) and median frequency (MF). The aim of the study was to quantify differences between distractor (i.e., novelty) and target (i.e., novelty and relevance) tones in an auditory oddball paradigm. Healthy controls displayed a larger SE decrease in response to target stimulus than in response to distractor tones. SE decrease was accompanied by a significant and widespread reduction of MF (i.e., a significant slowing of EEG activity). In comparison with controls, patients showed a significant reduction of changes in SE in response to both target and distractor tones. These differences were also observed in patients that only received a minimal treatment prior to EEG recording. Furthermore, significant changes in SE were inversely correlated to positive and total symptoms severity for SCH patients. Our findings support the notion that SCH is associated with a reduced response to both novelty and relevance during an auditory P300 task.

We prospectively and blindly assessed a serial cohort of chronic hepatitis C patients. A total of 168 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled from 1995 to 2007. IFN alpha was administered intramuscularly at 9 x 10(6) IU daily for the first 4 weeks and then three times a week for the next 20 weeks. Consecutive EEGs obtained before, 2 and 4 weeks after treatment initiation, and 2-3 days after treatment termination were assessed. EEG recordings were obtained from each patient in the resting awake condition with their eyes closed. The absolute power for each frequency band was determined using qEEG techniques. Diffuse slowing was observed during IFN alpha treatment and was reversible after completion of treatment. A tendency to this qEEG change was generally observed in all patients. The patient's age and severity of chronic hepatitis were factors that influenced qEEG changes during IFN alpha treatment. The change in the Mini-Mental State Examination score and IFN alpha-induced depression were also related to qEEG changes. Such diffuse EEG changes indicated mild encephalopathy associated with IFN alpha treatment. (C) 2015 S.

The ability to recreate these deficits in animal models is limited, hampering ongoing translational drug development efforts. This paper reviews the use of electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurophysiological measures, such as event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), as novel translational biomarkers for both etiological and treatment development research in neuropsychiatry. In schizophrenia, cognitive impairments manifest as deficits not only in high-level processes, such as working memory or executive processing, but also as deficits in neurophysiological responses to simple auditory and visual stimuli. Moreover, neurophysiological responses can be assessed even in untrained animals and are therefore particularly amenable to translational, cross-species investigation. To date, several sensory-level ERP measures, including auditory mismatch negativity and N1, and visual P1 and steady state responses, have been validated in both human clinical investigations and animal models. Deficits have been tied to impaired neurotransmission at N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Time-frequency analysis of ERSP permits further extension of these findings from physiological to circuit/cellular levels of analysis.

During cognitive activity, brain networks have to rapidly reorganize on a sub-second time scale. Tracking the dynamics of these networks over this short time duration is an unsolved issue. Here, we propose a new way to tackle this problem by using dense electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during a specific cognitive task: picture naming. We found that the cognitive task can be divided into six functional connectivity states (fcSs) characterized by significantly high synchronization of gamma (30-45 Hz) oscillations. We showed that dense-EEG can reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of whole-brain functional connectivity at high temporal (in the order of ms) and spatial (similar to 1000 regions of interest) resolution. Our results showed also that the brain cognitive functions are based on fast transitions between fcSs that last from 30 ms to 160 ms. Each identified network can be associated with one or several specific function (visual processing, lexical concept activation, selecting the target word from the mental lexicon, phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and initiation of articulation) of the whole cognitive process. Finally, we believe that the identification of the dynamics of cognitive brain networks is a very powerful tool to understand the brain information processing.

We obtained a sample of spike waves and nonspike waves for HHT decomposition by using numerous intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the Hilbert transform (HT) to determine the instantaneous, marginal, and Hilbert energy spectra. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the IMFs, and energy-IMF distributions for the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal without spike waves, Spike I, Spike II and Spike III sample waves were determined. The analysis results showed that the ratios of the referred wave and Spike III wave to the referred total energy for IMF1, IMF2, and the residual function exceeded 10 %. Furthermore, the energy ratios for IMF1, IMF2, IMF3 and the residual function of Spike I, Spike II to their total energy exceeded 10 %. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the IMF3 of the EEG signal without spike waves and Spike I wave, EEG signal without spike waves and Spike II wave, EEG signal without spike waves and Spike III wave, Spike I and II waves, Spike I and III waves, and Spike II and III waves were 0.002, 0.06, 0.01, 0.17, 0.03, and 0.3, respectively. The energy ratios of IMF3 in the delta band to its referred total energy for the EEG signal without spike waves, and of the Spike I, II, and III waves were 4.72, 6.75, 5.41, and 5.55 %, respectively. The weighted average frequency of the IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3 of the EEG signal without spike waves was lower than that of the IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3 of the spike waves, respectively. The weighted average magnitude of the IMF3, IMF4, and IMF5 of the EEG signal without spike waves was lower than that of the IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3 of spike waves, respectively.

However, it remains uncertain whether the EEG abnormalities are actually caused by SYN. Methods: To determine whether SYN can cause neural network abnormalities, we performed EEG recordings and analyzed the expression of neuronal activity-dependent gene products in SYN transgenic mice. We also carried out comparative analyses in humans with DLB. Results: We demonstrate that neuronal expression of SYN in transgenic mice causes a left shift in spectral power that closely resembles the EEG slowing observed in DLB patients. Surprisingly, SYN mice also had seizures and showed molecular hippocampal alterations indicative of aberrant network excitability, including calbindin depletion in the dentate gyrus. In postmortem brain tissues from DLB patients, we found reduced levels of calbindin mRNA in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, nearly one quarter of DLB patients showed myoclonus, a clinical sign of aberrant network excitability that was associated with an earlier age of onset of cognitive impairments. In SYN mice, partial suppression of epileptiform activity did not alter their shift in spectral power. Furthermore, epileptiform activity in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was not associated with a left shift in spectral power. Interpretation: We conclude that neuronal accumulation of SYN slows brain oscillations and, in parallel, causes aberrant network excitability that can escalate into seizure activity. The potential role of aberrant network excitability in DLB merits further investigation.

This study assessed reaction-time-sorted spectral perturbation and event-related spectral perturbation in order to examine the temporal dynamic patterns in the frontal midline (F), central parietal (CP), and occipital (O) regions during a chemistry working memory task at theta, alpha, and beta frequencies. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between F-CP, CP-O, and F-O were assessed by component event-related coherence (ERCoh) and component phase-locking (PL) at different frequency bands. In addition, this study examined whether the temporal dynamic patterns are consistent with the functional connectivity patterns across different frequencies and time courses. Component ERCoh/PL measured the interactions between different independent components decomposed from the scalp EEG, mixtures of time courses of activities arising from different brain, and artifactual sources. The results indicate that the O and CP regions' temporal dynamic patterns are similar to each other. Furthermore, pronounced component ERCoh/PL patterns were found to exist between the O and CP regions across each stimulus and probe presentation, in both theta and alpha frequencies. The consistent theta component ERCoh/PL between the F and O regions was found at the first stimulus and after probe presentation. These findings demonstrate that temporal dynamic patterns at different regions are in accordance with the functional connectivity patterns. Such coordinated and robust EEG temporal dynamics and component ERCoh/PL patterns suggest that these brain regions' neurons work together both to induce similar event-related spectral perturbation and to synchronize or desynchronize simultaneously in order to swiftly accomplish a particular goal. The possible mechanisms for such distinct component phase-locking and coherence patterns were also further discussed.

Spindles in Svarog: framework and software for parametrization of EEG transients	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep spindles; matching pursuit; EEG transients; time-frequency; sleep; Svarog; open source; free software	TIME-FREQUENCY DICTIONARIES; MATCHING PURSUIT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; SLEEP	We present a complete framework for time-frequency parametrization of EEG transients, based upon matching pursuit (MP) decomposition, applied to the detection of sleep spindles. Ranges of spindles duration (>0.5 s) and frequency (11-16 Hz) are taken directly from their standard definitions. Minimal amplitude is computed from the distribution of the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the signal within the frequency band of sleep spindles. Detection algorithm depends on the choice of just one free parameter, which is a percentile of this distribution. Performance of detection is assessed on the first cohort/second subset of the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS-C1/552). Cross-validation performed on the 19 available overnight recordings returned the optimal percentile of the RMS distribution close to 97 in most cases, and the following overall performance measures: sensitivity 0.63 +/- 0.06, positive predictive value 0.47 +/- 0.08, and Matthews coefficient of correlation 0.51 +/- 0.04. These concordances are similar to the results achieved on this database by other automatic methods. Proposed detailed parametrization of sleep spindles within a universal framework, encompassing also other EEG transients, opens new possibilities of high resolution investigation of their relations and detailed characteristics. MP decomposition, selection of relevant structures, and simple creation of EEG profiles used previously for assessment of brain activity of patients in disorders of consciousness are implemented in a freely available software package Svarog (Signal Viewer, Analyzer and Recorder On GPL) with user-friendly, mouse-driven interface for review and analysis of EEG.

This paper describes the design and validation of a classifier of upper-limb analytical movements based on electroencephalographic activity extracted from intervals preceding self-initiated movement tasks. Features selected for the classification are subject specific and associated with the movement tasks. Further tests are performed to reject the hypothesis that other information different from the task-related cortical activity is being used by the classifiers. Six healthy subjects were measured performing self-initiated upper-limb analytical movements. A Bayesian classifier was used to classify among seven different kinds of movements. Features considered covered the alpha and beta bands. A genetic algorithm was used to optimally select a subset of features for the classification. An average accuracy of 62.9 +/- 7.5 % was reached, which was above the baseline level observed with the proposed methodology (30.2 +/- 4.3 %). The study shows how the electroencephalography carries information about the type of analytical movement performed with the upper limb and how it can be decoded before the movement begins. In neurorehabilitation environments, this information could be used for monitoring and assisting purposes.	[Ibanez, Jaime; Pons, J.

The motivational priming hypothesis states that negative emotions could increase pain via activation of the aversive system, thus leading to an affective modulation of defensive reflexes. Nevertheless, little is known about peripheral and central correlates of affective reflex modulation in fibromyalgia. Methods Thirty patients with fibromyalgia and 30 healthy individuals were asked to view three video clips from a self-perspective to induce specific mood states. Video clips consisted of the same virtual walk through different locations of a park under three affective environments (unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral). Startle eyeblink reflex and heart rate response elicited by abrupt startle noises, as well as heart rate variability and electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations were recorded when participants were passively viewing the virtual environments. Results Patients with fibromyalgia rated all environments as more negative and arousing than did healthy controls (p values < .05). Nevertheless, startle eyeblink reflex and heart rate response were lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls when viewing all three environments (p values < .05). Patients with fibromyalgia also displayed lower heart rate variability, as well as higher EEG power (2-22 Hz) during all environments than did healthy controls (p values < .05). Conclusions Patients with fibromyalgia were characterized by relevant deficits in affective modulation of startle and cardiac responses, heart rate variability, and EEG power spectra in response to sustained induction of affective states. These findings suggest an alteration of emotional and attentional aspects of information processing at subjective, autonomic, and central nervous system levels.

Although a variety of approaches have been proposed, we will mainly focus on cognitive training interventions, in which learners repeatedly perform cognitive tasks to improve their cognitive abilities. In this review article, we propose that the learning process during the cognitive training can be facilitated by an assistive system monitoring cognitive workloads using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, and the brain connectome approach can provide additional valuable biomarkers for facilitating leaners learning processes. For the purpose, we will introduce studies on the cognitive training interventions, EEG biomarkers for cognitive workload, and human brain connectome. As cognitive overload and mental fatigue would reduce or even eliminate gains of cognitive training interventions, a real-time monitoring of cognitive workload can facilitate the learning process by flexibly adjusting difficulty levels of the training task. Moreover, cognitive training interventions should have effects on brain sub networks, not on a single brain region, and graph theoretical network metrics quantifying topological architecture of the brain network can differentiate with respect to individual cognitive states as well as to different individuals' cognitive abilities, suggesting that the connectome is a valuable approach for tracking the learning progress. Although only a few studies have exploited the connectome approach for studying alterations of the brain network induced by cognitive training interventions so far, we believe that it would be a useful technique for capturing improvements of cognitive functions.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE POLYMORPHISM AND RESTING-STATE EEG ACTIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						resting EEG; spectral power; sLORETA; 5-HTTL-PR polymorphism; gender	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; QUANTITATIVE EEG; RECEPTOR-BINDING; 1A RECEPTOR; SEX; RELIABILITY; DEPRESSION	Human brain oscillations represent important features of information processing and are highly heritable. Gender has been observed to affect association between the 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region) polymorphism and various endophenotypes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 5-HTTLPR on the spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) activity in healthy male and female subjects. DNA samples extracted from buccal swabs and resting EEG recorded at 60 standard leads were collected from 210 (101 men and 109 women) volunteers. Spectral EEG power estimates and cortical sources of EEG activity were investigated. It was shown that effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on electrical activity of the brain vary as a function of gender. Women with the S/L genotype had greater global EEG power compared to men with the same genotype. In men, current source density was markedly different among genotype groups in only alpha 2 and alpha 3 frequency ranges: S/S allele carriers had higher current source density estimates in the left inferior parietal lobule in comparison with the L/L group. In women, genotype difference in global power asymmetry was found in the central-temporal region. Contrasting L/L and S/L genotype carriers also yielded significant effects in the right hemisphere inferior parietal lobule and the right postcentral gyrus with L/L genotype carriers showing lower current source density estimates than S/L genotype carriers in all but gamma bands. So, in women, the effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were associated with modulation of the EEG activity in a wide range of EEG frequencies. The significance of the results lies in the demonstration of gene by sex interaction with resting EEG that has implications for understanding sex-related differences in affective states, emotion and cognition.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, neural oscillations above 20 Hz and induced acute psychosis	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						THC; EEG; Beta; Gamma; Psychosis; Cannabis	GAMMA-BAND; CANNABIS USE; HIGH-FREQUENCY; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RISK; STATE; CORTEX; COMMUNICATION	An acute challenge with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can induce psychotic symptoms including delusions. High electroencephalography (EEG) frequencies, above 20 Hz, have previously been implicated in psychosis and schizophrenia. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous THC compared to placebo on high-frequency EEG. A double-blind cross-over study design was used. In the resting state, the high-beta to low-gamma magnitude (21-45 Hz) was investigated (n = 13 pairs + 4 THC only). Also, the event-related synchronisation (ERS) of motor-associated high gamma was studied using a self-paced button press task (n = 15). In the resting state, there was a significant condition x frequency interaction (p = 0.00017), consisting of a shift towards higher frequencies under THC conditions (reduced high beta [21-27 Hz] and increased low gamma [27-45 Hz]). There was also a condition x frequency x location interaction (p = 0.006), such that the reduction in 21-27-Hz magnitude tended to be more prominent in anterior regions, whilst posterior areas tended to show greater 27-45-Hz increases. This effect was correlated with positive symptoms, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (r = 0.429, p = 0.042). In the motor task, there was a main effect of THC to increase 65-130-Hz ERS (p = 0.035) over contra-lateral sensorimotor areas, which was driven by increased magnitude in the higher, 85-130-Hz band (p = 0.02) and not the 65-85-Hz band. The THC-induced shift to faster gamma oscillations may represent an over-activation of the cortex, possibly related to saliency misattribution in the delusional state.

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a possibility to objectively quantify the brain's activity before and after the administration of opioids. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) properties of the buprenorphine transdermal patch on resting EEG and pain tolerance. METHOD: Twenty-two healthy male subjects (mean age 23.1 3.8 years) were studied. They received a 144-hour buprenorphine (20 g/h) or placebo transdermal patch in this experimental, randomized, crossover, double-blind study. Skin heat pain tolerance was measured on the arm before the recordings of resting EEG. From the EEG, the ratio of slow and fast oscillations was calculated for further analysis. A population PKPD model with a stochastic differential equation for drug absorption from the patch was used to analyze the PK and PD data simultaneously by use of the statistical analysis package NONMEM. RESULTS: Buprenorphine increased EEG ratio (P = 0.0006) and skin pain tolerance (P = 0.0008) compared with placebo. The stochastic model adequately characterized the concentration-time and effect-time courses for both the skin heat stimulation and the resting EEG outcomes with variations in the drug's absorption rate during the 144-hour treatment period. As measured by the potency parameter, the EEG effect was 10 +/- 3 (median +/- SE) times more sensitive to buprenorphine than the skin pain test. CONCLUSIONS: Using a stochastic PKPD analysis, the effect of a 144-hour buprenorphine patch application on resting EEG and skin pain tolerance was quantified successfully. Both end points were affected by buprenorphine, although the resting EEG was more sensitive to buprenorphine. The stochastic PKPD analysis allowed the computation of a time-dependent variability in drug absorption from patch to blood. The data suggest that the resting EEG is an attractive and objective alternative for assessing opioid effect.

The corticomuscular matching between brain (EEG) and muscles (EMG) activity allows the assessment of the intentionality of the performed movement. Basing on this knowledge, a real-time algorithm for falling risk prediction based on EMG/EEG coupled analysis is presented. The system architecture involves 8 EMG (limbs) and 8 EEG (motor-cortex) channels wirelessly collected by a FPGA (gateway) that contextually performs the real-time processing based on an event triggered time-frequency approach. The digital architecture is validated on the FPGA to determine resources utilization, related timing constraints and performance figures of a dedicated real-time ASIC implementation for wearable applications. The system resource utilization is 85.95% ALMs, 43283 ALUTs, 73.0% registers, 9.9% block memory of an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. The processing latency is lower than 1ms and the output are available in 56ms, respecting the time limit of 300ms. Outputs enables decision-taking for feedback delivering.	[Annese, V.

We tried to further determine interactions between cardiac and electrical brain activity by means of EEG. We investigated how the heartbeat modulates EEG in 23 healthy controls from wakefulness to deep sleep and showed that frontocentral heartbeat evoked EEG amplitude and phase locking (as measured by intertrial phase locking), at about 300-400 ms after the R peak, decreased with increasing sleep depth with a renewed increase during REM sleep, which underpins the assumption that the heartbeat evoked positivity constitutes an active frontocortical response to the heartbeat. Additionally, we found that individual heart rate was correlated with the frequency of the EEG's spectral peak (i.e., alpha peak frequency during wakefulness). This correlation was strongest during wakefulness and declined linearly with increasing sleep depth. Furthermore, we show that the QRS complex modulates spindle phase possibly related to the correspondence between the frequency of the QRS complex and the spindle frequency of about 12-15 Hz. Finally, during deep sleep stages, a loose temporal coupling between heartbeats and slow oscillation (0.8 Hz) could be observed. These findings indicate that cardiac activity such as heart rate or individual heartbeats can modulate or be modulated by ongoing oscillatory brain activity.

Parkinson bradykinesia correlates with EEG background frequency and perceptual forward projection	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Timing; Motor velocity; EEG; Bradykinesia	BASAL GANGLIA; IMPAIRMENT; MOVEMENT; DISEASE; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; DOPAMINE; POSITION; MOTION	Background: To deal with processing-time in the nervous system, visuomotor control requires anticipation. An index for such anticipation is provided by the 'flash-lag illusion' in which moving objects are perceived ahead of static objects while actually being in the same place. We investigated the neurophysiological relation between visuomotor anticipation and motor velocity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. Methods: Motor velocity was assessed by the number of keystrokes in 30s ('kinesia score') and visuomotor anticipation in a behavioural flash-lag paradigm while electroencephalography data was obtained. PD patients (n = 24) were divided in a 'PDslow' and a 'PDfast' group based on kinesia score. Results: The PDslow group had a lower kinesia score than controls (resp. 40.3 +/- 1.7 and 64.9 +/- 4.6, p < 0.001). The flash-lag illusion was weaker in the PDslow group than in controls (resp. fractions 0.32 +/- 0.04 and 0.50 +/- 0.09 of the responses indicating perceived lagging, p = 0.03). Furthermore, the magnitude of the flash-lag illusion correlated with the kinesia score (cc = 0.45, p = 0.02). Finally, electroencephalography background frequency was lower in the PDslow group than in controls (resp 8.24 +/- 0.24 and 9.1 +/- 032 Hz, p = 0.01) and background frequency correlated with the kinesia score (cc = 0.58, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The decreased flash-lag illusion and lower electroencephalography background frequency in more bradykinetic PD patients provides support for disturbed visuomotor anticipations, putatively caused by reduced, sub-cortically mediated, network efficiency. This suggests a link between anticipation in early-stage visual motion processing and motor preparation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Beudel, M.; Roosma, E.; Manzanera, O. E.

This allows one to: (i) eventually recover non-desired resulting (robotic) actions, while in the same time, (ii) improve the classifier/controller parameters in order to interpret more precisely the brain signals for the next actions. Instead of using EEG error potential identification (ErrP), we instruct the users to explicit misclassifications using one of the two following extra-brain activities: briefly clenching teeth or closing the eyes. The experiments conducted on three healthy subjects, show that these two extra-brain activities are detectable by EEG time-frequency analysis and in less than one second if the user is focused. Indeed, associated potentials are clearly distinguished after they are made following a bad classification result is revealed to the user. Our analysis and results are based on a brain machine interface (BMI) using the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials technique (SSVEP).

However, how these regions interact remains unclear. We recorded cortical electrical activity from 7 epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes for presurgical evaluation while they listened to positively and negatively valenced musical chords. Time-frequency analysis suggested a specific role of the orbitofrontal cortex in the processing of positively valenced stimuli while, most importantly, Granger causality analysis revealed that the amygdala tends to drive both the orbitofrontal cortex and the auditory cortex in theta and alpha frequency bands, during the processing of valenced stimuli. Results from the current study show the amygdala to be a critical hub in the emotion processing network: specifically one that influences not only the higher order areas involved in the evaluation of a stimulus's emotional value but also the sensory cortical areas involved in the processing of its low-level acoustic features.

Comparison of Bispectral Index and Entropy values with electroencephalogram during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthetics inhalation, sevoflurane; EEG; electromyography; monitoring, intraoperative	SPECTRAL ENTROPY; CEREBRAL STATE; TIME-DELAY; INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS; NARCOTREND INDEXES; HYPNOTIC COMPONENT; CONSCIOUSNESS; POPULATION; PREVENTION; RESPONSES	Background: Concomitantly recorded Bispectral Index (R) (BIS) and Entropy (TM) values sometimes show discordant trends during general anaesthesia. Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods: In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed >= 10-unit disagreement for >= 60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain. Results: A >= 10-unit disagreement >= 60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE). Conclusions: Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.	[Aho, A.

Monitoring and correcting the insurgence of abnormal dynamic balance opens new scenarios in the cure of these diseases and fall prevention. In this work, we present a study based on EEG time-frequency analysis to identify the correlation between synchronized EEG and EMG signals for gait analysis. Several tools for gait analysis are developed and experimented i.e. EMG trigger generation with dynamic threshold, EMG co-contraction, EEG movement related potentials (MRPs) and EEG event related desynchronizations (ERDs). This work particularly focus on gait analysis indexes implementation and experimentally obtained results based on a large dataset, including different type of gait i.e. normal gait, perturbed gait and gait during a second cognitive task (DT). A weighted average on the calculated indexes are exploited to quantify the falling risk.

A Modified S-Transform for EEG Signals Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS			English	Article						S-Transform; modified Gaussian window; nonstationary signals; time-frequency resolution; sleep scoring; electroencephalogram (EEG); time-frequency distribution (TFD)	INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY	Due to the advantages offered by the S-transform (ST) distribution, it has been recently successfully implemented for various applications such as seismic and image processing. The desirable properties of the ST include a globally referenced phase as the case with the short time Fourier transform (STFT) while offering a higher spectral resolution as the wavelet transform (WT). However, this estimator suffers from some inherent disadvantages seen as poor energy concentration with higher frequencies. In order to improve the performance of the distribution, a modification to the existing technique is proposed. Additional parameters are proposed to control the window's width which can greatly enhance the signal representation in the time-frequency plane. The new estimator's performance is evaluated using synthetic signals as well as biomedical data. The required features of the ST which include invertability and phase information are still preserved.

The objective of this study was to identify EEG source signals and their associated action-related visual and auditory responses, especially independent components of EEG. Methods: A hand-moving-Hanoi video paradigm was used to study neural correlates of the action-related visual and auditory information processing determined by mu rhythm (8-12 Hz) in 16 healthy young subjects. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify separate EEG sources, and further computed in the frequency domain by applying-Fourier transform ICA (F-ICA). Results: F-ICA found more sensory stimuli-related independent components located within the sensorimotor region than ICA did. The total number of independent components of interest from F-ICA was 768, twice that of 384 from traditional time-domain ICA (p < 0.05). In the sensory-motor region C3 or C4, the total source signals intensity distribution values from all 14 subjects was 23.00 (Mean 1.64 +/- 1.17) from F-ICA; which was more than the 10.5 (Mean 0.75 +/- 0.62) from traditional time-domain ICA (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the intensity distribution of source signals in the C3 or C4 region was statistically significant between the ICA and F-ICA groups (strong 50 vs. 92%; weak 50 vs. 8% retrospectively; p < 0.05). In the Pz region, the total source signal intensity distribution from F-ICA was 12.50 (Mean 0.89 +/- 0.53); although exceeding that of traditional time-domain ICA 8.20 (Mean 0.59 +/- 0.48), the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that mu rhythm was sensitive to detection of the cognitive expression, which could be reflected by the function in the parietal lobe sensory-motor region. The results of this study could potentially be applied into early diagnosis for those with visual and hearing impairments in the near future.

The interplay of the slow and fast oscillations might dynamically coordinate the mnemonic cortical circuits to rehearse stored items during working memory retention. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI during a working memory task involving a natural scene to verify whether the cortical networks emerge with the neural oscillations for memory of the natural scene. The slow EEG power was enhanced in association with the better accuracy of working memory retention, and accompanied cortical activities in the mnemonic circuits for the natural scene. Fast oscillation showed a phase-amplitude coupling to the slow oscillation, and its power was tightly coupled with the cortical activities for representing the visual images of natural scenes. The mnemonic cortical circuit with the slow neural oscillations would rehearse the distributed natural scene representations with the fast oscillation for working memory retention. The coincidence of the natural scene representations could be obtained by the slow oscillation phase to create a coherent whole of the natural scene in the working memory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study directly compared the statistical effects of four commonly-used (nose, linked mastoids, average) or recommended (reference electrode standardization technique [REST]) references and their spherical spline current source density (CSD) transformation for a large data set stemming from a well-understood experimental manipulation. ERPs (72 sites) recorded from 130 individuals during a visual half-field paradigm with highly-controlled emotional stimuli were characterized by mid-parietooccipital N1 (125 ms peak latency) and event-related synchronization (ERS) of theta/delta (160 ms), which were most robust over the contralateral hemisphere. All five data transformations were rescaled to the same covariance and submitted to a single temporal or time-frequency PCA (Varimax) to yield simplified estimates of N1 or theta/delta ERS. Unbiased nonparametric permutation tests revealed that these hemifield-dependent asymmetries were by far most focal and prominent for CSD data, despite all transformations showing maximum effects at mid-parietooccipital sites. Employing smaller subsamples (signal-to-noise) or window-based ERP/ERS amplitudes did not affect these comparisons. Furthermore, correlations between N1 and theta/delta ERS at these sites were strongest for CSD and weakest for nose-referenced data. Contrary to the common notion that the spatial high pass filter properties of a surface Laplacian reduce important contributions of neuronal generators to the EEG signal, the present findings demonstrate that instead volume conduction inherent in surface potentials weakens the representation of neuronal activation patterns at scalp that directly reflect regional brain activity.

Decoding covert shifts of attention induced by ambiguous visuospatial cues	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visuospatial attention; cues; decoding; electroencephalography; brain-computer interface; spatial filtering	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EEG; SELECTION; BRAIN; BIAS; BCI; MEG	Simple and unambiguous visual cues (e.g., an arrow) can be used to trigger covert shifts of visual attention away from the center of gaze. The processing of visual stimuli is enhanced at the attended location. Covert shifts of attention modulate the power of cerebral oscillations in the alpha band over parietal and occipital regions. These modulations are sufficiently robust to be decoded on a single trial basis from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It is often assumed that covert attention shifts are under voluntary control, and that they also occur in more natural and complex environments, but there is no direct evidence to support this assumption. We address this important issue by using random-dot stimuli to cue one of two opposite locations, where a visual target is presented. We contrast two conditions, one in which the random-dot motion is predictive of the target location, and the other, in which it provides ambiguous information. Behavioral results show attention shifts in anticipation of the visual target, in both conditions. In addition, using the common spatial patterns (CSPs) algorithm, we extract EEG power features in the alpha-band (around 10 Hz) that best discriminate the attended location in single trials. We obtain a significant decoding accuracy in 7/10 subjects using a cross-validation procedure applied in the predictive condition. Interestingly, similar accuracy (significant in 5/10 subjects) is obtained when the CSPs trained in the predictive condition are tested in the ambiguous condition. In agreement with this result, we find that the CSPs show very similar topographies in both conditions. These results shed a new light on the behavioral and EEG correlates of visuospatial attention in complex visual environments. This study demonstrates that alpha-power features could be used in brain computer interfaces to decode covert attention shifts in an environment containing ambiguous spatial information.

Background: Empathic processes are associated with dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction areas. Prediction of others' preference involves emphatic processes. So functional connectivity between prefrontal and right temporoparietal areas would be associated with the others' preference prediction ability. Methods: Twenty participants (female, average age: 21.86) participated in our others' preference prediction task using the rapid evaluation of face images. During this experiment, participants' electroencephalogram was measured. We analyzed spectral band power as well as phase relations between EEG channels. Results: The success and failure trials of the preference prediction task showed differences in phase resetting latency patterns of alpha oscillations between frontal and right posterior regions. To check whether these phase resetting patterns indicated the likelihood of success or failure trials, we changed participants' response whenever specific phase resetting patterns occurred. This resulted in 1.41% pt increase in accuracy when we used an indicator from four pairs (FP2-T4, T4-P4, P4-FP2 and F4-T5) or 16.52% pt decrease in accuracy when we used it from two pairs (Fz-O2 and C3-T6). Conclusion: EEG phase resetting latencies between frontal and right parietal areas could indicate the likelihood of success or failure in a given trial of the others' preference prediction task	[Park, Jonghyeok; Yang, Taeyang; Kim, Sung-Phil] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Human & Syst Engn, Ulsan, South Korea; [Kim, Hakjin] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul, South Korea		Kim, SP (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Human & Syst Engn, Ulsan, South Korea.	jhpark0409@unist.ac.kr; tyyang@unist.ac.kr; hackjinkim@korea.ac.kr; spkim@unist.ac.kr							12	0	0	1	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2093-7121		978-8-9932-1509-0	INT C CONTR AUTOMAT			2015							1790	1794						5	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering	BF5MU					2022-08-02	WOS:000382295200372

The method could potentially enable robust recording of EEG in natural environments. The objective of this study was to substantiate the ear-EEG method by using a larger population of subjects and several paradigms. For rigor, we considered simultaneous scalp and ear-EEG recordings with common reference. More precisely, 32 conventional scalp electrodes and 12 ear electrodes allowed a thorough comparison between conventional and ear electrodes, testing several different placements of references. The paradigms probed auditory onset response, mismatch negativity, auditory steady-state response and alpha power attenuation. By comparing event related potential (ERP) waveforms from the mismatch response paradigm, the signal measured from the ear electrodes was found to reflect the same cortical activity as that from nearby scalp electrodes. It was also found that referencing the ear-EEG electrodes to another within ear electrode affects the time domain recorded waveform (relative to scalp recordings), but not the timing of individual components. It was furthermore found that auditory steady-state responses and alpha-band modulation were measured reliably with the ear-EEG modality. Finally, our findings showed that the auditory mismatch response was difficult to monitor with the ear-EEG. We conclude that ear-EEG yields similar performance as conventional EEG for spectrogram-based analysis, similar timing of ERP components, and equal signal strength for sources close to the ear. Ear-FEG can reliably measure activity from regions of the cortex which are located close to the ears, especially in paradigms employing frequency domain analyses.

To demonstrate their causal role on behavior, entrainment approaches in particular aim at driving endogenous oscillations via rhythmic stimulation. Within this context, transcranial electrical stimulation, especially transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has received renewed attention. This is likely due to the possibility of defining oscillatory stimulation properties precisely. Also, measurements comparing pre-tACS with post-tACS electroencephalography (EEG) have shown impressive modulations. However, the period during tACS has remained a blackbox until now, due to the enormous stimulation artifact. By means of application of beamforming to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we successfully recovered modulations of the amplitude of brain oscillations during weak and strong tACS. Additionally, we demonstrate that also evoked responses to visual and auditory stimuli can be recovered during tACS. The main contribution of the present study is to provide critical evidence that during ongoing tACS, subtle modulations of oscillatory brain activity can be reconstructed even at the stimulation frequency. Future tACS experiments will be able to deliver direct physiological insights in order to further the understanding of the contribution of brain oscillations to cognition and behavior.

It is unclear, however, whether these abnormalities are related to severity of illness or are a marker for risk. This study investigated total and evoked theta and delta activity in schizophrenia patients, unaffected siblings, and healthy controls (HCs). EEG data were recorded whilst 24 individuals with schizophrenia, 26 unaffected siblings of individuals with schizophrenia and 26 healthy control participants completed a Go/No-Go task. Event-related total activity and evoked theta and delta activity were calculated for correct hits (CH), failed inhibitions (FI) and correct inhibitions (CI) trials. Patients displayed significantly less total delta, evoked delta, total theta and evoked theta activity when compared with healthy controls. Unaffected siblings displayed abnormalities of evoked delta, but other measures were similar to those in control participants. The findings of this study add to evidence that abnormal low-frequency EEG oscillations contribute to impairments in information processing seen in schizophrenia. These findings also suggest abnormal evoked delta oscillations are associated with an increased familial risk of developing the disorder. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ongoing pain in chronic pain states, on the other hand, is a pathological condition that causes widespread suffering and whose treatment remains unsatisfactory. The brain mechanisms of ongoing pain are largely unknown. In this study, we applied tonic painful heat stimuli of varying degree to healthy human subjects, obtained continuous pain ratings, and recorded electroencephalograms to relate ongoing pain to brain activity. Our results reveal that the subjective perception of tonic pain is selectively encoded by gamma oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex. We further observed that the encoding of subjective pain intensity experienced by the participants differs fundamentally from that of objective stimulus intensity and from that of brief pain stimuli. These observations point to a role for gamma oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex in ongoing, tonic pain and thereby extend current concepts of the brain mechanisms of pain to the clinically relevant state of ongoing pain. Furthermore, our approach might help to identify a brain marker of ongoing pain, which may prove useful for the diagnosis and therapy of chronic pain.

Methods: Sixty-nine consecutive cases referring to our hospital within the previous 1 year, who were evaluated as bipolar disorder manic episode according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) at the first episode and had the informed consent form signed by first degree relatives, were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included having previous depressive episode, using drugs which could influence electroencephalographic activity before electroencephalography (EEG), and having previous neurological disease, particularly epilepsy, head trauma, and/or loss of consciousness. EEG records were obtained using a digital device in 16 channels; 23 surface electrodes were placed according to the International 10-20 system. Spectral power density (db mu V/Hz) of EEG signal provided information on the power carried out by EEG waves in defined frequancy range per unit frequency in the present study. Results: A peak power value detected on the right with FP2P4 and on the left with F7T3 electrodes were found to be higher in the manic episode than in the remission period (p=0.018 and 0.025). In the remission period, in cases with psychotic symptoms during the manic period, F4C4 peak power value was found to be lower than that in cases with no psychotic findings during the manic period (p=0.027). There was no relation was found between YMRS scores and peak power scores. Conclusion: Electrophysiological corollary of mood episode is present from the onset of the disease, and it differs between the manic and remission periods of bipolar disorder. In the remission period, peak power values of PSD distinguish cases with psychotic findings from cases without psychotic findings when they were manic.

Quadratic Phase Couplings in the EEG of Premature and Full-term Newborn during Quiet Sleep	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; full-term newborn; premature newborn; time-variant; quadratic phase coupling	VARIANT PARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; PRETERM INFANTS; COMPONENTS	Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on "Biosignal Interpretation: Advanced Methods for Neural Signals and Images". Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare rhythmicities in the quadratic phase coupling (QPC) in the trace discontinue EEG patterns (TD) of premature newborns and the trace alternant EEG patterns (TA) of full-term newborns by means of time-variant bispectral analysis. Both pattern occur during quiet sleep and are characterized by an ongoing sequence of interburst and burst patterns. The courses of time-variant bispectral measures during the EEG burst most likely indicate specific interrelations between cortical and thalamocortical brain structures. Methods: The EEG of a group of premature (n = 5) and of full-term (n = 5) newborns was analysed. Time-variant QPC was investigated by means of time-variant parametric bispectral analysis. The frequency plain [0.5 Hz, 1.5 Hz] x [3 Hz, 6 Hz] was used as the region-of-interest (ROI). Results: QPC rhythms with a frequency of 0.1 Hz (8-11 s) were found in all full-term newborns at all electrodes. For the premature newborns the QPC rhythms were less stable and slower (<0.1 Hz, 11 17 s) at all electrodes and showed a higher inter-individual variation than for the full-term newborns. Statistically, the adaptation of a linear mixed model revealed a difference of about 5 s between both groups of newborns. Conclusions: The comparison of the results of both groups of newborns indicates a development in the interaction between cortical, thalamocortical and neurovegetative structures in the neonatal brain.

Nicotinic modulation of auditory evoked potential electroencephalography in a rodent neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Mismatch negativity; Sensory gating; MAM; Nicotine; alpha 7nAChR	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR AGONIST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PROOF-OF-CONCEPT; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SENSORY MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; CLOZAPINE; EVP-6124; ABT-107	Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that has been hypothesized to be linked to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in basic sensory processing including sensory gating deficits in P50 and mismatch negativity (MMN). Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists have been reported to attenuate these deficits. Gestational exposure of rats to methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at embryonic day 17 leads to developmental disruption of the limbic-cortical system. MAM exposed offspring show neuropathological and behavioral changes that have similarities with those seen in schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to assess whether N40 auditory sensory gating (the rodent form of P50 gating) and MMN deficits as measures of auditory evoked potential (AEP) electroencephalography (EEG) are present in MAM rats and whether nAChR agonists could attend the deficit. El 7 male MAM and sham rats were implanted with cortical electrodes at 2 months of age. EEG recordings evaluating N40 gating and MMN paradigms were done comparing effects of vehicle (saline), nicotine and the alpha 7 agonist ABT-107. Deficits were seen for MAM rats compared to sham animals in both N40 auditory sensory gating and MMN AEP recordings. There was a strong trend for N40 deficits to be attenuated by both nicotine (0.16 mg/kg i.p. base) and ABT-107 (1.0 mg/kg i.p. base). MMN deficits were significantly attenuated by ABT-107 but not by nicotine. These data support the MAM model as a useful tool for translating pharmacodynamic effects in clinical medicine studies of novel therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although in SSVEP-based BCIs the frequency recognition methods using multiple channels EEG signals may provide better accuracy, using single channel would be preferable in a practical scenario since it can make the system simple and easy-to-use. To this goal, we propose a new single channel method based on wavelet-independent component analysis (WICA) in the SSVEP-based BCI, in which wavelet transform (WT) is applied to decompose a single channel signal into several wavelet components and then independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to separate the independent sources from the wavelet components. Experimental results show that most of the time the recognition accuracy of the proposed single channel method is higher than the conventional single channel method, power spectrum (PS) method.

However, as EEG signals easily suffer from various artifacts, ERPs are often collapsed and hard to observe. There are several attempts at using multi-channel EEG signals to enhance EEG signals of interest and make ERPs more clearly observed. For example, a previous work has proposed a blind EEG signal separation method using a multi-channel Wiener filter designed with a probabilistic generative model of observed EEG signals. This method copes with the under-determination of EEG signal separation by assuming sparseness of each EEG component in the time-frequency domain. Although this method blindly separates EEG signals into individual EEG components using time-varying scaled spatial correlation matrices, target EEG components, such as P300 of ERP, are often known in advance in some applications. In this paper, inspired by this previous work, we propose a probabilistic EEG signal enhancement method using a multi-channel Wiener filter, newly incorporating prior information of the spatial correlation matrices related to the target EEG component in the probabilistic generative model to improve performance of EEG signal enhancement. An experimental evaluation for P300 enhancement shows that the proposed method significantly reduces artifacts.

Here the spectral power in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta EEG bands and various power ratios (theta/alpha, theta/beta, beta/alpha, beta/theta, beta/[alpha+theta], [delta+theta]/alpha, alpha/delta, and [theta+alpha]/beta) are applied. These measures were subjected to a factor analysis with varimax rotation revealing four factors explaining 90 % of the entire variance. Factor 1 represents the power of the slow EEG frequency bands delta and theta, factor 2 the relationship between fast and slow frequency bands, factor 3 the slow to fast ratios, and factor 4 the absolute power of nearly all frequency bands. Group differences were found for three factor scores (1, 3, and 4). The linear discriminant analysis with the four factor scores as dependent and the group allocation as independent variables revealed a correct classification of 86 %. Although this classification is far from being perfect it is nevertheless reasonable high and statistically significant. Thus, EEG measures like the one used in this study might support the diagnosis of this difficult to diagnose disability. In addition, the EEG measures identified provide a deeper insight into the neural underpinnings of this disability. Based on this knowledge it might be possible to design new therapeutic strategies to treat LD.

At present, 2D multimedia animations have become the popular learning style in educational field. This study will investigate which brain area require more cognitive load during multimedia animations learning. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the physiological methods that are used to measure the brain activity during any cognitive task. We have used EEG to investigate the cognitive activity of 2D multimedia animations during learning. One of the EEG waves, Alpha's Power recorded sensitive during alert state while facing task difficulty. These are the prominent brain waves to measure the cognitive load during any cognitive task. In this study, behavior of Alpha waves has been analyzed in four different brain regions to find the more cognitive load regions. For that analysis, five healthy male adults have been recruited and a 2D multimedia animation on biology has been shown to them. Results showed a decrease in power spectral density (PSD) of Alpha waves for all brain regions. Different responses are recorded across these four brain regions. Parietal and occipital regions are associated with visual information processing and interpretation so a high suppression of Alpha band power has been noticed during the 2D multimedia aid.

Tractography diagrams obtained through diffusion tensor imaging have focused on white matter microstructure, with particular emphasis on neuronal connectivity at the level of fibre tract systems. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a complementary approach with more direct access to brain electrical activity. Its temporal resolution is excellent, and its spatial resolution can be enhanced to physiologically relevant levels, through the combination of high-density recordings (e.g. by using 64 channels in newborn infants) and mathematical models (e.g. inverse modelling computation), to identify generators of different oscillation bands and synchrony patterns. The integration of functional and structural topography of the neonatal brain provides insights into typical brain organization, and the deviations seen in particular contexts, for example the effect of hypoxic-ischaemic insult in terms of damage, eventual reorganization, and functional changes. Endophenotypes can then be used for pathophysiolgical reasoning, management planning, and outcome measurements, and allow a longitudinal approach to individual developmental trajectories.

A rich literature indicates that humans and animals are able to learn to influence diverse brain parameters, oscillatory patterns as well as the BOLD signal. Even though there is much known about oscillatory processes, it is still unclear how the brain manages to influence its own oscillatory activity. We developed a novel MEG technique for the real-time analysis of MEG source data to investigate that question. Our method extracts the power of ongoing oscillatory activity from a region of interest at the source, not at the sensor level, using the weighted information of all 275 MEG sensors in a real-time Beamforming procedure. The extracted power of oscillations in a particular frequency range is then used as the feedback signal. To examine whether and how the brain can control the level of oscillatory activity in the high frequency band (> 40 Hz, gamma band) we converted the gamma power into the pitch of a tone and trained subjects to modulate the pitch. Subsequent periods with and without feedback training were compared and the spectral and spatial parameters of oscillatory brain activity determined. Our pilot study includes 5 healthy subjects that all completed nine sessions of NFB training, each lasting about 50 minutes. The data suggests that 4 subjects were able to change high frequency oscillations in visual cortex in particular frequency bands. The distances between the region of interest and task related changes are less than 2 cm in the successful subjects. The task related changes vary between participants.

It is a good mean to observe cognitive response that depends on time. EEG has many advantages over other techniques owing to its non-invasiveness, low cost and high temporal resolution. But one of the major challenges of EEG signal study is the huge data dimensionality which makes signal processing and subsequent analysis an uphill task. The aim of this study is to obtain a model for better neural connectivity analysis which illustrates meditation's dynamic mind-body response. Accordingly the EEG data is being collected during meditation (Kriya Yoga). In order to calculate and visualize the time-frequency representations of each electrode, a time varying Granger Causality based connectivity estimators named Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and adaptive DTF (ADTF) among all scalp electrodes have been computed in meditator group. The ADTF can be derived from the coefficients of a time-varying multivariate autoregressive (TVAR) model fitted to the data obtained during meditation. We define this time-varying measure of causality as the adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF) and compare its ability with the conventional DTF for meditator group. Both ADTF and Conventional DTF were calculated in meditator. The obtained simulation results of adaptive DTF and conventional DTF shows better neural connectivity and gives useful information in meditator group. However, to accomplish this task, surrogate data statistics has been used in both the mentioned models to validate the models. It was found that the ADTF has the capability to distinguish the dynamic changes in the primary source of the information outflow. The results obtained both by using ADTF and conventional DTF method were compared in meditator group subsequently.

They are altered in various pathological states, as well as by neuropharmaceuticals, so that they are of interest in drug and clinical investigations. However, when the human electroencephalogram is recorded on the scalp, this neural high-frequency signal is buried under a range of other electrical signals such that, without careful handling, recordings of the high-frequency electroencephalogram cannot be considered reliable. The artefacts of concern originate from: power line noise, saccade-associated contraction of the extra-ocular muscles, activity of muscles in the scalp, face and neck, screen refresh artefacts and activity of the muscles associated with blinking. Recent progress in dealing with these artefacts is described, including either noise cancellation or phased noise template subtraction for power line noise, regression or independent component analysis for correcting extra-ocular muscle activity and mathematical modelling for reducing scalp, face and neck muscle activity. If the artefacts are properly addressed, the neural gamma signal can be uncovered. (C) 2016 S.

In order to estimate user's favorite musical pieces, our method utilizes his/her EEG signals for calculating new audio features suitable for representing the user's music preference. Specifically, projection, which transforms original audio features into the features reflecting the preference, is calculated by applying kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to the audio features and the EEG features which are extracted from the user's EEG signals during listening to favorite musical pieces. By using the obtained projection, the new EEG-based audio features can be derived since this projection provides the best correlation between the user's EEG signals and their corresponding audio signals. Thus, successful estimation of user's favorite musical pieces via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the new audio features becomes feasible. Since our method does not need acquisition of EEG signals for obtaining new audio features from new musical pieces after calculating the projection, this indicates the high practicability of our method. Experimental results show that our method outperforms methods using original audio features or EEG features.

PARAFAC analysis of EEG tensor enables us to decompose multichannel EEG into constituting temporal, spectral and spatial signatures. SSVEPs characterized with localized spectral and spatial signatures are then detected exploiting a correlation analysis between extracted signatures of the EEG tensor and the corresponding simulated signatures of all target SSVEP signals. The SSVEP that has the highest correlation is selected as the intended target. Two flickers blinking at 8 and 13 Hz were used as visual stimuli and the detection was performed based on data packets of 1 second without overlapping. Five subjects participated in the experiments and the highest classification rate of 83.34% was achieved, leading to the Information Transfer Rate (ITR) of 21.01 bits/min.

J	Obleser, J				Obleser, Jonas			Re-visiting the electrophysiology of language	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Time-frequency analysis; Event-related potentials; EEG; ECoG; Speech comprehension; Prediction	OSCILLATIONS	This editorial accompanies a special issue of Brain and Language re-visiting old themes and new leads in the electrophysiology of language. The event-related potential (ERP) as a series of characteristic deflections ("components") over time and their distribution on the scalp has been exploited by speech and language researchers over decades to find support for diverse psycholinguistic models. Fortunately, methodological and statistical advances have allowed human neuroscience to move beyond some of the limitations imposed when looking at the ERP only. Most importantly, we currently witness a refined and refreshed look at "event-related" (in the literal sense) brain activity that relates itself more closely to the actual neurobiology of speech and language processes. It is this imminent change in handling and interpreting electrophysiological data of speech and language experiments that this special issue intends to capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In detail, five types of visual stimuli with different frequencies are displayed on the different locations of a PC monitor. The human subject can select his/her intended food by focusing on a related specific visual stimulus for several seconds. A wearable EEG sensor then measures the subject's EEG and followed by on line frequency analysis. From the frequency analysis, the robot can detect the human subject's intention within limited time and can perform the task to move the related food to the subject. In this research, 5 health subjects are tested using this WE-BRI. It is found that in order to increase the success rate of intention detection, the subject should focus on a specific visual stimulus for more than 4 seconds. The highest success rate of the detection can reach to 92%. The developed WE-BRI is also expected to be applied in wider range of robotic human care tasks.

The proposed method consists of four phases; EEG recordings and EEG feature extraction, personality quantification, feature vector creation to detect the impression evaluation patterns, and impression evaluation patterns detection. The EEG feature is extracted by calculating the time average of the power spectrum of each frequency band at 1 Hz intervals of the EEG. Egogram, Yatabe-Guilford personality inventory and Kretschmer type personality inventory are using for quantifying his/her character. The feature vector to detect the impression evaluation patterns is created by the EEG feature and the results of his/her character quantification. We regard the matching patterns between music and his/her mood as the impression patterns on music listened to. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments using real EEG data.

Inverse effectiveness, a phenomenon in which weaker stimuli induce greater activation of multisensory neurons than do stronger stimuli, is an essential component of multisensory integration. The superior colliculus is especially abundant in multisensory neurons with properties of inverse effectiveness. However, multisensory neurons are distributed throughout the brain, suggesting that a wide range of brain regions are involved in generating multisensory behavior in addition to the superior colliculus. In this study, we aimed to use scalp EEG to elucidate the cortical responses that respond to multisensory stimuli according to the principle of inverse effectiveness. By modulating the intensity of the tactile aspect of a simultaneous visuotactile stimulus, we explored the time frequency component of scalp EEG waveforms produced during multi-sensory stimulation. Using this method, we determined the relative values and temporal dynamics of the increment of power spectrum (event-related spectrum perturbation) and phase coherence across trials (e.g., inter-trial phase coherency) produced by multisensory stimulation compared to unisensoiy stimulation. In the somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortices, we observed significant differences in the inter-trial phase coherence of the theta band oscillation 200-400 ms post-stimulus, in response to visuotactile (multisensory) and tactile (unisensory) stimulation, while no differences were found in later time windows and other cortical areas. These results suggest that inverse effectiveness is an important aspect of multi-sensory processing in the somato-sensory and frontal cerebral cortices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Trained physicians and neurologists visually scan the long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) records to identify epileptic seizures. It generally requires many hours to interpret the data. Therefore, tools for quick detection of seizures in long-term EEG records are very useful. This study proposes an algorithm to help detect seizures in long-term iEEG based on low computational costs methods using Spectral Power and Wavelet analysis. The detector was tested on 21 invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) records. A sensitivity of 85.39% was achieved. The results indicate that the proposed method detects epileptic seizures in long-term iEEG records successfully. Moreover, the algorithm does not require long processing time due to its simplicity. This feature will allow significant time reduction of the visual inspection of iEEG records performed by the specialists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Swarm modulation has potential applications to enhance human hearing with extended frequency ranges, in medical diagnostics for electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and other medical signals, for RADAR analysis, for user-interface sonification, and for sound synthesis or non-synthetic sound transformation. Swarm modulation is a new way to transform signals, and is demonstrated for transforming subsonic and ultrasonic sound into the audible range of human hearing. Swarm modulation is based on the principle of phase-incoherent frequency-roaming oscillation. Features in the frequency-time plane are reconstructed via a time-varying process, controllable with instantaneous zero-latency reaction time to new information. Swarm modulation allows prioritization of salient output spectral features for efficient processing, and overcomes cyclic beating patterns when Fourier and wavelet-based methods are applied in a stationary manner. Swarm modulation can flexibly re-map sound when a user expressively touches physical matter creating vibration. By detecting subsonic, sonic and ultrasonic vibrations, we can add to materials a rich acoustic user-feedback that can be adjusted to sound like a bell, xylophone, dull piece of wood, or a variety of other objects, in real-time. By dynamically controlling the output sound spectrum depending on the input spectrum, simultaneously with a continuous and low-latency temporal response, the system imitates the physicality of touching a real object. Applied in control panels and expressive control surfaces, swarm modulation can create realistic sonic feedback, for human head-up operation of controls in critical applications.

Extracting EEG features correlated with driver's cognitive states is key for achieving accurate prediction. However, high dimensionality and temporal-and-spatial correlations of EEG data make extraction of effective features difficult. This study explores the approaches based on deep belief networks (DBN) for feature extraction and dimension reduction. Experimental results of this study showed that DBN applied to channel epochs (DBN-C) produces the most discriminant features and the best classification performance is achieved when DBN-C is applied to the time-frequency and independent-component analysis transformed EEG data. The results suggested that DBN-C is a promising new method for extracting complex, discriminant features for EEG-based brain computer interfaces.

In this study we developed a tool to record skull EEG in awake-behaving rats in a similar manner to how human EEG are obtained and then used this technique to test whether acute NMDA receptor antagonism alters rodent EEG signals in a similar manner as in humans. Acute MK-801 treatment elevated gamma power and reduced beta band power, which closely mirrored EEG data from healthy volunteers receiving acute ketamine. To explore the mechanisms behind these oscillatory changes, we examined the effects of GABA-A receptor blockade, finding that picrotoxin (PTX) recapitulated the decrease in sound-evoked beta oscillations observed with acute MK-801, but did not produce changes in gamma band power. Chronic treatment with either PTX or MK-801 did not affect frequency-specific oscillatory activity when tested 24 h after the last drug injection, but decreased total broadband oscillatory power. Overall, this study validated a novel platform for recording rodent EEG and demonstrated similar oscillatory changes after acute NMDA receptor antagonism in both humans and rodents, suggesting that skull EEG may be a powerful tool for further translational studies.

Synchronization can occur in form of phase coupling or amplitude correlation. It is unknown whether these coupling types have differing behavioral significance at rest. To address this, we performed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and source connectivity analysis in several populations of healthy subjects and patients with brain lesions. We systematically compared different types and frequencies of neural synchronization and investigated their association with behavioral performance in verbal and spatial attention tasks. Behavioral performance could be consistently predicted by two distinct resting-state coupling patterns: (1) amplitude envelope correlation of beta activity between homologous areas of both hemispheres, (2) lagged phase synchronization in EEG alpha activity between a brain area and the entire cortex. A disruption of these coupling patterns was also associated with neurological deficits in patients with stroke lesions. This suggests the existence of two distinct network systems responsible for resting-state integration. Lagged phase synchronization in the alpha band is associated with global interaction across networks while amplitude envelope correlation seems to be behaviorally relevant for interactions within networks and between hemispheres. These two coupling types may therefore provide complementary insights on brain physiology and pathology.

The entrainment to rhythmic sound stimuli is often referred to as the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and can be captured using noninvasive techniques, such as scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). An ASSR to a driving frequency of approximately 40 Hz is particularly interesting in that it shows, in relative terms, maximal power, synchrony, and synaptic activity. Moreover, the 40-Hz ASSR has been consistently found to be abnormal in schizophrenia patients across multiple studies. The nature of the reported abnormality has been less consistent; while most studies report a deficit in entrainment, several studies have reported increased signal power, particularly when there are concurrent positive symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations. However, the neuropharmacological basis for the 40-Hz ASSR, as well as its dysfunction in schizophrenia, has been unclear until recently. On the basis of several recent reports, it is argued that the 40-Hz ASSR represents a specific marker for cortical NMDA transmission. If confirmed, the 40-Hz ASSR may be a simple and easy-to-access pharmacodynamic biomarker for testing the integrity of cortical NMDA neurotransmission that is robustly translational across species.

The EMD method decomposes EEG signals into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These IMFs can be considered narrow-band, amplitude and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signals. The mean frequency measure of these IMFs has been used to combine these IMFs in order to obtain the enhanced EEG signals which have major contributions due to mu and beta rhythms. The main aim of the proposed method is to filter EEG signals before feature extraction and classification to enhance the features separability and ultimately the BCI task classification performance. The features namely, Hjorth and band power features computed from the enhanced EEG signals, have been used as a feature set for classification of left hand and right hand MIs using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based classification method. Significant superior performance is obtained when the method is tested on the BCI competition IV datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This pathology is characterized by the progressive and irreversible alteration of cognitive functions, such as memory, leading inexorably to the loss of autonomy for patients with AD. The pathology is linked with aging and occurs most commonly around 65 years old. Its prevalence (5% over 65 years of age and 20% after 80 years) constitutes an economic and social burden for AD patients and their family. At the present, there is still no cure for AD, actual treatments being moderately effective only in early stages of the pathology. A lot of efforts have been deployed with the aim of defining new AD biomarkers. Successful early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) linked to AD requires the identification of biomarkers capable of distinguishing individuals with early stages of AD from other pathologies impacting cognition such as depression. In this article, we will review recent evidence suggesting that electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, coupled with behavioral assessments, could be a useful approach and easily implementable for a precocious detection of AD.

However, the classification of EEG signals is still challenging because of high nonstationarity and high dimensionality. The aim of this work is an automatic classification of the EEG recordings by using statistical features extraction and support vector machine. From a real database, two sets of EEG signals are used: EEG recorded from a healthy person and from an epileptic person during epileptic seizures. Three important statistical features are computed at different sub-bands discrete wavelet and wavelet packet decomposition of EEG recordings. In this study, to select the best wavelet for our application,five wavelet basis functions are considered for processing EEG signals. After reducing the dimension of the obtained data by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), feature vectors are used to model and to train the efficient support vector machine classifier. In order to show the efficiency of this approach, the statistical classification performances are evaluated, and a rate of 100% for the best classification accuracy is obtained and is compared with those obtained in other studies for the same dataset. However, this method is not meant to replace the clinician but can assist him for his diagnosis and reinforce his decision.

Oscillations in the human brain during walking execution, imagination and observation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Oscillations; EEG; fMRI; Motor control; Mental imagery; Walking; Review	CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; BIOLOGICAL MOTION PERCEPTION; HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR IMAGERY; VIRTUAL-REALITY; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS	Gait is an essential human activity which organizes many functional and cognitive behaviors. The bio-mechanical constraints of bipedalism implicating a permanent control of balance during gait are taken into account by a complex dialog between the cortical, subcortical and spinal networks. This networking is largely based on oscillatory coding, including changes in spectral power and phase-locking of ongoing neural activity in theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. This coding is specifically modulated in actual gait execution and representation, as well as in contexts of gait observation or imagination. A main challenge in integrative neuroscience oscillatory activity analysis is to disentangle the brain oscillations devoted to gait control. In addition to neuroimaging approaches, which have highlighted the structural components of an extended network, dynamic high-density EEG gives non-invasive access to functioning of this network. Here we revisit the neurophysiological foundations of behavior-related EEG in the light of current neuropsychological theoretic frameworks. We review different EEG rhythms emerging in the most informative paradigms relating to human gait and implications for rehabilitation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These gestures are usually aligned with lexical stress and can modulate the saliency of their affiliate words. Here we addressed the consequences of beat gestures on the neural correlates of speech perception. Previous studies have highlighted the role played by theta oscillations in temporal prediction of speech. We hypothesized that the sight of beat gestures may influence ongoing low-frequency neural oscillations around the onset of the corresponding words. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were acquired while participants watched a continuous, naturally recorded discourse. The phase-locking value (PLV) at word onset was calculated from the EEG from pairs of identical words that had been pronounced with and without a concurrent beat gesture in the discourse. We observed an increase in PLV in the 5-6 Hz theta range as well as a desynchronization in the 8-10 Hz alpha band around the onset of words preceded by a beat gesture. These findings suggest that beats help tune low-frequency oscillatory activity at relevant moments during natural speech perception, providing a new insight of how speech and paralinguistic information are integrated.

The wavelet-coherent magnitude spectra provide the information indicating the degree of coherence between two EEG channels on different cortical regions. Sixteen subjects were divided into guilty and innocent groups randomly. They were instructed to make a truthful or deceptive response on the stimuli. EEG recordings on 12 channels were collected. Experimental result shows that there are obvious differences between two groups' wavelet coherence in a specific time-frequency area, suggesting that wavelet coherence is an effective and reliable approach to detect deception.

These rhythms reveal spectral changes in alpha and beta bands induced by movements of different body parts, e.g., hands and limbs, in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, less can be revealed in them about movements of different fine body parts that activate adjacent brain regions, such as individual fingers from one hand. Several studies have reported spatial and temporal couplings of rhythmic activities at different frequency bands, suggesting the existence of well-defined spectral structures across multiple frequency bands. In the present study, spectral principal component analysis (PGA) was applied on EEG data, obtained from a finger movement task, to identify cross-frequency spectral structures. Features from identified spectral structures were examined in their spatial patterns, cross-condition pattern changes, detection capability of finger movements from resting, and decoding performance of individual finger movements in comparison to classic mu/beta rhythms. These new features reveal some similar, but more different spatial and spectral patterns as compared with classic mu/beta rhythms. Decoding results further indicate that these new features (91%) can detect finger movements much better than classic mu/beta rhythms (75.6%). More importantly, these new features reveal discriminative information about movements of different fingers (fine body-part movements), which is not available in classic mu/beta rhythms. The capability in decoding fingers (and hand gestures in the future) from EEG will contribute significantly to the development of non-invasive BCI and neuroprosthesis with intuitive and flexible controls.

Subdural Electrodes in Focal Epilepsy Surgery at a Typical Academic Epilepsy Center	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Invasive; Intracranial; EEG; Subdural	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; AMERICAN-ACADEMY; GRID ELECTRODES; 80-500 HZ; DEPTH; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Purpose: To assess the use of subdural intracranial EEG (iEEG) on postoperative outcomes at an epilepsy center. Methods: Ninety-one epilepsy patients underwent iEEG. Array design was compared with noninvasive EEG with over 1 year of outcome. Patient demographics, implanted brain sites, electrodes, contacts/site, and surgical location were correlated with outcome. Fisher exact test and logistics regression were used to evaluate significance (P <= 0.05). Results: Of ninety-one women, 55 (mean age, 32.3 years; range, 11-60) underwent tailored iEEG. Seventy of ninety-one (76.9%) resections (70% temporal) yielded 24/91 (26.4%) seizure free (SF). Strips (57.1%), grids (5.5%), or both (37.4%) for iEEG use was commonly bilateral (58.2%; 65.3% bitemporal) but did not predict outcome (P = NS). A lesion (28/91) did predict a SF outcome (42.9%). The iEEG localized 45.7% of seizures beyond scalp EEG and changed the localization or lateralization in 75.7% of resected patients. Electrode design, localization, lateralization, and site of resection did not correlate with outcome (P = NS). Overall, iEEG use portended a non-SF outcome (P <= 0.0001). Conclusions: The use of iEEG selected 46% additional patients for surgery, yet only 26% became SF. A magnetic resonance imaging lesion predicted a SF or seizure-improved outcome. Although iEEG changed the localization and lateralization of scalp ictal EEG in three quarters of patients, its use was a negative predictor for a favorable outcome. Preoperative counseling should emphasize expectations for seizure reduction in patients requiring iEEG.

This work investigated the time delay between changes of cardiac and brain activity for sleep transitions. Here, the brain activity was quantified by electroencephalographic (EEG) mean frequency and the cardiac parameters included heart rate, standard deviation of heartbeat intervals, and their low-and high-frequency spectral powers. Using a cross-correlation analysis, we found that the cardiac variations during wake-sleep and NREM sleep transitions preceded the EEG changes by 1-3 min but this was not the case for REM sleep transitions. These important findings can be further used to predict the onset and ending of some sleep stages in an early manner. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

We studied 22 patients with epileptic spasms recorded during digital video-scalp EEG, including five individuals who still had persistent spasms after callosotomy. We analysed the duration, amplitude, latency to onset of electromyographic bursts, and distribution of the highest positive and negative peaks of slow waves in 352 spasms. High-voltage positive slow waves preceded the identifiable muscle contractions of spasms. The mean duration of these positive waves was 569 +/- 228 m, and the mean latency to electromyographic onset was 182 +/- 127 m. These parameters varied markedly even within a patient. The highest peak of the positive component was distributed in variable regions, which was not consistent with the location of lesions on MRI. The peak of the negative component following the positivity was distributed in the neighbouring or opposite areas of the positive peak distribution. No changes were evident in the pre- or post-surgical distributions of the positive peak, or in the interhemispheric delay between both hemispheres, in individuals with callosotomy. Our data imply that ictal positive slow waves are the most common EEG changes during spasms associated with a massive motor component. Plausible explanations for these widespread positive slow waves include the notion that EEG changes possibly reflect involvement of both cortical and subcortical structures.

Low-Frequency Cortical Entrainment to Speech Reflects Phoneme-Level Processing	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PHASE PATTERNS; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; MECHANISMS; TRACKING	The human ability to understand speech is underpinned by a hierarchical auditory system whose successive stages process increasingly complex attributes of the acoustic input. It has been suggested that to produce categorical speech perception, this system must elicit consistent neural responses to speech tokens (e.g., phonemes) despite variations in their acoustics. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we provide evidence for this categorical phoneme-level speech processing by showing that the relationship between continuous speech and neural activity is best described when that speech is represented using both low-level spectrotemporal information and categorical labeling of phonetic features. Furthermore, the mapping between phonemes and EEG becomes more discriminative for phonetic features at longer latencies, in line with what one might expect from a hierarchical system. Importantly, these effects are not seen for time-reversed speech. These findings may form the basis for future research on natural language processing in specific cohorts of interest and for broader insights into how brains transform acoustic input into meaning.

J	Siswandari, Y; Xiong, SP				Siswandari, Yohana; Xiong, Shuping			Eye movements and brain oscillations to symbolic safety signs with different comprehensibility	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						Safety sign; Comprehensibility; Eye movement; Brain activity; Physiological measures	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG ALPHA; PERCEPTION; FREQUENCY; PERFORMANCE; TRACKING; POWER	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate eye movements and brain oscillations to symbolic safety signs with different comprehensibility. Methods: Forty-two young adults participated in this study, and ten traffic symbols consisting of easy-to-comprehend and hard-to-comprehend signs were used as stimuli. During the sign comprehension test, real-time eye movements and spontaneous brain activity [electroencephalogram (EEG) data] were simultaneously recorded. Results: The comprehensibility level of symbolic traffic signs significantly affects eye movements and EEG spectral power. The harder to comprehend the sign is, the slower the blink rate, the larger the pupil diameter, and the longer the time to first fixation. Noticeable differences on EEG spectral power between easy-to-comprehend and hard-tocomprehend signs are observed in the prefrontal and visual cortex of the human brain. Conclusions: Sign comprehensibility has significant effects on real-time nonintrusive eye movements and brain oscillations. These findings demonstrate the potential to integrate physiological measures from eye movements and brain oscillations with existing evaluation methods in assessing the comprehensibility of symbolic safety signs.

One of the interesting areas of interaction modality is robotic environment where involvement of illegitimate users may cause severe threat to environment thereby, a continuous monitoring is mandatory. In this paper, we have presented a study of potential of brainwaves and their computing for providing higher security. This work utilizes EEG signal generated by visual stimuli for keying in the password. In order to construct a model for user authentication, we have selected the time-frequency analysis method called wavelet analysis to decompose original signal corresponding to EEG sub-band frequency, thereby extracting statistical measures and energy calculation of each decomposed waves. Furthermore, we have selected and employed the neural network based on learning vector quantization for correct classification. Classification rate has been calculated over the different combination of channels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lexical mediation of phonotactic frequency effects on spoken word recognition: A Granger causality analysis of MRI-constrained MEG/EEG data	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Phonotactic frequency; Effective connectivity; Magnetoencephalography; Granger causation; Speech perception; Lexical effect	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVATION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; COMPENSATION; LANGUAGE; MODEL; MEG; COARTICULATION	Phonotactic frequency effects play a crucial role in a number of debates over language processing and representation. It is unclear however, whether these effects reflect prelexical sensitivity to phonotactic frequency, or lexical "gang effects" in speech perception. In this paper, we use Granger causality analysis of MR-constrained MEG/EEG data to understand how phonotactic frequency influences neural processing dynamics during auditory lexical decision. Effective connectivity analysis showed weaker feedforward influence from brain regions involved in acoustic-phonetic processing (superior temporal gyrus) to lexical areas (supramarginal gyrus) for high phonotactic frequency words, but stronger top-down lexical influence for the same items. Low entropy nonwords (nonwords judged to closely resemble real words) showed a similar pattern of interactions between brain regions involved in lexical and acoustic-phonetic processing. These results contradict the predictions of a feedforward model of phonotactic frequency facilitation, but support the predictions of a lexically mediated account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This can be achieved through the understanding of neurophysiological correlates of architectural perception. To this aim, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of 12 healthy subjects were recorded during the perception of three immersive virtual reality environments (VEs). Afterwards, participants were asked to describe their experience in terms of Familiarity, Novelty, Comfort, Pleasantness, Arousal, and Presence using a rating scale from 1 to 9. These perceptual dimensions are hypothesized to influence the pattern of cerebral spectral activity, while Presence is used to assess the realism of the virtual stimulation. Hence, the collected scores were used to analyze the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG for each behavioral dimension in the theta, alpha and mu bands by means of time-frequency analysis and topographic statistical maps. Analysis of Presence resulted in the activation of the frontal-midline theta, indicating the involvement of sensorimotor integration mechanisms when subjects expressed to feel more present in the VEs. Similar patterns also characterized the experience of familiar and comfortable VEs. In addition, pleasant VEs increased the theta power across visuomotor circuits and activated the alpha band in areas devoted to visuospatial exploration and processing of categorical spatial relations. Finally, the de synchronization of the mu rhythm described the perception of pleasant and comfortable VEs, showing the involvement of left motor areas and embodied mechanisms for environment appreciation. Overall, these results show the possibility to measure EEG correlates of architectural perception involving the cerebral circuits of sensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and embodiment. These observations can help testing architectural hypotheses in order to design environments matching the changing needs of humans.

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to improve the prediction of nociceptive responses with linear and non-linear measures calculated from EEG signal filtered in frequency bands higher than the traditional bands. Power spectral density and auto-mutual information function was applied in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure. The proposed measures exhibit better performances than the bispectral index (BIS). Values of prediction probability of P-k above 0.75 and percentages of sensitivity and specificity above 70% were achieved combining EEG measures from the traditional frequency bands and higher frequency bands.

EEG signals for 20 university volunteers were measured at the SNRs of 0, -4, -8, -12 and -16 dB under the A, AV and V conditions. It was indicated that the task-relevant brain areas exhibited ERS under the different three sensory conditions. Brain region of A condition was distributed in the regions of frontal, central, and parietal, whereas those of AV and V conditions were concentrated in the parietal areas. Larger alpha-band power (ERS) of A condition was observed than those of AV and V conditions. The background brightness, objects recognition, relevant-task, and lip movement might contribute to the ERS. It was revealed that alpha-band oscillation can reflect the ability to process the background information for the human brain.

Intra-and inter-subject variations represent the main source of HFOs diversity in terms of spectral and temporal characteristics. According to spectral characteristics, HFOs are usually classified into four sub-bands: gamma, high-gamma, ripples and fast ripples. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of discriminating HFOs classes. Gabor Transform is used to extract relevant features from intracerebral electroencephalography signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery.

Evidence for Neural Computations of Temporal Coherence in an Auditory Scene and Their Enhancement during Active Listening	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory scene analysis; denoising source separation (DSS); electroencephalography (EEG); stream segregation; temporal coherence; temporal response function (TRF)	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; SPEECH; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES	The human brain has evolved to operate effectively in highly complex acoustic environments, segregating multiple sound sources into perceptually distinct auditory objects. A recent theory seeks to explain this ability by arguing that stream segregation occurs primarily due to the temporal coherence of the neural populations that encode the various features of an individual acoustic source. This theory has received support from both psychoacoustic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that use stimuli which model complex acoustic environments. Termed stochastic figure-ground (SFG) stimuli, they are composed of a "figure" and background that overlap in spectrotemporal space, such that the only way to segregate the figure is by computing the coherence of its frequency components over time. Here, we extend these psychoacoustic and fMRI findings by using the greater temporal resolution of electroencephalography to investigate the neural computation of temporal coherence. We present subjects with modified SFG stimuli wherein the temporal coherence of the figure is modulated stochastically over time, which allows us to use linear regression methods to extract a signature of the neural processing of this temporal coherence. We do this under both active and passive listening conditions. Our findings show an early effect of coherence during passive listening, lasting from similar to 115 to 185 ms post-stimulus. When subjects are actively listening to the stimuli, these responses are larger and last longer, up to similar to 265 ms. These findings provide evidence for early and preattentive neural computations of temporal coherence that are enhanced by active analysis of an auditory scene.

Development of the posterior basic rhythm in children with autism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Autism; Electroencephalography; Development; Posterior basic rhythm; Alpha; Resting state	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG; COHERENCE; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; MECHANISMS; DISORDER; POWER	Objective: Early detection of autism is critical for effective intervention, but currently, no simple screening tests are available. Furthermore, little is known about the development of brain dynamics in young children. We examine the early neurophysiological manifestations of autism by retrospectively analyzing EEG. In particular, we focus on maturation of the posterior basic rhythm (PBR), which is one of the most characteristic features of the normal EEG, and comprises a discrete functional state. Methods: Subjects with a diagnosis of autism (n = 74), as well as normal (n = 134) and epileptic (n = 108) controls, were extracted retrospectively from our digital EEG database. Segments with clear PBR were extracted, and standard signal analysis methods were used to calculate peak PBR frequency, power, and coherence. Results: In our cohort, a subset of autistic children show accelerated development of the PBR, with early maturation especially in the 2-to 4-year old range. The overall coherence of PBR-specific activity is also lower in autistic children in our cohort. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that autism is associated with accelerated development of the PBR. Significance: These findings generate a clinical hypothesis for future prospective studies on the efficacy of these simple measures as a diagnostic or screening tool.

It is suggested that cross frequency coupling (CFC) occurred when the amplitude of fast oscillation is modulated by the phase of slow oscillation. In this study, we assess CFC in terms of Modulation Index (MI) of theta, low gamma (LG) and high gamma (HG) in sleep stages N1, N2, N3 and REM of healthy and sleep apnoea patients. The results showed theta phase modulated more the HG band in all sleep stages. Theta-HG coupling was more pronounced in the sleep apnoea as compared to the healthy.

At the level of macroscopic cortical network dynamics, recent electroencephalography (EEG) data suggests that cortical oscillations in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) are correlated with creative thinking. However, whether alpha oscillations play a functional role in creativity has remained unknown. Here we show that creativity is increased by enhancing alpha power using 10 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (10 Hz-tACS) of the frontal cortex. In a study of 20 healthy participants with a randomized, balanced cross-over design, we found a significant improvement of 7.4% in the Creativity Index measured by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), a comprehensive and most frequently used assay of creative potential and strengths. In a second similar study with 20 subjects, 40 Hz-tACS was used instead of 10 Hz-tACS to rule out a general "electrical stimulation" effect. No significant change in the Creativity Index was found for such frontal 40 Hz stimulation. Our results suggest that alpha activity in frontal brain areas is selectively involved in creativity; this enhancement represents the first demonstration of specific neuronal dynamics that drive creativity and can be modulated by non-invasive brain stimulation. Our findings agree with the model that alpha recruitment increases with internal processing demands and is involved in inhibitory top-down control, which is an important requirement for creative ideation.

Specifically, we analyzed EEG data from 11 normal hearing subjects to examine whether ITPC can predict noise-induced variations in the obligatory N1-P2 complex response. N1-P2 amplitude and latency data were obtained for the /bu/syllable in quiet and noise listening conditions. ITPC data in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands were calculated for the N1-P2 responses in the two passive listening conditions. Consistent with previous studies, background noise produced significant amplitude reduction and latency increase in N1 and P2, which were accompanied by significant ITPC decreases in all the three frequency bands. Correlation analyses further revealed that variations in ITPC were able to predict the amplitude and latency variations in N1-P2. The results suggest that trial-by-trial analysis of cortical neural synchrony is a valuable tool in understanding the modulatory effects of background noise on AERP measures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed, constraints have to be imposed on the source estimates to find a unique solution. These constraints can be applied either in the standard or a transformed domain. The Time-Frequency Mixed Norm Estimate applies a composite convex regularization functional promoting structured sparsity in the time-frequency domain by combining an l(2,1)-mixed-norm and an l(1)-norm penalty on the coefficients of the Gabor TF decomposition of the source signals, to improve the reconstruction of spatially sparse neural activations with non-stationary and transient signals. Due to the l(1)-norm based constraints, the resulting source estimates are however biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection. In this work, we present the iterative reweighted Time-Frequency Mixed Norm Estimate, which employs a composite non-convex penalty formed by the sum of an l(2,0.5)-quasinorm and an l(0.5)-quasinorm penalty. The resulting non-convex problem is solved with a reweighted convex optimization scheme, in which each iteration is equivalent to a weighted Time-Frequency Mixed-Norm Estimate solved efficiently using a block coordinate descent scheme and an active set strategy. We compare our approach to alternative solvers using simulations and analysis of MEG data and demonstrate the benefit of the iterative reweighted Time-Frequency Mixed Norm Estimate with regard to active source identification, amplitude bias correction, and temporal unmixing of activations.

In an overview on how this approach can take shape, multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) is treated in 2 main parts: by experiments without a task and in the experimentally cued working brain. It concentrates first on the alpha rhythm properties and next on data-driven search for patterns such as the default mode network. The high-resolution volumic distributions of neuronal metabolic indices result in distributed cortical regions and possibly relate to numerous nuclei, observable in a non-invasive manner in the central nervous system of humans. The second part deals with paradigms in which nowadays assessment of target-related networks can align level-dependent blood oxygenation, electrical responses and behaviour, taking the temporal resolution advantages of event-related potentials. Evidence-based electrical propagation in serial tasks during performance is now to a large extent attributed to interconnected pathways, particularly chronometry-dependent ones, throughout a chain including a dorsal stream, next ventral cortical areas taking the flow of information towards inferior temporal domains. The influence of aging is documented, and results of the first multimodal studies in neuropharmacology are consistent. Finally a scope on implementation of advanced clinical applications and personalized marker strategies in neuropsychiatry is indicated. (C) 2016 S.

Single-channel EEG recordings containing totally 488 seizures from 8 WAG/Rij rats were analyzed using the real-time SWD detection algorithm. The proposed algorithms based on the variation of wavelet power to the background power in two specific frequency bands whose spectral power are highly correlated with SWDs. The wavelet powers of two specific frequency bands are calculated with a pattern-adapted mother wavelet and compared with an adaptive ratio of background power of each frequency band. The results indicate used algorithm is able to detect the whole 488 seizures within less than 1 s with sensitivity of 100%. The average precision for 1200, 1400 and 1600 point of window size was 95.2%, 98.3% and 99.17%, respectively. The present algorithm, with its high sensitivity and specificity, could be used for further studies of absence seizures in humans and rats and could be implemented as real-time system for closed loop deep brain stimulation systems.

EEG signals are located in low frequency range and relatively small. The amplitude of these signals are approximately 50 mu V with the maximum amplitude is about 100 mu V. Therefore, there are number of sources such as power line, EOG or ECG can extremely interfere EEG signals. Detection and elimination of artifacts plays an important role to acquire clean EEG signals to analyze and detect brain activities. Besides, the extraction of important components in recorded EEG required fast and reliable algorithm to process mix of data set. In this paper, we will demonstrate EEG acquisition from EEG Exea Ultra system of Bitmed, analyze and compare signals from volunteers in relaxation mode and contaminated EEG signals with eye blinks. We then design filters to remove powerlines and baseline noise from acquired signals. With the aim to assess the feasibility of Wavelet transform technique to identify feature in recorded EEG signals, we carried out Wavelet transform and applied threshold method to detect and remove artifacts in EEG signals with eye blinks. We achieved PSNR of original signals and wavelet filtered signal that approximately 17,7810 dB. Our preliminary results show that wavelet can be utilized as automatically detection tools for artifacts and event-related potentials and in applications require real-time processing of EEG signals.

The spectrum of the non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram following total sleep deprivation is trait-like	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						inter-individual variability; phenotype; polysomnography; power spectrum; sleep homeostasis; variance components	INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; EEG	The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum is unique to an individual and stable across multiple baseline recordings. The aim of this study was to examine whether the sleep EEG spectrum exhibits the same stable characteristics after acute total sleep deprivation. Polysomnography (PSG) was recorded in 20 healthy adults across consecutive sleep periods. Three nights of baseline sleep [12h time in bed (TIB)] following 12h of wakefulness were interleaved with three nights of recovery sleep (12h TIB) following 36h of sustained wakefulness. Spectral analysis of the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG (C3LM derivation) was used to calculate power in 0.25Hz frequency bins between 0.75 and 16.0Hz. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess stable individual differences for baseline and recovery night spectra separately and combined. ICCs were high across all frequencies for baseline and recovery and for baseline and recovery combined. These results show that the spectrum of the NREM sleep EEG is substantially different among individuals, highly stable within individuals and robust to an experimental challenge (i.e. sleep deprivation) known to have considerable impact on the NREM sleep EEG. These findings indicate that the NREM sleep EEG represents a trait.

We examined 20 healthy individuals using the Sternberg's paradigm with increasing memory load (three, five, and seven words). The stimuli were four-letter words. Artifact-free 5-s EEG segments during retention period were analyzed. The most significant finding was the increase in FD with the increase in memory load in temporal regions T3 and T4, and in parietal region Pz, while decrease in FD with increase in memory load was registered in frontal midline region Fz. Results point to increase in frontal midline (Fz) theta spectral power, decrease in alpha spectral power in parietal region-Pz, and increase in beta spectral power in T3 and T4 region with increase in memory load. Decrease in theta coherence within right hemisphere due to memory load was obtained. Alpha coherence increased in posterior regions with anterior decrease. Beta coherence increased in fronto-temporal regions. Source localization delineated theta activity increase in frontal midline region, alpha decrease in superior parietal region, and beta increase in superior temporal gyrus with increase in memory load. In conclusion, FD as a nonlinear measure may serve as a sensitive index for quantifying dynamical changes in EEG signals during AVSTM tasks.

Our method assumes that only a small number of brain sources are active throughout a measurement, where each of the sources exhibits focal (smooth but localized) characteristics in space, time and frequency. This structure is enforced through an expansion of the source current density into appropriate spatio-temporal basis functions in combination with sparsity constraints. This approach combines the main strengths of two existing methods, namely Sparse Basis Field Expansions (Haufe et al., 2011) and Time-Frequency Mixed-Norm Estimates (Gramfort et al., 2013). By adjusting the ratio between two regularization terms, STOUT is capable of trading temporal for spatial reconstruction accuracy and vice versa, depending on the requirements of specific analyses and the provided data. Due to allowing for non-stationary source activations, STOUT is particularly suited for the localization of event-related potentials (ERP) and other evoked brain activity. We demonstrate its performance on simulated ERP data for varying signal-to-noise ratios and numbers of active sources. Our analysis of the generators of visual and auditory evoked N200 potentials reveals that the most active sources originate in the temporal and occipital lobes, in line with the literature on sensory processing.

We computed sleep behavioral (macro-sleep architectural) features and sleep spectral (micro-sleep architectural) features in order to observe if the annotated EEG data can be used to distinguish between good and bad sleepers in a more quantitative manner. Specifically, the macro-sleep features were defined by sleep stages and included sleep transitions, percentage of time spent in each sleep stage, and duration of time spent in each sleep stage. The micro-sleep features were obtained from the power spectrum of the EEG signals by computing the total power across all channels and all frequencies, as well as the average power in each sleep stage and across different frequency bands. We found that while the scoring-independent micro features are significantly different between the two groups, the macro features are not able to significantly distinguish the two groups. The fact that the macro features computed from the scoring files cannot pick up the expected difference in the EEG signals raises the question as to whether human scoring of EEG signals is practical in assessing sleep quality.

Behavioral studies have shown that motion congruence facilitates interplay between visual and tactile stimuli, but the neural mechanisms underlying this interplay are not well understood. Neural oscillations play a role in motion processing and multisensory integration. They may also be crucial for visuotactile motion processing. In this electroencephalography study, we applied linear beamforming to examine the impact of visuotactile motion congruence on beta and gamma band activity (GBA) in visual and somatosensory cortices. Visual and tactile inputs comprised of gratings that moved either in the same or different directions. Participants performed a target detection task that was unrelated to motion congruence. While there were no effects in the beta band (13-21 Hz), the power of GBA (50-80 Hz) in visual and somatosensory cortices was larger for congruent compared with incongruent motion stimuli. This suggests enhanced bottom-up multisensory processing when visual and tactile gratings moved in the same direction. Supporting its behavioral relevance, GBA was correlated with shorter reaction times in the target detection task. We conclude that motion congruence plays an important role for the integrative processing of visuotactile stimuli in sensory cortices, as reflected by oscillatory responses in the gamma band.

The meditation practice of Zazen, like many other meditation practices, aims at disregarding intrusive thoughts while controlling body posture. It is an open monitoring meditation characterized by detached moment-to-moment awareness and reduced conceptual thinking and self-reference. Which brain areas differ in electric activity during Zazen compared to task-free resting? Since scalp electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms are reference-dependent, conclusions about the localization of active brain areas are ambiguous. Computing intracerebral source models from the scalp EEG data solves this problem. In the present study, we applied source modeling using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to 58-channel scalp EEG data recorded from 15 experienced Zen meditators during Zazen and no-task resting. Zazen compared to no-task resting showed increased alpha-1 and alpha-2 frequency activity in an exclusively right-lateralized cluster extending from prefrontal areas including the insula to parts of the somatosensory and motor cortices and temporal areas. Zazen also showed decreased alpha and beta-2 activity in the left angular gyrus and decreased beta-1 and beta-2 activity in a large bilateral posterior cluster comprising the visual cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the parietal cortex. The results include parts of the default mode network and suggest enhanced automatic memory and emotion processing, reduced conceptual thinking and self-reference on a less judgmental, i.e., more detached moment-to-moment basis during Zazen compared to no-task resting.

Cognitive task based networks differ horn resting-state networks and this is the first study to investigate effects or lithium on evoked and event-related beta oscillatory responses of patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: The study included 16 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder on lithium monotherapy, 22 euthymic medication-free patients with bipolar disorder and 21 healthy participants. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes were measured for each subject's averaged beta responses (14-28 Hz) in the 0-300 ms time window. Auditory simple and oddball paradigm were presented to obtain evoked and event-related beta oscillatory responses. Results: There were significant differences in beta oscillatory responses between groups (p=0.010). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed location (p=0.007), laterality X group (p=0.043) and stimulus X location (p=0.013) type effects. Serum lithium levels were correlated with beta responses. Limitations: The lithium group had higher number of previous episodes, suggesting that patients of the lithium were more severe cases than patients of the medication-free group. Discussion: Lithium stimulates neuroplastic cascades and beta oscillations become prominent during neuroplastic changes. Excessively enhanced beta oscillatory responses in the lithium-treated patients may be indicative of excessive activation of the neuron groups of the certain cognitive networks and dysfunctional GABAergic modulation during cognitive activity.

This paper concerns the diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG, which currently suffers from several cardinal problems: it heavily depends on assumptions, conditions and prior knowledge regarding the patient. Additionally, the diagnostic experiments take hours, and the accuracy of the analysis is low or unreliable. This article presents the "TFFO" (Time-Frequency transformation followed by Feature-Optimization), a novel approach for schizophrenia detection showing great success in classification accuracy with no false positives. The methodology is designed for single electrode recording, and it attempts to make the data acquisition process feasible and quick for most patients.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						EEG spectrum; Wavelet decomposition; power spectral ratio; epileptic seizure; coherence; phase synchrony	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE	This paper deals with the wavelet analysis method for seizure detection in EEG time series and coherence estimation. The main part of the paper presents the basic principles of signal decomposition in connection with the EEG frequency bands. Wavelet analysis method has been used for detection of seizure onset. The wavelet filtered signal is used for the computation of spectral power ratio. The results show that our method can identify pre seizure, seizure, post seizure and non seizure phases. When dealing with seizure detection and prediction problems it is important to identify seizure precursor dynamics and necessary to identify information about onset and spread of seizures. Therefore in the second part the coherence and phase synchrony during pre seizure, seizure, post seizure and non seizure are computed. We expect this method to provide more insight into dynamic aspects of the seizure generating process.	[Ravish, D. K.; Devi, S.

The processing method is based on sparse representation of electrode signals and complex-valued independent component analysis with a robust measure of sparseness. Combination of scalp topography, estimated dipole source location and spectral patterns of resulted ICs were used to k-means clustering and identification of near-equivalent ICs across subjects. Several frequency features were extracted from clustered ICs and individually submitted to k-nn classifier. The best resulted accuracy was 86.36% using (mean feature at R-parietal cluster. Eight pairs of features resulted in such accuracy. The method used in this study not only improves the participant's classification accuracy compared to reference analysis, but also better identifies the dynamic of brain source signals than time domain ICA algorithms.

Previously, their analysis was based on massive averaging of EEG responses. Advanced neurotechnology and optimized off-line analysis can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of sHFOs, eventually enabling single-trial analysis. Methods: The rationale for developing dedicated low-noise EEG technology for sHFOs is unfolded. Detailed recording procedures and tailored analysis principles are explained step-by-step. Source codes in Matlab and Python are provided as supplementary material online. Results: Combining synergistic hardware and analysis improvements, evoked sHFOs at around 600 Hz ('sigma-bursts') can be studied in single-trials. Additionally, optimized spatial filters increase the signal-to-noise ratio of components at about 1 kHz ('kappa-bursts') enabling their detection in non-invasive surface EEG. Conclusions: sHFOs offer a unique possibility to record evoked human cortical population spikes non-invasively. The experimental approaches and algorithms presented here enable also non-specialized EEG laboratories to combine measurements of conventional low-frequency EEG with the analysis of concomitant cortical population spike responses.

EEG biometric identification: a thorough exploration of the time-frequency domain	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interface (BCI); electroencephalogram (EEG); biometry; subject identification/verification	HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PERSON IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; MODEL	Objective. Although interest in using electroencephalogram (EEG) activity for subject identification has grown in recent years, the state of the art still lacks a comprehensive exploration of the discriminant information within it. This work aims to fill this gap, and in particular, it focuses on the time-frequency representation of the EEG. Approach. We executed qualitative and quantitative analyses of six publicly available data sets following a sequential experimentation approach. This approach was divided in three blocks analysing the configuration of the power spectrum density, the representation of the data and the properties of the discriminant information. A total of ten experiments were applied. Main results. Results show that EEG information below 40 Hz is unique enough to discriminate across subjects (a maximum of 100 subjects were evaluated here), regardless of the recorded cognitive task or the sensor location. Moreover, the discriminative power of rhythms follows a W-like shape between 1 and 40 Hz, with the central peak located at the posterior rhythm (around 10 Hz). This information is maximized with segments of around 2 s, and it proved to be moderately constant across montages and time. Significance. Therefore, we characterize how EEG activity differs across individuals and detail the optimal conditions to detect subject-specific information. This work helps to clarify the results of previous studies and to solve some unanswered questions. Ultimately, it will serve as guide for the design of future biometric systems.

Many methods have been proposed to remove OA from EEG recordings based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm. Often regression is performed in time or frequency domain by completely deleting the OA components. This can cause the overestimation of OA and the information loss of EEG, because EEG and electrooculogram (EOG) mix or spread bidirectionally. Furthermore, there exists a variety of noises, except for OA, and interference coupling in EEG, this also affects the OA removal performance, such as the robustness and anti-interference ability. Here, we propose a novel and generally applicable method, denoted as FKD, for removing OA from mixed EEG signals with the Fast Kernel Independent Component analysis (FastKICA) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In two cases of linear and nonlinear mixed models, many experiments are conducted with Brain Computer Interface (BCI) data set. The experiment results show that FKD has good performance comparing with other BBS-based OA removal methods, and it is more acceptable in actual BCI system.

In this paper, we present an integrated recorder chip that is part of a wireless system to record and process sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data for seizure detection and treatment. The recorder is designed based on a novel frequency-shaping architecture that offers competitive circuit specifications on power, noise, precision, and chronic stability. The design is fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. When measured at a 2.5kHz clock and 1.0V supply, the recorder can be switched between two bandwidths, where the lower bandwidth (50Hz) is for recording regular EEG data and the higher bandwidth (500Hz) is for recording high frequency oscillations [1]. The recorder is designed with a wide data dynamic range in order to avoid saturation from 50mV ambulatory motion artifacts when the gain of the active filter is set to 2V/V. The total power consumption is under 2.5 mu W/ch and the input-referred noise is 0.8 mu V from 150Hz and 1.4 mu V from 1-500Hz. A proof-of-concept prototype has been also developed to demonstrate that the recorder is insensitive to ambient interferences and movement artifacts in experiments.

Six healthy subjects were awakened from REM sleep in a within-subjects design with multiple naps, until a recall and a non-recall condition were obtained. Naps were scheduled in the early afternoon and were separated by 1 week. Topographical EEG data of the 5-min of REM sleep preceding each awakening were analyzed by power spectral analysis [Fast Fourier Transform (H-1)] and by a method to detect oscillatory activity [Better OSCillations (BOSC)]. Both analyses show that REC is associated to higher frontal theta activity (5-7 Hz) and theta oscillations (6.06 Hz) compared to NREC condition, but only the second comparison reached significance. Our pilot study provides support to the notion that sleep and wakefulness share similar EEG correlates of encoding in episodic memories, and supports the "state-like hypothesis": DR may depend on the physiological state related to the sleep stage from which the subject is awakened rather than on a stable individual EEG pattern.

Tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of large scale networks over this short time duration is a very challenging issue. Here, we tackle this problem by using dense electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during a picture naming task. We found that (i) the picture naming task can be divided into six brain network states (BNSs) characterized by significantly high synchronization of gamma (30-45 Hz) oscillations, (ii) fast transitions occur between these BNSs that last from 30 msec to 160 msec, (iii) based on the state of the art of the picture naming task, we consider that the spatial location of their nodes and edges, as well as the timing of transitions, indicate that each network can be associated with one or several specific function (from visual processing to articulation) and (iv) the comparison with previously-used approach aimed at localizing the sources showed that the network-based approach reveals networks that are more specific to the performed task. We speculate that the persistence of several brain regions in successive BNSs participates to fast and efficient information processing in the brain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the CCA method outperforms the traditional power spectral density analysis through multi-channel detection, it requires additionally pre-constructed reference signals of sine-cosine waves. It is likely to encounter overfitting in using a short time window since the reference signals include no features from training data. New method: We consider that a group of electroencephalogram (EEG) data trials recorded at a certain stimulus frequency on a same subject should share some common features that may bear the real SSVEP characteristics. This study therefore proposes a common feature analysis (CFA)-based method to exploit the latent common features as natural reference signals in using correlation analysis for SSVEP recognition. Results: Good performance of the CFA method for SSVEP recognition is validated with EEG data recorded from ten healthy subjects, in contrast to CCA and a multiway extension of CCA (MCCA). Comparison with existing methods: Experimental results indicate that the CFA method significantly outperformed the CCA and the MCCA methods for SSVEP recognition in using a short time window (i.e., less than 1 s). Conclusions: The superiority of the proposed CFA method suggests it is promising for the development of a real-time SSVEP-based BCI. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Additional mechanisms may include enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission as the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor actions of choline and increased acetylcholine synthesis accompanying CDP-choline administration may modulate brain oscillations underlying cognitive processes. This study utilizes electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers to evaluate COP-choline induction of an oscillatory response profile associated with nicotinic stimulation. Resting state EEG was acquired in 24 male volunteers administered low (500 mg) and moderate (1000 mg) doses of CDP-choline in a randomized placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Consistent with nicotinic agonist treatment, spectral analysis showed dose-dependent reductions in delta and increases in alpha oscillations, which were also accompanied by decreases in beta and gamma oscillatory activity. These findings support the posit that COP-choline cognitive enhancement involves multiple mechanisms including facilitated nicotinic cholinergic action. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cumulative effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on EEG oscillations and attention/working memory during subacute neurorehabilitation of traumatic brain injury	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Transcranial direct current stimulation; Traumatic brain injury, EEG oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROPLASTICITY; MECHANISMS; DEFICITS; CORTEX	Objective: To investigate in a randomized, double-blind design, cumulative effects of anodal tDCS on EEG oscillations and neuropsychological tests among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) undergoing subacute neurorehabilitation. Methods: Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to active (n = 13) or sham (n = 13) tDCS groups. EEGs were recorded at 6 different time points, assessing both immediate and cumulative effects of tDCS on EEG oscillations. Twenty minute sessions of 1 mA anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3, cathode placed at right supraorbital site, Fp2), were provided on 10 consecutive days. Neuropsychological tests were administered before and after the series of tDCS sessions. Results: Theta was significantly reduced for active tDCS patients following the first tDCS session. Delta decreased and alpha increased, both significantly, for the active tDCS group after 10 consecutive tDCS sessions. No significant changes were seen for sham group. Decreases in delta were significantly correlated with improved performance on neuropsychological tests for the active tDCS group to far greater degree than for the sham group. Participants in the active tDCS group who had excess slow EEG activity in their initial recordings showed greater improvement on neuropsychological tests than other groups. Conclusion: Results suggest that 10 anodal tDCS sessions may beneficially modulate regulation of cortical excitability for patients with TBI. Significance: EEG-guided tDCS warrants further investigation as a potential intervention for TBI during subacute neurorehabilitation. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Gait abnormalities are common and disabling in patients with MS with limited treatment options available. Emerging evidence suggests a role of prefrontal attention networks in modulating gait. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is known to enhance cortical excitability in stimulated cortex and its correlates. We investigated the effect of high-frequency left prefrontal rTMS on gait parameters in a 51-year-old Caucasian male with chronic relapsing/remitting MS with residual disabling attention and gait symptoms. Patient received 6Hz, rTMS at 90% motor threshold using figure of eight coil centered on.. 3 location (using 10-20 electroencephalography (EEG) lead localization system). GAITRite gait analysis system was used to collect objective gait measures before and after one session and in another occasion three consecutive daily sessions of rTMS. Two-tailed within subject repeated measure t-test showed significant enhancement in ambulation time, gait velocity, and cadence after three consecutive daily sessions of rTMS.

To date, most of the evidence is obtained by correlating bandpower fluctuations to specific target variables such as reaction times or task ratings, while the causal links between oscillatory activity and behavior remain less clear. Here, we propose to identify causal relationships by the statistical concept of Granger causality, and we investigate which methods are bests suited to reveal Granger causal links between the power of brain oscillations and experimental variables. As an alternative to testing such causal links on the sensor level, we propose to linearly combine the information contained in each sensor in order to create virtual channels, corresponding to estimates of underlying brain oscillations, the Granger-causal relations of which may be assessed. Such linear combinations of sensor can be given by source separation methods such as, for example, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or by the recently developed Source Power Correlation (SPoC) method. Here we compare Granger causal analysis on power dynamics obtained fromi) sensor directly, ii) spatial filtering methods that do not optimize for Granger causality (ICA and SPoC), and iii) a method that directly optimizes spatial filters to extract sources the power dynamics of which maximally Granger causes a given target variable. We refer to this method as Granger Causal Power Analysis (GrangerCPA). Using both simulated and real EEG recordings, we find that computing Granger causality on channel-wise spectral power suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio due to volume conduction, while all three multivariate approaches alleviate this issue. In real EEG recordings from subjects performing self-paced foot movements, all three multivariate methods identify neural oscillations with motor-related patterns at a similar performance level. In an auditory perception task, the application of GrangerCPA reveals significant Granger-causal links between alpha oscillations and reaction times in more subjects compared to conventional methods.

We aimed to investigate HFO correlates of different pathologic substrates in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and to examine the relation of HFOs with the anatomic location of the dysplastic lesion and surrounding tissue in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). MethodsWe studied consecutive patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) investigations with depth electrodes at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, between November 2004 and May 2013. Inclusion criteria were the following: a focal lesion documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); EEG recording at a 2,000Hz sampling rate; and seizures starting from depth electrode contacts placed in lesion and perilesional tissue. ResultsThirty-seven patients (13 FCD, 12 mesial temporal sclerosis, five cortical atrophy, three polymicrogyria, three nodular heterotopia, and one tuberous sclerosis) were included; 18 were women (median age 34). Ripples and fast ripples were found in all lesion types, except tuberous sclerosis, which showed no fast ripples. There was a significant difference in rates of ripples and fast ripples across different lesions (p<0.001), with higher rates in FCD, mesial temporal sclerosis, and nodular heterotopia than in atrophy, polymicrogyria, and tuberous sclerosis. Regarding patients with FCD, HFOs rates differed significantly across the three types of tissue (lesional, perilesional, and nonlesional; p<0.001), being higher within the borders of the MRI-visible dysplastic lesion, followed by the surrounding area, and rare in the remote cortex. SignificanceOur findings suggest that in patients who are all intractable, the HFO rates vary with different pathologies, and reflect different types of neuronal derangements. Our results also emphasize the potential usefulness of HFOs as an additional method to better define the extent of the epileptogenic dysplastic tissue in FCD.

EEG recordings obtained from 13 healthy individuals in the 25-45 age range were used in the study. Features obtained analysis of these records with Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) are evaluated by statistically. The increase in the luminance level of the neutral visual stimuli as a result of statistical findings are reflected in the EEG activity, when given a bright neutral visual stimuli, comparable rates of exchange between the first 0-200 ms and 200-400ms on the electrical activity in the brain across the bright neutral stimuli to be higher than originally neutral stimulus were observed. This study has an initial research on the issue.

Attention Modulates TMS-Locked Alpha Oscillations in the Visual Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; auditory attention; TMS-EEG; TMS-evoked potential; transcranial magnetic stimulation; visual attention	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; PERCEPTION; PHASE; EXCITABILITY	Cortical oscillations, such as 8 - 12 Hz alpha-band activity, are thought to subserve gating of information processing in the human brain. While most of the supporting evidence is correlational, causal evidence comes from attempts to externally drive ("entrain") these oscillations by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Indeed, the frequency profile of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) closely resembles that of oscillations spontaneously emerging in the same brain region. However, it is unclear whether TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are produced by the same neuronal mechanisms. If so, they should react in a similar manner to top-down modulation by endogenous attention. To test this prediction, we assessed the alpha-like EEG response to TMS of the visual cortex during periods of high and low visual attention while participants attended to either the visual or auditory modality in a cross-modal attention task. We observed a TMS-locked local oscillatory alpha response lasting several cycles after TMS(but not after sham stimulation). Importantly, TMS-locked alpha power was suppressed during deployment of visual relative to auditory attention, mirroring spontaneous alpha amplitudes. In addition, the early N40 TEP component, located at the stimulation site, was amplified by visual attention. The extent of attentional modulation for both TMS-locked alpha power and N40 amplitude did depend, with opposite sign, on the individual ability to modulate spontaneous alpha power at the stimulation site. We therefore argue that TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are of common neurophysiological origin, whereas the N40 TEP component may serve as an index of current cortical excitability at the time of stimulation.

However, compared to fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have much higher temporal resolution and provide a direct estimation of cortical activity. To date, MEG studies have applied ICA for separate frequency bands only, disregarding cross frequency couplings. In this study, we aimed to detect EEG-RS-independent-Ns and their interactions in all frequency bands. We applied exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography-ICA (eLORETA-ICA) to resting-state EEG data in 80 healthy subjects using five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma band) and found five RS-independent-Ns in alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Next, taking into account previous neuroimaging findings, five RS-independent-Ns were identified: (1) the visual network in alpha frequency band, (2) dual-process of visual perception network, characterized by a negative correlation between the right ventral visual pathway (VVP) in alpha and beta frequency bands and left posterior dorsal visual pathway (DVP) in alpha frequency band, (3) self referential processing network, characterized by a negative correlation between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in beta frequency band and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in alpha frequency band, (4) dual-process of memory perception network, functionally related to a negative correlation between the left VVP and the precuneus in alpha frequency band; and (5) sensorimotor network in beta and gamma frequency bands. We selected eLORETA-ICA which has many advantages over the other network visualization methods and overall findings indicate that eLORETA-ICA with EEG data can identify five RS-independent-Ns in their intrinsic frequency bands, and correct correlations within RS-independent-Ns.

While several studies have investigated gamma oscillations in ASD, none have examined resting gamma power across multiple brain regions. This study investigated resting gamma power using EEG in 15 boys with ASD and 18 age and intelligence quotient matched typically developing controls. We found a decrease in resting gamma power at right lateral electrodes in ASD. We further explored associations between gamma and ASD severity as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and found a negative correlation between SRS and gamma power. We believe that our findings give further support of gamma oscillations as a potential biomarker for ASD.

Methods: EEG recordings were obtained in dementia with Lewy bodies patients, Alzheimer's disease patients and controls, matched for age and sex (N = 66 for each group; 14 [21%] female; mean age: 70 years). We analyzed functional connectivity of band-filtered EEG time series using the phase lag index. Functional brain network topology was analyzed with the minimum spanning tree. Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test A, and Visual Association Test were used as cognitive measures. Results: Dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed lower connectivity strength in the alpha frequency band, compared to both controls and Alzheimer's disease patients (P < 0.001). Functional network topology in dementia with Lewy bodies patients was less efficient and contained less hubs (P < 0.01). Network characteristics in Alzheimer's disease patients were in between (but did not differ from) those of the other two groups. In dementia with Lewy bodies patients, lower alpha band phase lag index correlated with Visual Association Test scores and Trail Making Test scores (rho = 0.33 and rho = 0.31, respectively), whereas leaf fraction (a measure of 'network efficiency') correlated with Visual Association Test scores (rho = 0.29) and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (rho = 0.27). Conclusion: Functional networks of dementia with Lewy bodies patients are characterized by decreased connectivity strength and a loss of network efficiency and hubs. Severity of these disturbances is related to cognitive impairment, suggesting that network disturbances mediate between neuropathology and the clinical syndrome in dementia with Lewy bodies.

It is generally associated with coma of various etiologies (hypoxia, drug-related intoxication, hypothermia, and childhood encephalopathies, but also anesthesia). Animal studies suggest that both the cortex and the thalamus are involved in the generation of BS. However, very little is known about mechanisms of BS in humans. The aim of this study was to identify the neuronal network underlying both burst and suppression phases using source reconstruction and analysis of functional and effective connectivity in EEG. Material/Methods Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) was applied to EEG segments of 13 neonates and infants with burst and suppression EEG pattern. The brain area with the strongest power in the analyzed frequency (1-4 Hz) range was defined as the reference region. DICS was used to compute the coherence between this reference region and the entire brain. The renormalized partial directed coherence (RPDC) was used to describe the informational flow between the identified sources. Results/Conclusion Delta activity during the burst phases was associated with coherent sources in the thalamus and brainstem as well as bilateral sources in cortical regions mainly frontal and parietal, whereas suppression phases were associated with coherent sources only in cortical regions. Results of the RPDC analyses showed an upwards informational flow from the brainstem towards the thalamus and from the thalamus to cortical regions, which was absent during the suppression phases. These findings may support the theory that a "cortical deafferentiation" between the cortex and sub-cortical structures exists especially in suppression phases compared to burst phases in burst suppression EEGs. Such a deafferentiation may play a role in the poor neurological outcome of children with these encephalopathies.

This paper proposes an efficient and low-complexity method for seizure prediction. The univariate feature of line length can describe both amplitude and frequency variations of an EEG signal, and the bivariate feature of mean phase coherence (MPC) is able to quantify phase synchronization between EEG signals recorded from two different channels. The two features are combined to characterize the behavior of EEG signals. The Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) algorithm is used as classifier to decide the feature samples. The smoothing and threshold process for the outputs of the BLDA classifier can reduce incorrect decisions further. This method has been evaluated on the publicly available EEG dataset and achieved the acceptable sensitivity of 86.36% with the false prediction rate of 0.04/h. The low computational burden of this method makes it suitable for the real-time processing in clinical practice.

EEG-BASED EMOTION RECOGNITION USING ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES	EMOTION RECOGNITION: A PATTERN ANALYSIS APPROACH			English	Article; Book Chapter							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ASYMMETRY; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMITATION	The direct association of the EEG signal to the activation of the brain, related to the emotion elicitation and expression, makes it a suitable field to structure effective EEG-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) systems. EEG-ER is a relatively new research area within the Affective Computing (AC) field; hence, a number of issues should be taken under consideration for further justification, during the design of an EEG-ER system. This chapter, by employing advanced signal processing techniques, sheds light upon two main issues of the EEG-ER field, that is, the aspect of quantitatively estimating the degree of emotion elicitation in subjects under suitable stimuli (affective images) and the overall enhancement of the EEG-ER systems performance by introducing new feature vectors. In particular, the use of brain functional concepts, that is, the activation of the Mirror Neuron System and the asymmetry in the brain activity under emotion stimulation, to evaluate the emotion-related content of an EEG signal is described. This includes sophisticated signal processing tools with robust mathematical background, drawn from the field of Multidimensional Directed Information Analysis, resulting in an "emotion-based segmentation" of the related EEG data. Moreover, novel feature extraction algorithms, structured in the time (Higher Order Crossings) and/or time-frequency domains (Empirical Mode Decomposition), are presented, along with their application to experimental EEG data, collected from subjects emotionally stimulated by two elicitation protocols (Facial Expressions and Affective Pictures). The chapter concludes by pointing out the potential of the proposed approaches toward efficient EEG-ER systems and discusses some future directions of research for the EEG-ER task.

In this paper, we use the Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) method to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from control and alcoholic observers who watched two different pictures. We examined the intrinsic mode function (IMF) based energy distribution features of FP1, FP2, and Fz EEG signals in the time and frequency domains for alcoholics. The HHT-based characteristics of the IMFs, the instantaneous frequencies, and the time-frequency-energy distributions of the IMFs of the clinical FP1, FP2, and Fz EEG signals recorded from normal and alcoholic observers who watched two different pictures were analyzed. We observed that the number of peak amplitudes of the alcoholic subjects is larger than that of the control. In addition, the Pearson correlation coefficients of the IMFs, and the energy-IMF distributions of the clinical FP1, FP2, and Fz EEG signals recorded from normal and alcoholic observers were analyzed. The analysis results show that the energy ratios of IMF4, IMF5, and IMF7 waves of the normal observers to the refereed total energy were larger than 10 %, respectively. In addition, the energy ratios of IMF3, IMF4, and IMF5 waves of the alcoholic observers to the refereed total energy were larger than 10 %. The FP1 and FP2 waves of the normal observers, the FP1 and FP2 waves of the alcoholic observers, and the FP1 and Fz waves of the alcoholic observers demonstrated extremely high correlations. On the other hand, the FP1 waves of the normal and alcoholic observers, the FP1 wave of the normal observer and the FP2 wave of the alcoholic observer, the FP1 wave of the normal observer and the Fz wave of the alcoholic observer, the FP2 waves of the normal and alcoholic FP2 observers, and the FP2 wave of the normal observer and the Fz wave of the alcoholic observer demonstrated extremely low correlations. The IMF4 of the FP1 and FP2 signals of the normal observer, and the IMF5 of the FP1 and FP2 signals of the alcoholic observer were correlated. The IMF4 of the FP1 signal of the normal observer and that of the FP2 signal of the alcoholic observer as well as the IMF5 of the FP1 signal of the normal observer and that of the FP2 signal of the alcoholic observer exhibited extremely low correlations. In this manner, our experiment leads to a better understanding of the HHT-based IMFs features of FP1, FP2, and Fz EEG signals in alcoholism. The analysis results show that the energy ratios of the wave of an alcoholic observer to its refereed total energy for IMF4, and IMF5 in the delta band for FP1, FP2, and Fz channels were larger than those of the respective waves of the normal observer. The alcoholic EEG signals constitute more than 1 % of the total energy in the d wave, and the reaction times were 0_4, 4_8, 8_12, and 12_16s. For normal EEG signals, more than 1 % of the total energy is distributed in the d wave, with a reaction time 0 to 4 s. We observed that the alcoholic subject reaction times were slower than those of the normal subjects, and the alcoholic subjects could have experienced a cognitive error. This phenomenon is due to the intoxicated central nervous systems of the alcoholic subjects.

Still, interictal spikes, i.e. transient activity, remain a classical marker. A difficult question is to separate these two classes of activity that overlap in the time-frequency plane. We propose to use a temporal basis set in order to describe and subtract spiking activity from the traces, as a preprocessing step for further space-time-frequency analysis. The set is based on singular value decomposition. We select the first three temporal components, construct a model of the spikes by projecting the data on the new basis and obtain a spike-free signal by subtracting the model from the original signal. We prove that despikifying results in a better characterization of oscillatory activity, promoting time and frequency separation. The resulting spatio-temporal maps could help for a better characterization of the oscillatory activity in electrophysiology of epilepsy.

Less is known, however, about the relationships between LRTC and proneness to engage in depression-related cognitive emotion regulation (ER) strategies which characterize both clinically and subclinically depressed (SBD) people. In this study we applied detrended fluctuation analysis to the amplitude envelope of broad band, theta band, and alpha band spontaneous EEG oscillations of a group of SBD individuals and a group of non-depressed individuals (both groups from a sample of healthy adults, N = 120), to whom brooding and thought suppression questionnaires were administered. Between-groups differences were not found for any band scaling exponents at any brain location, but linear correlations pointed out several associations between exponents at frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital sites and maladaptive ER strategies. These results suggest that alterations in brain dynamics are related with the proneness that depressive individuals show to engage in brooding and thought suppression in order to cognitively regulate their emotions.

It has been related to visual processing, attentional selection and object coherence, respectively. Here we tested the interaction of alpha oscillations of the human brain with visual search tasks that differed in their attentional demands (pre-attentive vs. attentive) and also in the necessity to establish object coherence (conjunction vs. single feature). Between pre- and post-assessment elderly subjects received 20 min/d of repetitive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the occipital cortex adjusted to their individual alpha frequency over five consecutive days. Compared to sham the entrained alpha oscillations led to a selective, set size independent improvement in the conjunction search task performance but not in the easy or in the hard feature search task. These findings suggest that cortical alpha oscillations play a specific role in establishing object coherence through suppression of distracting objects.

Six patients performed a demanding covert visual attention task while we simultaneously recorded brain activity from deep-brain electrodes implanted in the nucleus accumbens and the surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Both theta and alpha oscillations were strongly coherent with the frontal and parietal EEG during the task. Theta-band coherence increased during processing of the visual stimuli. Granger causality analysis revealed that the nucleus accumbens was communicating with the neocortex primarily in the theta-band, while the cortex was communicating the nucleus accumbens in the alpha-band. These data are consistent with a model, in which theta-and alpha-band oscillations serve dissociable roles: Prior to stimulus processing, the cortex might suppress ongoing processing in the nucleus accumbens by modulating alpha-band activity. Subsequently, upon stimulus presentation, theta oscillations might facilitate the active exchange of stimulus information from the nucleus accumbens to the cortex.

Quantification of Interictal Neuromagnetic Activity in Absence Epilepsy with Accumulated Source Imaging	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Childhood absence epilepsy; Magnetoencephalography; High frequency oscillation; Magnetic source imaging; Seizure	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG; CHILDHOOD; MEG; SEIZURES; HZ; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; MECHANISMS	Aberrant brain activity in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) during seizures has been well recognized as synchronous 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges on electroencephalography. However, brain activity from low- to very high-frequency ranges in subjects with CAE between seizures (interictal) has rarely been studied. Using a high-sampling rate magnetoencephalography (MEG) system, we studied ten subjects with clinically diagnosed but untreated CAE in comparison with age- and gender-matched controls. MEG data were recorded from all subjects during the resting state. MEG sources were assessed with accumulated source imaging, a new method optimized for localizing and quantifying spontaneous brain activity. MEG data were analyzed in nine frequency bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), low-gamma (30-55 Hz), high-gamma (65-90 Hz), ripple (90-200 Hz), high-frequency oscillation (HFO, 200-1,000 Hz), and very high-frequency oscillation (VHFO, 1,000-2,000 Hz). MEG source imaging revealed that subjects with CAE had higher odds of interictal brain activity in 200-1,000 and 1,000-2,000 Hz in the parieto-occipito-temporal junction and the medial frontal cortices as compared with controls. The strength of the interictal brain activity in these regions was significantly elevated in the frequency bands of 90-200, 200-1,000 and 1,000-2,000 Hz for subjects with CAE as compared with controls. The results indicate that CAE has significantly aberrant brain activity between seizures that can be noninvasively detected. The measurements of high-frequency neuromagnetic oscillations may open a new window for investigating the cerebral mechanisms of interictal abnormalities in CAE.

In particular, beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations were repeatedly found to be disturbed in schizophrenia and linked to clinical symptoms. However, it remains unknown whether abnormalities in current source density (CSD) and lagged phase synchronization of oscillations across distributed regions of the brain already occur in patients with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Methods: To further elucidate this issue, we assessed resting-state EEG data of 63 ARMS patients and 2(healthy controls (HC). Twenty-three ARMS patients later made a transition to psychosis (ARMS-T) and 40 did not (ARMS-NT). CSD and lagged phase synchronization of neural oscillations across brain areas were assessed using eLORETA and their relationships to neurocognitive deficits and clinical symptoms were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Results: ARMS-T patients showed higher gamma activity in the medial prefrontal cortex compared to HC, which was associated with abstract reasoning abilities in ARMS-T. Furthermore, in ARMS-T patients lagged phase synchronization of beta oscillations decreased more over Euclidian distance compared to ARMS-NT and HC. Finally, this steep spatial decrease of phase synchronicity was most pronounced in ARMS-T patients with high positive and negative symptoms scores. Conclusions: These results indicate that patients who will later make the transition to psychosis are characterized by impairments in localized and synchronized neural oscillations providing new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenic psychoses and may be used to improve the prediction of psychosis.

Linear and non-linear brain-heart and brain-brain interactions during sleep	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						physiological networks; transfer entropy; multivariate time series	RATE-VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY BANDS; TRANSFER ENTROPY; TIME; EEG; NIGHT; COMPONENTS; ALPHA; POWER; LINK	In this study, the physiological networks underlying the joint modulation of the parasympathetic component of heart rate variability (HRV) and of the different electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms during sleep were assessed using two popular measures of directed interaction in multivariate time series, namely Granger causality (GC) and transfer entropy (TE). Time series representative of cardiac and brain activities were obtained in 10 young healthy subjects as the normalized high frequency (HF) component of HRV and EEG power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands, measured during the whole duration of sleep. The magnitude and statistical significance of GC and TE were evaluated between each pair of series, conditional on the remaining series, using respectively a linear model-based approach exploiting regression models, and a nonlinear model-free approach combining nearestneighbor entropy estimation with a procedure for dimensionality reduction. The contribution of nonlinear dynamics to the TE was also assessed using surrogate data. GC and TE consistently detected structured networks of physiological interactions, with links directed predominantly from HRV to the EEG waves in the brain-heart network, and from the sigma and beta EEG waves to the delta,theta, and alpha waves in the brain-brain network. While these common patterns supported the suitability of a linear model-based analysis, we also found a significant contribution of nonlinear dynamics, particularly involving the information transferred out of the delta node in the two networks. This suggested the importance of nonparametric TE estimation for evidencing the fine structure of the physiological networks underlying the autonomic regulation of cardiac and brain functions during sleep.

We study infraslow activity (<0.1 Hz) in 41 patients with postanoxic coma after cardiac arrest, including the relationship between infraslow activity and EEG power in the 3-30 Hz range, using continuous full-band scalp EEG. In all patients, infraslow activity (0.015-0.06 Hz) was present, irrespective of neurological outcome or EEG activity in the conventional frequency bands. In two patients, low-amplitude (10-30 mu V) infraslow activity was present while the EEG showed no rhythmic activity above 0.5 Hz. In 13/15 patients with a good outcome and 20/26 patients with a poor one, EEG power in the 3-30 Hz frequency range was correlated with the phase of infraslow activity, quantified by the modulation index. In 9/14 patients with burst-suppression with identical bursts, bursts appeared in clusters, phase-locked to the infraslow oscillations. This is substantiated by a simulation of burst-suppression in a minimal computational model. Infraslow activity is preserved in postanoxic encephalopathy and modulates cortical excitability. The strongest modulation is observed in patients with severe postanoxic encephalopathy and burst-suppression with identical bursts.	[van Putten, Michel J. A.

Epileptic Seizure Prediction and Identification of Epileptogenic Region using EEG Signal	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREEN COMPUTING AND INTERNET OF THINGS (ICGCIOT)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things (ICGCIoT)	OCT 08-10, 2015	GALGOTIAS Educ Inst, Greater Noida, INDIA	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE UP Sect India, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Malaysia Chapter, Inst Neural Network Soc	GALGOTIAS Educ Inst	coherence; correlation; electro encephalo gram (EEG); epilepsy; seizure		This paper presents a method to predict an epileptic seizure using synchrony analysis of EEG signals. The topographical map of the brain is divided into different regions and synchrony measures are computed between these different regions to identify the region responsible for epileptic seizure. The molecular and biochemical process of seizure generation during pre-ictal period is essential for seizure to start and this property has been investigated here in EEG signals to predict the onset of epileptic seizure. Particular region of the brain responsible for seizure is identified by pairing the EEG signals from different regions of brain and identifying the changes in synchrony measures corresponding to those regions. Two synchrony measures one from time domain, correlation, and other from frequency domain, coherence, are used in this work to validate the observations. Coherence and correlation increases in pre-ictal state and hence seizure onset can be predicted in advance. The results shows that epileptogenic region of the brain can also be identified.

High level of dynamism in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal reasons us to look toward evolutionary algorithm (EA). Motivated by these two facts, in this work a hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering technique has been used to distinguish two class motor imagery (MI) tasks. The proposed hybrid GA-PSO based K means clustering is found to outperform genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based K-means clustering techniques in terms of both accuracy and execution time. The lesser execution time of hybrid GA-PSO technique makes it suitable for real time BCI application. Time frequency representation (TFR) techniques have been used to extract the feature of the signal under investigation. TFRs based features are extracted and relying on the concept of event related synchronization (ERD) and desynchronization (ERD) feature vector is formed.

Hypoglycemia-Associated Changes in the Electroencephalogram in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Normal Hypoglycemia Awareness or Unawareness	DIABETES			English	Article							INSULIN-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA; IMPAIRED AWARENESS; AUTONOMIC FAILURE; MELLITUS; GLUCOSE; ADULTS; FREQUENCY; RECOVERY; SYMPTOMS; EEG	Hypoglycemia is associated with increased activity in the low-frequency bands in the electroencephalogram (EEG). We investigated whether hypoglycemia awareness and unawareness are associated with different hypoglycemia-associated EEG changes in patients with type 1 diabetes. Twenty-four patients participated in the study: 10 with normal hypoglycemia awareness and 14 with hypoglycemia unawareness. The patients were studied at normoglycemia (5-6 mmol/L) and hypoglycemia (2.0-2.5 mmol/L), and during recovery (5-6 mmol/L) by hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. During each 1-h period, EEG, cognitive function, and hypoglycemia symptom scores were recorded, and the counterregulatory hormonal response was measured. Quantitative EEG analysis showed that the absolute amplitude of the theta band and alpha-theta band up to doubled during hypoglycemia with no difference between the two groups. In the recovery period, the theta amplitude remained increased. Cognitive function declined equally during hypoglycemia in both groups and during recovery reaction time was still prolonged in a subset of tests. The aware group reported higher hypoglycemia symptom scores and had higher epinephrine and cortisol responses compared with the unaware group. In patients with type 1 diabetes, EEG changes and cognitive performance during hypoglycemia are not affected by awareness status during a single insulin-induced episode with hypoglycemia.

Empirically Assessing Minimum Usable DAQ Performance for Highly Fieldable EEG Systems	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, AC 2015	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Augmented Cognition (AC) Held as Part of 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International)	AUG 02-07, 2015	Los Angeles, CA					Electroencephalography (EEG) as a physiological assessment technique holds high promise for on-line monitoring of cognitive states. Examples include detecting when a user is overly fatigued, if they are paying attention to a target item, or even detecting sub-conscious object recognition, all of which can be used for greatly enhanced human-system interaction. However, because EEG involves measuring extremely small voltage fluctuations (microvolts) against a potential background that is very large (milivolts), conventional EEG data acquisition (DAQ) systems utilize very high-resolution components, such as low-noise amplifiers and 24-bit sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) on the ideal premise of acquiring a maximal resolution signal to guarantee information content from the data. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of high power consumption and requires expensive system components. We hypothesize that, for many targeted research applications, this level of resolution may not be necessary, and that by intelligently allowing a reduction in the signal fidelity, substantial savings in cost and power consumption can be obtained. To date though a pragmatic minimum resolution remains unexplored. Here, we discuss the utility of using a parametric approach of simulating signal degradation analogous to decreasing ADC bit (vertical) resolution and amplifier fidelity. Results derived from classification of both drowsiness (alpha oscillation) and oddity (P300) detection show strong overall robustness to poor-quality signals, such that classifier performance remains unaffected until resolution is well outside of typical recording specifications. These observations suggest that researchers and system designers should carefully consider that resolution trade-offs for power and cost are entirely reasonable for targeted applications, enabling feasibility of ultra-low power or highly fieldable data collection systems in the near future.

In the experiment, 10 AS adults (2 females, age 19.6 +/- 1.96) and 10 IQ-matched controls (3 females, age 24.4 +/- 3.24) participated in tasks involving emotionality evaluation of either photograph or line-drawing faces. Emotional faces elicited comparable reaction times and evaluation scores between the two groups. In the photograph task, the AS group had no visible N400 component and lower deltaltheta synchronization (350-450 ms post-stimulus onset) in the temporal and occipital-parietal regions, and much weaker phase synchronization between distant scalp regions (200-500 ms post-stimulus onset) compared with the control group. In the line-drawing task, the two groups had the same degree of delta/theta synchronization in the central and occipital-parietal regions and comparable phase synchronization between scalp regions. We conclude by hypothesizing that AS patients might have structural deficits in the amygdala and its related limbic structures, a site critical for recognition of emotional faces beyond conscious awareness, but that they preserve the intact function in the cognitive pathway to keep up comparable behavioral performances with the healthy controls through voluntary control of attention.

However, conventional BCIs are still lacking in terms of high computational complexity, less accuracy due to Fourier phase suppression and lack of substantial conclusion for depression diagnosis. An automated, EEG-based depression diagnostic and management tool is proposed to overcome these limitations. Channel eventrelated potentials, cross-coherence and power spectra plots in MATLAB are quantified and studied as an outcome to map real-time, emotion-specific multichannel EEG data set into distinct emotional states. A fast and stable fourth-order statistics-based independent component analysis is incorporated to reject temporal/spatial artefacts. Increases in frontal alpha (8-13 Hz) and delta (0.5-4 Hz) power/coherence are during depressed and normal/relaxed states, respectively. Devotional music (relaxed state) is found to facilitate depression elimination. Results are found to be statistically significant across all subjects with minimal p-values. Hence, it has been inferred that the proposed model has the potential to aid early and accurate depression diagnostic and management process.

Ceftriaxone reverses ketamine-induced lasting EEG and astrocyte alterations in juvenile mice	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Ketamine; Mouse; EEG; Glia; EAAT2	INCREASES GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS; UP-REGULATION; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN-INJURY; CLUB DRUGS; TRANSPORTER; OSCILLATIONS; EXPRESSION; CORTEX	Background: Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is used as a pediatric anesthetic because of its favorable safety profile. It is also being investigated as an antidepressant. Unfortunately, ketamine causes adverse reactions including hallucinations and is associated with a high prevalence of abuse among adolescents. Although chronic ketamine use has been shown to produce cognitive impairments even years following cessation, little is known about its long-term consequences on adolescents. The beta-lactam ceftriaxone has been shown to attenuate alcohol withdrawal, and alleviate early brain injury and memory impairments following subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, its ability to reverse the effects of adolescent ketamine exposure is not known. Previous data indicate that ketamine causes a reduction in the number of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter Type 2 (EAAT2)-containing astrocytes. Additionally, the beta lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone increased expression of EAAT2. As EAAT2 is a principal mechanism of glutamate clearance from the synapse, the current study tests the hypothesis that ceftriaxone may reverse functional consequences of ketamine exposure. Methods: We examined the effects of chronic ketamine in juvenile mice as well as reversal by ceftriaxone using electroencephalography (EEG). Subsequently, we assessed the effects of these treatments on markers of astrocyte proliferation, using Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), and function, as evidenced by EAAT2. Results: juvenile mice exposed to chronic ketamine showed lasting alterations in EEG measurements as well as markers of astrocyte number and function. These alterations were reversed by ceftriaxone. Conclusions: Data suggest that ceftriaxone may be able to ameliorate ketamine-induced long-term disturbances in adolescent brains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The amplitudes show scaling from 2 to 500 seconds (depending on the considered band) with large fluctuation exponents during (nocturnal) wakefulness (0.73-0.83) and small ones during deep sleep (0.50-0.69). Light sleep is similar to deep sleep, while REM sleep (0.64-0.76) is closer to wakefulness except for the EEG. band. Some of the frequency time series also show long-term scaling, depending on the selected bands and stages.

The impact of dual tasking on cognitive performance in a Parkinson's disease cohort with and without freezing of gait: an EEG and behavioral based approach	2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 22-24, 2015	Montpellier, FRANCE	IEEE, EMBS			OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; WALKING	Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling gait disorder in late stage Parkinson's disease (PD), which can lead to falls and loss of independence. To date, the mechanisms causing FOG are still unknown and no treatment has proven to be effective. In this study, sixteen PD participants with and without clinically confirmed FOG symptoms were recruited, referred to as FOG+ and FOG-, respectively. All participants navigated through a customized virtual reality (VR) corridor by stepping in place (SIP) on a force plate while electroencephalography (EEG) data was recorded. The VR environment was combined with a cognitive, visual two-stimulus oddball response task, which was repeated while seated to allow for comparisons to the SIP condition. The VR environment proved to be a reliable tool to elicit FOG like symptoms in a clinical test environment. EEG recordings were compared between conditions (seated/SIP) within groups and behavioral performance was compared between groups and conditions for qualitative differences. In the seated condition FOG+ participants showed similar behavioral performance to FOG-participants, however, in the SIP condition the FOG+ group showed significantly decreased performance with longer reaction times and more target misses. Analysis of the EEG data revealed consistent visual responses to the stimuli, but an absence of the P3b component in stimulus-locked brain responses for FOG+ participants and both conditions. However, if data is response-locked, the P3b component is clearly visible for both conditions, supporting the theory that components related to decision making and motor preparation are present, but with variable delays.

Epoch-based Entropy for Early Screening of Alzheimer's Disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; EEG signal; complexity measures; entropy; hidden Markov models; stationary multichannel epochs	EEG BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; DYNAMICAL ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; COHERENCE; COMPUTATION; ATROPHY; EEG/MEG; MODELS	In this paper, we introduce a novel entropy measure, termed epoch-based entropy. This measure quantifies disorder of EEG signals both at the time level and spatial level, using local density estimation by a Hidden Markov Model on inter-channel stationary epochs. The investigation is led on a multi-centric EEG database recorded from patients at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched healthy subjects. We investigate the classification performances of this method, its robustness to noise, and its sensitivity to sampling frequency and to variations of hyperparameters. The measure is compared to two alternative complexity measures, Shannon's entropy and correlation dimension. The classification accuracies for the discrimination of AD patients from healthy subjects were estimated using a linear classifier designed on a development dataset, and subsequently tested on an independent test set. Epoch-based entropy reached a classification accuracy of 83% on the test dataset (specificity = 83.3%, sensitivity = 82.3%), outperforming the two other complexity measures. Furthermore, it was shown to be more stable to hyperparameter variations, and less sensitive to noise and sampling frequency disturbances than the other two complexity measures.

However, the location of neurologic impairment cannot be determined from SEPs. Previous studies imply that the time-frequency characteristics of SEPs may reflect the location of the spinal cord injury. To validate the hypothesis that time-frequency patterns of SEPs are associated with the location of neurologic deficits in the spinal cord, we studied the time-frequency distributions of SEPs at different injury levels. Twenty-four rats were equally divided into one normal group and three injury groups, in which weight-drop contusions were delivered to the spinal cord of the rats at C4, C5, or C6 level, respectively. By comparing the time-frequency patterns of SEPs across groups, we found significant differences in several time-frequency regions of interest in the time-frequency distributions of the normal group and the injury groups. Importantly, the regions of interest were different across injury groups, suggesting that these regions of interest could be specific to injury locations. The results imply that changes of the time-frequency patterns of SEPs may be related to the location of the spinal cord injury.

In this study we assessed energy and task related phase locking of event-related oscillation (EROs), behavioral responses, measures of IQ and personality, and expected responses to alcohol in a large sample of individuals with LVEEG compared to those with higher voltage variants. Participants (n = 762) were recruited from a Native American community and completed a diagnostic interview, the Quick Test, the Subjective High Assessment Scale Expectation Version (SHAS-E) and the Maudsley Personality Inventory. Clinical and spectral analyzed EEGs were collected for determination of the presence of a LVEEG variant. EROs were generated using a facial expression recognition task. Participants with LVEEG (n = 451) were significantly more likely to be older, married and have higher degrees of Native American heritage but did not differ in gender, income or education. Individuals with LVEEG were also found to have decreased energy in their alpha EROs, increased phase locking between stimulus trials, and increased phase-locking between cortical brain areas. No significant differences in the cognitive tests, personality variables or alcohol dependence or anxiety diagnoses were found, however, individuals with LVEEG did report a larger number of drinks ever consumed in a 24-h period and a less intense expected response to alcohol. These data suggest that alpha power in the resting EEG is highly associated with energy and cortical connectivity measures generated by event-related stimuli, as well as potentially increased risk for alcohol use.

Current theories of visual search postulate an early stage of feature extraction interacting with an attentional process that selects candidate targets for further analysis; in difficult search situations, this selection is iterated until the target is found. Although such theories predict an intrinsic periodicity in the neuronal substrates of attentional search, this prediction has not been extensively tested in human electrophysiology. Here, using EEG and TMS, we study attentional periodicities in visual search. EEG measurements indicated that successful and unsuccessful search trials were associated with different amounts of poststimulus oscillatory amplitude and phase-locking at similar to 6 Hz and opposite prestimulus oscillatory phase at similar to 6 Hz. A trial-bytrial comparison of pre- and poststimulus similar to 6 Hz EEG phases revealed that the functional interplay between prestimulus brain states, poststimulus oscillations, and successful search performance was mediated by a partial phase reset of ongoing oscillations. Independently, TMS applied over occipital cortex at various intervals after search onset demonstrated a periodic pattern of interference at similar to 6 Hz. The converging evidence from independent TMS and EEG measurements demonstrates that attentional search is modulated periodically by brain oscillations. This periodicity is naturally compatible with a sequential exploration by attention, although a parallel but rhythmically modulated attention spotlight cannot be entirely ruled out.

Pure manual scoring is time-consuming and commercial scoring software is costly. We present a LabVIEW-based, semi-automated scoring routine using recorded EEG and EMG signals. This scoring routine is designed to reliably assign the vigilance/sleep states wakefulness (WAKE), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) to defined EEG/EMG episodes. straightforward to use even for beginners in the field of sleep research. freely available upon request. Chronic recordings from mice were used to design and evaluate the scoring routine consisting of an artifact removal, a scoring- and a rescoring routine. The scoring routine processes EMG and different EEG frequency bands. Amplitude-based thresholds for EEG and EMG parameters trigger a decision tree assigning each EEG episode to a defined vigilance/sleep state automatically. Using the rescoring routine individual episodes or particular state transitions can be re-evaluated manually. High agreements between auto-scored and manual sleep scoring could be shown for experienced scorers and for beginners quickly and reliably. With small modifications to the software, it can be easily adapted for sleep analysis in other animal models. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Kreuzer, M.; Kochs, E.

Two temporally and physiologically dissociable neural patterns prior to errors, i.e., pre-stimulus alpha (8-13 Hz) power indicative of sustained attention and post-stimulus N2 amplitude indicative of cognitive control, have been widely (but independently) reported in many studies. However, it is still largely unknown whether these two neural mechanisms for error commission exist in a single task at the same time and, if so, whether they can be probed simultaneously and how they lead to response accuracy (collectively or separately). To this end, we measured high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a color-word matching Stroop task. We quantified both patterns on EEG data from individual stimulus condition (congruent or incongruent), as well as on pooled data from both conditions. Enhanced pre-stimulus alpha power for errors was identified over the parieto-occipital area in the congruent condition and the pooled data. Reduced post-stimulus N2 amplitude was only revealed in the incongruent condition. More importantly, for the first time, a balanced interaction between these two EEG patterns was revealed in correct trials, but not in error trials. These findings suggest that errors in one task could occur due to distinct neural mechanisms, e.g., poor sustained attention, poor cognitive control, or missed balance between these two. The present results further suggest that the detection of neural patterns related to different neural mechanisms could be complicated by other modulation factors, such as stimulus condition. Therefore, more than one neural marker should be simultaneously monitored to effectively predict imminent errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thirty-nine children and their parents visited the research lab before, after, and a year after treatment ended. During those lab visits, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during a challenging Go/No-go task. Treatment consisted of intensive 14-week combined cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training sessions. For the analysis, participants were divided into long-term improvers (IMPs) and long-term nonimprovers (NIMPs) based on changes in their externalizing problem scores. The results showed early no-go theta power (4-8Hz, 100-250ms) decreased for long-term IMPs compared to NIMPs. When participants were divided based on changes in their comorbid internalizing symptoms, effects were stronger and reductions in theta power were found for early as well as later phases (250-650ms). We provided preliminary evidence that theta power is a useful neural measure to trace behavioral change linked to improved self-regulation even up to a year after treatment ended. Results may have implications for the characterization of children with disruptive behavior problems and may lead to the development of novel markers of treatment success.

EEG abnormalities was observed in brain cortex of patients with OCD. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Dipol Approximation Method (FFTDA), used for source localization and superior to conventional FFT method, has also been used for measurement of the level of EEG synchronization. In this research, phase differences between cortical neural oscillations was computed by using FFTDA. Then, analysis of 19 channel EEG series, collected with international 10-20 electrode placement system, shows the loss of Theta band phase synchronization in patients with OCD.

Here we aimed to investigate the development of this phenomenon in infancy. We elicited arm and leg actions from 12-month-old infants and presented them, and a control group of adults, with videos of arm and leg actions while we measured their sensorimotor alpha suppression using EEG. Sensorimotor alpha suppression during action execution was somatotopically organised in 12-month-old infants: there was more suppression over the arm areas when infants performed reaching actions, and more suppression over the leg area when they performed kicking actions. Adults also showed somatotopically-organised activation during the observation of reaching and kicking actions. In contrast, infants did not show somatotopically-organised activation during action observation, but instead activated the arm areas when observing both reaching and kicking actions. We suggest that the somatotopic organisation of sensorimotor cortex activation during action observation may depend on infants' understanding of the action goal and their expectations about how this goal will be achieved.

Methods: We studied 11 patients with focal epilepsy (age range: 9-28 years) who underwent measurement of calculation- and naming-related gamma-augmentation during extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG). The patients were instructed to overtly verbalize a one-word answer in response to auditorily-delivered calculation and naming questions. The assigned calculation tasks were addition and subtraction involving integers between 1 and 17. Results: Out of the 1001 analyzed cortical electrode sites, 63 showed gamma-augmentation at 50-120 Hz elicited by both tasks, 88 specifically during naming, and 7 specifically during calculation. Common gamma-augmentation mainly took place in the Rolandic regions. Calculation-specific gamma-augmentation, involving the period between the question-offset and response-onset, was noted in the middle-temporal, inferior-parietal, inferior post-central, middle-frontal, and premotor regions of the left hemisphere. Calculation-specific gamma-augmentation in the middle-temporal, inferior-parietal, and inferior post-central regions peaked around the question offset, while that in the frontal lobe peaked after the question offset and before the response onset. This study failed to detect a significant difference in calculation- specific gamma amplitude between easy trials and difficult ones requiring multi-digit operations. Conclusions: Auditorily-delivered stimuli can elicit calculation-specific gamma-augmentation in multiple regions of the left hemisphere including the parietal region. However, the additive diagnostic value of measurement of gamma-augmentation related to a simple calculation task appears modest. Significance: Further studies are warranted to determine the functional significance of calculation- specific gamma-augmentation in each site, and to establish the optimal protocol for mapping mental calculation.

Natural winter hibernation was also induced in hamsters by housing them in a dark cold chamber. During recovering from the artificial and natural hypometabolic states, we recorded EEG activity (leads were implanted in the frontal and parietal cortices), EMG of the neck muscles, and body temperature. The initial period of self-heating after the AHMS in both species and that in hamsters after hibernation was characterized by low amplitudes of EEG and EMG and clearly pronounced depression of EEG oscillations of all frequency ranges, but with relative predominance of delta oscillations (the latter phenomenon may be partly due to superposition of ECG activity on EEG). In the course of further self-heating of animals, the EEG amplitude increased, and its spectral composition changed. The power of some EEG rhythms reached the maximum, and then the EEG composition was normalized successively beginning from the delta range; then the theta and alpha ranges and, finally, the beta range were normalized. We observed a certain parallelism between changes in the power of b activity in the composition of EEG and increase in the intensity of muscle activity. Patterns of EEG activity corresponding to one functional state or another (active or passive wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, or paradoxical sleep) were normalized in hamsters approximately two times faster than in rats.

Of primary importance is to use less data and computationally efficient algorithms to support real-time BCI. To this end, an algorithm that exploits the sparse characteristics of EEGs is proposed to classify these signals. Different feature vectors are extracted based on the energies in different frequency sub-bands of the Wavelet Packet decomposition of EEG trials recorded only by five electrodes near the sensorimotor cortex. Features from a small spatial region are approximated by a sparse linear combination of few atoms from a multi-class dictionary constructed from the wavelet features of the projected EEG training signals for each class. This is used to classify the signals based on the pattern of their sparse representation using a minimum-residual decision rule. The results obtained from real data demonstrate that the combination of energy and entropy features enables efficient classification of motor imagery EEG trials related to hand and foot movements. Also, the decomposition used is shown to provide a frequency resolution consistent with the existence of different levels within the alpha band.

Thus, this study used an EEG power spectral analysis to investigate whether alterations in EEG are associated with changes in blood glucose levels in healthy fasting subjects.Methods:This study included 24 healthy volunteers who underwent resting-state EEG and completed two attention examinations following a fasting period of at least 8 hours. The same tests were repeated after the participants ingested a glucose-rich drink.Results:After consumption of the glucose-rich drink, significant increases in low alpha (8-10 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power were observed in the whole brain and were especially prominent in the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. The participants performed better on the attention tests after than before the intake of glucose, but regional EEG changes were not correlated with this attentional enhancement.Conclusions:The present study demonstrated that recovery from low levels of blood glucose following a prolonged fasting period was associated with increased power in the theta and low alpha bands on a resting-state EEG and that this recovery was accompanied by improved attentional performance.

J	Cebolla, AM; Cheron, G				Cebolla, A. M.; Cheron, G.			Sensorimotor and cognitive involvement of the beta-gamma oscillation in the frontal N30 component of somatosensory evoked potentials	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Somatosensory; N30; SEP; EEG; Mirror neuron network; Beta-gamma	INDUCED TRANSIENT POTENTIATION; FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; RECORDED EEG-EPOGRAMS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MEDIAN NERVE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE	The most consistent negative cortical component of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), namely the frontal N30, can be considered more multidimensional than a strict item of standard somatosensmy investigation, dedicated to tracking the afferent volley from the peripheral sensory nerve potentials to the primary somatosensory cortex. In this review, we revisited its classical sensorimotor implication within the framework of the recent oscillatory model of ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms. Recently, the N30 component was demonstrated to be related to an increase in the power of betagamma EEG oscillation and a phase reorganization of the ongoing EEG oscillations (phase locking) in this frequency band. Thanks to high density EEG recordings and the inverse modeling method (swLORETA), it was shown that different overlapping areas of the motor and premotor cortex are specifically involved in generating the N30 in the form of a beta gamma oscillatory phase locking and power increase. This oscillatory approach has allowed a re-investigation of the movement gating behavior of the N30. It was demonstrated that the concomitant execution of finger movements by a stimulated hand impinges the temporal concentration of the ongoing beta/gamma EEG oscillations and abolished the N30 component. It was hypothesized that the involvement of neuronal populations in both the sensorimotor cortex and other related areas were unable to respond to the phasic sensory activation so could not phase-lock their oscillatory signals to the external sensory input during the movement. In this case, the actual movement has primacy over the artificial somatosensory input. The contribution of the ongoing oscillatory activity in the N30 emergence calls for a reappraisal of fundamental and clinical interpretations of the frontal N30 component. An absent or reduced amplitude of the N30 can now be viewed not only as a deficit in the activation of the somatosensory synaptic network in response to sensory input, but also as a global alteration of the beta-gamma ongoing oscillation and/or of the phase-locking mechanism itself. In addition, it has lately been shown that the N30 amplitude increases during the observation of another person's hand movement. A new paradigm in which the experimenter's hand movement, observed by the participant, triggered the electric stimulation of the subject's hand has been introduced. This has allowed the identification of different cortical areas which are closely related to those involved in the mirror neuron system. This contribution of N30 behavior has paved the way for future investigation of the integration of sensory input into cognitive context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The neural mechanism, however, has thus far remained elusive. Here, we measure oscillations in the EEG associated with attentional orienting to address this issue. The EEG was recorded from DCD children and typical developing (TD) controls during an eye-gaze cueing paradigm. DCD group responded more slowly than TD group across all conditions. Additionally, TD group showed higher frontal midline theta activities in both valid and invalid conditions relative to a neutral condition, with such an effect absent in the DCD group. Theta oscillations might reflect attentional processing in relation to the cues being performed in TD group, with the lessened modulation of theta in DCD group possibly reflecting a deficit in attentional orienting.

In this study, we aimed to investigate how predisposition to depression shows up in the emotional coloring of spontaneous thoughts and the activity of oscillatory resting-state networks, as revealed by source localization and independent component analysis techniques. Depressive symptoms correlated positively with the prevalence of negative emotion during EEG registration and with delta and theta activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and negatively with theta activity in the DMN. Since an increase of low-frequency oscillations in the orbitofrontal cortex is observed in aversive states, whereas their decrease in the DMN reflects an activation of this network, which is related to self-referenced processing, our results are consistent with the notion that vulnerability to depression is associated with general negative emotional disposition and excessive focus on the self	[Knyazev, G.

The approach to identify these discharges consists of three stages: first - construct the time-frequency domain (TFD) of the EEG recording using matching pursuit TFD (MP-TFD), second - decompose the TFD matrix into two submatrices (W, H) using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and third - use the decomposed spectral and temporal vectors to locate the epileptiform discharges, referred to as spikes, during intervals of HYPS. The method was applied to an EEG dataset of five individuals and the identification of spike locations was compared with those which were visually identified by the epileptologists and those obtained using commercially available clinical analysis software. The MP-TFD method resulted in average true positive and false negative percentages of 86% and 14%, respectively, which represents a significant improvement over the clinical software, which achieved average true positive and false negative percentages of 4% and 96%, respectively.

Converging evidence suggests that frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations play an important role during the execution of such PFC-dependent tasks. Additionally, it is well-established that acute stress impairs PFC function, and recent evidence suggests that FMT is decreased under stress. In this EEG study, we investigated FMT oscillations during a mental arithmetic task that was carried out in a stressful and a neutral control condition. Our results show late-onset, sustained FMT increases during mental arithmetic. In the neutral condition FMT started to increase earlier than in the stress condition. Direct comparison of the conditions quantified this difference by showing stronger FMT increases in the neutral condition in an early time window. Between-subject correlation analysis showed that attenuated FMT under stress was related to slowed reaction times. Our results suggest that FMT is associated with stimulus independent mental processes during the natural and complex PFC-dependent task of mental arithmetic, and is a possible marker for intact PFC function that is disrupted under stress.

Frontal midline. power as an index of listening effort	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; audiological rehabilitation; auditory; event-related spectral perturbation; independent components analysis	EEG DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; SPEECH	Attempts to identify physiological correlates of listening effort have mainly focused on peripheral measures (e.g. pupillometry) and auditory-evoked/event-related potentials. Although nonauditory studies have suggested that sustained time-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) features in the.-band (4-7 Hz) are correlated with domain-general mental effort, little work has characterized such features during effortful listening. Here, high-density EEG data was collected while listeners performed a sentence-recognition task in noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of which varied across blocks. Frontal midline theta (Fm theta), largely driven by sources localized in or near the medial frontal cortex, showed greater power with decreasing SNR and was positively correlated with self-reports of effort. Increased Fm theta was present before speech onset and during speech presentation. Fm theta power also differed across SNRs when including only trials in which all words were recognized, suggesting that the effects were unrelated to performance differences. Results suggest that frontal cortical networks play a larger role in listening as acoustic signals are increasingly masked. Further, sustained time-frequency EEG features may usefully supplement previously used peripheral and event-related potential measures in psychophysiological investigations of effortful listening.

In humans, invasive stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is emerging as a reference method for electrophysiological recordings because of its excellent spatial and temporal resolution. It could thus be also considered an optimal method for mapping neuronal inter-areal interactions. However, the common bipolar (BP) referencing of SEEG data may both confuse signals from distinct sources and suppress true neuronal interactions whereas the alternative monopolar (MP) reference yields data contaminated by volume conduction. We advance here a novel referencing scheme for SEEG data where electrodes in grey matter are referenced to closest white-matter (CW) electrodes. Using a 22 subject cohort and these three referencing schemes, we observed that both inter-areal phase and amplitude correlations decayed as function of distance and frequency but remained significant and stable across distances up to 10 cm. Furthermore, we found that deep and superficial cortical laminae exhibit distinct spectral profiles of oscillation power as well as distinct patterns of inter-areal phase and amplitude interactions. These effects were qualitatively similar in MP and CW but distorted with BP referencing. Importantly CW was not influenced by the apparent large-scale volume conduction inherent to MP. We thus demonstrate here that with CW referencing, the superior anatomical accuracy of SEEG can be leveraged to yield accurate quantification and qualitatively novel insight into phase and amplitude interactions in human brain activity.

In this illusion, a visual speech stimulus influences the perception of an incongruent auditory stimulus, resulting in a fused novel percept. In this high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study, we were interested in the neural signatures of the subjective percept of the McGurk illusion as a phenomenon of speech-specific multisensory integration. Therefore, we examined the role of cortical oscillations and event-related responses in the perception of congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech. We compared the cortical activity elicited by objectively congruent syllables with incongruent audiovisual stimuli. Importantly, the latter elicited a subjectively congruent percept: the McGurk illusion. We found that early event-related responses (N1) to audiovisual stimuli were reduced during the perception of the McGurk illusion compared with congruent stimuli. Most interestingly, our study showed a stronger poststimulus suppression of beta-band power (13-30 Hz) at short (0-500 ms) and long (500-800 ms) latencies during the perception of the McGurk illusion compared with congruent stimuli. Our study demonstrates that auditory perception is influenced by visual context and that the subsequent formation of a McGurk illusion requires stronger audiovisual integration even at early processing stages. Our results provide evidence that beta-band suppression at early stages reflects stronger stimulus processing in the McGurk illusion. Moreover, stronger late beta-band suppression in McGurk illusion indicates the resolution of incongruent physical audiovisual input and the formation of a coherent, illusory multisensory percept.

Considerable work indicates oscillatory synchronization through phase alignment is a major agent of inter-regional communication. In the brain, different oscillatory phases correspond to low- and high-excitability states. Optimally aligned phases (or high-excitability states) promote inter-regional communication. Studies have also shown that sensory stimulation can modulate or reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations. For example, auditory stimuli can reset the phase of oscillations in visual cortex, influencing processing of a simultaneous visual stimulus. Such cross-regional phase reset represents a candidate mechanism for aligning oscillatory phase for inter-regional communication. Here, we explored the role of local and inter-regional phase alignment in driving a well established behavioral correlate of multisensory integration: the redundant target effect (RTE), which refers to the fact that responses to multisensory inputs are substantially faster than to unisensory stimuli. In a speeded detection task, human epileptic patients (N = 3) responded to unisensory (auditory or visual) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli with a button press, while electrocorticography was recorded over auditory and motor regions. Visual stimulation significantly modulated auditory activity via phase reset in the delta and theta bands. During the period between stimulation and subsequent motor response, transient synchronization between auditory and motor regions was observed. Phase synchrony to multisensory inputs was faster than to unisensory stimulation. This sensorimotor phase alignment correlated with behavior such that stronger synchrony was associated with faster responses, linking the commonly observed RTE with phase alignment across a sensorimotor network.

In spite of the abilities of this procedure, because of some reasons like insufficient data, algorithm shortcomings and noise, it is required that the reliability of components be measured. RELICA is a new procedure which evaluates within subject reliability from the physiological plausibility and stability perspective. However, based on the previous researches, ICA in frequency domain estimates more brain components. It is based on non-Gaussianity of non-brain sources. In this paper two ICA algorithms in time and frequency domains and estimated component's reliability are studied by RELICA. Findings show that components in frequency domain are more reliable.

Group-level component analyses of EEG: validation and evaluation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; group component analysis; multisubject analysis; blind source separation; ICA; SOBI	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; VOLUME CONDUCTION; STATISTICS; SUBJECT	Multi-subject or group-level component analysis provides a data-driven approach to study properties of brain networks. Algorithms for group-level data decomposition of functional magnetic resonance imaging data have been brought forward more than a decade ago and have significantly matured since. Similar applications for electroencephalographic data are at a comparatively early stage of development though, and their sensitivity to topographic variability of the electroencephalogram or loose time-locking of neuronal responses has not yet been assessed. This study investigates the performance of independent component analysis (ICA) and second order blind source identification (SOBI) for data decomposition, and their combination with either temporal or spatial concatenation of data sets, for multi-subject analyses of electroencephalographic data. Analyses of simulated sources with different spatial, frequency, and time-locking profiles, revealed that temporal concatenation of data sets with either ICA or SOBI served well to reconstruct sources with both strict and loose time-locking, whereas performance decreased in the presence of topographical variability. The opposite pattern was found with a spatial concatenation of subject-specific data sets. This study proofs that procedures for group-level decomposition of electroencephalographic data can be considered valid and promising approaches to infer the latent structure of multi-subject data sets. Yet, specific implementations need further adaptations to optimally address sources of inter-subject and inter-trial variance commonly found in EEG recordings.

Computational and theoretical models have revealed that the geometry of these hallucinations can be related to functional neuro-anatomy. However, while experimental evidence links both visual flicker and hallucinogenic drugs to upward and downward modulations of brain oscillatory activity, the exact relation between brain oscillations and geometric hallucinations remains a mystery. Here we demonstrate that, in human observers, this link is bidirectional. The same flicker frequencies that preferentially induced radial (<10 Hz) or spiral (10 - 20 Hz) hallucinations in a behavioral experiment involving full-field uniform flicker without any actual shape displayed, also showed selective oscillatory EEG enhancement when observers viewed a genuine static image of a radial or spiral pattern without any flicker. This bidirectional property constrains the possible neuronal events at the origin of visual hallucinations, and further suggests that brain oscillations, which are strictly temporal in nature, could nonetheless act as preferential channels for spatial information.

A high-density EEG study of differences between three high speeds of simulated forward motion from optic flow in adult participants	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; optic flow; motion perception; speed differences; adults; visual evoked potential (VEP); time-frequency analysis; temporal spectral evolution (TSE)	RANDOM VISUAL-MOTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; WHITE-MATTER; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; NEURONS RESPOND; CORTICAL AREAS; MOTOR CORTEX	A high-density EEG study was conducted to investigate evoked and oscillatory brain activity in response to high speeds of simulated forward motion. Participants were shown an optic flow pattern consisting of a virtual road with moving poles at either side of it, simulating structured forward motion at different driving speeds (25, 50, and 75 km/h) with a static control condition between each motion condition. Significant differences in N2 latencies and peak amplitudes between the three speeds of visual motion were found in parietal channels of interest P3 and P4. As motion speed increased, peak latency increased while peak amplitude decreased which might indicate that higher driving speeds are perceived as more demanding resulting in longer latencies, and as fewer neurons in the motion sensitive areas of the adult brain appear to be attuned to such high visual speeds this could explain the observed inverse relationship between speed and amplitude. In addition, significant differences between alpha de-synchronizations for forward motion and alpha synchronizations in the static condition were found in the parietal midline (PM) source. It was suggested that the alpha de synchronizations reflect an activated state related to the visual processing of simulated forward motion, whereas the alpha synchronizations in response to the static condition reflect a deactivated resting period.

For the estimation of functional connectivity (coherence), Welch and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) methods were compared. The MVDR coherence was found to be more suitable since it is both data and frequency dependent and enables higher spectral resolution, while Welch's periodogram-based approach is both data and frequency independent. The directed transfer function (DTF) method was applied in order to estimate the effective connectivity or brain's flow of information between different regions during each state. DTF enables to identify the main brain areas that initiate EEG activity and the spatial distribution of these activities with time. Analysis was conducted using the EEG data of 30 subjects (ten awake, ten drowsy and ten meditating) focusing on six main electrodes (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1 and O2). For each subject, EEG data were recorded during 5-min baseline and 15 min of a specific condition (awake, meditation or drowsiness). Statistical analysis included the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) nonparametric analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests with Bonferroni alpha correction. The results reveal that both states of drowsiness and meditation states lead to a marked difference in the brain's flow of information (effective connectivity) as shown by DTF analyses. In specific, a significant increase in the flow of information in the delta frequency band was found only in the meditation condition and was further found to originate from frontal (F3, F4), parietal (P3, P4) and occipital (O1, O2) regions. Altogether, these results suggest that a change in attentiveness leads to significant changes in the spectral profile of the brain's information flow as well as in its functional connectivity and that these changes can be captured using coherence and DTF analyses.

According to the reported findings, we hypothesized that HFOs occur more specific to the epileptogenic tissue. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intracranial electroencephalograms (iEEG) of three subjects of animal epilepsy model. Overall 180 minutes of iEEG records were processed by the automatic high frequency activity detector and further analyzed. The dominant frequency of each segment was determined and categorized as ripples (80-200 Hz) or fast ripples (200-1000 Hz). Even though overall number of HFO detections predominate in the hemisphere where epileptic focus is located, in comparison of each brain structure separately our hypothesis cannot be fully confirmed.

In the past few years, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been widely used to analyze epileptic EEG. However, there are two practical questions unanswered: 1. what the best mother wavelet for epileptic EEG analysis is; 2. what the optimal level of wavelet decomposition is. The main challenge in using wavelet transform is selecting the optimal mother wavelet for the given task, as different mother wavelet applied on the same signal may produces different results. Such a problem also exist in epileptic EEG analysis based on wavelet. Deeper DWT can yield more detailed depiction of signals but it requires substantially more computational time. In this paper, we study these problems, using the most common epileptic EEG classification task, seizure detection, as an example. The results show that all 7 mother wavelets used in this work achieve high seizure detection accuracy at high decomposition levels. Also, decomposition level effects the detection accuracy more significantly than mother wavelets. For all wavelets, decomposition beyond level 7 improves accuracy limitedly and even decreases accuracy. We further study the most effective bands and features for seizure detection. An interpretation to our results is that seizure and non-seizure EEGs differ across all conventional frequency bands of human EEG rhythms. The best accuracy of seizure detection achieved in this research is 92.30% using coif 3 from levels 2 to 7.

On the possible role of stimulation duration for after-effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalography; tACS; NIBS; non-invasive brain stimulation; entrainment; synaptic plasticity	MOTOR CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; TACS; ENTRAINMENT; HUMANS; RANGE	Transcranial alternating current stimulation is a novel method that allows application of sinusoidal currents to modulate brain oscillations and cognitive processes. Studies in humans have demonstrated transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) aftereffects following stimulation durations in the range of minutes. However, such aftereffects are absent in animal studies using much shorter stimulation protocols in the range of seconds. Thus, stimulation duration might be a critical parameter for after-effects to occur. To test this hypothesis, we repeated a recent human tACS experiment with a short duration. We applied alpha tACS intermittently for 1 s duration while keeping other parameters identical. The results demonstrate that this very short intermittent protocol did not produce after-effects on amplitude or phase of the electroencephalogram. Since synaptic plasticity has been suggested as a possible mechanism for after-effects, our results indicate that a stimulation duration of 1 s is too short to induce synaptic plasticity. Future studies in animals are required that use extended stimulation durations to reveal the neuronal underpinnings. A better understanding of the mechanisms of tACS aftereffects is crucial for potential clinical applications.

Information as to when exactly an event occurs enables temporal orienting. Intersensory and temporal attention mechanisms are often deployed simultaneously, but as yet it is unknown whether these processes operate interactively or in parallel. In this human electroencephalography study, we manipulated intersensory attention and temporal orienting in the same paradigm. A continuous stream of bisensory visuo-tactile inputs was presented, and a preceding auditory cue indicated to which modality participants should attend (visual or tactile). Temporal orienting was manipulated blockwise by presenting stimuli either at regular or irregular intervals. Using linear beamforming, we examined neural oscillations at virtual channels in sensory and motor cortices. Both attentional processes simultaneously modulated the power of anticipatory delta- and beta-band oscillations, as well as delta-band phase coherence. Modulations in sensory cortices reflected intersensory attention, indicative of modality-specific gating mechanisms. Modulations in motor and partly in somatosensory cortex reflected temporal orienting, indicative of a supramodal preparatory mechanism. We found no evidence for interactions between intersensory attention and temporal orienting, suggesting that these two mechanisms act in parallel and largely independent of each other in sensory and motor cortices.

Method: The sample was composed of 15 healthy individuals exposed to three experimental conditions: placebo, modafinil and bromazepam. EEG data were recorded before, during and after the execution of the task. A three-way ANOVA was applied, in order to compare the absolute alpha power among the factors: Group (control, bromazepam and modafinil) Condition (Pre and Post-drug ingestion) and Moment (pre and post-stimulus). Results: Interaction was found between the group and condition factors for Fp1, F4 and F3. We observed a main effect of moment and condition for the Fp2, F8 and Fz electrodes. Conclusion: We concluded that drugs may interfere in sensorimotor processes, such as in the performance of tasks carried out in an unpredictable scenario.

Techniques such as cepstral-based filter banks or wavelets are popular analysis techniques in many signal processing applications including EEG classification. In this paper, we present a comparison of a variety of approaches to estimating and postprocessing features. To further aid in discrimination of periodic signals from aperiodic signals, we add a differential energy term. We evaluate our approaches on the TUH EEG Corpus, which is the largest publicly available EEG corpus and an exceedingly challenging task due to the clinical nature of the data. We demonstrate that a variant of a standard filter bank-based approach, coupled with first and second derivatives, provides a substantial reduction in the overall error rate. The combination of differential energy and derivatives produces a 24% absolute reduction in the error rate and improves our ability to discriminate between signal events and background noise. This relatively simple approach proves to be comparable to other popular feature extraction approaches such as wavelets, but is much more computationally efficient.

Theta oscillations across the cortex have been associated with changes in memory, attention, and sensorimotor processing. What has proven more elusive is pinpointing the region-specific frequency band oscillations that are associated with specific parameters of movement during the acceleration and deceleration phases. We report a study using 3D analytic techniques for high density electroencephalography that examines electrocortical dynamics while participants produce upper limb movements to different distances at varying rates. During fast ballistic movements, we observed increased theta band activity in the left motor area contralateral to the moving limb during the acceleration phase of the movement, and theta power correlated with the acceleration of movement. In contrast, beta band activity scaled with the type of movement during the deceleration phase near the end of the movement and correlated with movement time. In the ipsilateral motor and somatosensory area, alpha band activity decreased with the type of movement near the end of the movement, and gamma band activity in visual cortex increased with the type of movement near the end of the movement. Our results suggest that humans use distinct lateralized cortical activity for distance and speed dependent arm movements. We provide new evidence that a temporary increase in theta band power relates to movement acceleration and is important during movement execution. Further, the theta power increase is coupled with desychronization of beta band power and alpha band power which are modulated by the task near the end of movement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These symptoms can be improved by shunt operation in some but not all patients. Therefore, discovering predictive factors for the surgical outcome is of great clinical importance. We used normalized power variance (NPV) of electroencephalography (EEG) waves, a sensitive measure of the instability of cortical electrical activity, and found significantly higher NPV in beta frequency band at the right fronto-temporo-occipital electrodes (Fp2, T4 and O2) in shunt responders compared to non-responders. By utilizing these differences, we were able to correctly identify responders and non-responders to shunt operation with a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 88%. Our findings indicate that NPV can be useful in noninvasively predicting the clinical outcome of shunt operation in patients with iNPH.

To investigate changes directly attributed to the formation of explicit associations, we examined oscillatory power captured through intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) as 27 neurosurgical patients receiving subdural and depth electrodes for seizure monitoring participated in a paired associates memory task. We examined low (3-8 Hz) and high (45-95 Hz) frequency activity, and found that the successful formation of new associations was accompanied by broad decreases in low frequency activity and a posterior to anterior progression of increases in high frequency activity in the left hemisphere. These data suggest that the observed patterns of activity may reflect the neural mechanisms underlying the formation of novel item-item associations. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A new approach which combines the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with the Genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the ELM is used both as the final classifier and the fitness function for the GA to select the optimal feature subset from the initial features extracted through time-frequency (TF) analysis. The GA is adopted as the complementary input optimization mechanism to improve the performance of the ELM. To testify the performance of the proposed approach, experiments were simulated using the real-world EEG signals of 2003 International BCI Competition dataset. The recognition results haw proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Thus, field studies remain scarce, especially in extreme conditions such as during real flights. Here, we investigated the effects of flight procedures of varied complexity on the in-flight EEG activity of military helicopter pilots. Flight procedural complexity modulated the EEG power spectrum: highly demanding procedures (i.e., takeoff and landing) were associated with higher EEG power in the higher frequency bands, whereas less demanding procedures (i.e., flight exercises) were associated with lower EEG power over the same frequency bands. These results suggest that EEG recordings may help to evaluate an operator's cognitive performance in challenging real-life scenarios, and thus could aid in the prevention of catastrophic events.

MethodsIn 17 infants with West syndrome, we conservatively detected fast frequency peaks that stood out from the time-frequency spectral background with square root power>1 mu V (spectral criterion) and corresponded to clear FOs with at least 4 oscillations in the filtered EEG traces (waveform criterion) in sleep EEGs. ResultsWe found a total of 1,519 interictal FOs that fulfilled both the spectral and waveform criteria. The FOs with a median frequency of 56.6Hz (range=41.0-140.6Hz) were dense, with a median rate of 66 (range=24-171) per minute before adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment, which was significantly higher than that in control infants without seizures (median=1, p<0.001). The FOs were reduced by treatment. The mean gamma and ripple oscillation rates that were detected using the waveform criterion alone were 40.62/min and 15.75/min, respectively, per channel; these results were 112.8 and 98.4 times higher, respectively, than the previously reported corresponding rates in adult epilepsy patients. InterpretationThe observed FOs corresponded to epileptogenicity because of their close relation to the severity of hypsarrhythmia during the course of ACTH treatment. The very high epileptic FO rates in hypsarrhythmia are thought to affect the process of neurodevelopment by interfering with physiological functions in West syndrome, taking into account that high frequencies are also important in physiological higher brain functions.

J	Gao, C; Ma, L; Li, HF				Gao, Chang; Ma, Lin; Li, Haifeng			An ICA/HHT Hybrid Approach for Automatic Ocular Artifact Correction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; ocular artifact; Hilbert Huang transformation; independent component analysis	EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; WAVELET TRANSFORM; EEG; REMOVAL; TIME	In the field of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing, the ocular artifact (OA), especially the blink is the most commonly observed, gives the largest disturbance, and can hardly be automatically corrected due to its sudden appearance and wide frequency band influence. In this paper, we focus on a 2-stage independent component analysis/Hilbert Huang transformation (ICA/HHT) hybrid OA correction method which realizes an automatic OA correction as well as a better information conservation to the OA distorted EEG data. In the 1st stage, the ICA is introduced to convert the raw EEG signals into a set of independent signal sources, i.e. a number of independent components (ICs). In the 2nd stage, the HHT is then applied to analyze the ICs in order to emphasize the differences between the OA related ICs and the normal EEG related ICs. On the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of each IC extracted by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the Hilbert spectrums can clearly indicate where an OA exists and make an automatic OA correction possible. EEG signal samples randomly picked from a variety of neuropsychology tasks were used to evaluate the proposed automatic OA correction method, and the outcomes approved an excellent OA correction performance as well as a better information conservation ability comparing to the well applied methods nowadays.

On the basis of the well-known relationship between sleep and memory, there has been a growing interest in the predictive role of human brain activity during sleep on dream recall. Neuroimaging studies indicate that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by limbic activation and prefrontal cortex deactivation. This pattern could explain the presence of emotional contents in dream reports. Furthermore, the morphoanatomical measures of amygdala and hippocampus predict some features of dream contents (bizarreness, vividness, and emotional load). More relevant for a general view of dreaming mechanisms, empirical data from neuropsychological and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies support the hypothesis that there is a sort of continuity between the neurophysiological mechanisms of encoding and retrieval of episodic memories across sleep and wakefulness. A notable overlap between the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying emotional memory formation and some peculiar EEG features of REM sleep has been suggested. In particular, theta (5-8 Hz) EEG oscillations on frontal regions in the pre-awakening sleep are predictive of dream recall, which parallels the predictive relation during wakefulness between theta activity and successful retrieval of episodic memory. Although some observations support an interpretation more in terms of an intraindividual than interindividual mechanism, the existing empirical evidence still precludes from definitely disentangling if this relation is explained by state- or trait-like differences.

We call this method CLP-BSE standing for constrained-linear-prediction BSE. Extracting event-related oscillations is a crucial task due to nonphase-locked nature and inter-trial variability of this event. The main objective of this work is to extract rolandic beta rhythm to measure event-related synchronization (ERS) with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The extracted rhythm is utilized for constructing a regressor to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The proposed method is a semi-blind technique which uses a spatio-temporal constraint for beta rhythm extraction. This constraint is derived from recorded EEG signals based on the prior knowledge about the frequency and location of the source of interest. The main reason of employing linear prediction as an effective algorithm to extract the EEG rhythm is the ability of extracting sources which have specific temporal structure. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using both synthetic and real EEG data. The obtained results show that the proposed technique is able to extract ERS effectively. The maximum percentage of ERS obtained by filtering is 152% while the obtained ERS by CLP-BSE is 214%. In another experiment, the extracted event-related oscillations in beta band are used to make the necessary regressor for fMRI analysis. The results of EEG-fMRI coregistration confirm that there are correlation between the extracted rolandic beta rhythm and simultaneously recorded fMRI. This conclude that, the results of EEG-fMRI combination support the reliability of CLP-BSE output.

Specifically, the module is based on short-time analysis with time-domain and frequency-domain features and classification using support vector machines. The seizure detection module was evaluated on three subjects with diagnosed idiopathic generalized epilepsy manifested with absences. The achieved seizure detection accuracy was approximately 90% for all evaluated subjects. Feature ranking investigation and evaluation of the seizure detection module using subsets of features showed that the feature vector composed of approximately the 65%-best ranked parameters provides a good trade-off between computational demands and accuracy. This configurable architecture allows the seizure detection module to operate as part of a healthcare system in offline mode as well as in online mode, where real-time performance is needed.

A number of studies have shown that the use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation programs provides safe and intensive treatment to patients with motor impairments because of a neurological injury. Furthermore, robot-aided therapy was shown to be well accepted and tolerated by all patients; however, it is not known whether a specific robot-aided rehabilitation can induce beneficial cortical plasticity in stroke patients. Here, we present a procedure to study neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. Neurophysiological recordings use the following: (a) 10-20 system electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode montage; (b) bipolar vertical and horizontal electrooculographies; and (c) bipolar electromyography from the operating upper limb. Behavior monitoring includes the following: (a) clinical data and (b) kinematic and dynamic of the operant upper limb movements. Experimental conditions include the following: (a) resting state eyes closed and eyes open, and (b) robotic rehabilitation task (maximum 80s each block to reach 4-min EEG data; interblock pause of 1min). The data collection is performed before and after a program of 30 daily rehabilitation sessions. EEG markers include the following: (a) EEG power density in the eyes-closed condition; (b) reactivity of EEG power density to eyes opening; and (c) reactivity of EEG power density to robotic rehabilitation task. The above procedure was tested on a subacute patient (29 poststroke days) and on a chronic patient (21 poststroke months). After the rehabilitation program, we observed (a) improved clinical condition; (b) improved performance during the robotic task; (c) reduced delta rhythms (1-4Hz) and increased alpha rhythms (8-12Hz) during the resting state eyes-closed condition; (d) increased alpha desynchronization to eyes opening; and (e) decreased alpha desynchronization during the robotic rehabilitation task. We conclude that the present procedure is suitable for evaluation of the neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation.

For this purpose, various patterns/features of EEG data need to be extracted and associated with specific events like cue-paced motor imagery. However, this is a challenging task since EEG data are usually non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio. New method: In this study, we propose a novel method, called structure constrained semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SCS-NMF), to extract the key patterns of EEG data in time domain by imposing the mean envelopes of event-related potentials (ERPs) as constraints on the semi-NMF procedure. The proposed method is applicable to general EEG time series, and the extracted temporal features by SCS-NMF can also be combined with other features in frequency domain to improve the performance of motor imagery classification. Results: Real data experiments have been performed using the SCS-NMF approach for motor imagery classification, and the results clearly suggest the superiority of the proposed method. Comparison with existing methods: Comparison experiments have also been conducted. The compared methods include ICA, PCA, Semi-NMF, Wavelets, EMD and CSP, which further verified the effectivity of SCS-NMF. Conclusions: The SCS-NMF method could obtain better or competitive performance over the state of the art methods, which provides a novel solution for brain pattern analysis from the perspective of structure constraint.

Selective thalamic lesions are reportedly associated to reductions of spindle activity and its spectrum similar to 14 Hz (sigma), and to alterations of SSO features. This apparent, parallel behavior suggests that thalamo-cortical entrainment favors cortical bistability. Here we investigate temporally-causal associations between thalamic sigma activity and shape, topology, and dynamics of SSOs. We recorded sleep EEG and studied whether spatio-temporal variability of SSO amplitude, negative slope (synchronization in downstate falling) and detection rate are driven by cortical-sigma-activity expression (12-18 Hz), in 3 consecutive 1 s-EEG-epochs preceding each SSO event (Baselines). We analyzed: (i) spatial variability, comparing maps of baseline sigma power and of SSO features, averaged over the first sleep cycle; (ii) event-by-event shape variability, computing for each electrode correlations between baseline sigma power and amplitude/slope of related SSOs; (iii) event-by-event spreading variability, comparing baseline sigma power in electrodes showing an SSO event with the homologous ones, spared by the event. The scalp distribution of baseline sigma power mirrored those of SSO amplitude and slope; event-by-event variability in baseline sigma power was associated with that in SSO amplitude in fronto-central areas; within each SSO event, electrodes involved in cortical bistability presented higher baseline sigma activity than those free of SSO. In conclusion, spatio-temporal variability of thalamocortical entrainment, measured by background sigma activity, is a reliable estimate of the cortical proneness to bistability.

By entraining multiple neurons into a common time regime, such network oscillations form a critical interface between cellular activity and large-scale systemic functions. Synaptic integrity is altered in neurodegenerative diseases, and it is likely that this goes along with characteristic changes of coordinated network activity. This notion is supported by EEG recordings from human patients and from different animal models of such disorders. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiology of network oscillations in neurodegenerative diseases is surprisingly incomplete, and increased research efforts are urgently needed. One complicating factor is the pronounced diversity of network oscillations between different brain regions and functional states. Pathological changes must, therefore, be analyzed separately in each condition and affected area. However, cumulative evidence from different diseases may result, in the future, in more unifying "oscillopathy" concepts of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we report present evidence for pathological changes of network oscillations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most prominent and challenging neurodegenerative disorders. The heterogeneous findings from AD are contrasted to Parkinson's disease, where motor-related changes in specific frequency bands do already fulfill criteria of a valid biomarker.

The method works in three steps: (i) to employ EEMD for EEG signal decomposition into components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), followed by applying Hilbert transform to the IMFs to determine the instantaneous frequency and amplitude; (ii) to choose the IMFs containing the most significant information based on the degree of presence in gamma band; (iii) to select segments of instantaneous vectors according to JSD metric, which measures the distances between two concepts. This method was applied to EEG signals of 5 subjects performing 5 mental tasks. The classification of mental tasks was performed using Fisher linear discriminator. The experimental results are compared with the ones obtained by a method that uses the power of gamma band in EEG signals (a traditional and popular method). The experimental results show improvement of the classification accuracy.

The goal of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids disrupt gamma-oscillations in humans and whether these effects relate to their psychosis-relevant behavioral effects. The acute, dose-related effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were studied in humans (n=20) who completed 3 test days during which they received intravenous Delta(9)-THC (placebo, 0.015, and 0.03 mg/kg) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced design. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while subjects listened to auditory click trains presented at 20, 30, and 40 Hz. Psychosis-relevant effects were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS). Delta(9)-THC (0.03 mg/kg) reduced intertrialcoherence (ITC) in the 40 Hz condition compared with 0.015 mg/kg and placebo. No significant effects were detected for 30 and 20 Hz stimulation. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between 40 Hz ITC and PANSS subscales and total scores under the influence of Delta(9)-THC. Delta(9)-THC (0.03 mg/kg) reduced evoked power during 40 Hz stimulation at a trend level. Recent users of cannabis showed blunted Delta(9)-THC effects on ITC and evoked power. We show for the first time in humans that cannabinoids disrupt gamma-band neural oscillations. Furthermore, there is a relationship between disruption of gamma-band neural oscillations and psychosis-relevant phenomena induced by cannabinoids. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting some overlap between the acute effects of cannabinoids and the behavioral and psychophysiological alterations observed in psychotic disorders.

These oscillatory activities, whose functional significances differ greatly according to their temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics, are commonly detected when single-trial signals are transformed into time-frequency distributions (TFDs). Parameters characterizing oscillatory activities are normally measured from multi-channel TFDs within a time-frequency region-of-interest (TF-ROI), pre-defined using a hypothesis-driven or data-driven approach. However, both approaches could ignore the possibility that the pre-defined TF-ROI contains several spatially/functionally distinct oscillatory activities. New method: We proposed a novel approach based on topographic segmentation analysis to optimally and automatically identify detailed time-frequency features. This approach, which could effectively exploit the spatial information of oscillatory activities, has been validated in both simulation and real electrocortical studies. Results: Simulation study showed that the proposed approach could successfully identify noise-contaminated time-frequency features if their signal-to-noise ratio was relatively high. Real electrocortical study demonstrated that several time-frequency features with distinct scalp distributions and evident neurophysiological functions were identified when the same analysis was applied on stimulus-elicited TFDs. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach could provide an optimal identification of detailed time-frequency features by making use of their distinct spatial distributions. Conclusions: Our findings illustrated the validity and usefulness of the presented approach in isolating detailed time-frequency features, thus having wide applications in cognitive neuroscience to provide a precise assessment of the functional significance of oscillatory activities.

J	Tsoneva, T; Garcia-Molina, G; Desain, P				Tsoneva, Tsvetomira; Garcia-Molina, Gary; Desain, Peter			Neural dynamics during repetitive visual stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						SSVEP; temporal and spatial dynamics; brain oscillations; entrainment; BCI; steady-state topography	EVOKED POTENTIALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; HZ FLICKER; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN; MEMORY; RESPONSES; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; CORTEX	Objective. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), the brain responses to repetitive visual stimulation (RVS), are widely utilized in neuroscience. Their high signal-to-noise ratio and ability to entrain oscillatory brain activity are beneficial for their applications in brain-computer interfaces, investigation of neural processes underlying brain rhythmic activity (steady-state topography) and probing the causal role of brain rhythms in cognition and emotion. This paper aims at analyzing the space and time EEG dynamics in response to RVS at the frequency of stimulation and ongoing rhythms in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Approach. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to study the oscillatory brain dynamics during RVS at 10 frequencies in the gamma band (40-60 Hz). We collected an extensive EEG data set from 32 participants and analyzed the RVS evoked and induced responses in the time-frequency domain. Main results. Stable SSVEP over parieto-occipital sites was observed at each of the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics and sub-harmonics. Both the strength and the spatial propagation of the SSVEP response seem sensitive to stimulus frequency. The SSVEP was more localized around the parieto-occipital sites for higher frequencies (>54 Hz) and spread to fronto-central locations for lower frequencies. We observed a strong negative correlation between stimulation frequency and relative power change at that frequency, the first harmonic and the sub-harmonic components over occipital sites. Interestingly, over parietal sites for subharmonics a positive correlation of relative power change and stimulation frequency was found. A number of distinct patterns in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) bands were also observed. The transient response, from 0 to about 300 ms after stimulation onset, was accompanied by increase in delta and theta power over fronto-central and occipital sites, which returned to baseline after approx. 500 ms. During the steady-state response, we observed alpha band desynchronization over occipital sites and after 500 ms also over frontal sites, while neighboring areas synchronized. The power in beta band over occipital sites increased during the stimulation period, possibly caused by increase in power at sub-harmonic frequencies of stimulation. Gamma power was also enhanced by the stimulation. Significance. These findings have direct implications on the use of RVS and SSVEPs for neural process investigation through steady-state topography, controlled entrainment of brain oscillations and BCIs. A deep understanding of SSVEP propagation in time and space and the link with ongoing brain rhythms is crucial for optimizing the typical SSVEP applications for studying, assisting, or augmenting human cognitive and sensorimotor function.

However, many viewers have reported various problems which are usually faced after watching 3D movies. These problems include visual fatigue, eye strain, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision or collectively may be termed as visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). This research focuses on the comparison between 3D passive technology with a conventional 2D technology to find that whether 3D is causing trouble in the viewers or not. For this purpose, an experiment was designed in which participants were randomly assigned to watch 2D or a 3D movie. The movie was specially designed to induce VIMS. The movie was shown for the duration of 10 min to every participant. The electroencephalogram (EEG) data was recorded throughout the session. At the end of the session, participants rated their feelings using simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ). The SSQ data was analyzed and the ratings of 2D and 3D participants were compared statistically by using a two tailed t test. From the SSQ results, it was found that participants watching 3D movies reported significantly higher symptoms of VIMS (p value < 0.05). EEG data was analyzed by using MATLAB and topographic plots are created from the data. A significant difference has been observed in the frontal-theta power which increases with the passage of time in 2D condition while decreases with time in 3D condition. Also, a decrease in beta power has been found in the temporal lobe of 3D group. Therefore, it is concluded that there are negative effects of 3D movies causing significant changes in the brain activity in terms of band powers. This condition leads to produce symptoms of VIMS in the viewers.

SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain injury; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Slow oscillations; Sleep spindles	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; EEG ACTIVITY; QUALITY INDEX; SPINDLES; DISTURBANCE; FREQUENCY; INSOMNIA; AGE	Introduction: Sleep complaints are common after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While recent findings suggest that sleep macro-architecture is preserved in mTBI, features of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep micro-architecture including electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power, slow waves (SW), and sleep spindles could be affected. This study aimed to compare NREM sleep in mTBI and healthy controls, and explore whether NREM sleep characteristics correlate with sleep complaints in these groups. Methods: Thirty-four mTBI participants (mean age: 34.2 +/- 11.9 yrs; post-injury delay: 10.5 +/- 10.4 weeks) and 29 age-matched controls (mean age: 32.4 +/- 8.2 yrs) were recruited for two consecutive nights of polysomnographic (PSG) recording. Spectral power was computed and SW and spindles were automatically detected in three derivations (F3, C3, O1) for the first three sleep cycles. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: mTBI participants reported significant poorer sleep quality than controls on the PSQI and showed significant increases in beta power during NREM sleep at the occipital derivation only. Conversely, no group differences were found in SW and spindle characteristics. Interestingly, changes in NREM sleep characteristics were not associated with mTBI estimation of sleep quality. Conclusions: Compared to controls, mTBI were found to have enhanced NREM beta power. However, these changes were not found to be associated with the subjective evaluation of sleep. While increases in beta bands during NREM sleep may be attributable to the occurrence of a brain injury, they could also be related to the presence of pain and anxiety as suggested in one prior study.

Physical fitness has been found beneficial to cognitive performance in a wide age population. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between physical fitness and resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in children with ADHD. EEG was recorded during eyes-open resting for 28 children (23 boys and 5 girls, 8.66 +/- 1.10 years) with ADHD, and a battery of physical fitness assessments including flexibility, muscular endurance, power, and agility tests were administered. The results indicated that ADHD children with higher power fitness exhibited a smaller theta/alpha ratio than those with lower power fitness. These findings suggest that power fitness may be associated with improved attentional self-control in children with ADHD.

The current study determined whether experimental sleep restriction had an effect on experimentally induced pain and pain-elicited electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Design: A paired crossover study. Intervention: Pain testing was performed after 2 nights of 50% SR and after 2 nights with habitual sleep (HS). Setting: Laboratory experiment at research center. Participants: Self-reported healthy volunteers (n = 21, age range: 18-31 y). Measurements and Results: Brief high-density electrical stimuli to the forearm skin produced pinprick-like pain. Subjective pain ratings increased after SR, but only in response to the highest stimulus intensity (P = 0.018). SR increased the magnitude of the pain-elicited EEG response analyzed in the time-frequency domain (P = 0.021). Habituation across blocks did not differ between HS and SR. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was reduced after SR (P = 0.039). Pressure pain threshold of the trapezius muscle region also decreased after SR (P = 0.017). Conclusion: Sleep restriction (SR) increased the sensitivity to pressure pain and to electrically induced pain of moderate, but not low, intensity. The increased electrical pain could not be explained by a difference in habituation. Increased response magnitude is possibly related to reduced processing within the somatosensory cortex after partial SR.

The discovery of processing stages: Analyzing EEG data with hidden semi-Markov models	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Associative recognition; Processing stages; EEG; Hidden semi-Markov models	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; FORWARD-BACKWARD ALGORITHM; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; TIME-COURSE; ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; WORD-FREQUENCY; RETRIEVAL	In this paper we propose a new method for identifying processing stages in human information processing. Since the 1860s scientists have used different methods to identify processing stages, usually based on reaction time (RT) differences between conditions. To overcome the limitations of RT-based methods we used hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) to analyze EEG data. This HSMM-EEG methodology can identify stages of processing and how they vary with experimental condition. By combining this information with the brain signatures of the identified stages one can infer their function, and deduce underlying cognitive processes. To demonstrate the method we applied it to an associative recognition task. The stage-discovery method indicated that three major processes play a role in associative recognition: a familiarity process, an associative retrieval process, and a decision process. We conclude that the new stage-discovery method can provide valuable insight into human information processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Theta and Alpha Band Modulations Reflect Error-Related Adjustments in the Auditory Condensation Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; errors; time-frequency decomposition; theta oscillations; alpha oscillations; post-error adaptations; post-error trials	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EEG DYNAMICS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; GENERIC METHOD; CONFLICT; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION	Error commission leads to adaptive adjustments in a number of brain networks that subserve goal-directed behavior, resulting in either enhanced stimulus processing or increased motor threshold depending on the nature of errors committed. Here, we studied these adjustments by analyzing post error modulations of alpha and theta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Errors were followed by increased frontal midline theta (FMT) activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression in the parietal and the left central regions; parietal alpha suppression correlated with the task performance, left central alpha suppression correlated with the post-error slowing, and FMT increase correlated with both behavioral measures. On post-error correct trials, left-central alpha band suppression started earlier before the response, and the response was followed by weaker FMT activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression distributed over the entire scalp. These findings indicate that several separate neuronal networks are involved in post-error adjustments, including the midfrontal performance monitoring network, the parietal attentional network, and the sensorimotor network. Supposedly, activity within these networks is rapidly modulated after errors, resulting in optimization of their functional state on the subsequent trials, with corresponding changes in behavioral measures.

Scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 12 human observers viewing natural images of objects at a rapid frequency of 5.88 images/s for 60 s. Natural images of faces were interleaved every five stimuli, i.e., at 1.18 Hz (5.88/5). Face categorization was indexed by a high signal-to-noise ratio response, specifically at an oddball face stimulation frequency of 1.18 Hz and its harmonics. This face-selective periodic EEG response was highly significant for every participant, even for a single 60-s sequence, and was generally localized over the right occipitotemporal cortex. The periodicity constraint and the large selection of stimuli ensured that this selective response to natural face images was free of low-level visual confounds, as confirmed by the absence of any oddball response for phase-scrambled stimuli. Without any subtraction procedure, time-domain analysis revealed a sequence of differential face-selective EEG components between 120 and 400 ms after oddball face image onset, progressing from medial occipital (P1-faces) to occipitotemporal (N1-faces) and anterior temporal (P2-faces) regions. Overall, this fast periodic visual stimulation approach provides a direct signature of natural face categorization and opens an avenue for efficiently measuring categorization responses of complex visual stimuli in the human brain.

By using this system we would like to investigate the education training effect on cognitive state in a mental retardation child in four years. The aim of special education is to make adaptations, accommodations and modification that allow a child with a mental retardation to succeed in classroom. This education training separated into two systems, resting state and studying state. After the measurement, we calculated the EEG power spectrum of alpha, theta bands and the low frequency power (LF), high frequency power (HF), and LH/HF value from the RR interval in ECG. At the same time we calculated the changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin ([oxy-Hb]). The result in studying state showed theta power is lower than beta power in study state in the other hand beta power is lower than theta power in resting state From LF/HF activity we could know that sympathetic activity is increasing and from the result that has obtained from ECG, the parasympathetic activity is decreasing the time. NIRS showed the increasing in study states and decreasing in resting states at Fp2 area from oxyhemoglobin analysis.

They are known to influence behavior, especially in gambling scenarios. Previous neuroimaging studies have described an 'anomalous' activity of brain reward areas following these events. The goal of the present research was to study electrophysiological correlates of near-misses in the expectation and outcome phases. Electroencephalography was recorded while participants were playing a simplified version of a slot machine. Four possible outcomes (gain, near-miss, loss and no-information) were presented in a pseudorandom order to ensure fixed proportions. Results from the time-frequency analysis for the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (9-13 Hz), low beta (15-22 Hz) and beta-gamma (25-35 Hz) frequency-bands presented larger power increases for wins and near-misses compared with losses. In the anticipation phase, power changes were lower than in the resolution phase. The current results are in agreement with previous studies showing that near-miss events recruit brain areas of the reward network. Likewise, the oscillatory activity in near-misses is very similar to the one elicited in the gain condition. In addition, present findings suggest that oscillatory activity in the expectation phase does not play a crucial role in near-miss events.

Recent conceptual and empirical work has pointed to pre-target brain states as potential mediators of the AB effect. The current study examined differences in pre-target electrophysiology between correctly and incorrectly reported trials, considering amplitude and phase measures of alpha oscillations as well as the steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) evoked by the RSVP stream. For incorrectly reported trials, relatively lower alpha-band power and greater ssVEP inter-trial phase locking were observed during extended time periods preceding presentation of the first target. These results suggest that facilitated processing of the pre-target distracter stream indexed by reduced alpha and heightened phase locking characterizes a dynamic brain state that predicts lower accuracy in terms of reporting the second target under strict temporal constraints. Findings align with hypotheses in which the AB effect is attributed to neurocognitive factors such as fluctuations in pre-target attention or to cognitive strategies applied at the trial level.

It is less clear whether selective attention also improves the precision of a stimulus already represented in memory. Here, we investigate the behavioral and neural dynamics of selective attention to representations in auditory working memory (i.e., auditory objects) using psychophysical modeling and model-based analysis of electroencephalographic signals. Human listeners performed a syllable pitch discrimination task where two syllables served as to-be-encoded auditory objects. Valid (vs neutral) retroactive cues were presented during retention to allow listeners to selectively attendto the to-be-probed auditory object in memory. Behaviorally, listeners represented auditory objects in memory more precisely(expressed by steeper slopes of a psychometric curve) and made faster perceptual decisions when valid compared to neutral retrocues were presented. Neurally, valid compared to neutral retrocues elicited a larger frontocentral sustained negativity in the evoked potential as well as enhanced parietal alpha/low-beta oscillatory power (9-18 Hz) during memory retention. Critically, individual magnitudes of alpha oscillatory power (7-11Hz) modulation predicted the degree to which valid retrocues benefitted individuals' behavior. Our results indicate that selective attention to a specific object in auditory memory does benefit human performance not by simply reducing memory load, but by actively engaging complementary neural resources to sharpen the precision of the task-relevant object in memory.

Methods: Evidences were reviewed in subjects with MCI, who underwent EEG recording, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and memory evaluation. Alpha3/alpha2 power ratio (alpha2 8.9-10.9 Hz range; alpha3 10.9-12.9 Hz range), cortical thickness, linear EEG coherence, and memory impairment have been evaluated in a large group of 74 patients. A subset of 27 subjects within the same group also underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) evaluation. Results: In MCI subjects with higher EEG upper/low alpha power ratio, a greater temporo-parietal and hippocampal atrophy was found as well as a decrease in regional blood perfusion and memory impairment. In this group, an increase of theta oscillations is associated with a greater interhemispheric coupling between temporal areas. Conclusion: The increase of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio is a promising novel biomarker in identifying MCI subjects at risk for Alzheimer's disease.

CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Review						Epileptic seizure prediction; Electrophysiology; Computational neuroscience; Active EEG; Ambulatory EEG; Micro-electrode; Review	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; INTRACRANIAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RESPONSIVE NEUROSTIMULATION; SUBDURAL ELECTRODES; BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-DENSITY; LARGE-SCALE	This review highlights recent developments in the field of epileptic seizure prediction. We argue that seizure prediction is possible; however, most previous attempts have used data with an insufficient amount of information to solve the problem. The review discusses four methods for gaining more information above standard clinical electrophysiological recordings. We first discuss developments in obtaining long-term data that enables better characterisation of signal features and trends. Then, we discuss the usage of electrical stimulation to probe neural circuits to obtain robust information regarding excitability. Following this, we present a review of developments in high-resolution micro-electrode technologies that enable neuroimaging across spatial scales. Finally, we present recent results from data-driven model-based analyses, which enable imaging of seizure generating mechanisms from clinical electrophysiological measurements. It is foreseeable that the field of seizure prediction will shift focus to a more probabilistic forecasting approach leading to improvements in the quality of life for the millions of people who suffer uncontrolled seizures. However, a missing piece of the puzzle is devices to acquire long-term-high-quality data. When this void is filled, seizure prediction will become a reality.

Recently, functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) have entered into the picture. In the related decoding scheme, FCGs are treated as unstructured data and, hence, their inherent format is overlooked. To alleviate this, tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is incorporated for the parsimonious representation of connectivity data. In addition to the particular methodological innovation, this work also makes a contribution at a conceptual level by encoding in FCGs cross-frequency coupling apart from the conventional frequency-specific interactions. Working memory related tasks, supported by networks oscillating at different frequencies, are good candidates for assessing the novel approach. We employed surface EEG recordings when the subjects were repeatedly performing a mental arithmetic task of five cognitive workload levels. For each trial, an FCG was constructed based on phase interactions within and between Frontal (theta) and Parieto-Occipital (alpha 2) neural activities, which are considered to reflect the function of two distinct working memory subsystems. Based on the TSA representation, a remarkably high correct-recognition-rate (96%) of the task difficulties was achieved using a standard classifier. The overall scheme is computational efficient and therefore potentially useful for real-time and personalized applications.

J	Coll, MP; Bird, G; Catmur, C; Press, C				Coll, Michel-Pierre; Bird, Geoffrey; Catmur, Caroline; Press, Clare			Cross-modal repetition effects in the mu rhythm indicate tactile mirroring during action observation	CORTEX			English	Article						Adaptation; Mirror neurons; Mu rhythm; Somatosensory	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; INFERIOR PARIETAL; EEG EVIDENCE; NEURONS; TOUCH; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; EXECUTION	Similar cortical activations during the experience and observation of touch suggest the presence of a tactile mirroring system. However, the specificity of observation-related activity - i.e., whether observation excites the same representations as experience of that specific tactile stimulation - is still to be established. Furthermore, central mu rhythms are attenuated during the experience and observation of touch, and also during action observation and execution, making it unclear whether they index processing of predominantly tactile or motor features of observed actions. The present study used an electroencephalography (EEG) cross-modal repetition paradigm to assess the relative tactile and motor specificity of mu attenuation during action observation. Two experiments were carried out during which participants executed and observed actions in alternation, and the repetition of either tactile or motor features of the actions were manipulated. The mu signal over central electrodes varied as a function of tactile repetition, consistent with the claim of a tactile mirroring system and its reflection in the mu signal. Of note was the fact that mu attenuation was sensitive only to manipulation of tactile not motor properties of actions, suggesting that caution should be employed when interpreting mu effects during action observation as reflective of motor mirroring.

Therefore, since most of the commercially available EEG acquisition systems are focused on the low frequency signals, a wide-band EEG recorder is here presented. The proposed system is designed for those applications in which a wearable and user-friendly device is required. Using a standard Bluetooth (BT) module to transfers the acquired signals to a remote back-end, it can be easily interfaced with the nowadays widely spread smartphones or tablets by means of a mobile-based application. A Component Off-The-Shelf (COTS) device was designed on a 19 cm 2 custom PCB with a low-power 8-channel acquisition module and a 24-bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The presented system, validated through in-vivo experiments, allows EEG signals recording at different sample rates, with a maximum bandwidth of 524 Hz, and exhibits a maximum power consumption of 270mW.

To that end, isotonic flexion/extension knee movements will be analyzed. Particularly, the decoding performance of healthy and incomplete spinal cord injured subjects will be assessed to determine the behavior of this methodology with motor disabled people. When studying cortical activity during walking, the appearance of muscular artifacts severely influences the EEG signals recorded. The analysis of single joint movements should decrease the noise provoked by the gait process itself. Additionally, different time windows prior to the decoded angle will be assessed to obtain a more reliable decoder. The results show that decoding performance is significantly above chance for most of the subjects (both healthy and disabled) and suggests that meaningful information of the movement planning starts around 2.5 seconds prior to the decoded angle.

Fast electro-encephalographic (EEG) oscillations, which typically originate from frontal regions, have been reported to be markedly reduced in schizophrenia. Methods: Here we employed TMS/EEG to assess the natural frequency of the premotor area in a sample of 48 age-matched participants (12 each in major depression disorder (MDD)), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and healthy controls. Event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were obtained for each study participant using wavelet decomposition. Results: TMS resulted in a significant activation of the beta/gamma band response (21-50 Hz) to frontal cortical perturbation in healthy control subjects. By contrast, the main frequencies of frontal EEG responses to TMS were significantly reduced in patients with BPD, MDD and SCZ (11-27 Hz) relative to healthy subjects. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia showed a significantly lower natural frequency of frontal cortico-thalamocortical circuits compared to healthy controls. These results suggest a common neurobiological mechanism of corticothalamic impairment. The most likely candidates include dysfunction of GABAergic circuits. Limitations: Further studies are needed to consider other biological markers, gene variants and their interaction with clinical variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we tested for the first time whether verbal cueing during sleep can improve vocabulary learning. We cued prior learned Dutch words either during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) or during active or passive waking. Re-exposure to Dutch words during sleep improved later memory for the German translation of the cued words when compared with uncued words. Recall of uncued words was similar to an additional group receiving no verbal cues during sleep. Furthermore, verbal cueing failed to improve memory during active and passive waking. High-density electroencephalographic recordings revealed that successful verbal cueing during NonREM sleep is associated with a pronounced frontal negativity in eventrelated potentials, a higher frequency of frontal slow waves as well as a cueing-related increase in right frontal and left parietal oscillatory theta power. Our results indicate that verbal cues presented during NonREM sleep reactivate associated memories, and facilitate later recall of foreign vocabulary without impairing ongoing consolidation processes. Likewise, our oscillatory analysis suggests that both sleep-specific slow waves as well as theta oscillations (typically associated with successful memory encoding during wakefulness) might be involved in strengthening memories by cueing during sleep.

Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) is a promising tool for the diagnosis of ADHD. Recently, theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling (TGC) measurement has received attention because it is a feasible method of assessing brain function. We investigated the relationship between CPT performance and EEG measures such as TGC and theta and gamma activity. EEGs were recorded from 68 volunteers from a camp for hyperactive children using a 19-electrode system. Their TGC, theta and 40 Hz gamma activity were estimated and compared with results obtained on the Korean ADHD Rating Scale (KARS) and the Intermediate Visual and Auditory (IVA) CPT. The results demonstrated significant negative partial correlations between TGC and the IVA CPT, such as the Response Control Quotient (RCQ) and Attention Quotient (AQ). TGC successfully identified the level of dysfunctional interaction of the attention/arousal system at a multi-scale large network level. It is thought that as the TGC increases, the efficacy of the system is very low or dysfunctional. Compensatory hyper-arousal patterns of the dysfunctional attention/arousal system may account for this effect. TGC is a promising neurophysiological marker for ADHD behavior in children.

Here hybrid algorithm is a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Time Domain Morphological Gradient (TDMG). To analyze biological signals like ECG, EEG, EMG, Time - Frequency domain is suited method to provide both time and frequency information of a signal. To analyze non stationary signals, DWT is selected compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Short - Time Fourier Transform. A DWT gives better analysis in time - Frequency plane of the ECG signal, Haar as a mother wavelet function. Since Haar is simple of all wavelets, it reduces computation time and logic. These initial fiducial points can be refined using Time-Domain morphological properties of ECG and reduced temporal resolution of DWT is alleviated. From available PTBDB & QTDB ECG databases, the ECG samples are taken and CSE tolerance limits are satisfied. The ECG signal processed easily in a DSP processor. The obtained results using DSP Processor showed desired performance.	[Pullaiah, K.

Hippocampal spindles have been considered a physiological phenomenon, an evoked response to afferent epileptic discharges, or even the expression of an epileptic manifestation. To address this question, we investigated the presence and rate of hippocampal spindles in focal pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients undergoing scalp-intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG). Design: Sleep recording with scalp-intracerebral EEG. Setting: Tertiary referral epilepsy center. Patients: Twenty-five epilepsy patients (extratemporal: n = 6, temporal: n = 15, and multifocal including the temporal lobe: n = 4). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: We analyzed associations between hippocampal spindles and hippocampal electrophysiological findings (interictal spiking, seizure onset zone) and magnetic resonance imaging volumetry. Sixteen of 25 patients (64%) had hippocampal spindles (extratemporal epilepsy: 6/6; temporal epilepsy: 10/15; and multifocal epilepsy: 0/4; P = 0.005). Median spindle rate was 0.6 (range, 0.1-8.6)/min in nonrapid eye movement sleep. Highest spindle rates were found in hippocampi of patients with extratemporal epilepsy (P < 0.001). A negative association was found between hippocampal spiking activity and spindle rate (P = 0.003). We found no association between the presence (n = 21) or absence (n = 17) of hippocampal seizure onset zone and hippocampal spindle rate (P = 0.114), and between a normal (n = 30) or atrophic (n = 8) hippocampus and hippocampal spindle rate (P = 0.195). Conclusions: Hippocampal spindles represent a physiological phenomenon, with an expression that is diminished in epilepsy affecting the temporal lobe. Hippocampal spiking lowered the rate of hippocampal spindles, suggesting that epileptic discharges may at least in part be a transformation of these physiological events, similar to the hypothesis considering generalized spike-and-waves a transformation of frontal spindles.

Power-law dynamics in neuronal and behavioral data introduce spurious correlations	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						correlations; significance testing; power-law signals; LRTC; EEG; oscillations	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; PREFRONTAL THETA OSCILLATIONS; FMRI TIME-SERIES; ACTIVITY FLUCTUATIONS; COLORED NOISE; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; ALPHA; PRESTIMULUS; PREDICT	Relating behavioral and neuroimaging measures is essential to understanding human brain function. Often, this is achieved by computing a correlation between behavioral measures, e.g., reaction times, and neurophysiological recordings, e.g., prestimulus EEG alpha-power, on a single-trial-basis. This approach treats individual trials as independent measurements and ignores the fact that data are acquired in a temporal order. It has already been shown that behavioral measures as well as neurophysiological recordings display power-law dynamics, which implies that trials are not in fact independent. Critically, computing the correlation coefficient between two measures exhibiting long-range temporal dependencies may introduce spurious correlations, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the relationship between brain activity and behavioral measures. Here, we address data-analytic pitfalls which may arise when long-range temporal dependencies in neural as well as behavioral measures are ignored. We quantify the influence of temporal dependencies of neural and behavioral measures on the observed correlations through simulations. Results are further supported in analysis of real EEG data recorded in a simple reaction time task, where the aim is to predict the latency of responses on the basis of prestimulus alpha oscillations. We show that it is possible to "predict" reaction times from one subject on the basis of EEG activity recorded in another subject simply owing to the fact that both measures display power-law dynamics. The same is true when correlating EEG activity obtained from different subjects. A surrogate-data procedure is described which correctly tests for the presence of correlation while controlling for the effect of power-law dynamics. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2901-2914, 2015.

Jenson et al. (2014) used independent component analysis (ICA) and event related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data to describe anterior sensorimotor (e.g., premotor cortex, PMC) activity during speech perception and production. The purpose of the current study was to identify and temporally map neural activity from posterior (i.e., auditory) regions of the dorsal stream in the same tasks. Perception tasks required "active" discrimination of syllable pairs Vba/ and /da/) in quiet and noisy conditions. Production conditions required overt production of syllable pairs and nouns. ICA performed on concatenated raw 68 channel EEG data from all tasks identified bilateral "auditory" alpha (a) components in 15 of 29 participants localized to pSTG (left) and pMTG (right). ERSP analyses were performed to reveal fluctuations in the spectral power of the is rhythm clusters across time. Production conditions were characterized by significant is event related synchronization (ERS; pFDR < 0.05) concurrent with EMG activity from speech production, consistent with speechinduced auditory inhibition. Discrimination conditions were also characterized by is ERS following stimulus offset. Auditory is ERS in all conditions temporally aligned with PMC activity reported in Jenson et al. (2014). These findings are indicative of speechinduced suppression of auditory regions, possibly via efference copy. The presence of the same pattern following stimulus offset in discrimination conditions suggests that sensorimotor contributions following speech perception reflect covert replay, and that covert replay provides one source of the motor activity previously observed in some speech perception tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first time that inhibition of auditory regions by speech has been observed in real-time with the ICA/ERSP technique.

J	Frauscher, B; von Ellenrieder, N; Dubeau, F; Gotman, J				Frauscher, Birgit; von Ellenrieder, Nicolas; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean			Scalp spindles are associated with widespread intracranial activity with unexpectedly low synchrony	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Hippocampus; Human; Insula; Sleep physiology; Non-rapid eye movement sleep	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN RHYTHMS; EEG; HUMANS; DENSITY; MEG	In humans, the knowledge of intracranial correlates of spindles is mainly gathered from noninvasive neurophysiologic and functional imaging studies which provide an indirect estimate of neuronal intracranial activity. This potential limitation can be overcome by intracranial electroencephalography used in presurgical epilepsy evaluation. We investigated the intracranial correlates of scalp spindles using combined scalp and intracerebral depth electrodes covering the frontal, parietal and temporal neocortex, and the scalp and intracranial correlates of hippocampal and insula spindles in 35 pre-surgical epilepsy patients. Spindles in the scalp were accompanied by widespread cortical increases in sigma band energy (10-16 Hz): the highest percentages were observed in the frontoparietal lateral and mesial cortex, whereas in temporal lateral and mesial structures only a low or no simultaneous increase was present. This intracranial involvement during scalp spindles showed no consistent pattern, and exhibited unexpectedly low synchrony across brain regions. Hippocampal spindles were shorter and spatially restricted with a low synchrony even within the temporal lobe. Similar results were found for the insula. We suggest that the generation of spindles is under a high local cortical influence contributing to the concept of sleep as a local phenomenon and challenging the notion of spindles as widespread synchronous oscillations.

The aim of the study was to determine whether sleep influences the spread of IEDs over the scalp and whether their distribution depends on vigilance-related modifications in cortical interactions. Methods: Wake and sleep 256-channel electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded in 12 subjects with right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) differentiated by whether they had mesial or neocortical TLE. Spikes were selected during wake and sleep. The averaged waking signal was subtracted from the sleep signal and projected on a bidimensional scalp map; sleep and wake spike distributions were compared by using a t-test. The superimposed signal of sleep and wake traces was obtained; the rising phase of the spike, the peak, and the deflections following the spike were identified, and their cortical generator was calculated using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for each group. Results: A mean of 21 IEDs in wake and 39 in sleep per subject were selected. As compared to wake, a larger IED scalp projection was detected during sleep in both mesial and neocortical TLE (p < 0.05). A series of EEG deflections followed the spike, the cortical sources of which displayed alternating activations of different cortical areas in wake, substituted by isolated, stationary activations in sleep in mesial TLE and a silencing in neocortical TLE. Conclusion: During sleep, the IED scalp region increases, while cortical interaction decreases. Significance: The interaction of cortical modules in sleep and wake in TLE may influence the appearance of IEDs on scalp EEG; in addition, IEDs could be proxies for cerebral oscillation perturbation.

Sleep slow waves are present during this stage and have been shown to include a deactivated ('down', hyperpolarized) and an activated state ('up', depolarized). The 'up' state enhances physiological rhythms, and we hypothesize that sleep slow waves and particularly the 'up' state are the specific components of non-rapid eye movement sleep that mediate the activation of epileptic activity. We investigated eight patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsies who underwent combined scalp-intracerebral electroencephalography for diagnostic evaluation. We analysed 259 frontal electroencephalographic channels, and manually marked 442 epileptic spikes and 8487 high frequency oscillations during high amplitude widespread slow waves, and during matched control segments with low amplitude widespread slow waves, non-widespread slow waves or no slow waves selected during the same sleep stages (total duration of slow wave and control segments: 49 min each). During the slow waves, spikes and high frequency oscillations were more frequent than during control segments (79% of spikes during slow waves and 65% of high frequency oscillations, both P similar to 0). The spike and high frequency oscillation density also increased for higher amplitude slow waves. We compared the density of spikes and high frequency oscillations between the 'up' and 'down' states. Spike and high frequency oscillation density was highest during the transition from the 'up' to the 'down' state. Interestingly, high frequency oscillations in channels with normal activity expressed a different peak at the transition from the 'down' to the 'up' state. These results show that the apparent activation of epileptic discharges by non-rapid eye movement sleep is not a state-dependent phenomenon but is predominantly associated with specific events, the high amplitude widespread slow waves that are frequent, but not continuous, during this state of sleep. Both epileptic spikes and high frequency oscillations do not predominate, like physiological activity, during the 'up' state but during the transition from the 'up' to the 'down' state of the slow wave, a period of high synchronization. Epileptic discharges appear therefore more associated with synchronization than with excitability. Furthermore, high frequency oscillations in channels devoid of epileptic activity peak differently during the slow wave cycle from those in channels with epileptic activity. This property may allow differentiating physiological from pathological high frequency oscillations, a problem that is unresolved until now.

Changes in the sleep and wake stages are accompanied by changes in the frequency spectrum of the EEG signals; so, the features extracted from the 5-s epoch of the EEG using auto-regressive (AR) coefficients were used to represent EEG signals of different sleep and wake stages. The proposed fast classification method was based on partial least squares regression (PLS), which was used to classify these features by finding an optimum beta using K-fold cross validation. The Physionet database was used to confirm accuracy and speed of the proposed classification system. This system could be used in real-time implementations because of its high classification rate, speed and capability to be implemented on hardware owing to be very comfortable. Finally, results of the PLS were compared with those of other classifiers such as k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN), linear discriminant classifier (LDC) and Bayes. We achieved 91% classification accuracy by selecting PIS as the classifier. These comparisons revealed that the proposed algorithm could recognize an emergency situation in less than 1 s with high accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(No) time for control: Frontal theta dynamics reveal the cost of temporally guided conflict anticipation	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Functional connectivity; Timing; Oscillatory dynamics	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; EEG DYNAMICS; ATTENTION; EXPECTATION; SELECTION; CUE	During situations of response conflict, cognitive control is characterized by prefrontal theta-band (3- to 8-Hz) activity. It has been shown that cognitive control can be triggered proactively by contextual cues that predict conflict. Here, we investigated whether a pretrial preparation interval could serve as such a cue. This would show that the temporal contingencies embedded in the task can be used to anticipate upcoming conflict. To this end, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 30 human subjects while they performed a version of a Simon task in which the duration of a fixation cross between trials predicted whether the next trial would contain response conflict. Both their behavior and EEG activity showed a consistent but unexpected pattern of results: The conflict effect (increased reaction times and decreased accuracy on conflict as compared to nonconflict trials) was stronger when conflict was cued, and this was associated with stronger conflict-related midfrontal theta activity and functional connectivity. Interestingly, intervals that predicted conflict did show a pretarget increase in midfrontal theta power. These findings suggest that temporally guided expectations of conflict do heighten conflict anticipation, but also lead to less efficiently applied reactive control. We further explored this post-hoc interpretation by means of three behavioral followup experiments, in which we used nontemporal cues, semantically informative cues, and neutral cues. Together, this body of results suggests that the counterintuitive cost of conflict cueing may not be uniquely related to the temporal domain, but may instead be related to the implicitness and validity of the cue.

Social exclusion modulates event-related frontal theta and tracks ostracism distress in children	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Theta oscillations; Social exclusion; Ostracism; Medial frontal cortex; Children; Event-related spectral perturbations	PEER REJECTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; EEG-ALPHA; RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; CHILDHOOD	Social exclusion is a potent elicitor of distress. Previous studies have shown that medial frontal theta oscillations are modulated by the experience of social exclusion. Using the Cyberball paradigm, we examined event-related dynamics of theta power in the EEG at medial frontal sites while children aged 8-12 years were exposed to conditions of fair play and social exclusion. Using an event-related design, we found that medial frontal theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) increase during both early (i.e., 200-400ms) and late (i.e., 400-800ms) processing of rejection events during social exclusion relative to perceptually identical "not my turn" events during inclusion. Importantly, we show that only for the later time window (400-800 ms) slow-wave theta power tracks self-reported ostracism distress. Specifically, greater theta power at medial frontal sites to "rejection" events predicted higher levels of ostracism distress. Alpha and beta oscillations for rejection events were unrelated to ostracism distress at either 200-400 ms or 400-800 ms time windows. Our findings extend previous studies by showing that medial frontal theta oscillations for rejection events are a neural signature of social exclusion, linked to experienced distress in middle childhood.

Here we explore the neurophysiology of visual food cue-reactivity in overweight and obese women, as compared with normal weight women, by assessing differences in cortical arousal and attentional processing elicited by food and neutral image inserts in a Stroop task with record of EEG spectral band power and ERP responses. Results show excess right frontal (F-8) and left central (C-3) relative beta band activity in overweight women during food task performance (indicative of pronounced early visual cue-reactivity) and blunted prefrontal (F-p, and F-p2) theta band activity in obese women during office task performance (suggestive of executive dysfunction). Moreover, as compared to normal weight women, food images elicited greater right parietal (P-4) ERP P200 amplitude in overweight women (denoting pronounced early attentional processing) and shorter right parietal (P-4) ERP P300 latency in obese women (signifying enhanced and efficient maintained attentional processing). Differential measures of cortical arousal and attentional processing showed significant correlations with self-reported eating behaviour and body shape dissatisfaction, as well as with objectively assessed percent fat mass. The findings of the present study suggest that heightened food cue-reactivity can be neurophysiologically measured, that different neural circuits are implicated in the pathogenesis of overweight and obesity, and that EEG techniques may serve useful in the identification of endophenotypic markers associated with an increased risk of externally mediated food consumption.

While very promising, MI-BCIs remain barely used outside laboratories because of the difficulty encountered by users to control them. Indeed, although some users obtain good control performances after training, a substantial proportion remains unable to reliably control an MI-BCI. This huge variability in user-performance led the community to look for predictors of MI-BCI control ability. However, these predictors were only explored for motor-imagery based BCIs, and mostly for a single training session per subject. In this study, 18 participants were instructed to learn to control an EEG-based MI-BCI by performing 3 MI-tasks, 2 of which were non-motor tasks, across 6 training sessions, on 6 different days. Relationships between the participants' BCI control performances and their personality, cognitive profile and neurophysiological markers were explored. While no relevant relationships with neurophysiological markers were found, strong correlations between MI-BCI performances and mental-rotation scores (reflecting spatial abilities) were revealed. Also, a predictive model of MI-BCI performance based on psychometric questionnaire scores was proposed. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation process revealed the stability and reliability of this model: it enabled to predict participants' performance with a mean error of less than 3 points. This study determined how users' profiles impact their MI-BCI control ability and thus clears the way for designing novel MI-BCI training protocols, adapted to the profile of each user.

NEURAL OSCILLATORY CORRELATES OF DURATION MAINTENANCE IN WORKING MEMORY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						temporal information; duration; working memory; neural oscillation	TEMPORAL REPRODUCTION; STIMULUS-DURATION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; RETENTION; ARTIFACTS	Working memory (WM) is a core element of temporal information processing, but little is known about the internal representation and neuronal underpinnings of the duration maintenance in WM. The neural oscillations during maintenance of duration in WM were examined using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The EEG results showed that theta amplitude was not modulated by the length of duration retained in WM, while alpha amplitude decreased in a 4-s duration condition compared with 1-s, 2-s, and 3-s duration conditions. The amplitude of alpha power positively correlated with accuracy for the 3-s duration condition. The results suggest that alpha activity is involved in duration maintenance in WM. Our study provides electrophysiological evidence that different internal representations are retained in WM for durations below and above about 3 s. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recent proposals have suggested a strong link between predictive coding accounts of the hierarchical flow of information in the brain, and oscillatory neural dynamics in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. We propose that findings relating beta and gamma oscillations to sentence-level language comprehension might be unified under such a predictive coding account. Our suggestion is that oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range may reflect both the active maintenance of the current network configuration responsible for representing the sentence-level meaning under construction, and the top-down propagation of predictions to hierarchically lower processing levels based on that representation. In addition, we suggest that oscillatory activity in the low and middle gamma range reflect the matching of top-down predictions with bottom-up linguistic input, while evoked high gamma might reflect the propagation of bottom-up prediction errors to higher levels of the processing hierarchy. We also discuss some of the implications of this predictive coding framework, and we outline ideas for how these might be tested experimentally. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used multi-electrode EEG, analyzed with multitaper spectral methods and video recording of body movement to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity in 36 infants 0-6 months old when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia. During maintenance: (1) slow-delta oscillations were present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerged around 4 months; (3) unlike adults, all infants lacked frontal alpha predominance and coherence. Alpha power was greatest during maintenance, compared to awake and emergence in infants at 4-6 months. During emergence, theta and alpha power decreased with decreasing sevoflurane concentration in infants at 4-6 months. These EEG dynamic differences are likely due to developmental factors including regional differences in synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex. We demonstrate the need to apply age-adjusted analytic approaches to develop neurophysiologic-based strategies for pediatric anesthetic state monitoring.

In this study, an S-estimator method is proposed to describe the course of global synchronization in multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) from awake to sleep in 11 patients with ESES. The study confirms that there is a significant increase in spikes and global synchronization from awake to sleep. It is also found that global synchronization is strongly correlated with spikes. The proposed method has the potential of revealing the intrinsic features of EEG signals and the underlying brain dynamics in ESES.

Institutionalized children showed higher RP of alpha rhythm in seven loci (frontal polar, anterior temporal, posterior temporal and left occipital derivations), lower RP of theta rhythm in eight loci (frontal polar, frontal, anterior temporal and posterior temporal derivations). In addition, RP of beta- and gamma-rhythms were decreased in the left anterior temporal area. These results suggest that institutionalized children show impaired development of CNS, in particular development of limbic system and neocortex, probably are caused by early social deprivation.

Brain oscillations represent the combined electrical activity of neuronal assemblies, usually measured as specific frequencies representing slower (delta, theta, alpha) and faster (beta, gamma) oscillations. Hypnosis has been most closely linked to power in the theta band and changes in gamma activity. These oscillations are thought to play a critical role in both the recording and recall of declarative memory and emotional limbic circuits. The authors propose that this role may be the mechanistic link between theta (and perhaps gamma) oscillations and hypnosis, specifically, that the increases in theta oscillations and changes in gamma activity observed with hypnosis may underlie some hypnotic responses. If these hypotheses are supported, they have important implications for both understanding the effects of hypnosis and for enhancing response to hypnotic treatments.

Normative amplitude-integrated EEG measures in preterm infants	JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY			English	Article							SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; SEIZURE DETECTION; BRAIN-INJURY; MATURATION; IMPAIRMENT; PATTERNS; PREDICTS; OUTCOMES; BORN	OBJECTIVE: Assessing qualitative patterns of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) maturation of preterm infants requires personnel with training in interpretation and an investment of time. Quantitative algorithms provide a method for rapidly and reproducibly assessing an aEEG recording independent of provider skill level. Although there are several qualitative and quantitative normative data sets in the literature, this study provides the broadest array of quantitative aEEG measures in a carefully selected and followed cohort of preterm infants with mild or no visible injury on term-equivalent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequently normal neurodevelopment at 2 and 7 years of age. STUDY DESIGN: A two-channel aEEG recording was obtained on days 4, 7, 14 and 28 of life for infants born <= 30 weeks estimated gestational age. Measures of amplitude and continuity, spectral edge frequency, percentage of trace in interburst interval (IBI), IBI length and frequency counts of smooth delta waves, delta brushes and theta bursts were obtained. MRI was obtained at term-equivalent age and neurodevelopmental testing was conducted at 2 and 7 years of corrected age. RESULT: Correlations were found between increasing postmenstrual age (PMA) and decreasing maximum amplitude (R = -0.23, P = 0.05), increasing minimum amplitude (R = 0.46, P = 0.002) and increasing spectral edge frequency (R = 0.78, P = 4.17 x 10(-14)). Negative correlations were noted between increasing PMA and counts of smooth delta waves (R = -0.39, P = 0.001), delta brushes (R = -0.37, P = 0.003) and theta bursts (R = -0.61, P = 5.66 x 10(-8)). Increasing PMA was also associated with a decreased amount of time spent in the IBI (R = -0.38, P = 0.001) and a shorter length of the maximum IBI (R = -0.27, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This analysis supports a strong correlation between quantitatively determined aEEG measures and PMA, in a cohort of preterm infants with normal term-equivalent age neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 7 years of age, which is both predictable and reproducible. These 'normative' quantitative values support the pattern of maturation previously identified by qualitative analysis.	[Vesoulis, Z. A.; Mathur, A.

Predictive timing functions of cortical beta oscillations are impaired in Parkinson's disease and influenced by L-DOPA and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus Impaired beta-band timing functions in PD	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Interval timing; Beta oscillations; Subthalamic nucleus; Deep brain stimulation	BASAL GANGLIA; RHYTHM FORMATION; EEG; STATE; MOVEMENTS; DYNAMICS; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; CUES; MEG	Cortex-basal ganglia circuits participate in motor timing and temporal perception, and are important for the dynamic configuration of sensorimotor networks in response to exogenous demands. In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) induces motor performance benefits. Hitherto, little is known concerning contributions of the basal ganglia to sensory facilitation and cortical responses to RAS in PD. Therefore, we conducted an EEG study in 12 PD patients before and after surgery for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and in 12 age-matched controls. Here we investigated the effects of levodopa and STN-DBS on resting-state EEG and on the cortical-response profile to slowand fast RAS in a passive-listening paradigm focusing on beta-band oscillations, which are important for auditory-motor coupling. The beta-modulation profile to RAS in healthy participants was characterized by local peaks preceding and following auditory stimuli. In PD patients RAS failed to induce pre-stimulus beta increases. The absence of pre-stimulus beta-band modulation may contribute to impaired rhythmperception in PD. Moreover, post-stimulus beta-band responseswere highly abnormal during fast RAS in PD patients. Treatmentwith levodopa and STN-DBS reinstated a post-stimulus betamodulation profile similar to controls, while STN-DBS reduced beta-band power in the resting-state. The treatment-sensitivity of beta oscillations suggests that STN-DBS may specifically improve timekeeping functions of cortical beta oscillations during fast auditory pacing. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Reward feedback stimuli elicit high-beta EEG oscillations in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; ACCOUNT; RULES	Reward-related feedback stimuli have been observed to elicit a burst of power in the beta frequency range over frontal areas of the human scalp. Recent discussions have suggested possible neural sources for this activity but there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the question. Here we recorded EEG from participants while they navigated a virtual T-maze to find monetary rewards. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the reward feedback stimuli elicited an increase in beta power (20-30 Hz) over a right-frontal area of the scalp. Source analysis indicated that this signal was produced in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These findings align with previous observations of reward-related beta oscillations in the DLPFC in non-human primates. We speculate that increased power in the beta frequency range following reward receipt reflects the activation of task-related neural assemblies that encode the stimulus-response mapping in working memory.

We show that recent results on Slow Wave Sleep, including our own works, naturally fit within consciousness models. In particular, Sleep Slow Oscillations, namely low-frequency (< 1Hz) oscillations, contain electrophysiological properties (up and down states) able to elicit and quench neural integration during Slow Wave Sleep. The physiological unconsciousness related to the Sleep Slow Oscillation derives from the interplay between spontaneous or evoked wake-like activities (up states) and half-a-second's electrical silences (down states). Sleep Slow Oscillation induces unconsciousness via the formation of parallel and segregated neural activities.

SPATIAL INHIBITION OF RETURN PROMOTES CHANGES IN RESPONSE-RELATED MU AND BETA OSCILLATORY PATTERNS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG oscillatory changes; spatial IOR; response preparation and execution; mu band; beta band; vertical asymmetries	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; VERTICAL ASYMMETRIES; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; TACTILE STIMULATION; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; ALPHA BAND	The possible role that response processes play in Inhibition of Return (IOR), traditionally associated with reduced or inhibited attentional processing of spatially cued target stimuli presented at cue-target intervals longer than 300 ms, is still under debate. Previous psychophysiological studies on response-related Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and IOR have found divergent results. Considering that the ability to optimize our behavior not only resides in our capacity to inhibit the focus of attention from irrelevant information but also to inhibit or reduce motor activation associated with responses to that information, it is conceivable that response processes are also affected by IOR. In the present study, time-frequency (T-F) analyses were performed on EEG oscillatory activity between 2 and 40 Hz to check whether spatial IOR affects response preparation and execution during a visuospatial attention task. To avoid possible spatial stimulus-response compatibility effects and their interaction with the IOR effects, the stimuli were presented along the vertical meridian of the visual field. The results differed between lower and upper visual fields. In the lower visual field spatial IOR was related to a synchronization in the pre-movement mu band at bilateral precentral and central electrodes, and in the post-movement beta band at contralateral precentral and central electrodes, which may be associated with an attention-driven reduction of somatomotor processing prior to the execution of responses to relevant stimuli presented at previously cued locations followed by a post-movement deactivation of motor areas. In the upper visual field, spatial IOR was associated with a decrease in desynchronization around response execution in the beta band at contralateral postcentral electrodes that might indicate a late (last moment) reduction of motor activation when responding to spatially cued targets. The present results suggest that different response processes are affected by spatial IOR depending on the visual field where the target is presented. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a seizure detection algorithm using pattern features of periodogram and an optimized hybrid model based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is proposed. In this algorithm, with introducing a novel feature extraction method, a feature vector based on periodogram is extracted. For this purpose, we define a novel color map of periodogram pattern based on windowing method and modified periodogram. Statistical and frequency features are computed for each one of five rhythms in EEG signals. These rhythms and features are extracted by using a novel scenario that is called Periodogram Pattern Feature (PPF). In this scenario, at first by making a color pattern of periodogram as an estimation of the spectral density, for each signal, a Time-Frequency layout is created. This pattern is divided to some epochs for decomposing the brain rhythms. Also, to optimize the feature vector, ACO algorithm in combination with MLP is used. At last, a perfect set of features with 5 valid items has provided. Moreover, seizure from non-seizure signal has been classified with accuracy of 94.4% using the final optimized features.

Defining regions of interest using cross-frequency coupling in extratemporal lobe epilepsy patients	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						regions of interest; extratemporal lobe epilepsy; cross-frequency coupling; intracranial electroencephalogram; high frequency oscillations; modulation index; eigenvalue decomposition	HZ ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FAST RIPPLES; SLEEP SPINDLES; DELTA-ACTIVITY; NETWORK; PHASE; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS	Objective. Clinicians identify seizure onset zones (SOZs) for resection in an attempt to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the cortical tissue that is indispensible for seizure generation. An automated system is proposed to objectively localize this EZ by identifying regions of interest (ROIs). Methods. Intracranial electroencephalogram recordings were obtained from seven patients presenting with extratemporal lobe epilepsy and the interaction between neuronal rhythms in the form of phase-amplitude coupling was investigated. Modulation of the amplitude of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) by the phase of low frequency oscillations was measured by computing the modulation index (MI). Delta- (0.5-4 Hz) and theta- (4-8 Hz) modulation of HFOs (30-450 Hz) were examined across the channels of a 64-electrode subdural grid. Surrogate analysis was performed and false discovery rates were computed to determine the significance of the modulation observed. Mean MI values were subjected to eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and channels defining the ROIs were selected based on the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. ROIs were compared to the SOZs identified by two independent neurologists. Global coherence values were also computed. Main results. MI was found to capture the seizure in time for six of seven patients and identified ROIs in all seven. Patients were found to have a poorer post-surgical outcome when the number of EVD-selected channels that were not resected increased. Moreover, in patients who experienced a seizure-free outcome (i.e., Engel Class I) all EVD-selected channels were found to be within the resected tissue or immediately adjacent to it. In these Engel Class I patients, delta-modulated HFOs were found to identify more of the channels in the resected tissue compared to theta-modulated HFOs. However, for the Engel Class IV patient, the delta-modulated HFOs did not identify any of the channels in the resected tissue suggesting that the resected tissue was not appropriate, which was also suggested by the Engel Class IV outcome. A sensitivity of 75.4% and a false positive rate of 15.6% were achieved using delta-modulated HFOs in an Engel Class I patient. Significance. LFO-modulated HFOs can be used to identify ROIs in extratemporal lobe patients. Moreover, delta-modulated HFOs may provide more accurate localization of the EZ. These ROIs may result in better surgical outcomes when used to compliment the SOZs identified by clinicians for resection.

Few studies have focused on clinical correlates of cortical activity asymmetry using quantitative electroencephalography. Methods: We retrospectively selected N = 34 L-dopa naive PD subjects who had undergone standardized electroencephalography. We selected N = 18 subjects group-matched by age, sex and hand dominance with normal electroencephalography and no parkinsonism and/or cognitive decline as controls. A Welch's periodogram was applied to electroencephalographic signal epochs recorded from homologous pairs of electrodes over each hemisphere. An index of lateralization was then obtained as the absolute value of the electroencephalographic asymmetry index, computed by subtracting left from right-sided log power spectral density for each homologous site and frequency band. A standardized L-dopa acute challenge test was performed on all PD subjects to compute short-duration response magnitude. Results: In mid/lateral frontal regions higher index of lateralization for the beta band (p = 0.015) and lower index of lateralization for the theta band (p = 0.036) were found in PD subjects as compared to controls. Both parameters correlated with Hoehn-Yahr staging (beta: r = 0.428, p = 0.012; theta: r = 0.464, p = 0.006). In occipital region lower index of lateralization for the alpha band was found in PD correlating with L-dopa short-duration response magnitude (r = 0.456; p = 0.007).

Neuroimaging studies relate interference control to 4-7Hz (theta) neural activity in a network spanning prefrontal, anterior cingulate (ACC), and parietal cortices. The mechanism of communication in this network and how it is disrupted in schizophrenia are unclear. Behavioral performance and EEG theta oscillations were examined in a Stroop color-word interference task in 17 healthy controls (HC) and 14SZ patients. Color-word incongruence induced less theta power increase in SZ than in HC around 400ms and 600-900ms after word onset in ACC, left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior parietal regions. Coupling of ACC theta phase to MFG gamma amplitude, indexing interregional communication, was weaker in SZ than in HC. Results suggest ACC-MFG theta power modulation as a mechanism of interference control that supports executive function and is disrupted in schizophrenia.

In the framework of IMI PharmaCog project (Grant Agreement no 115009, www.pharmacog.org), we tested the hypothesis that spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of motor and locomotor activity in gray mouse lemurs reflect typical movement-related desynchronization of alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz) in humans. To this aim, EEG (bipolar electrodes in frontal cortex) and electromyographic (EMG; bipolar electrodes sutured in neck muscles) data were recorded in 13 male adult (about 3 years) lemurs. Artifact-free EEG segments during active state (gross movements, exploratory movements or locomotor activity) and awake passive state (no sleep) were selected on the basis of instrumental measures of animal behavior, and were used as an input for EEG power density analysis. Results showed a clear peak of EEG power density at alpha range (7-9 Hz) during passive state. During active state, there was a reduction in alpha power density (8-12 Hz) and an increase of power density at slow frequencies (1-4 Hz). Relative EMG activity was related to EEG power density at 2-4 Hz (positive correlation) and at 8-12 Hz (negative correlation). These results suggest for the first time that the primate gray mouse lemurs and humans may share basic neurophysiologic mechanisms of synchronization of frontal alpha rhythms in awake passive state and their desynchronization during motor and locomotor activity. These EEG markers may be an ideal experimental model for translational basic (motor science) and applied (pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions) research in Neurophysiology.

Oscillations in the high frequency band (30-100 Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG), that have been postulated to be a product of this interaction, are involved in the binding of spatially separated but temporally correlated neural events, which results in a unified perceptual experience. The extent of this functional connectivity can be examined by means of the mathematical algorithm called "coherence", which is correlated with the "strength" of functional interactions between cortical areas. As a continuation of previous studies in the cat [6,7], the present study was conducted to analyze EEG coherence in the gamma band of the rat during wakefulness (W), non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. Rats were implanted with electrodes in different cortical areas to record EEG activity, and the magnitude squared coherence values within the gamma frequency band of EEG (30-48 and 52-100 Hz) were determined. Coherence between all cortical regions in the low and high gamma frequency bands was greater during W compared with sleep. Remarkably, EEG coherence in the low and high gamma bands was smallest during REM sleep. We conclude that high frequency interactions between cortical areas are radically different during sleep and wakefulness in the rat. Since this feature is conserved in other mammals, including humans, we suggest that the uncoupling of gamma frequency activity during REM sleep is a defining trait of REM sleep in mammals.

This paper presents a novel method based on S-transform and singular value decomposition (SVD) for seizure detection. Primarily, S-transform is performed on EEG signals, and the obtained time-frequency matrix is divided into submatrices. Then, the singular values of each submatrix are extracted using singular value decomposition (SVD). Effective features are constructed by adding the largest singular values in the same frequency band together and fed into Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) classifier for decision. Finally, postprocessing is applied to obtain higher sensitivity and lower false detection rate. A total of 183.07 hours of intracranial EEG recordings containing 82 seizure events from 20 patients were used to evaluate the system. The proposed method had a sensitivity of 96.40% and a specificity of 99.01%, with a false detection rate of 0.16/ h. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It was hypothesized that children with MECP2 duplication (overexpression of MeCP2) and Rett syndrome (underexpression of MeCP2) would exhibit distinct electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of auditory stimulus discrimination. In this study, gamma-band oscillatory responses to familiar and novel voices were examined and related to social functioning in 17 children (3-11 years old) with MECP2 duplication (n = 12) and Rett syndrome (n = 5). Relative to the stranger's voice, gamma activity in response to the mother's voice was increased in MECP2 duplication but decreased in Rett syndrome. In MECP2 duplication, greater mother versus stranger differences in gamma activity were associated with higher social functioning. For the first time, brain responses in a passive voice discrimination paradigm show that overexpression and underexpression of MeCP2 have differential effects on cortical information processing.

This method is well standardized in terms of signal choice, recording technology and visual presentation. A sleep study requires much time for recording and subsequent visual scoring. A computer-based scoring can reduce time and effort and improve reliability of the result. A computer-based scoring is not yet accepted because of potential misclassifications, which may lead to false diagnoses. The principles of automatic sleep scoring are well known and documented. Automatic sleep scoring can summarize patterns quantitatively and enables a comparison of result, which is not possible by visual scoring alone: statistics, counting of patterns, arousal scoring, and sleep microstructure analysis. Classical methods such as frequency analysis and new methods, including nonlinear signal processing, can be of great help in answering research questions and for characterizing sleep EEG abnormalities. The computer-supported scoring of sleep-related breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders is reliable and is widely used in clinical practice. It is reliable if applicants agree on the sensor technology applied and specify the amplitude criteria chosen. In order to remain compatible with values from previous sleep study reports (sleep duration times, percent spent in each sleep stage, sleep efficiency, latencies), a visual scoring or a re-scoring of automated sleep analysis is indispensable.

In this study, we compare time and frequency domain features to detect movement intention from EEG signals prior to movement execution. Data were recoded from 24 able-bodied subjects, 12 performing real movements, and 12 performing imaginary movements. Furthermore, six stroke patients with lower limb paresis were included. Temporal and spectral features were investigated in combination with linear discriminant analysis and compared with template matching. The results showed that spectral features were best suited for differentiating between movement intention and noise across different tasks. The ensemble average across tasks when using spectral features was (error = 3.4 +/- 0.8%, sensitivity = 97.2 +/- 0.9%, and specificity = 97 +/- 1%) significantly better (P < 0.01) than temporal features (error = 15 +/- 1.4%, sensitivity: 85 +/- 1.3%, and specificity: 84 +/- 2%). The proposed approach also (error = 3.4 +/- 0.8%) outperformed template matching (error = 26.9 +/- 2.3%) significantly (P > 0.001). Results imply that frequency information is important for detecting movement intention, which is promising for the application of this approach to provide patient-driven real-time neurofeedback.

We used combined EEG and fMRI in 13 subjects with autism and 13 control participants and show that in autism, gamma and theta cortical activity do not engage synergistically in response to speech. Theta activity in left auditory cortex fails to track speech modulations, and to down regulate gamma oscillations in the group with autism. This deficit predicts the severity of both verbal impairment and autism symptoms in the affected sample. Finally, we found that oscillation-based connectivity between auditory and other language cortices is altered in autism. These results suggest that the verbal disorder in autism could be associated with an altered balance of slow and fast auditory oscillations, and that this anomaly could compromise the mapping between sensory input and higher-level cognitive representations.

Early and late effects of objecthood and spatial frequency on event-related potentials and gamma band activity	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Oscillations; Gamma band; Object recognition	TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; TIME-COURSE; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; BIOELECTRIC EVENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EEG; RESPONSES; FACE; OSCILLATIONS; FEATURES	Background: The visual system may process spatial frequency information in a low-to-high, coarse-to-fine sequence. In particular, low and high spatial frequency information may be processed via different pathways during object recognition, with LSF information projected rapidly to frontal areas and HSF processed later in visual ventral areas. In an electroencephalographic study, we examined the time course of information processing for images filtered to contain different ranges of spatial frequencies. Participants viewed either high spatial frequency (HSF), low spatial frequency (LSF), or unfiltered, broadband (BB) images of objects or non-object textures, classifying them as showing either man-made or natural objects, or non-objects. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and evoked and total gamma band activity (eGBA and tGBA) recorded using the electroencephalogram were compared for object and non-object images across the different spatial frequency ranges. Results: The visual P1 showed independent modulations by object and spatial frequency, while for the N1 these factors interacted. The P1 showed more positive amplitudes for objects than non-objects, and more positive amplitudes for BB than for HSF images, which in turn evoked more positive amplitudes than LSF images. The peak-to-peak N1 showed that the N1 was much reduced for BB non-objects relative to all other images, while HSF and LSF non-objects still elicited as negative an N1 as objects. In contrast, eGBA was influenced by spatial frequency and not objecthood, while tGBA showed a stronger response to objects than non-objects. Conclusions: Different pathways are involved in the processing of low and high spatial frequencies during object recognition, as reflected in interactions between objecthood and spatial frequency in the visual N1 component. Total gamma band seems to be related to a late, probably high-level representational process.

We tested the hypothesis that social interaction impairments in people with schizophrenia are related to alterations in the predictions of others' behavior and explored their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. METHODS: Electroencephalography was performed in 20 patients with schizophrenia and 25 well-matched control subjects. Participants played as proposers in the repeated version of the Ultimatum Game believing that they were playing with another human or with a computer. The power of oscillatory brain activity was obtained by means of the wavelet transform. We performed a trial-by-trial correlation between the oscillatory activity and the risk of the offer. RESULTS: Control subjects adapted their offers when playing with computers and tended to maintain their offers when playing with humans, as such revealing learning and bargaining strategies, respectively. People with schizophrenia presented the opposite pattern of behavior in both games. During the anticipation of others' responses, the power of alpha oscillations correlated with the risk of the offers made, in a different way in both games. Patients with schizophrenia presented a greater correlation in computer games than in human games; control subjects showed the opposite pattern. The alpha activity correlated with positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an alteration in social interaction in patients with schizophrenia that is related to oscillatory brain activity, suggesting maladjustment of expectation when patients face social and nonsocial agents. This alteration is related to psychotic symptoms and could guide further therapies for improving social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

It remains unexplored if the modulation of alpha band oscillations plays a similar functional role in typically developing children. The aim of this study was to characterize alpha modulations in children in relation to attentional performance. To this end, the posterior alpha activity (8-12 Hz) in children between 7 and 10 years old was measured using EEG while they performed a visuospatial covert attention task. We found that the alpha activity decreased in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended hemifield, whereas it relatively increased in the other hemisphere. In addition, we found that the degree of lateralized alpha modulation predicted performance on the attention task by negatively predicting the response time on invalid trials. Of note, children who were behaviorally less influenced by spatial cueing also were children with a clear lateralized alpha modulation pattern, with a significantly stronger alpha lateralization in the left hemisphere than children who were influenced more by spatial cueing. In addition, a bias to the right visual field such as that commonly observed in children, was significantly smaller or absent in the children influenced least by spatial cueing. Among all children, the magnitude of this visual field bias was positively related to the ability to modulate alpha activity. In conclusion, we have shown that the pattern of alpha oscillations modulated by attention is already present in 7-10 year old typically developing children. Although a similar pattern is observed in adults, the consequences for behavior are different. The fact that alpha modulation is already present at this age opens up the possibility of using hemispheric alpha lateralization as a tool to study the physiological basis of attention deficits in clinical disorders such as ADHD.

In this paper, we study the feasibility of using a commercial low cost EEG amplifier which has only limited number of electrodes, to develop a motor control BCI system. The objective is to extract brain activity responsible for direction specific imagined and executed motor activity, which can be used to identify the motor task performed by the user using the simultaneously recorded EEG. An experiment is conducted to engage the user in bi-directional horizontal movement execution and imagination of the dominant hand. The analysis includes investigation of the time-frequency bins of the recorded EEG that provides maximum discrimination of directional movement. Further, the features are extracted using Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP), followed by Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) for classification. The classification performance at various time instants of each trial are considered; and a control strategy was introduced at the classifier output to enhance performance. The performance in terms of average classification accuracy over five subjects is obtained as 81.3 % (movement execution) and 82.4 % (movement imagination). The results indicate the applicability of this EEG-BCI system to provide directional motor control to an interfaced device such as a robotic arm or a game element.	[Robinson, Neethu; Vinod, A.

The multisensory gain of gamma-band activity between the audiovisual (AV) and auditory-only conditions in different noise environments was analyzed. Videos of face motion articulating words concordant with different levels of pink noise were used as stimuli. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 0, -4, -8, -12 and -16 dB were selected to measure the speech recognition accuracy and EEG activity for 20 healthy subjects. The power and phase of EEG gamma-band oscillations increased in a time window of 50-90 ms. The multisensory gains of evoked and total activity, as well as phase-locking factor, were greatest at the -12 dB SNR, which were consistent with the behavioral result. The multisensory gain of gamma-band activity showed an inverted U-shaped curve as a function of SNR. This finding confirmed the presence of cross-modal stochastic resonance. In addition, there was a significant correlation between evoked activity and phase-locking factor of gamma-band at five different SNRs. Gamma-band oscillation was believed to play a role in the rapid processing and information linkage strengthening of AV modalities in the early stage of cognitive processes.

Basic knowledge about its impact on motor system oscillations and functional connectivity is however scarce. Specifically, a direct comparison between different feedback modalities and their neural signatures is missing. We assessed a neurofeedback training intervention of modulating beta-activity in circumscribed sensorimotor regions by kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). Right-handed healthy participants received two different feedback modalities contingent to their MI-associated brain activity in a cross-over design: (I) visual feedback with a brain-computer interface (BCI) and (II) proprioceptive feedback with a brain-robot interface (BRI) orthosis attached to the right hand. High-density electroencephalography was used to examine the reactivity of the corticalmotor system during the training session of each task by studying both local oscillatory power entrainment and distributed functional connectivity. Both feedback modalities activated a distributed functional connectivity network of coherent oscillations. A significantly higher skill and lower variability of self-controlled sensorimotor beta-bandmodulation could, however, be achieved in the BRI condition. This gain in controlling regional motor oscillations was accompanied by functional coupling of remote beta-band and theta-band activity in bilateral fronto-central regions and left parieto-occipital regions, respectively. The functional coupling of coherent theta-band oscillations correlated moreover with the skill of regional beta-modulation thus revealing a motor learning related network. Our findings indicate that proprioceptive feedback is more suitable than visual feedback to entrain the motor network architecture during the interplay between motor imagery and feedback processing thus resulting in better volitional control of regional brain activity.

High-frequency brain signals are also called high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), ripples, or fast ripples. There are no established terms for describing HFOs in a variety of frequency ranges. HFOs are clinically important because early detection of epileptic (or pathologic) high-frequency brain signals may significantly change the clinical management of epilepsy, including pediatric epilepsy. In this article, we review the cerebral mechanisms of HFOs and the maturational changes of HFOs in the developing brain. Newly developed methods for the detection and localization of HFOs are discussed. We describe many recent findings in the literature from invasive electrocorticography recordings, scalp electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. We also discuss the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. As successful surgical treatment in medically refractory epilepsies largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zones, the use of HFOs may significantly improve surgical outcomes. Indeed, the removal of brain tissue generating pathological high-frequency signals has been related to better postsurgical outcomes than removal of the seizure onset zones. This indicates that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The link between the epileptogenic zone and HFOs suggests that their study can elucidate the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. In addition, HFOs may reflect the predisposition of the tissue to generate seizures. Finally, we discuss how HFOs can be used to study childhood absence epilepsy, which can only be studied noninvasively.

By averaging over EEG segments coincident with more than hundred thousand single spikes, we found short-lived (approximate to 0.5 ms) triphasic EEG deflections dominated by high-frequency components >800 Hz. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the grand-averaged spike correlate was 80 nV, which matched theoretical predictions, while single-neuron amplitudes ranged from 12 to 966 nV. Combining these estimates with post-stimulus-time histograms of single-unit responses to median-nerve stimulation allowed us to predict the shape of the evoked epidural EEG response and to estimate the number of contributing neurons. These findings establish spiking activity of cortical neurons as a primary building block of high-frequency epidural EEG, which thus can serve as a quantitative macroscopic marker of neuronal spikes.

EEG-beta/gamma spectral power elevation in rat: a translatable biomarker elicited by GABA(A alpha 2/3)-positive allosteric modulators at nonsedating anxiolytic doses	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencehalography; benzodiazepine; GABA(A) subtypes; pharmaco-EEG; gamma network oscillation; anxiolysis	DIAZEPAM-INDUCED CHANGES; SELECTIVE AGONIST; SITE LIGANDS; IN-VIVO; RECEPTOR; SLEEP; SUBTYPE; 7-(1,1-DIMETHYLETHYL)-6-(2-ETHYL-2H-1,2,4-TRIAZOL-3-YLMETHOXY)-3-(2-FLUOROPHENYL; BENZODIAZEPINES; CLASSIFICATION	Benzodiazepine drugs, through interaction with GABA(A alpha 1), GABA(A alpha 2,3), and GABA(A alpha 5) subunits, modulate cortical network oscillations, as reflected by a complex signature in the EEG power spectrum. Recent drug discovery efforts have developed GABA(A alpha 2,3) -subunit-selective partial modulators in an effort to dissociate the side effect liabilities from the efficacy imparted by benzodiazepines. Here, we evaluated rat EEG and behavioral end points during dosing of nine chemically distinct compounds that we confirmed statistically to selectively to enhance GABA(A alpha 2,3)-mediated vs. GABA(A alpha 1) or GABA(A alpha 5) currents in voltage clamped oocytes transfected with those GABA A subunits. These compounds were shown with in vivo receptor occupancy techniques to competitively displace [H-3] flumazenil in multiple brain regions following peripheral administration at increasing doses. Over the same dose range, the compounds all produced dose-dependent EEG spectral power increases in the beta- and and gamma-bands. Finally, the dose range that increased gamma-power coincided with that eliciting punished over unpunished responding in a behavioral conflict model of anxiety, indicative of anxiolysis without sedation. EEG gamma-band power increases showed a significant positive correlation to in vitro GABA(A alpha 2,3) modulatory intrinsic activity across the compound set, further supporting a hypothesis that this EEG signature was linked specifically to pharmacological modulation of GABA(A alpha 2,3) signaling. These findings encourage further evaluation of this EEG signature as a noninvasive clinical translational biomarker that could ultimately facilitate development of GABA(A alpha 2,3) -subtype-selective drugs for anxiety and potentially other indications.

J	Chung, D; Yun, K; Jeong, J				Chung, Dongil; Yun, Kyongsik; Jeong, Jaeseung			Decoding covert motivations of free riding and cooperation from multi-feature pattern analysis of EEG signals	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRISONERS-DILEMMA; PARIETAL JUNCTION; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; PUNISHMENT; CLASSIFICATION; EMERGENCE; DYNAMICS; KINDNESS; MIND	Cooperation and free riding are among the most frequently observed behaviors in human social decision-making. In social interactions, the effects of strategic decision processes have been consistently reported in iterative cooperation decisions. However, the neural activity immediately after new information is presented, the time at which strategy learning potentially starts has not yet been investigated with high temporal resolution. Here, we implemented an iterative, binary public goods game that simulates cooperation/free riding behavior. We applied the multi-feature pattern analysis method by using a support vector machine and the unique combinatorial performance measure, and identified neural features from the single-trial, event-related spectral perturbation at the result-presentation of the current round that predict participants' decisions to cooperate or free ride in the subsequent round. We found that neural oscillations in centroparietal and temporal regions showed the highest predictive power through 10-fold cross-validation; these predicted the participants' next decisions, which were independent of the neural responses during their own preceding choices. We suggest that the spatial distribution and time-frequency information of the selected features represent covert motivations to free ride or cooperate in the next round and are separately processed in parallel with information regarding the preceding results.

A new training-free framework was proposed for target detection in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using joint frequency-phase coding. Approach. The key idea is to transfer SSVEP templates from the existing subjects to a new subject to enhance the detection of SSVEPs. Under this framework, transfer template-based canonical correlation analysis (tt-CCA) methods were developed for single-channel and multi-channel conditions respectively. In addition, an online transfer template-based CCA (ott-CCA) method was proposed to update EEG templates by online adaptation. Main results. The efficiency of the proposed framework was proved with a simulated BCI experiment. Compared with the standard CCA method, tt-CCA obtained an 18.78% increase of accuracy with a data length of 1.5 s. A simulated test of ott-CCA further received an accuracy increase of 2.99%. Significance. The proposed simple yet efficient framework significantly facilitates the use of SSVEP BCIs using joint frequency-phase coding. This study also sheds light on the benefits from exploring and exploiting inter-subject information to the electroencephalogram (EEG)based BCIs.

It depends on bottom-up-mediated factors like stimulus intensity and top-down-mediated factors like expectations. In the brain, pain is associated with a complex pattern of neuronal responses including evoked potentials and induced responses at alpha and gamma frequencies. Although they all covary with stimulus intensity and pain perception, responses at gamma frequencies can be particularly closely related to the perception of pain. It is, however, unclear whether this association holds true across all types of pain modulation. Here, we used electroencephalography to directly compare bottom-up-and top-down-mediated modulations of pain, which were implemented by changes in stimulus intensity and placebo analgesia, respectively. The results show that stimulus intensity modulated pain-evoked potentials and pain-induced alpha and gamma responses. In contrast, placebo analgesia was associated with changes of evoked potentials, but not of alpha and gamma responses. These findings reveal that pain-related neuronal responses are differentially sensitive to bottom-up and top-down modulations of pain, indicating that they provide complementary information about pain perception. The results further show that pain-induced gamma oscillations do not invariably encode pain perception but may rather represent a marker of sensory processing whose influence on pain perception varies with behavioral context.

Here, the mechanisms of keystroke preparation were studied with a typed picture-naming task performed by expert typists. Electroencephalographic activities recorded over sensorimotor areas prior to first-keystroke onset were examined with time-frequency and event-related potential (ERP) analyses. In the time-frequency domain, a beta event-related desynchronization was present bilaterally. In the ERP analyses, the activity was asymmetric, with negativity and positivity patterns developing over, respectively, contra- and ipsilateral recording sites. This pattern is similar to that observed in choice reaction time tasks, and thus can be interpreted as evidence of contralateral motor cortex activation accompanied by inhibition of the ipsilateral motor cortex. These data constitute the first electrophysiological demonstration of inhibitory activity in typing and pave the way to a thorough study of typing.

Sleep spindle alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; sleep spindle morphology; EEG; neurodegeneration; biomarker	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS; DELAYED EMERGENCE; NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; L-DOPA; EEG; DEMENTIA; MEMORY	The aim of this study was to identify changes of sleep spindles (SS) in the EEG of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Five sleep experts manually identified SS at a central scalp location (C3-A2) in 15 PD and 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Each SS was given a confidence score, and by using a group consensus rule, 901 SS were identified and characterized by their (1) duration, (2) oscillation frequency, (3) maximum peak-to-peak amplitude, (4) percent-to-peak amplitude, and (5) density. Between-group comparisons were made for all SS characteristics computed, and significant changes for PD patients vs. control subjects were found for duration, oscillation frequency, maximum peak-to-peak amplitude and density. Specifically, SS density was lower, duration was longer, oscillation frequency slower and maximum peak-to-peak amplitude higher in patients vs. controls. We also computed inter-expert reliability in SS scoring and found a significantly lower reliability in scoring definite SS in patients when compared to controls. How neurodegeneration in PD could influence SS characteristics is discussed. We also note that the SS morphological changes observed here may affect automatic detection of SS in patients with PD or other neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs).	[Christensen, Julie A.

A look at the strength of micro and macro EEG analysis for distinguishing insomnia within an HIV cohort	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			SLEEP QUALITY	HIV patients are often plagued by sleep disorders and suffer from sleep deprivation. However, there remains a wide gap in our understanding of the relationship between HIV status, poor sleep, overall function and future outcomes; particularly in the case of HIV patients otherwise well controlled on cART (combined anti-retroviral therapy). In this study, we compared two groups: 16 non-HIV subjects (seronegative controls) and 12 seropositive HIV patients with undetectable viral loads. We looked at sleep behavioral (macro-sleep) features and sleep spectral (micro-sleep) features obtained from human-scored overnight EEG recordings to study whether the scored EEG data can be used to distinguish between controls and HIV subjects. Specifically, the macro-sleep features were defined by sleep stages and included sleep transitions, percentage of time spent in each sleep stage, and duration of time spent in each sleep stage. The micro-sleep features were obtained from the power spectrum of the EEG signals by computing the total power across all channels and frequencies, as well as the average power in each sleep stage and across different frequency bands. While the macro features do not distinguish between the two groups, there is a significant difference and a high classification accuracy for the scoring-independent micro features. This spectral separation is interesting because evidence suggests a relationship between sleep complaints and cognitive dysfunction in HIV patients stable on cART. Furthermore, there are currently no biomarkers that predict the early development of cognitive decline in HIV patients. Thus, a micro-sleep architectural approach could serve as a biomarker to identify HIV patients vulnerable to cognitive decline, providing an avenue to explore the utility of early intervention.

Herein, we describe a case of MRI and functional imaging-negative intractable frontal lobe epilepsy in which, initially, secondary bilateral synchrony of surface and intracranial EEG and non-lateralizing semiology rendered identification of the epileptogenic zone difficult. A staged bilateral stereotactic EEG exploration revealed a very focal, putative ictal onset zone in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, as evidenced by interictal and ictal high-frequency oscillations (at 250 Hz) and induction of seizures from the same electrode contacts by 50-Hz low-intensity cortical stimulation. This was subsequently confirmed by ILAE class 1 outcome following resection of the ictal onset and irritative zones. Histopathological examination revealed focal cortical dysplasia type 1b (ILAE Commission, 2011) as the cause of epilepsy. The importance of anatomo-electro-clinical correlation is illustrated in this case in which semiological and electrophysiological features pointed to the anatomical localization of a challenging, MRI-negative epilepsy.

Nevertheless, the neuronal mechanisms underlying some of the most intriguing states of consciousness, including spiritual experiences, remain unknown. Objectives To elucidate state of consciousness-related neuronal mechanisms, human subjects were given psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonergic agonist and hallucinogen that has been used for centuries to induce spiritual experiences in religious and medical rituals. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy human volunteers received a moderate dose of psilocybin, while high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The current source density and the lagged phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions were computed and correlated with psilocybin-induced altered states of consciousness. Results Psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations at 1.5-20 Hz within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions. Most intriguingly, the intensity levels of psilocybin-induced spiritual experience and insightfulness correlated with the lagged phase synchronization of delta oscillations (1.5-4 Hz) between the retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus, and the lateral orbitofrontal area. Conclusions These results provide systematic evidence for the direct association of a specific spatiotemporal neuronal mechanism with spiritual experiences and enhanced insight into life and existence. The identified mechanism may constitute a pathway for modulating mental health, as spiritual experiences can promote sustained well-being and psychological resilience.

These developments have provided new theories on the relationship between physiological and pathological states, as well as common motifs for the propagation of paroxysmal activity. Although traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings continue to describe normal network oscillations and abnormal epileptic events within and outside of the seizure focus, analysis of epilepsy dynamics at the microscale has found variability in the composition of macroscopically repetitive epileptiform events. These novel results point to heterogeneity in the underlying dynamics of the disorder, highlighting both the need and potential for more specific and targeted therapies.

In addition to natural sleep, slow waves can be seen in the EEG during general anesthesia offering great potential for depth of anesthesia monitoring. In this paper, Hilbert-Huang Transform, an adaptive data-driven method designed for the analysis on non-stationary data, was used to investigate the dynamical changes in the EEG slow wave activity during induction of anesthesia with propofol. The method was found to be able to extract stable signal components representing slow wave activity that were consistent between patients. The signal analysis revealed a possible specific structure between different components dependent on the depth of anesthesia on which further studies are needed.

Changes in the electroencephalogram during anaesthesia and their physiological basis	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Review						electroencephalogram; reticulate nuclei of thalamus; spindle; thalamus	THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; ISOFLURANE; STIMULATION; SEVOFLURANE; OSCILLATION; BICOHERENCE	The use of EEG monitors to assess the level of hypnosis during anaesthesia has become widespread. Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS T) and other indices calculated by EEG monitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, it is necessary to understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes aremore complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindle waves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and deltawaves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveformchanges into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS T, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappearwhen adequate analgesia is obtained. To prevent awareness during anaesthesia, I speculate that themost effective strategy is to administer anaesthetic agents in such a way as to maintain anaesthesia at a level where spindle waves predominate.

OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied the characteristics of two electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns evoked by two different imaginary tasks and evaluated the binary classification performance. METHODS: Fifteen individuals (11 male and 4 female, age range of 22 to 33) participated in five sessions of 32-channel EEG recordings. Only by analyzing the subjects' output EEG signals from the central parieto-occipital region of P-Z electrode, under the circumstances of consciousness of relaxation-meditation or tension-imagination, we carried out the experiment of feature extraction for spontaneous EEG, as the subjects were blindfolded but asked to open their eyes all the same. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was utilized to obtain the Hilbert time-frequency amplitude spectrum, and then with the feature vector set extracted, a two-class Fisher linear discriminant analysis classifier was trained for classification of data epochs of those two tasks. RESULTS: The overall result was that about 90% (+/- 5%) of the epochs could be correctly classified to their originating task. CONCLUSION: This study not only brings new opportunities for consciousness studies, but also provides a new classification paradigm for achieving control of robots based on the brain-computer interface (BCI).

In this paper we review and reinterpret the functional roles of beta-and gamma-band oscillatory activity during language comprehension at the sentence and discourse level. We discuss the evidence in favor of a role for beta and gamma in unification (the unification hypothesis), and in light of mounting evidence that cannot be accounted for under this hypothesis, we explore an alternative proposal linking beta and gamma oscillations to maintenance and prediction (respectively) during language comprehension. Our maintenance/prediction hypothesis is able to account for most of the findings that are currently available relating beta and gamma oscillations to language comprehension, and is in good agreement with other proposals about the roles of beta and gamma in domain-general cognitive processing. In conclusion we discuss proposals for further testing and comparing the prediction and unification hypotheses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The agent's oscillating nature is inferred by empirical neuroscience observations. In the OAM, a social agent is understood as a set of characteristic basic mind-brain states (BMS) and transitions between them. The neural correlations of consciousness are fundamentally backed-up using an adaption of the Hameroff-Penrose Orch OR quantum theory of neuronal beats, which has recently been confirmed by some experimental studies on neural cells' activities in microtubules. This paper provides a putative link between the Orch OR, a conceptual oscillations-based OSIMAS framework, and the empirically observed coherent bioelectromagnetic oscillations of ensembles of neurons in the brain (EEG spectra). It also sheds new light on the novel interpretation of the Orch OR theory of quantum beats. In this short work-in-progress report, a proposed multidisciplinary approach provides conceptual tools for the modeling of the new type of agency.

Based on the two-stage model of memory consolidation, different functions for slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have been proposed; thus, state-dependent changes of neural oscillations in the hippocampus might clarify this fundamental question. Methods: We recorded hippocampal local field potentials from freely behaving monkeys via telemetry and analyzed their nonstationary oscillations using Hilbert-Huang transform. Results: By applying a recently developed empirical mode decomposition analysis, we found strong cross-frequency coupling between high-frequency and slow wave oscillations during SWS and a prominent increase of gamma band activity in short bursts during REM sleep in unanesthetized primates' hippocampus. Conclusion: Spatiotemporal integration through coupled oscillations during slow wave sleep might be a physiological basis of system consolidation, whereas gamma bursts during rapid eye movement sleep might be related to synaptic consolidation in the local hippocampal neural circuit.

EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Hyperexcitability; Intracellular; EEG	ISOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; BACLOFEN OVERDOSE; BRAIN; EEG; COMA; HYPOTHERMIA; PROTECTION; PATIENT; PATTERN; CORTEX	This paper describes the various electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns expressed by the comatose brain, starting with the sleep-like oscillations associated with light coma. Deeper coma generally displays a burst-suppression pattern characterized by alternating episodes of isoelectric (flat) EEG and bursting slow waves. The latter are the result of cortical hype rexcitability, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings in anesthetized animals. Further deepening of the coma yields to continuous isoelectric electroencephalogram and eventually results in a newly discovered type of spiky waves that have been termed Nu-complexes. The paper discusses the structures participating in the genesis of burst suppression, the afferent mechanisms, and the reasons for which this activity should or should not be regarded as an epileptic disorder.

However, manual scoring of spindles on prolonged recordings is very laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm based on synchrosqueezing transform for detection of sleep spindles. Synchrosqueezing is a powerful time-frequency analysis tool that provides precise frequency representation of a multicomponent signal through mode decomposition. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm extracts and compares the basic features of a spindle-like activity with its surrounding, thus adapting to an expert's visual criteria for spindle scoring. The performance of the algorithm was assessed against the spindle scoring of one expert on continuous electroencephalogram sleep recordings from two subjects. Through appropriate choice of synchrosqueezing parameters, our proposed algorithm obtained a maximum sensitivity of 96.5 % with 98.1 % specificity. Compared to previously published works, our algorithm has shown improved performance by enhancing the quality of sleep spindle detection.

Adolescents with ASD in PEERS shifted from right-hemisphere gamma-band EEG asymmetry before PEERS to left-hemisphere EEG asymmetry after PEERS, versus a waitlist ASD group. Left-hemisphere EEG asymmetry was associated with more social contacts and knowledge, and fewer symptoms of autism. Adolescents with ASD in PEERS no longer differed from typically developing adolescents in left-dominant EEG asymmetry at post-test. These findings are discussed via the Modifier Model of Autism (Mundy et al. in Res Pract Persons Severe Disabl 32(2):124, 2007), with emphasis on remediating isolation/withdrawal in ASD.

Rehabilitation robots or exoskeletons have been controlled using EEG activity. However, all studies have used a 2-class or one-dimensional decoding scheme. In this study we investigated EEG decoding of 5 functional movements of the same limb towards an online scenario. Six healthy participants performed a three-dimensional center-out reaching task based on direction movements (four directions and rest) wearing a 32-channel EEG cap. A BCI design based on multiclass extensions of Spectrally Weighted Common Spatial Patterns (Spec-CSP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was developed and tested offline. The decoding accuracy was 5-fold cross-validated. A decoding accuracy of 39.5% on average for all the six subjects was obtained (chance level being 20%). The results of the current study demonstrate multiple functional movements decoding (significantly higher than chance level) from the same limb using EEG data. This study represents first steps towards a same limb multi degree of freedom (DOF) online EEG based BCI for motor restoration.

We explored the relationship between ictal HFOs and hyperexcitability with a view to improving surgical outcome. Methods: We evaluated 262 patients with refractory epilepsy. Fifteen patients underwent electrode implantation, and surgical resection was performed in 12 patients using a semi-prospective design. Ictal intracranial EEGs were examined by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Significant ictal HFOs were denoted by normalized wavelet power above the 50th percentile across all channels. Each patient underwent functional mapping with cortical electrical stimulation. Hyperexcitability was defined as the appearance of afterdischarges or clinical seizures after electrical stimulation (50 Hz, biphasic, pulse width = 0.5 ms, 5 s, 5 mA). Results: Among the group of patients achieving Engel Class I/II outcome at 1+ year, the mean proportion of significant ictal HFOs among resected channels for any given patient was 69% (33.3-100%). The respective figures for conventional frequency ictal patterns (CFIPs), hyperexcitability, and radiological lesion were 68.3% (26.3-100%), 39.6% (0-100%), and 52.8% (0-100%). Statistical significance was only achieved with ictal HFOs when comparing patients with Engel Class I/II outcomes versus III/IV outcomes (12.6% vs. 4.2%, the number of channels as the denominator, p = 0.005). Results: Further analysis from all patients irrespective of the surgical outcome showed that ictal HFOs co-occurred with CFIP (p < 0.001), hyperexcitability (p < 0.001), and radiological lesion (p < 0.001). The combination of ictal HFOs/hyperexcitability improved the sensitivity from 66.7% to 100%, and the specificity from 66.7% to 75% when compared with ictal HFOs or hyperexcitability alone. Conclusions: We confirmed the utility of ictal HFOs in determining surgical outcome. Ictal HFOs are affiliated to cortical hyperexcitability, which may represent a pathological manifestation of epileptogenicity. Significance: Presurgical evaluation of refractory epilepsy may incorporate both ictal HFOs and cortical stimulation in determining epileptogenic foci.

Clustering techniques applied to independent sources resolved with ICA have been proven to be successful in the identification of clusters of sensorimotor mu rhythm across different subjects. The present work deals with the issue regarding the minimum number of data channels that is recommended to find reliable clusters of mu rhythm. Left and right mu clusters were identified from high-density EEG recordings (61 channels) belonging to a publicly available EEG database. A second dataset was created by selecting a small subset of the same high-density EEG recordings. Specifically, only the 19 channels belonging to the standard 10-20 International System were used for the identification of left and right mu clusters. Quantitative parameters computed from mu clusters obtained from both the 61-channel and the 19-channel datasets were statistically compared. The obtained results suggest that clusters of mu rhythm in sensorimotor areas can be reliably found from a lower number of EEG channels compared to high-density electrodes configuration.

Physiologic artifacts in resting state oscillations in young children: methodological considerations for noisy data	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Quantitative EEG; Artifacts; Resting state; Children	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; HEAD MOTION; BAND POWER; GUIDELINES; AUTISM	We quantified the potential effects of physiologic artifact on the estimation of EEG band power in a cohort of typically developing children in order to guide artifact rejection methods in quantitative EEG data analysis in developmental populations. High density EEG was recorded for 2 min while children, ages 2-6, watched a video of bubbles. Segments of data were categorized as blinks, saccades, EMG or artifact-free, and both absolute and relative power in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (35-45 Hz) bands were calculated in 9 regions for each category. Using a linear mixed model approach with artifact type, region and their interaction as predictors, we compared mean band power between clean data and each type of artifact. We found significant differences in mean relative and absolute power between artifacts and artifact-free segments in all frequency bands. The magnitude and direction of the differences varied based on power type, region, and frequency band. The most significant differences in mean band power were found in the gamma band for EMG artifact and the theta band for ocular artifacts. Artifact detection strategies need to be sensitive to the oscillations of interest for a given analysis, with the most conservative approach being the removal of all EMG and ocular artifact from EEG data. Quantitative EEG holds considerable promise as a clinical biomarker of both typical and atypical development. However, there needs to be transparency in the choice of power type, regions of interest, and frequency band, as each of these variables are differentially vulnerable to noise, and therefore, their interpretation depends on the methods used to identify and remove artifacts.

This may be one reason for the present failure of EEG-based BCI paradigms for completely locked-in ALS patients. In order to help understand this failure, we have recorded resting state data from six ALS patients and thirty-two healthy controls to investigate for group differences. While similar studies have been attempted in the past, none have used high-density EEG or tried to distinguish between physiological and non-physiological sources of the EEG. We find an ALS-specific global increase in gamma power (30-90 Hz) that is not specific to the motor cortex, suggesting that the mechanism behind ALS affects non-motor cortical regions even in the absence of comorbid cognitive deficits.

However, due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SEPs are generally measured using ensemble averaging across hundreds of trials, thus unavoidably producing a tardiness of SEPs to the potential damages caused by surgical maneuvers and a loss of dynamical information of cortical processing related to somatosensory inputs. Here, we aimed to enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs using Kalman filtering and time-frequency multiple linear regression (TF-MLR) and measure their single-trial parameters, both in the time domain and in the time-frequency domain. We first showed that, Kalman filtering and TF-MLR can effectively capture the single-trial SEP responses and provide accurate estimates of single- trial SEP parameters in the time domain and time-frequency domain, respectively. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between the stimulus intensity and a set of indicative single- trial SEP parameters, including the correlation coefficient (between each single-trial SEPs and their average), P37 amplitude, N45 amplitude, P37-N45 amplitude, and phase value (at the zero-crossing points between P37 and N45). Finally, based on each indicative single-trial SEP parameter, we investigated the minimum number of trials required on a single-trial basis to suggest the existence of SEP responses, thus providing important information for fast SEP extraction in intraoperative monitoring.

In this study the AEPs in hyperthyroidism were studied both in time and frequency domains rather than studying just in the time domain by peak scoring. This paper presents a method for filtering auditory oddball standard and target AEPs by using singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and feature extraction in the frequency domain via spectral analysis. AEPs were recorded during an auditory oddball paradigm in 25 newly diagnosed hyperthyroid patients and 15 healthy subjects. The signals are captured in the presence of ongoing background EEG activity so they are often contaminated by artifacts. This paper presents a method for filtering auditory odd-ball standard and target AEPs by using Singular spectrum analysis and feature extraction in frequency domain via spectral analysis. Information about the frequency composition of the signal is then used to compare normal and hyperthyroid states. While there was no significant difference either in the target or standard unfiltered signals between the hyperthyroid patients and the control group (p>0.05), there was a significant difference in the filtered signals between the two groups (p<0.01). In conclusion, our results revealed that SSA is an effective filtering method for AEPs. Thus, a much more objective and specific examination method was developed.

Early and Late Electrophysiological Effects of Distractor Frequency in Picture Naming: Reconciling Input and Output Accounts	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORD INTERFERENCE EVIDENCE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SEMANTIC INTERFERENCE; TEMPORAL SIGNATURES; LEXICAL SELECTION; ERROR NEGATIVITY; TIME-COURSE; STROOP; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION	The "distractor-frequency effect" refers to the finding that high-frequency (HF) distractor words slow picture naming less than low-frequency distractors in the picture-word interference paradigm. Rival input and output accounts of this effect have been proposed. The former attributes the effect to attentional selection mechanisms operating during distractor recognition, whereas the latter attributes it to monitoring/decision mechanisms operating on distractor and target responses in an articulatory buffer. Using high-density (128-channel) EEG, we tested hypotheses from these rival accounts. In addition to conducting stimulus-and response-locked whole-brain corrected analyses, we investigated the correct-related negativity, an ERP observed on correct trials at fronto-central electrodes proposed to reflect the involvement of domain general monitoring. The whole-brain ERP analysis revealed a significant effect of distractor frequency at inferior right frontal and temporal sites between 100 and 300-msec post-stimulus onset, during which lexical access is thought to occur. Response-locked, region of interest (ROI) analyses of fronto-central electrodes revealed a correct-related negativity starting 121 msec before and peaking 125 msec after vocal onset on the grand averages. Slope analysis of this component revealed a significant difference between HF and low-frequency distractor words, with the former associated with a steeper slope on the time window spanning from 100 msec before to 100 msec after vocal onset. The finding of ERP effects in time windows and components corresponding to both lexical processing and monitoring suggests the distractor frequency effect is most likely associated with more than one physiological mechanism.

As neurocognitive deficits are already present in the high-risk state, identification of the neural networks involved in this core feature of schizophrenia is essential to our understanding of the disorder. Resting-state studies enable such investigations, while at the same time avoiding the known confounder of impaired task performance in patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate EEG resting-state connectivity in high-risk individuals (HR) compared to first episode patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and to healthy controls (HC), and its association with cognitive deficits. Methods: 64-channel resting-state EEG recordings (eyes closed) were obtained for 28HR, 19 stable SZ, and 23 HC, matched for age, education, and parental education. The imaginary coherence-based multivariate interaction measure (MIM) was used as a measure of connectivity across 80 cortical regions and six frequency bands. Mean connectivity at each region was compared across groups using the non-parametric randomization approach. Additionally, the network-based statistic was applied to identify affected networks in patients. Results: SZ displayed increased theta-band resting-state MIM connectivity across midline, sensorimotor, orbitofrontal regions and the left temporoparietal junction. HR displayed intermediate theta-band connectivity patterns that did not differ from either SZ or HC. Mean theta-band connectivity within the above network partially mediated verbal memory deficits in SZ and HR. Conclusions: Aberrant theta-band connectivity may represent a trait characteristic of schizophrenia associated with neurocognitive deficits. As such, it might constitute a promising target for novel treatment applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Here, we set out to address the motor network activity and synchronization in Parkinson's disease and its modulation with subthalamic stimulation. To this end, 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease with subthalamic nucleus stimulation were analysed on externally cued right hand finger movements with 1.5-s interstimulus interval. Simultaneous recordings were obtained from electromyography on antagonistic muscles (right flexor digitorum and extensor digitorum) together with 64-channel electroencephalography. Time-frequency event-related spectral perturbations were assessed to determine cortical and muscular activity. Next, cross-spectra in the time-frequency domain were analysed to explore the cortico-cortical synchronization. The time-frequency modulations enabled us to select a time-frequency range relevant for motor processing. On these time-frequency windows, we developed an extension of the phase synchronization index to quantify the global cortico-cortical synchronization and to obtain topographic differentiations of distinct electrode sites with respect to their contributions to the global phase synchronization index. The spectral measures were used to predict clinical and reaction time outcome using regression analysis. We found that movement-related desynchronization of cortical activity in the upper alpha and beta range was significantly facilitated with 'stimulation on' compared to 'stimulation off' on electrodes over the bilateral parietal, sensorimotor, premotor, supplementary-motor, and prefrontal areas, including the bilateral inferior prefrontal areas. These spectral modulations enabled us to predict both clinical and reaction time improvement from subthalamic stimulation. With 'stimulation on', interhemispheric cortico-cortical coherence in the beta band was significantly attenuated over the bilateral sensorimotor areas. Similarly, the global cortico-cortical phase synchronization was attenuated, and the topographic differentiation revealed stronger desynchronization over the (ipsilateral) right-hemispheric prefrontal, premotor and sensorimotor areas compared to 'stimulation off'. We further demonstrated that the cortico-cortical phase synchronization was largely dominated by genuine neuronal coupling. The clinical improvement with 'stimulation on' compared to 'stimulation off' could be predicted from this cortical decoupling with multiple regressions, and the reduction of synchronization over the right prefrontal area showed a linear univariate correlation with clinical improvement. Our study demonstrates wide-spread activity and synchronization modulations of the cortical motor network, and highlights subthalamic stimulation as a network-modulating therapy. Accordingly, subthalamic stimulation may release bilateral cortical computational resources by facilitating movement-related desynchronization. Moreover, the subthalamic nucleus is critical to balance inhibitory and facilitatory cortical players within the motor program.

Under conditions of challenging signal-to-noise ratio, high-dimensional data and small training sets, however, these methods may overfit to meaningless solutions. Examples are spatial filtering methods like Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) [1] and Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) [2]. It is difficult for the practitioner to tell apart meaningful from arbitrary, random components. We propose three approaches to probe the robustness of extracted oscillatory components and show their application to both, simulated and EEG data recorded during a visually cued hand motor reaction time task.

Yet the effect of temperature management on different EEG frequency bands has not been elucidated. A novel quantitative EEG algorithm, sub-band information quantity (SIQ), was applied to evaluate EEG recovery and outcomes after CA. Twenty-four Wistar rats undergoing 7-min CA were randomly assigned to immediate hypothermia (32-34 A degrees C), normothermia (36.5-37.5 A degrees C), or hyperthermia (38.5-39.5 A degrees C) (n = 8). EEG was recorded continuously for the first 8 h and then for serial 30-min epochs daily. The neurologic deficit score (NDS) at 72-h was the primary functional outcome. Another four rats without brain injury were added as a control. Better recovery of gamma-band SIQ was found in the hypothermia group (0.60 +/- A 0.03) compared with the normothermia group (0.40 +/- A 0.03) (p < 0.01) and in the normothermia group compared with the hyperthermia group (0.34 +/- A 0.03) (p < 0.05). The NDS was also improved in the lower temperature groups: hypothermia [median (25th, 75th), 74 (61, 74)] versus normothermia [49 (47, 61)] versus hyperthermia [43 (0, 50)] (p < 0.01). Throughout the 72-h experiment, the gamma-band SIQ showed the strongest correlation at every time point (ranging 0.520-0.788 from 30-min to 72-h post-resuscitation, all p < 0.05) whereas the delta-band SIQ had poor correlation with the 72-h NDS. No significant difference of sub-band EEG was found with temperature manipulation alone. Recovery of gamma-band SIQ-qEEG was strongly associated with functional outcomes after CA. Induced hypothermia was associated with faster recovery of gamma-band SIQ and improved functional outcomes. Targeted temperature management primarily affected gamma frequency oscillations but not delta rhythm.

J	Lu, N; Yin, T				Lu, Na; Yin, Tao			Motor imagery classification via combinatory decomposition of ERP and ERSP using sparse nonnegative matrix factorization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Classification; Event related potential; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Brain computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; EEG; COMPONENTS; ALGORITHMS; ICA	Background: Brain activities could be measured by devices like EEG, MEG, MRI etc. in terms of electric or magnetic signal, which could provide information from three domains, i.e., time, frequency and space. Combinatory analysis of these features could definitely help to improve the classification performance on brain activities. NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization) has been widely applied in pattern extraction tasks (e.g., face recognition, gene data analysis) which could provide physically meaningful explanation of the data. However, brain signals also take negative values, so only spectral feature has been employed in existing NMF studies for brain computer interface. In addition, sparsity is an intrinsic characteristic of electric signals. New method: To incorporate sparsity constraint and enable analysis of time domain feature using NMF, a new solution for motor imagery classification is developed, which combinatorially analyzes the ERP (event related potential, time domain) and ERSP (event related spectral perturbation, frequency domain) features via a modified mixed alternating least square based NMF method (MALS-NMF for short). Results: Extensive experiments have verified the effectivity the proposed method. The results also showed that imposing sparsity constraint on the coefficient matrix in ERP factorization and basis matrix in ERSP factorization could better improve the algorithm performance. Comparison with existing methods: Comparisons with other eight representative methods have further verified the superiority of the proposed method. Conclusions: The MALS-NMF method is an effective solution for motor imagery classification and has shed some new light into the field of brain dynamics pattern analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of CMC can be affected by motor behavior. In a proof-of-principle study, we examined whether independent of motor output parameters, healthy subjects are able to voluntarily modulate CMC in a neuro-feedback paradigm. Subjects received visual online feedback of their instantaneous CMC strength, which was calculated between an optimized spatial projection of multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in an individually defined target frequency range. The neurofeedback training consisted of either increasing or decreasing CMC strength using a self-chosen mental strategy while performing a simple motor task. Evaluation of instantaneous coherence showed that CMC strength was significantly larger when subjects had to increase than when to decrease CMC; this difference between the two task conditions did not depend on motor performance. The exclusion of confounding factors such as motor performance, attention and task complexity in study design provides evidence that subjects were able to voluntarily modify CMC independent of motor output parameters. Additional analysis further strengthened the assumption that the subjects' response was specifically shaped by the neurofeedback. In perspective, we suggest that CMC-based neurofeedback could provide a therapeutic approach in clinical conditions, such as motor stroke, where CMC is altered. (C) 2015 IBRO.

A time-frequency analysis of mu rhythms	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Mu rhythms; Beta rhythms; Embodied meaning; Action language; Perceptive language	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ACTION VERBS; ACTION SENTENCES; GO/NOGO TASK; ACTION WORDS; SYSTEM; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS	EEG mu rhythms (8-13 Hz) recorded at fronto-central electrodes are generally considered as markers of motor cortical activity in humans, because they are modulated when participants perform an action, when they observe another's action or even when they imagine performing an action. In this study, we analyzed the time-frequency (TF) modulation of mu rhythms while participants read action language ("You will cut the strawberry cake"), abstract language ("You will doubt the patient's argument"), and perceptive language ("You will notice the bright day"). The results indicated that mu suppression at fronto-central sites is associated with action language rather than with abstract or perceptive language. Also, the largest difference between conditions occurred quite late in the sentence, while reading the first noun, (contrast Action vs. Abstract), or the second noun following the action verb (contrast Action vs. Perceptive). This suggests that motor activation is associated with the integration of words across the sentence beyond the lexical processing of the action verb. Source reconstruction localized mu suppression associated with action sentences in premotor cortex (BA 6). The present study suggests (1) that the understanding of action language activates motor networks in the human brain, and (2) that this activation occurs online based on semantic integration across multiple words in the sentence.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation can be combined with electroencephalography to index long-interval cortical inhibition, a measure of GABAergic receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission from the frontal and motor cortex. In previous studies we have reported that schizophrenia is associated with inhibitory deficits in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to healthy subjects and patients with bipolar disorder. The main objective of the current study was to replicate and extend these initial findings by evaluating long-interval cortical inhibition from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. A total of 111 participants were assessed: 38 patients with schizophrenia (average age: 35.71 years, 25 males, 13 females), 27 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (average age: 36.15 years, 11 males, 16 females) and 46 healthy subjects (average age: 33.63 years, 23 females, 23 males). Long-interval cortical inhibition was measured from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortex through combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, long-interval cortical inhibition was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.004) and not significantly different between patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy subjects (P = 0.5445). Long-interval cortical inhibition deficits in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were also significantly greater in patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (P = 0.0465). There were no significant differences in long-interval cortical inhibition across all three groups in the motor cortex. These results demonstrate that long-interval cortical inhibition deficits in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are specific to patients with schizophrenia and are not a generalized deficit that is shared by disorders of severe psychopathology.

We studied whether long range temporal correlations quantified by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) could be used in the neonatal EEG to distinguish different grades of abnormality in the background EEG activity. Long-term EEG records of 34 neonates were collected after perinatal asphyxia, and their background was scored in 1 h epochs (8 h in each neonate) as mild, moderate or severe. We applied DFA on 15 min long, non-overlapping EEG epochs (n = 1088) filtered from 3 to 8 Hz. Our formal feasibility study suggested that DFA exponent can be reliably assessed in only part of the EEG epochs, and in only relatively short time scales (10-60 s), while it becomes ambiguous if longer time scales are considered. This prompted further exploration whether paradigm used for quantifying multifractal DFA (MF-DFA) could be applied in a more efficient way, and whether metrics from MF-DFA paradigm could yield useful benchmark with existing clinical EEG gradings. Comparison of MF-DFA metrics showed a significant difference between three visually assessed background EEG grades. MF-DFA parameters were also significantly correlated to interburst intervals quantified with our previously developed automated detector. Finally, we piloted a monitoring application of MF-DFA metrics and showed their evolution during patient recovery from asphyxia. Our exploratory study showed that neonatal EEG can be quantified using multifractal metrics, which might offer a suitable parameter to quantify the grade of EEG background, or to monitor changes in brain state that take place during long-term brain monitoring.

The brain mechanisms of how on-line sensory-motor processes affect off-line neural self-face representations are unknown. This study used 3D virtual reality to create a 'virtual mirror' in which participants saw an avatar's face moving synchronously with their own face movements. Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis during virtual mirror exposure revealed mu oscillations in sensory-motor cortex signalling on-line congruency between the avatar's and participants' movements. After such exposure and compatible with a change in their off-line self-face representation, participants were more prone to recognize the avatar's face as their own, and this was also reflected in the activation of face-specific regions in the inferotemporal cortex. Further EEG analysis showed that the on-line sensory-motor effects during virtual mirror exposure caused these off-line visual effects, revealing the brain mechanisms that maintain a coherent self-representation, despite our continuously changing appearance.

EEG was recorded from participants who attended a photo of an object, and responded to a left-or right-pointing arrow, which was overlaid on the object 1000ms after object onset. Analysis of response times demonstrated the presence of a feature saliency effect. Lateralization of posterior alpha suppression showed that attention was initially directed to the object's (most salient) functional end. Pre-movement frontocentral beta suppression and the modulation of the P3 component showed that a response compatible to the functional end was activated before arrow onset. Moreover, lateralization of pre-movement posterior and central alpha suppression indicated a behaviorally masked affordance effect. This suggests that the two effects may occur independently, but without specific attention orienting instructions, the feature saliency effect dominates a potential prehensile affordance effect.

CORRELATION BETWEEN CORTICAL AND SUBCORTICAL NEURAL DYNAMICS ON MULTIPLE TIME SCALES IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						connectivity; deep brain stimulation; detrended fluctuation analysis; imaginary part of coherency; long-range temporal correlations; oscillations	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; FIELD POTENTIAL RECORDINGS; HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION	Complex amplitude dynamics of dominant alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the cortex can be captured with long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in healthy subjects and in various diseases. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), intra-nuclear coherence was demonstrated in dominant beta rhythms (10-30 Hz) in the basal ganglia. However, so far the relation between cortical LRTC (across tens of seconds) and subcortical coherence (millisecond scale) is unknown. We addressed these "multiscale interactions'' by simultaneous recordings of surface electroen-cephalography (EEG) and deep local field potentials (LFP) from the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) in eight patients with severe PD eligible for deep brain stimulation, who performed a lexical decision task on medication. In the continuous data set LRTC up to 20 s were calculated in the amplitude envelope of 8-13-Hz EEG oscillations (across whole scalp), and subcortical coherence was assessed with measures being insensitive to volume conduction artifacts (imaginary part of coherency; iCOH) in 10-20 and 21-30-Hz oscillations in STN-LFP. We showed a significant positive correlation across patients between cortical LRTC (813 Hz) and subcortical iCOH selectively in 10-20-Hz oscillations in the left STN. Our results suggest a relation between neural dynamics in the most dominant rhythms in the cortex and basal ganglia in PD, extending across multiple time scales (milliseconds vs. tens of seconds). Furthermore, the investigation of multiscale interactions might contribute to our understanding of cortical-subcortical neural coupling in PD. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of them suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus, development of antidepressants without undesirable side effects would be preferable. Previously, crude alkaloid extract from Mitragyna speciosa (MS) Korth was found to produce antidepressant activities. It was hypothesized that the alkaloid extract from MS may attenuate ethanol withdrawal without REM sleep disturbance. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes over the frontal and parietal cortices were used for two separated studies. For an acute study, 10 mg/kg fluoxetine or 60 mg/kg alkaloid extract from MS were administered intragastrically. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded for 3 h to examine sleep profiles and EEG fingerprints. Another set of animal was used for an ethanol withdrawal study. They were rendered dependent on ethanol via a modified liquid diet (MLD) containing ethanol ad libitum for 28 days. On day 29, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or alkaloid extract from MS (60 mg/kg) were administered 15 min before the ethanol-containing MLD was replaced with an isocaloric ethanol-free MW to induced ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Results: The sleep analysis revealed that alkaloid extract from MS did not change any REM parameters which included average duration of each REM episode, total REM time, number of REM episode and REM latency whereas fluoxetine significantly suppressed all REM parameters and delayed REM latency. However, power spectral analysis revealed similar fingerprints for fluoxetine and alkaloid extract from MS characterized by decreasing powers in the slow frequency range in frontal and parietal cortical EEG. Neither treatment affected spontaneous motor activity. Finally, both alkaloid extract from MS and fluoxetine were found to significantly attenuate ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability (increases gamma activity) in both cortices and to reduce locomotor activity. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the alkaloid extract from MS alleviates ethanol withdrawal severity with no side effect on REM sleep. In addition, these data suggest that suppressive effects on slow frequency powers but not REM sleep may be hallmarks of effective antidepressants for ethanol withdrawal treatment.

J	Kononowicz, TW; van Rijn, H				Kononowicz, Tadeusz W.; van Rijn, Hedderik			Single trial beta oscillations index time estimation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Beta power oscillations; Interval timing; Dopamine; Inhibition	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; INTERNAL CLOCK; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; DOPAMINE; FLUCTUATIONS; STIMULATION; MOVEMENT; EEG	Recent work shows that putamen-originating beta power oscillations serve as a carrier for temporal information during tapping tasks, with higher beta power associated with longer temporal reproductions. However, given the nature of tapping tasks, it is difficult to determine whether beta power dynamics observed in these tasks are linked to the generation or execution of motor programs or to the internal representation of time. To assess whether recent findings in animals generalize to human studies we reanalyzed existing EEG data of participants who estimated a 2.5 s time interval with self-paced onset and offset keypresses. The results showed that the trial-to-trial beta power measured after the onset predicts the produced duration, such that higher beta power indexes longer produced durations. Moreover, although beta power measured before the first key-press also influenced the estimated interval, it did so independently from post-first-keypress beta power. These results suggest that initial motor inhibition plays an important role in interval production, and that this inhibition can be interpreted as a biased starting point of the decision processes involved in time estimation.

A study of the dynamics of seizure propagation across micro domains in the vicinity of the seizure onset zone	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						micro seizure propagation; high gamma band; directed transfer function	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; TEMPORAL-LOBE; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT; GRANGER CAUSALITY; INFORMATION-FLOW; BRAIN; EEG; EPILEPSY	Objective. The use of micro-electrode arrays to measure electrical activity from the surface of the brain is increasingly being investigated as a means to improve seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization. In this work, we used a multivariate autoregressive model to determine the evolution of seizure dynamics in the 70-110 Hz high frequency band across micro-domains sampled by such micro-electrode arrays. We showed that a directed transfer function (DTF) can be used to estimate the flow of seizure activity in a set of simulated micro-electrode data with known propagation pattern. Approach. We used seven complex partial seizures recorded from four patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for surgical evaluation to reconstruct the seizure propagation pattern over sliding windows using a DTF measure. Main results. We showed that a DTF can be used to estimate the flow of seizure activity in a set of simulated micro-electrode data with a known propagation pattern. In general, depending on the location of the micro-electrode grid with respect to the clinical SOZ and the time from seizure onset, ictal propagation changed in directional characteristics over a 2-10 s time scale, with gross directionality limited to spatial dimensions of approximately 9 mm(2). It was also seen that the strongest seizure patterns in the high frequency band and their sources over such micro-domains are more stable over time and across seizures bordering the clinically determined SOZ than inside. Significance. This type of propagation analysis might in future provide an additional tool to epileptologists for characterizing epileptogenic tissue. This will potentially help narrowing down resection zones without compromising essential brain functions as well as provide important information about targeting anti-epileptic stimulation devices.

Comprehensive analysis suggests simple processes underlying EEG/ERP - Demonstration with the go/no-go paradigm in ADHD	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Analysis; Oscillations; ADHD; Go/no-go	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS; CHILDREN; TASK; METHYLPHENIDATE; INHIBITION; ADULTS; BRAIN; EEG	Background: Current basic or more advanced methods for analysis of averaged EEG/ERP are based on assumptions on the underlying processes, which are not necessarily precise. New method: In this work we present the findings of a method which obviates such assumptions and aims at a comprehensive analysis of the averaged EEG/ERP signal. Results: For the sake of demonstration we chose the established go/no-go paradigm in the context of ADHD. Our analysis method characterized two spatiotemporally distinct neurophysiologic processes which underlie the sampled signal: one which may be related to attention and the other which may be more related to perception. Comparison with existing method(s): We show how these processes accord with and provide insight on the waveforms reported in the literature. Conclusions: Finally we suggest that application of our method on averaged EEG/ERP data sampled from other paradigms may point at a similarly parsimonious set of underlying neurophysiologic processes which underlie the signal.

Multiscale entropy (MSE), an entropy-based method to measure dynamic complexity at multiple temporal scales, is helpful to disclose the information of brain connectivity. This study investigated the complexity of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using MSE in children with absence epilepsy. In this research, EEG signals from 19 channels of the entire brain in 21 children aged 5-12 years with absence epilepsy were analyzed. The EEG signals of pre-ictal (before seizure) and ictal states (during seizure) were analyzed by sample entropy (SamEn) and MSE methods. Variations of complexity index (CI), which was calculated from MSE, from the pre-ictal to the ictal states were also analyzed. The entropy values in the pre-ictal state were significantly higher than those in the ictal state. The MSE revealed more differences in analysis compared to the SamEn. The occurrence of absence seizures decreased the CI in all channels. Changes in CI were also significantly greater in the frontal and central parts of the brain, indicating fronto-central cortical involvement of "cortico-thalamo-cortical network" in the occurrence of generalized spike and wave discharges during absence seizures. Moreover, higher sampling frequency was more sensitive in detecting functional changes in the ictal state. There was significantly higher correlation in ictal states in the same patient in different seizures but there were great differences in CI among different patients, indicating that CI changes were consistent in different absence seizures in the same patient but not from patient to patient. This implies that the brain stays in a homogeneous activation state during the absence seizures. In conclusion, MSE analysis is better than SamEn analysis to analyze complexity of EEG, and CI can be used to investigate the functional brain changes during absence seizures.

The electro encephalo gram (EEG), a record of the oscillations of brain electric potentials reveals the synaptic action that strongly co-relate with brain state. As the EEG signal is non linear, non stationary and noisy, non linear methods will be suitable for the analysis. Fractal dimension (FD) is a useful concept in describing natural objects, which gives their degree of complexity. We used the fractal dimension (FD), a measure of complexity to analyze the effect of radiation while using mobile phone. Then fractal dimension of the complete data set for 21 electrodes were analyzed using Kruskal Wallis test. The test is significant for two electrodes. Then FD of different classes of EEG signals namely delta, theta alpha, beta and gamma for 21 channels were tested with Kruskal Wallis test, which is significant for three electrodes in gamma band. It can be concluded that as a whole, there is no effect on EEG complexity while using mobile phone.	[Smitha, C.

The methods of EEG signal coupling and synchronization act as a key role in evaluating and diagnosing MCI patients. Recently, these coupling and synchronization methods were used to analyze the EEG signals of MCI patients according to different angles, and many important discoveries have been achieved. However, considering that every method is single-faceted in solving problems, these methods have various deficiencies when analyzing EEG signals of MCI patients. This paper reviewed in detail the coupling and synchronization analysis methods, analyzed their advantages and disadvantages, and proposed a few research questions needed to solve in the future. Also, the principles and best performances of these methods were described. It is expected that the performance analysis of these methods can provide the theoretical basis for the method selection of analyzing EEG signals of MCI patients and the future research directions.

Dreaming and the default network: A review, synthesis, and counterintuitive research proposal	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Review						Dreaming; Mind-wandering; Sleep-onset process; Default network; EEG/fMRI	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MODE NETWORK; REM-SLEEP; MENTAL ACTIVITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; WAKEFULNESS	This article argues that the default network, augmented by secondary visual and sensorimotor cortices, is the likely neural correlate of dreaming. This hypothesis is based on a synthesis of work on dream content, the findings on the contents and neural correlates of mind-wandering, and the results from EEG and neuroimaging studies of REM sleep. Relying on studies in the 1970s that serendipitously discovered episodes of dreaming during waking mind-wandering, this article presents the seemingly counterintuitive hypothesis that the neural correlates for dreaming could be further specified in the process of carrying out EEG/fMRI studies of mind-wandering and default network activity. This hypothesis could be tested by asking participants for experiential reports during moments of differentially high levels of default network activation, as indicated by mixed EEG/fMRI criteria. Evidence from earlier EEG/fMRI studies of mind-wandering and from laboratory studies of dreaming during the sleep-onset process is used to support the argument. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In real applications, EEGs are inevitably contaminated with unexpected outlier artifacts, and this must be overcome. However, most of the current AR models are based on the 12 norm structure, which exaggerates the outlier effect due to the square property of the L2 norm. In this paper, a novel AR object function is constructed in the Lp (p <= 1) norm space with the aim to compress the outlier effects on EEG analysis, and a fast iteration procedure is developed to solve this new AR model. The quantitative evaluation using simulated EEGs with outliers proves that the proposed Lp (p <= 1) AR can estimate the AR parameters more robustly than the Yule-Walker, Burg and LS methods, under various simulated outlier conditions. The actual application to the resting EEG recording with ocular artifacts also demonstrates that Lp (p <= 1) AR can effectively address the outliers and recover a resting EEG power spectrum that is more consistent with its physiological basis.

J	van Ede, F; van Pelt, S; Fries, P; Maris, E				van Ede, Freek; van Pelt, Stan; Fries, Pascal; Maris, Eric			Both ongoing alpha and visually induced gamma oscillations show reliable diversity in their across-site phase-relations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						gamma oscillations; human; magnetoencephalography; neural oscillations; phase-relation	TRAVELING-WAVES; CORTEX; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; EEG	Neural oscillations have emerged as one of the major electrophysiological phenomena investigated in cognitive and systems neuroscience. These oscillations are typically studied with regard to their amplitude, phase, and/or phase coupling. Here we demonstrate the existence of another property that is intrinsic to neural oscillations but has hitherto remained largely unexplored in cognitive and systems neuroscience. This pertains to the notion that these oscillations show reliable diversity in their phase-relations between neighboring recording sites (phase-relation diversity). In contrast to most previous work, we demonstrate that this diversity is restricted neither to low-frequency oscillations nor to periods outside of sensory stimulation. On the basis of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings in humans, we show that this diversity is prominent not only for ongoing alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) but also for gamma oscillations (50-70 Hz) that are induced by sustained visual stimulation. We further show that this diversity provides a dimension within electrophysiological data that, provided a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, does not covary with changes in amplitude. These observations place phase-relation diversity on the map as a prominent and general property of neural oscillations that, moreover, can be studied with noninvasive methods in healthy human volunteers. This opens important new avenues for investigating how neural oscillations contribute to the neural implementation of cognition and behavior.

The evolution to hypsarrhythmia involves conversion of prehypsarrhythmic EEG findings to sporadic hypsarrhythmia paroxysms (HPs), and when paroxysms reach a certain frequency, ISs begin to occur. This retrospective chart study aimed to determine the HP threshold frequency after which ISs begin. Recorded either prior (Group A) or subsequent (Group B) to IS relapse, 248 EEGs were examined in 42 patients. The number of HPs in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep divided by NREM duration constituted the countable hypsarrhythmia paroxysms index (cHPI). After reaching a rate of approximately 10/min, the cHPI lost its feasibility due to the merging of HPs. The durational HPI (dHPI) was also calculated (total duration of HPs during NREM/NREM sleep time x 100). ACTH treatment was administered if cHPI was >= 2/min, with the aim of preventing relapse. The mean cHPI value without a concomitant spasm relapse (in Group A) was 1.20/min. Following relapse, this value rose to 4.10/min. EEGs performed subsequent to relapse (in Group B) were classified into three subgroups (B1, B2, and B3) according to the duration of the time interval between IS relapse and the succeeding EEG recording. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that cHPI values differed significantly between the Group B subgroups. In subgroups B2 and B3, a higher number of EEGs were evaluated via dHPI. Linear regression analysis established that the interval between recurrence and the succeeding EEG recording significantly predicted cHPI values and accounted for 54.2% of the explained variability in cHPI values. Therefore, use of the cHPI for early recognition and intervention may aid in preventing the onset and recurrence of ISs and further deterioration of psychomotor development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Oscillatory correlates of autobiographical memory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; Default mode network; EEG; Alpha oscillations; Independent component analysis; Source localization	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INTERNALLY DIRECTED ATTENTION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES	Recollection of events from one's own life is referred to as autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memory is an important part of our self. Neuroimaging findings link self-referential processes with the default mode network (DMN). Much evidence coming primarily from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies shows that autobiographical memory and DMN have a common neural base. In this study, electroencephalographic data collected in 47 participants during recollection of autobiographical episodes were analyzed using temporal and spatial independent component analyses in combination with source localization. Autobiographical remembering was associated with an increase of spectral power in alpha and beta and a decrease in delta band. The increase of alpha power, as estimated by sLORETA, was most prominent in the posterior DMN, but was also observed in visual and motor cortices, prompting an assumption that it is associated with activation of DMN and inhibition of irrelevant sensory and motor areas. In line with data linking delta oscillations with aversive states, decrease of delta power was more pronounced in episodes associated with positive emotions, whereas episodes associated with negative emotions were accompanied by an increase of delta power. Vividness of recollection correlated positively with theta oscillations. These results highlight the leading role of alpha oscillations and the DMN in the processes accompanying autobiographical remembering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multivariate genetic determinants of EEG oscillations in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder from the BSNIP study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CLINICAL PHENOTYPES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; CANDIDATE GENES; DISC1; NETWORKS	Schizophrenia (SZ) and psychotic bipolar disorder (PBP) are disabling psychiatric illnesses with complex and unclear etiologies. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory abnormalities in SZ and PBP probands are heritable and expressed in their relatives, but the neurobiology and genetic factors mediating these abnormalities in the psychosis dimension of either disorder are less explored. We examined the polygenic architecture of eyes-open resting state EEG frequency activity (intrinsic frequency) from 64 channels in 105 SZ, 145 PBP probands and 56 healthy controls (HCs) from the multisite BSNIP (Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes) study. One million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were derived from DNA. We assessed eight data-driven EEG frequency activity derived from group-independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with a reduced subset of 10 422 SNPs through novel multivariate association using parallel ICA (para-ICA). Genes contributing to the association were examined collectively using pathway analysis tools. Para-ICA extracted five frequency and nine SNP components, of which theta and delta activities were significantly correlated with two different gene components, comprising genes participating extensively in brain development, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Delta and theta abnormality was present in both SZ and PBP, while theta differed between the two disorders. Theta abnormalities were also mediated by gene clusters involved in glutamic acid pathways, cadherin and synaptic contact-based cell adhesion processes. Our data suggest plausible multifactorial genetic networks, including novel and several previously identified (DISC1) candidate risk genes, mediating low frequency delta and theta abnormalities in psychoses. The gene clusters were enriched for biological properties affecting neural circuitry and involved in brain function and/or development.	[Narayanan, B.; Soh, P.; Pearlson, G.

A systematic review of the neurophysiology of mindfulness on EEG oscillations	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Mindfulness; Meditation; Neurophysiology; EEG; Systematic review	ORIENTED RECOVERY ENHANCEMENT; COGNITIVE THERAPY; BETA-ACTIVITY; CHRONIC PAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALPHA-ASYMMETRY; THETA ACTIVITY; MEDITATION; ATTENTION; BRAIN	Mindfulness meditation has been purported to be a beneficial practice for wellbeing. It would therefore be expected that the neurophysiology of mindfulness would reflect this impact on wellbeing. However, investigations of the effects of mindfulness have generated mixed reports of increases, decreases, as well as no differences in EEG oscillations in comparison with a resting state and a variety of tasks. We have performed a systematic review of EEG studies of mindfulness meditation in order to determine any common effects and to identify factors which may impact on the effects. Databases were reviewed from 1966 to August 2015. Eligibility criteria included empirical quantitative analyses of mindfulness meditation practice and EEG measurements acquired in relation to practice. A total of 56 papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, consisting of a total 1715 subjects: 1358 healthy individuals and 357 individuals with psychiatric diagnoses. Studies were principally examined for power outcomes in each bandwidth, in particular the power differentials between mindfulness and a control state, as well as outcomes relating to hemispheric asymmetry and event-related potentials. The systematic review revealed that mindfulness was most commonly associated with enhanced alpha and theta power as compared to an eyes closed resting state, although such outcomes were not uniformly reported. No consistent patterns were observed with respect to beta, delta and gamma bandwidths. In summary, mindfulness is associated with increased alpha and theta power in both healthy individuals and in patient groups. This co-presence of elevated alpha and theta may signify a state of relaxed alertness which is conducive to mental health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oscillatory signatures of crossmodal congruence effects: An EEG investigation employing a visuotactile pattern matching paradigm	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cortical oscillations; Multisensory integration; Visuotactile; Pattern matching; Crossmodal congruence	AUDITORY OBJECT RECOGNITION; IMPROVES VISUAL-PERCEPTION; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; SIMPLE REACTION-TIME; FEATURE INTEGRATION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ENHANCEMENT; MODULATION	Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is an ongoing debate about the neurophysiological mechanisms of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (<30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms while human participants were engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching paradigm and analyzed oscillatory power in the theta-(4-7 Hz), alpha-(8-13 Hz) and beta-bands (13-30 Hz). Employing the same physical stimuli, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visuotactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics related to crossmodal congruence within the two tasks were observed in the beta-band for crossmodal target detection, as well as in the theta-band for congruence evaluation. Contrasting ongoing activity preceding visuotactile stimulation between the two tasks revealed differences in the alpha-and beta-bands. Source reconstruction of between-task differences showed prominent involvement of premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, somatosensory association cortex and the supramarginal gyrus. These areas not only exhibited more involvement in the pre-stimulus interval for target detection compared to congruence evaluation, but were also crucially involved in post-stimulus differences related to crossmodal stimulus congruence within the detection task. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are functionally relevant for integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visuotactile pattern matching in the current study.

J	Vossen, A; Gross, J; Thut, G				Vossen, Alexandra; Gross, Joachim; Thut, Gregor			Alpha Power Increase After Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation at Alpha Frequency (alpha-tACS) Reflects Plastic Changes Rather Than Entrainment	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Alpha oscillations; Entrainment; Spike-timing dependent plasticity; Electroencephalogram; Synchronization	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; TIMING-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NETWORK DYNAMICS; PRIMARY MOTOR; 10 HZ	Background: Periodic stimulation of occipital areas using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at alpha (alpha) frequency (8-12 Hz) enhances electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha-oscillation long after tACS-offset. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie these changes in oscillatory EEG activity: tACS-induced entrainment of brain oscillations and/or tACS-induced changes in oscillatory circuits by spike-timing dependent plasticity. Objective: We tested to what extent plasticity can account for tACS-aftereffects when controlling for entrainment "echoes." To this end, we used a novel, intermittent tACS protocol and investigated the strength of the aftereffect as a function of phase continuity between successive tACS episodes, as well as the match between stimulation frequency and endogenous alpha-frequency. Methods: 12 healthy participants were stimulated at around individual alpha-frequency for 11-15 min in four sessions using intermittent tACS or sham. Successive tACS events were either phase-continuous or phase-discontinuous, and either 3 or 8 s long. EEG alpha-phase and power changes were compared after and between episodes of alpha-tACS across conditions and against sham. Results: alpha-aftereffects were successfully replicated after intermittent stimulation using 8-s but not 3-s trains. These aftereffects did not reveal any of the characteristics of entrainment echoes in that they were independent of tACS phase-continuity and showed neither prolonged phase alignment nor frequency synchronization to the exact stimulation frequency. Conclusion: Our results indicate that plasticity mechanisms are sufficient to explain alpha-aftereffects in response to alpha-tACS, and inform models of tACS-induced plasticity in oscillatory circuits. Modifying brain oscillations with tACS holds promise for clinical applications in disorders involving abnormal neural synchrony. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI and a whole-brain analysis to investigate the effects of prestimulus alpha activity on the event-related BOLD response during an auditory oddball task. We separately investigated the effects of the posterior alpha rhythm's power and phase on activity related to task-relevant stimulus processing and also investigated higher-level decision-related processing. We found stronger decision-related BOLD activity in areas late in the processing stream when subjects were in the high alpha power state prior to stimulus onset, but did not detect any effect in primary sensory regions. Our phase analysis revealed correlates in the bilateral thalamus, providing support for a thalamo-cortical loop in attentional modulations and suggesting that the cortical alpha rhythm acts as a cyclic modulator of task-related responses very early in the processing stream. Our results help to reconcile the competing inhibition and active-processing hypotheses for ongoing alpha oscillations and begin to tease apart the distinct roles and mechanisms underlying their power and phase.

The use of a basis not only guarantees accuracy in the reconstruction process but also requires the uniqueness of the representation using the basis. By admitting a redundancy in representations of a signal i.e. as a way of decomposition, MCA introduced the concept of a "dictionary", which includes mixtures of traditional basis. This method is frequently applied to biological signals and natural and complex image processing. In the present study, we applied MCA to decompose real electrooculography (EOG) in the time-frequency domain, which includes the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, noise originating from measurement tools and cables for signal transmission and amplification, power-supply instability, biological fluctuations and so on. In our analysis using MCA, the EOG was decomposed into separate signal sources that could be represented using a linear expansion of waveforms from redundant dictionaries: DIRAC, UDWT and DCT. MCA was performed over several iterations to reduce the error in reconstruction. During this process; decomposed signals exhibited different characteristics in the time-frequency domain. By stopping the iteration when the correlation coefficient between the original and reconstructed signals reached a maximum (0.989 as the average), the DIRAC, UDWT and DCT represent irregular spikes, smooth curve in both the frequency and time domains and high-pass filtered components, respectively. Our results demonstrate successful decomposition via MCA and, consequently, authenticate it as an effective tool for the removal of artifacts from raw EOG signals.

Assignment of Empirical Mode Decomposition Components and Its Application to Biomedical Signals	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; correspondence problem; assignment problem; HRV; EEG	FULL-TERM NEWBORNS; TIME-VARIANT; EEG; AMPLITUDE; ALGORITHMS; COUPLINGS; PREMATURE	Objectives: Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a frequently used signal processing approach which adaptively decomposes a signal into a set of narrow-band components known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). For multi-trial, multivariate (multiple simultaneous recordings), and multi-subject analyses the number and signal properties of the IMFs can deviate from each other between trials, channels and subjects. A further processing of IMFs, e.g. a simple ensemble averaging, should determine which IMFs of one signal correspond to IMFs from another signal. When the signal properties have similar characteristics, the IMFs are assigned to each other. This problem is known as correspondence problem. Methods: From the mathematical point of view, in some cases the correspondence problem can be transformed into an assignment problem which can be solved e.g. by the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (KMA) by which a minimal cost matching can be found. We use the KMA for solving classic assignment problems, i.e. the pairwise correspondence between two sets of IMFs of equal cardinalities, and for pairwise correspondences between two sets of IMFs with different cardinalities representing an unbalanced assignment problem which is a special case of the k-cardinality assignment problem. Results:A KMA-based approach to solve the correspondence problem was tested by using simulated, heart rate variability (HRV), and EEG data. The KMA-based results of HRV decomposition are compared with those obtained from a hierarchical cluster analysis (state-of-the-art). The major difference between the two approaches is that there is a more consistent assignment pattern using KMA. Integrating KMA into complex analysis concepts enables a comprehensive exploitation of the key advantages of the EMD. This can be demonstrated by non-linear analysis of HRV-related IMFs and by an EMD-based cross-frequency coupling analysis of the EEG data. Conclusions: The successful application to HRV and EEG analysis demonstrates that our solutions can be used for automated EMD-based processing concepts for biomedical signals.

Here, we identify and discuss several outstanding issues or conundrums in regards to the recording, analysis, and interpretation of HFOs in the epileptic brain to critically highlight what is known and what is not about these enigmatic events. High-frequency oscillations reflect a range of neuronal processes contributing to overlapping frequencies from the lower 80 Hz to the very fast spectral frequency bands. Given their complex neuronal nature, HFOs are extremely sensitive to recording conditions and analytical approaches. We provide a list of recommendations that could help to obtain comparable HFO signals in clinical and basic epilepsy research. Adopting basic standards will facilitate data sharing and interpretation that collectively will aid in understanding the role of HFOs in health and disease for translational purpose.

It has been shown using EEG source localisation, as well as simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI, that the auditory evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) is modulated by attention. In addition to auditory cortex activity a dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) generator could be involved. In the present study we investigated aeGBR magnetic fields using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We aimed to localize the aeGBR sources and its connectivity features in relation to mental effort. We investigated the aeGBR magnetic fields in 13 healthy participants using a 275-channel CTF-MEG system. The experimental paradigms were two auditory choice reaction tasks with different difficulties and demands for mental effort. We performed source localization with eLORETA and calculated the aeGBR lagged phase synchronization between bilateral auditory cortices and frontal midline structures. The eLORETA analysis revealed sources of the aeGBR within bilateral auditory cortices and in frontal midline structures of the brain including the dACC. Compared to the control condition the dACC source activity was found to be significantly stronger during the performance of the cognitively demanding task. Moreover, this task involved a significantly stronger functional connectivity between auditory cortices and dACC. In accordance with previous EEG and EEG-fMRI investigations, our study confirms an aeGBR generator in the dACC by means of MEG and suggests its involvement in the effortful processing of auditory stimuli.

The targeting of physiologic features of epileptogenesis in FCD and colocalizing functionality has enhanced completeness of surgical resection, the main determinant of outcome. Electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography are helpful in guiding electrode implantation and surgical treatment, and high-frequency oscillations help defining the extent of the epileptogenic dysplasia. Ultra high-field MRI has a role in understanding the laminar organization of the cortex, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is highly sensitive for detecting FCD in MRI-negative cases. Multimodal imaging is clinically valuable, either by improving the rate of postoperative seizure freedom or by reducing postoperative deficits. However, there is no level 1 evidence that it improves outcomes. Prooffor a specific effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in FCD is lacking. Pathogenic mutations recently described in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes in FCD have yielded important insights into novel treatment options with mTOR inhibitors, which might represent an example of personalized treatment of epilepsy based on the known mechanisms of disease. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in children with epilepsy caused by structural abnormalities, especially FCD. It attenuates epigenetic chromatin modifications, a master regulator for gene expression and functional adaptation of the cell, thereby modifying disease progression. This could imply lasting benefit of dietary manipulation. Neurostimulation techniques have produced variable clinical outcomes in FCD. In widespread dysplasias, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has achieved responder rates >50%; however, the efficacy of noninvasive cranial nerve stimulation modalities such as transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) and noninvasive (nVNS) requires further study. Althoughreview of current strategies underscores the serious shortcomings of treatment-resistant cases, initial evidence from novel approaches suggests that future success is possible.

J	Riddle, J				Riddle, Justin			FRACTAL COGNITIVE TRIAD: THE THEORETICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE AND NEURAL OSCILLATIONS	COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Oscillations; Cognition; Fractal; Homunculus; Emergence; Submergence	FREQUENCY; GAMMA; EEG	It has long been appreciated that the brain is oscillatory(1). Early measurements of brain electrophysiology revealed rhythmic synchronization unifying large swaths of the brain. The study of neural oscillation has enveloped cognitive neuroscience and neural systems. The traditional belief that oscillations are epiphenomenal of neuron spiking is being challenged by intracellular oscillations and the theoretical backing that oscillatory activity is fundamental to physics. Subjective experience oscillates at three particular frequency bands in a cognitive triad: perception at 5 Hz (exogenous), action at 2 Hz (endogenous), and attention at 0.1 Hz (cognitive). This triad functions as a means of information flow across scales of magnitude in a biological fractal. The Homunculus Solution is proposed in which mental experience occurs at fixed scales of biology. The mind is composed of minds, perceived as "the voices in your head." Each voice has voices inside its head to increasingly microscopic scales, forming an interactive fractal of subjective experience.

J	Schalk, G				Schalk, Gerwin			A general framework for dynamic cortical function: the function-through-biased-oscillations (FBO) hypothesis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oscillations; information routing; communication-through-coherence; gating-by-inhibition; oscillatory modulation	EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SINGLE-NEURON ACTIVITY; EVOKED-RESPONSES; PHASE-RESET; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; VISUAL-STIMULI; MOTOR CORTEX; MECHANISMS	A central goal of neuroscience is to determine how the brain's relatively static anatomy can support dynamic cortical function, i.e., cortical function that varies according to task demands. In pursuit of this goal, scientists have produced a large number of experimental results and established influential conceptual frameworks, in particular communication-through-coherence (GIG) and gating-by-inhibition (GBI), but these data and frameworks have not provided a parsimonious view of the principles that underlie cortical function. Here I synthesize these existing experimental results and the CTC and GBI frameworks, and propose the function-through-biased-oscillations (FBO) hypothesis as a model to understand dynamic cortical function. The FBO hypothesis suggests that oscillatory voltage amplitude is the principal measurement that directly reflects cortical excitability, that asymmetries in voltage amplitude explain a range of brain signal phenomena, and that predictive variations in such asymmetric oscillations provide a simple and general model for information routing that can help to explain dynamic cortical function.

Slow-wave oscillations in a corticothalamic model of sleep and wake	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Slow wave sleep; Neural field theory; Thalamus; Cortex	ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; NEURONS; MECHANISMS; PARAMETERS; SEIZURES; SPECTRA; RHYTHMS; SWITCH; STATES	A physiologically-based corticothalamic neural field model is used to study slow wave oscillations including cortical UP and DOWN states in deep sleep by extending it to incorporate bursting dynamics of neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus. The interplay of local bursting dynamics and network interactions produces the cortical UP and DOWN states of slow wave sleep while preserving previously verified model predictions in the wake state. Results show that EEG spectral features in wake and sleep are reproduced. The bursting is subthreshold but acts to intensify the amplitude of oscillations in slow wave sleep with deep UP/DOWN oscillations on the cortex emerging naturally. Furthermore, there is a continuous cycle between the two regimes, rather than a flip-flop between discrete states. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a feature extraction method based on phase space for motor imagery tasks recognition. To remodel the single nonlinear sequence is to reveal variety information hidden in the original series by its phase space reconstruction, and maintaining the original information continuity. Three phase space features (PSF) datasets are used to classify two Graz BC! datasets. The simulation has shown that the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers based on the PSF outperform all the winners of the BCI Competition 2003 and other similar studies on the same Graz dataset in terms of the competition criterion of the mutual information (MI) or misclassification rate. The maximal MI was 0.67 and the minimal misclassification rate was 9.29% for Graz2003 dataset by using the combined PSF. According to the competition criterion of the maximal MI steepness, the LDA classifier based on PSF yielded a better performance than the winner of the BCI Competition 2005 and other similar research on the same Graz dataset for subject 03. The maximal MI steepness of 03 is 0.7355. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SENSORIMOTOR EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION REPRESENTS THE EXCITABILITY OF HUMAN SPINAL MOTONEURONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; cortical oscillations; spinal excitability; F-wave; motor imagery	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; F-WAVE; IMAGERY; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; MU; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION	Amplitudes of mu and beta (7-26 Hz) oscillations measured by electroencephalography over the sensorimotor areas are suppressed during motor imagery as well as during voluntary movements. This phenomenon is referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD) and is known to reflect motor cortical excitability. The increased motor cortical excitability associated with ERD during hand motor imagery would induce a descending cortical volley to spinal motoneurons, resulting in facilitation of spinal motoneuronal excitability. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the association of ERD during motor imagery with the excitability of spinal motoneurons in 15 healthy participants. Spinal excitability was tested using the F-wave recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The F-wave results from antidromic activation of spinal motoneurons and is induced by peripheral nerve stimulation. Participants performed 5 s of motor imagery of right thumb abduction following 7 s of rest. The right median nerve was stimulated at wrist level when the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand sensorimotor area exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. The results showed ERD magnitude during hand motor imagery was associated with an increase in F-wave persistence, but not with the response average of F-wave amplitude or F-wave latency. These findings suggest that the ERD magnitude may be a biomarker representing increases in the excitability of both cortical and spinal levels. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In both paradigms we found brain regional sources in the temporal and frontal cortices active during the MMN period, consistent with some previous studies. In the simpler paradigm, the scalp-potential variance during the earlier (70-120 ms) MMN was mostly accounted for by a wide array of temporal, frontal, and parietal sources. In the more complex paradigm, however, a generator in the prefrontal cortex accounted for a substantial amount of the variance of the scalp potential during the somewhat later MMN period (120-200 ms). These findings are consistent with a more nuanced view of the MMN and its generators than has been held in the past. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Generation of physiological and pathological high frequency oscillations: the role of perisomatic inhibition in sharp-wave ripple and interictal spike generation	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; BASKET CELLS; HIPPOCAMPAL; RAT; INTERNEURONS; MECHANISMS	Sharp-wave-ripple complexes (SWRs) and interictal-spikes are physiological and pathological forms of irregularly occurring transient high activity events in the hippocampal EEG. They share similar features and carry high-frequency oscillations with different spectral features. Recent results reveal similarities and differences in the generation of the two types of transients, and argue that parvalbumin containing basket cells (PVBCs) are crucial in synchronizing neuronal activity in both cases. SWRs are generated in the reciprocally connected network of inhibitory PVBCs, while in the pathological case, synchronous failure of perisomatic inhibition triggers massive pyramidal cell burst firing. While physiological ripple oscillation is primarily the result of phasic perisomatic inhibitory currents, pathological high-frequency ripples are population spikes of partially synchronous, massively bursting, uninhibited pyramidal cells.

In the current study, age-related changes in sensory cortical gamma were studied using the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), indexing cortical activity entrained to a periodic auditory stimulus. A large sample (n = 188) aged 8-22 years had electroencephalography recording of ASSR during 20-, 30-, and 40-Hz click trains, analyzed for evoked amplitude, phase-locking factor (PLF) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) with lower frequency oscillations. Both 40-Hz evoked power and PLF increased monotonically from 8 through 16 years, and subsequently decreased toward ages 20-22 years. CFC followed a similar pattern, with strongest age-related modulation of 40-Hz amplitude by the phase of delta oscillations. In contrast, the evoked power, PLF and CFC for the 20- and 30-Hz stimulation were distinct from the 40-Hz condition, with flat or decreasing profiles from childhood to early adulthood. The inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory of gamma oscillations may be consistent with interacting maturational processes-such as increasing fast GABA inhibition that enhances gamma activity and synaptic pruning that decreases gamma activity-that may continue from childhood through to adulthood.

Previous studies using equivalent current dipole source localization of MEG/EEG signals have demonstrated a preponderance of slow-wave activity localized to perilesional areas. Recent studies have also demonstrated the utility of nonlinear analyses such as multiscale entropy (MSE) for quantifying neuronal dysfunction in a wide range of pathologies. The current study utilized beamformer-based reconstruction of signals in source space to compare spectral and nonlinear measures of electrical activity in perilesional and healthy cortices. Data were collected from chronic stroke patients and healthy controls, both young and elderly. We assessed relative power in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands, and also measured the nonlinear complexity of electrical activity using MSE. Perilesional tissue exhibited a general slowing of the power spectrum(increased delta/theta, decreased beta) as well as a reduction in MSE. All measures tested were similarly sensitive to changes in the posterior perilesional regions, but anterior perilesional dysfunction was detected better by MSE and beta power. The findings also suggest that MSE is specifically sensitive to electrophysiological dysfunction in perilesional tissue, while spectral measures were additionally affected by an increase in rolandic beta power with advanced age. Furthermore, perilesional electrophysiological abnormalities in the left hemisphere were correlated with the degree of language task-induced activation in the right hemisphere. Finally, we demonstrate that single subject spectral and nonlinear analyses can identify dysfunctional perilesional regions within individual patients that may be ideal targets for interventions with non-invasive brain stimulation.

Building on the platform of neuroimaging evidence on brain circuit models, magnetoencephalography, scalp electroencephalography, and even invasive electroencephalography are now being used to characterize brain network dysfunctions that underlie major depressive disorder using brain oscillation measurements and associated treatment responses. Such multiple encephalography modalities provide avenues to study pathologic network dynamics with high temporal resolution and over long time courses, opportunities to complement neuroimaging methods and findings, and new approaches to identify quantitative biomarkers that indicate critical targets for brain therapy. Such goals have been facilitated by the ongoing testing of novel invasive neuromodulation therapies, notably, deep brain stimulation, where clinically relevant treatment effects can be monitored at multiple brain sites in a time-locked causal manner. We review key brain rhythms identified in major depressive disorder as foundation for development of putative biomarkers for objectively evaluating neuromodulation success and for guiding deep brain stimulation or other target-based neuromodulation strategies for treatment-resistant depression patients.

J	O'Reilly, C; Godbout, J; Carrier, J; Lina, JM				O'Reilly, Christian; Godbout, Jonathan; Carrier, Julie; Lina, Jean-Marc			Combining time-frequency and spatial information for the detection of sleep spindles	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep spindles; detection; electroencephalography; time-frequency; hierarchical clustering; machine learning; pattern recognition; sleep	AUTOMATED DETECTION; BRAIN RHYTHMS; EEG; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; VALIDATION; WAVELET	EEG sleep spindles are short (0.5-2.0s) bursts of activity in the 11-16 Hz band occurring during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This sporadic activity is thought to play a role in memory consolidation, brain plasticity, and protection of sleep integrity. Many automatic detectors have been proposed to assist or replace experts for sleep spindle scoring. However, these algorithms usually detect too many events making it difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between sensitivity (Se) and false detection rate (FDr). In this work, we propose a semi-automatic detector comprising a sensitivity phase based on well-established criteria followed by a specificity phase using spatial and spectral criteria. In the sensitivity phase, selected events are those which amplitude in the 10-16 Hz band and spectral ratio characteristics both reject a null hypothesis (p < 0.1) stating that the considered event is not a spindle. This null hypothesis is constructed from events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep epochs. In the specificity phase, a hierarchical clustering of the selected candidates is done based on events' frequency and spatial position along the anterior-posterior axis. Only events from the classes grouping most (at least 80%) spindles scored by an expert are kept. We obtain Se = 93.2% and FDr = 93.0% in the first phase and Se = 85.4% and FDr = 86.2% in the second phase. For these two phases, Matthew's correlation coefficients are respectively 0.228 and 0.324. Results suggest that spindles are defined by specific spatio-spectral properties and that automatic detection methods can be improved by considering these features.

Comparisons of grand means, e.g. between conditions, are then often performed by subtraction. These operations, and their statistical evaluation with parametric tests such as anova, tacitly rely on the assumption that the data follow the additive model, have a normal distribution, and have a homogeneous variance. This may be true for single trials, but these conditions are rarely met when ERFs/ERPs are compared between subjects, meaning that the additive model is seldom the correct model for computing grand mean waveforms. Here, we summarize some of our recent work and present new evidence, from auditory-evoked MEG and EEG results, that the non-normal distributions and the heteroscedasticity observed instead result because ERFs/ERPs follow a mixed model with additive and multiplicative components. For peak amplitudes, such as the auditory M100 and N100, the multiplicative component dominates. These findings emphasize that the common practice of simply subtracting arithmetic means of auditory-evoked ERFs or ERPs is problematic without prior adequate transformation of the data. Application of the area sinus hyperbolicus (asinh) transform to data following the mixed model transforms them into the requested additive model with its normal distribution and homogeneous variance. We therefore advise checking the data for compliance with the additive model and using the asinh transform if required.

However, few studies have bridged the causal link between SMR activity and sports performance. This study investigated the effect of SMR neurofeedback training (SMR NFT) on golf putting performance. We hypothesized that preelite golfers would exhibit enhanced putting performance after SMR NFT. Sixteen preelite golfers were recruited and randomly assigned into either an SMR or a control group. Participants were asked to perform putting while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, both before and after intervention. Our results showed that the SMR group performed more accurately when putting and exhibited greater SMR power than the control group after 8 intervention sessions. This study concludes that SMR NFT is effective for increasing SMR during action preparation and for enhancing golf putting performance. Moreover, greater SMR activity might be an EEG signature of improved attention processing, which induces superior putting performance.

Role of white-matter pathways in coordinating alpha oscillations in resting visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							NEURONAL MECHANISMS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG ALPHA; MEG; DYNAMICS; RHYTHM; MODEL; PROPAGATION; REFLECT	In the absence of cognitive tasks and external stimuli, strong rhythmic fluctuations with a frequency approximate to 10 Hz emerge from posterior regions of human neocortex. These posterior a-oscillations can be recorded throughout the visual cortex and are particularly strong in the calcarine sulcus, where the primary visual cortex is located. The mechanisms and anatomical pathways through which local 'alpha-oscillations are coordinated however, are not fully understood. In this study, we used a combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and biophysical modeling to assess the role of white-matter pathways in coordinating cortical a-oscillations. Our findings suggest that primary visual cortex plays a special role in coordinating a-oscillations in higher-order visual regions. Specifically, the amplitudes of a-sources throughout visual cortex could be explained by propagation of a-oscillations from primary visual cortex through white-matter pathways. In particular, a-amplitudes within visual cortex correlated with both the anatomical and functional connection strengths to primary visual cortex. These findings reinforce the notion of posterior a-oscillations as intrinsic oscillations of the visual system. We speculate that they might reflect a default-mode of the visual system during which higher-order visual regions are rhythmically primed for expected visual stimuli by a-oscillations in primary visual cortex.

The 5XFAD mouse model was analyzed and compared with wild-type (WT) controls for aberrant cortical excitability and hippocampal theta oscillations by using simultaneous video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. Seizure staging revealed that 5XFAD mice exhibited cortical hyperexcitability whereas controls did not. In addition, 5XFAD mice displayed a significant increase in hippocampal theta activity from the light to dark phase during nonmotor activity. We also observed a reduction in mean theta frequency in 5XFAD mice compared to controls that was again most prominent during nonmotor activity. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal probes and subsequent qPCR validation revealed an upregulation of Plcd4 that might be indicative of enhanced muscarinic signalling. Our results suggest that 5XFAD mice exhibit altered cortical excitability, hippocampal dysrhythmicity, and potential changes in muscarinic signaling.

Here we investigate the relationship between phase shifts in alpha-frequency rhythms and reaction times during a visual simple reaction task by applying our previously described method (Naruse et al., 2013), which enables detection of phase shifts from a single EEG trial. In the left, parietal, and occipital areas, the reaction times in the trials in which phase shifts were detected before the button press were significantly longer than in those in which phase shifts were not so detected. These results indicate that phase shifts in the alpha and mu rhythms relate to variability in reaction times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Targeted Memory Reactivation during Sleep Depends on Prior Learning	SLEEP			English	Article						memory reactivation; consolidation; reactivation; slow-wave sleep; sleep spindles	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PROCEDURAL MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; SPINDLES; HUMANS	Study Objectives: When sounds associated with learning are presented again during slow-wave sleep, targeted memory reactivation (TMR) can produce improvements in subsequent location recall. Here we used TMR to investigate memory consolidation during an afternoon nap as a function of prior learning. Participants: Twenty healthy individuals (8 male, 19-23 y old). Measurements and Results: Participants learned to associate each of 50 common objects with a unique screen location. When each object appeared, its characteristic sound was played. After electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were applied, location recall was assessed for each object, followed by a 90-min interval for sleep. During EEG-verified slow-wave sleep, half of the sounds were quietly presented over white noise. Recall was assessed 3 h after initial learning. A beneficial effect of TMR was found in the form of higher recall accuracy for cued objects compared to uncued objects when pre-sleep accuracy was used as an explanatory variable. An analysis of individual differences revealed that this benefit was greater for participants with higher pre-sleep recall accuracy. In an analysis for individual objects, cueing benefits were apparent as long as initial recall was not highly accurate. Sleep physiology analyses revealed that the cueing benefit correlated with delta power and fast spindle density. Conclusions: These findings substantiate the use of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) methods for manipulating consolidation during sleep. TMR can selectively strengthen memory storage for object-location associations learned prior to sleep, except for those near-perfectly memorized. Neural measures found in conjunction with TMR-induced strengthening provide additional evidence about mechanisms of sleep consolidation.

Neural signatures of response planning occur midway through an incoming question in conversation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; TURN-TAKING; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; TASK; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SENTENCES; ATTENTION; RHYTHMS	A striking puzzle about language use in everyday conversation is that turn-taking latencies are usually very short, whereas planning language production takes much longer. This implies overlap between language comprehension and production processes, but the nature and extent of such overlap has never been studied directly. Combining an interactive quiz paradigm with EEG measurements in an innovative way, we show that production planning processes start as soon as possible, that is, within half a second after the answer to a question can be retrieved (up to several seconds before the end of the question). Localization of ERP data shows early activation even of brain areas related to late stages of production planning (e.g., syllabification). Finally, oscillation results suggest an attention switch from comprehension to production around the same time frame. This perspective from interactive language use throws new light on the performance characteristics that language competence involves.

Previous works have described modulations of theta activity in the medial frontal cortex elicited by either self-generated errors or erroneous feedback. In turn, similar patterns have recently been reported to appear after the observation of external errors. We report cross-regional interactions after observation of errors at both average and single-trial levels. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 15 subjects while monitoring the movement of a cursor on a computer screen. Connectivity patterns, estimated using multivariate auto-regressive models, show increased error-related modulations of the information transfer in the theta and alpha bands between frontocentral and frontolateral areas. Conversely, a decrease of connectivity in the beta band is also observed. These network patterns are similar to those elicited by self-generated errors. However, since no motor response is required, they appear to be related to intrinsic mechanisms of error processing, instead of being linked to co-activation of motor areas. Noticeably, we demonstrate that cross-regional interaction patterns can be estimated on a trial-by-trial basis. These trial-specific patterns, consistent with the multi-trial analysis, convey discriminant information on whether a trial was elicited by observation of an erroneous action. Overall, our study supports the role of frequency-specific modulations in the medial frontal cortex in coordinating cross-regional activity during cognitive monitoring at a single-trial basis.

We conducted a systematic study to investigate the effects of ketamine on cortical acetylcholine (ACh) and electroencephalographic coherence. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=11) were implanted with electrodes to record electroencephalogram (EEG) from frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices, and with a micro dialysis guide cannula for simultaneous measurement of ACh concentrations in prefrontal cortex before, during, and after ketamine anaesthesia. Coherence and power spectral density computed from the EEG, and ACh concentrations, were compared between conscious and unconscious states. Loss of righting reflex was used as a surrogate for unconsciousness. Results: Ketamine-induced unconsciousness was associated with a global reduction of power (P=0.02) in higher gamma bandwidths (>65 Hz), a global reduction of coherence (P <= 0.01) across a broad frequency range (0.5-250 Hz), and a significant increase in ACh concentrations (P=0.01) in the prefrontal cortex. Compared with the unconscious state, recovery of righting reflex was marked by a further increase in ACh concentrations (P=0.0007), global increases in power in theta (4-10 Hz; P=0.03) and low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz; P=0.0001), and increase in power (P <= 0.01) and coherence (P<0.002) in higher gamma frequencies (65-250 Hz). Acetylcholine concentrations, coherence, and spectral properties returned to baseline levels after a prolonged recovery period. Conclusions: Ketamine-induced unconsciousness is characterized by suppression of high-frequency gamma activity and a breakdown of cortical coherence, despite increased cholinergic tone in the cortex.

Kernel-based relevant feature extraction to support motor imagery classification	2015 20TH SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, IMAGES AND COMPUTER VISION (STSIVA)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, IMAGES AND COMPUTER VISION (STSIVA)	SEP 02-04, 2015	Pontifica Univ Javeriana, Bogota, COLOMBIA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Colombia Sect, Colombia Sect Signal Proc Chapter, IEEE, IEEE Colombia, IEEE Signal Proc Soc Colombia	Pontifica Univ Javeriana		COMMUNICATION	Brain Computer Interface (BCI) has become one of the most interesting alternatives to support automatic systems able to interpret brain functions. Recently, the Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm is a widely topic of interest as a tool to develop BCI-based systems. Here, we present a relevant feature extraction methodology, termed MI discrimination using kernel relevance analysis (MIDKRA), to support MI classification in BCI systems. For such a purpose, a similarity criterion to rank the contribution of EEG features for classifying an MI paradigm is employed. The introduced approach includes the supervised information regarding the MI paradigm to find out a relevant set of features encoding discriminative information. We model the EEG recordings by considering both time and time-frequency representations. Moreover, a k nearest-neighbor classifier is carried out to validate the proposed feature relevance approach. Experimental results carried out on two different BCI databases, a well-known public MI data and an Emotiv-based dataset built by us, demonstrate that MIDKRA outperforms state of the art methods and it is a suitable alternative to support straightforward BCI systems.

Recent research indicates that these two groups of antagonism of neurons express different comprehension, while one group is emitting a pulse, the other group will be restrained. On the other hand, when this inhibition mechanism becomes weaker, the other antagonism neurons group will take over the interpretation. Since attention plays key roles controlling cognition, is highly interesting to find the location and frequency band used by brain (with either top-down or bottom-up control) to reach deterministic visual perceptions. In our study, we used a 16-channel EEG system to record brain signals from subjects while conducting bistable illusion testing. An extra channel of the EEG system was used for temporal marking. The moment when subjects reach a perception switch, they click the channel and mark the time. The recorded data were presented in form of brain electrical activity map (BEAM) with different frequency bands for analysis. It was found that the visual cortex in the on the right side between parietal and occipital areas was controlling the switching of perception. In the periods with stable perception, we can constantly observe all the delta, theta, alpha and beta waves. While the period perception is switching, almost all theta, alpha, and beta waves were suppressed by delta waves. This result suggests that delta wave may control the processing of perception switching.

However, a demonstration that static magnetic fields can influence human brain activity and behavior is currently lacking, despite evidence that static magnetic fields interfere with neuronal function in animals. Here we show that transcranial application of a static magnetic field (120-200 mT at 2-3 cm from the magnet surface) over the human occiput produces a focal increase in the power of alpha oscillations in underlying cortex. Critically, this neurophysiological effect of tSMS is paralleled by slowed performance in a visual search task, selectively for the most difficult target detection trials. The typical relationship between prestimulus alpha power over posterior cortical areas and reaction time (RT) to targets during tSMS is altered such that tSMS-dependent increases in alpha power are associated with longer RTs for difficult, but not easy, target detection trials. Our results directly demonstrate that a powerful magnet placed on the scalp modulates normal brain activity and induces behavioral changes in humans.

However, little is known about the generation mechanisms within the thalamocortical system for different types of spindles. In this study, we aim to investigate the electrophysiological behaviors of the topographically distinctive spindles within the thalamocortical system by applying high-density EEG and simultaneous thalamic LFP recordings in mice. Design: 32-channel extracranial EEG and 2-channel thalamic LFP were recorded simultaneously in freely behaving mice to acquire spindles during spontaneous sleep. Subjects: Hybrid F1 male mice of C57BL/6J and 129S4/svJae. Measurements and Results: Spindle events in each channel were detected by spindle detection algorithm, and then a cluster analysis was applied to classify the topographically distinctive spindles. All sleep spindles were successfully classified into 3 groups: anterior, posterior, and global spindles. Each spindle type showed distinct thalamocortical activity patterns regarding the extent of similarity, phase synchrony, and time lags between cortical and thalamic areas during spindle oscillation. We also found that sleep slow waves were likely to associate with all types of sleep spindles, but also that the ongoing cortical decruitment/recruitment dynamics before the onset of spindles and their relationship with spindle generation were also variable, depending on the spindle types. Conclusion: Topographically specific sleep spindles show distinctive thalamocortical network behaviors.

Orexin receptor activation generates gamma band input to cholinergic and serotonergic arousal system neurons and drives an intrinsic ca(2+)-dependent resonance in LDT and PPT cholinergic neurons	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						acetylcholine; arousal; brain slice; hypocretin; oscillations; reticular activating system; serotonin	LATERODORSAL TEGMENTAL NEURONS; DORSAL RAPHE; FREQUENCY PREFERENCES; MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; THALAMIC NEURONS; GAIN MODULATION; CATION CURRENT; DYNAMIC CLAMP; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS	A hallmark of the waking state is a shift in EEG power to higher frequencies with epochs of synchronized intracortical gamma activity (30-60 Hz) - a process associated with high-level cognitive functions. The ascending arousal system, including cholinergic laterodorsal (LDT) and pedunculopontine (PPT) tegmental neurons and serotonergic dorsal raphe (DR) neurons, promotes this state. Recently, this system has been proposed as a gamma wave generator, in part, because some neurons produce high-threshold, Ca2+-dependent oscillations at gamma frequencies. However, it is not known whether arousal-related inputs to these neurons generate such oscillations, or whether such oscillations are ever transmitted to neuronal targets. Since key arousal input arises from hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons, we investigated whether the unusually noisy, depolarizing orexin current could provide significant gamma input to cholinergic and serotonergic neurons, and whether such input could drive Ca2+-dependent oscillations. Whole-cell recordings in brain slices were obtained from mice expressing Cre-induced fluorescence in cholinergic LDT and PPT, and serotonergic DR neurons. After first quantifying reporter expression accuracy in cholinergic and serotonergic neurons, we found that the orexin current produced significant high frequency, including gamma, input to both cholinergic and serotonergic neurons. Then, by using a dynamic clamp, we found that adding a noisy orexin conductance to cholinergic neurons induced a Ca2+-dependent resonance that peaked in the theta and alpha frequency range (4-14 Hz) and extended up to 100 Hz. We propose that this orexin current noise and the Ca2+ dependent resonance work synergistically to boost the encoding of high-frequency synaptic inputs into action potentials and to help ensure cholinergic neurons fire during EEG activation. This activity could reinforce thalamocortical states supporting arousal, REM sleep, and intracortical gamma.

In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of different signal processing techniques for each BCI system stage concerning steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), which includes: (1) feature extraction performed by different spectral methods (bank of filters, Welch's method and the magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform); (2) feature selection by means of an incremental wrapper, a filter using Pearson's method and a cluster measure based on the Davies-Bouldin index, in addition to a scenario with no selection strategy; (3) classification schemes using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and extreme learning machines (ELM). The combination of such methodologies leads to a representative and helpful comparative overview of robustness and efficiency of classical strategies, in addition to the characterization of a relatively new classification approach (defined by ELM) applied to the BCI-SSVEP systems.

"Heat-sensitization'' responses have been reported during suspended moxibustion, whose occurrence is associated with significantly better therapeutic effects. The present study aimed to investigate the cortical activities of this interesting phenomenon by a standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. We performed electroencephalography recording in a group of patients with chronic low back pain before, during, and after moxibustion treatment at Yaoyangguan (DU3) areas. 11 out of 21 subjects experienced strong heat-sensitization during moxibustion, which were accompanied with significant decreases of current densities in the beta frequency bands in prefrontal, primary and second somatosensory, and cingulate cortices, as well as increased current densities in the alpha2 band in the left insula. No changes were detected in patients without sensitization responses, or in the post-moxibustion phase of either group. These data indicated widespread activity changes across different frequency bands during heat-sensitization. Cortical oscillatory activities could be used to evaluate the "heatsensitization'' responses during suspended moxibustion.

Design: A cross-sectional design was adopted to address this issue. Methods: We compared time-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from collegiate female badminton players (n = 12, aged 20.58 +/- 2.75 years) and age-and gender-matched sedentary non-athletic controls (n = 13, aged 19.08 +/- 2.10 years) when they performed a task that involves visuo-spatial attention and working memory. Results: We observed that players responded faster than controls on the task without suffering any increase in error responses. Correspondingly, the players, relative to controls, exhibited higher task-related modulations in beta power in the attention condition as well as in theta and beta power in the working memory condition. Notably, the behavior-EEG correlations revealed that better attention performance is associated with lower beta power, while greater working memory is related to higher theta power. Conclusions: Our results shed light on the mechanisms of athletic superiority in fundamental cognitive functioning: the higher theta synchronization points to a greater engagement of attention, whereas the higher beta desynchronization supports the contribution of processing speed (or motor-related processing) to better performance in athletes. This study extends current understanding by suggesting that enhanced neurocognitive function seen in athletes may transfer to fundamental tasks, giving insight into the generalizability of sport experience to neurocognitive functioning.

Ultra-low-noise EEG/MEG systems enable bimodal non-invasive detection of spike-like human somatosensory evoked responses at 1 kHz	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						low noise MEG; low noise EEG; high frequency somatosensory evoked potential	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; 1000 HZ; EEG; LOCALIZATION; GENERATORS; POTENTIALS; SIGNALS; BURSTS	Non-invasive EEG detection of very high frequency somatosensory evoked potentials featuring frequencies up to and above 1 kHz has been recently reported. Here, we establish the detectability of such components by combined low-noise EEG/MEG. We recorded SEP/SEF simultaneously using median nerve stimulation in five healthy human subjects inside an electromagnetically shielded room, combining a low-noise EEG custom-made amplifier (4.7 nV/root Hz) and a custom-made single-channel low-noise MEG (0.5 fT/root Hz @ 1 kHz). Both, low-noise EEG and MEG revealed three spectrally distinct and temporally overlapping evoked components: N20 (< 100 Hz), sigma-burst (450-750 Hz), and kappa-burst (850-1200 Hz). The two recording modalities showed similar relative scaling of signal amplitude in all three frequencies domains (EEG [10 nV] similar or equal to MEG [1.fT]). Pronounced waveform (peak-by-peak) overlap of EEG and MEG signals is observed in the sigma band, whereas in the kappa band overlap was only partial. A decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; calculated for n = 12.000 averages) from sigma to kappa components characterizes both, electric and magnetic field recordings: Sigma-band SNR was 12.9 +/- 5.5/19.8 +/- 12.6 for EEG/MEG, and kappa-band SNR at 3.77 +/- 0.8/4.5 +/- 2.9. High-frequency performance of a tailor-made MEG matches closely with simultaneously recorded low-noise EEG for the non-invasive detection of somatosensory evoked activity at and above 1 kHz. Thus, future multi-channel dual-mode low-noise technology could offer complementary views for source reconstruction of the neural generators underlying such high-frequency responses, and render neural high-frequency processes related to multi-unit spike discharges accessible in non-invasive recordings.

Here, we compare the EEG topography following the awakening from baseline (BSL) and REC sleep. Methods: We have recorded the EEG waking activity of 26 healthy subjects immediately after the awakening from BSL sleep and from REC sleep following 40 h of prolonged wakefulness. In both BSL and REC conditions, 12 subjects were awakened from stage 2 sleep, and 14 subjects from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The full-scalp waking EEG (eyes closed) was recorded after all awakenings. Results: Subjects awakened from REC sleep showed a reduction of fronto-central alpha and beta-1 activities, while no significant effects of the sleep stage of awakening have been observed. Positive correlations between pre- and post-awakening EEG modifications following REC sleep have been found in the posterior and lateral cortices in the frequency ranges from theta to beta-2 and (only for REM awakenings) extending to the fronto-central regions in the beta-1 band, and in the midline central and parietal derivations for the alpha and delta bands, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the higher SI after REC sleep may be due to the fronto-central decrease of alpha and beta-1 activity and to the persistence of the sleep EEG features after awakening in the posterior, lateral, and fronto-central cortices, without influences of the sleep stage of awakening.

This complements previous research that has largely focused on the identification of abnormalities in circumscribed brain regions and on disturbances of dopaminergic mechanisms as a cause of positive symptoms and executive deficits. In the current review, we provide an update on studies focusing on aberrant neural dynamics. First, we discuss the role of rhythmic activity in neural dynamics and in the coordination of distributed neuronal activity into organized neural states. This is followed by an overview on the current evidence for impaired neural oscillations and synchrony in schizophrenia and associated abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Finally, we discuss the distinction between fundamental symptoms, which are reflected in cognitive deficits, and psychotic, accessory symptoms, the latter likely constituting a compensatory response for aberrant neuronal dynamics.

However, the topographic specificity of these effects, the relationship between resting EEG and SSVEP, as well as the impact of antipsychotic medication on these effects, have not been clearly delineated. The present study sought to address these questions with 256 channel high-density EEG recordings in a group of 13 schizophrenia patients, 13 healthy controls, and 10 non-schizophrenia patients with psychiatric diagnoses currently taking antipsychoticmedication. At rest, the schizophrenia group demonstrated decreased alpha EEG power in frontal and occipital areas relative to healthy controls. With SSVEP stimulation centered in the alpha band (10 Hz), but not with stimulation above (15 Hz) or below(7 Hz) this range, the occipital deficit in alpha power was partially reverted. However, the frontal deficit persisted and contributed to a significantly reduced topographic relationship between occipital and frontal alpha activity for resting EEG and 10 Hz SSVEP alpha power in schizophrenia patients. No significant differences were observed between healthy and medicated controls or between medicated controls and schizophrenia. These findings suggest a potential intrinsic deficit in frontal eyes-closed EEG alpha oscillations in schizophrenia, whereby potent visual stimulation centered in that frequency range results in an increase in the occipital alpha power of these patients, which however does not extend to frontal regions. Future research to evaluate the cortical and subcortical mechanisms of these effects is warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To assess the differential frequency-coded posterior parietal cortex (PPC) role in planning visuo-motor goal-directed tasks, we studied the action specificity of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in this area. Methods: We investigated cortical activity by electroencephalography, while 16 healthy subjects performed self-paced reaching or wrist extension (control) movements. Time-frequency representations were calculated for each movement during the preparatory period. Results: ERD dynamics in upper alpha-band indicated that preparing a goal-directed action activates contralateral PPC to the moving hand around 1.2 s before starting the movement, while this activation is later (around 0.7 s) in preparing a not-goal-directed action. The posterior dominant rhythm had peak frequency of lower alpha-band at bilateral parietal. Conclusions: Posterior parietal cortex encodes goal-directed movement preparation through upper alpha-band activity, whereas general attention is processed via lower alpha-band oscillations. Significance: Preparing to reach an object engages posterior parietal cortex earlier than a not-goal directed movement. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Gamma-band oscillations are highly relevant in this context, due both to their proposed involvement in neuronal synchronization and to their association with neurotransmitter systems relevant for schizophrenia. Several task-related studies have confirmed reduced power and synchronization of gamma-band oscillations in schizophrenia, but it has been suggested that these findings might not apply to the resting state. The present study aimed to investigate resting-state gamma-band connectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Sixtyfour channel resting-state electroencephalography (eyes closed) was recorded in 22 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Orthogonalized power envelope correlation was used as a measure of connectivity across 80 cortical regions at 40 Hz. Mean connectivity at each region was compared across groups using the nonparametric randomization approach. Additionally, the network-based statistic was applied to identify affected networks in patients. Results: Patients displayed increased mean functional gamma-band connectivity compared to controls in the left rolandic operculum. Network-based analyses indicated increased connectivity in patients within a strongly lateralized network consisting mainly of left inferior frontal/orbitofrontal, lateral and medial temporal, and inferior parietal areas. Within this network, gamma-band connectivity was higher in patients with low positive and disorganization symptom levels. Conclusions: The present study provides a link between resting-state gamma-band connectivity and the core symptoms of schizophrenia. The observed findings are different than those reported by task-related studies, suggesting that resting-state studies might reveal new aspects in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Painful cutaneous laser stimuli induce event-related gamma-band activity in the lateral thalamus of humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; thalamus; gamma band oscillations; EEG; human; pain	DIRECTED FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; PHYSIOLOGICAL TREMOR; CEREBELLAR THALAMUS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR AREAS; CORTICAL AREAS; HUMAN BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION	Although the thalamus is an important module in "pain networks," there are few studies of the effect of experimental pain upon thalamic oscillations. We have now examined the hypothesis that, during a series of painful cutaneous laser stimuli, thalamic signals will show stimulus-related gamma-band spectral activity, which is modulated by attention to vs. distraction from the painful stimulus. When the series of laser stimuli was presented, attention was focused by counting the laser stimuli (count laser task), while distraction was produced by counting backward (count back plus laser task). We have studied the effect of a cutaneous laser on thalamic local field potentials and EEG activity during awake procedures (deep brain stimulation implants) for the treatment of essential tremor. At different delays after the stimulus, three low gamma-(30-50 Hz) and two high gamma-band (70-90 Hz) activations were observed during the two tasks. Greater high-gamma activation was found during the count laser task for the earlier window, while greater high-gamma activation was found during the count back plus laser task for the later window. Thalamic signals were coherent with EEG signals in the beta band, which indicated significant synchrony. Thalamic cross-frequency coupling analysis indicated that the phase of the lower frequency activity (theta to beta) modulated the amplitude of the higher frequency activity (low and high gamma) more strongly during the count laser task than during the count back plus laser task. This modulation might result in multiplexed signals each encoding a different aspect of pain.	[Chien, J. H.; Liu, C. C.; Lenz, F.

Individual Types Reactivity of EEG Oscillations in Effective Heart Rhythm Biofeedback Parameters in Adolescents and Young People in the North	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						heart rate variability; biofeedback; electroencephalogram; North	ALPHA; CORTEX	A single session of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback in apparently healthy young people and adolescents aged 14-17 years in order to increase vagal effects on heart rhythm and also electroencephalograms were carried out. Different variants of EEG spectral power during the successful HRVbiofeed-back session were identified. In the case of I variant of EEG activity the increase of power spectrum of alpha-, beta1-, theta-components takes place in all parts of the brain. In the case of II variant of EEG activity the reduction of power spectrum of alpha-, beta1-, theta-activity in all parts of the brain was observed. I and II variants of EEG activity cause more intensive regime of cortical-subcortical interactions. During the III variant of EEG activity the successful biofeedback is accompanied by increase of alpha activity in the central, front and anteriofrontal brain parts and so indicates the formation of thalamocortical relations of neural network in order to optimize the vegetal regulation of heart function. There was an increase in alpha- and betal-activity in the parietal, central, frontal and temporal brain parts during the IV variant of EEG activity and so that it provides the relief of neural networks communication for information processing. As a result of V variance of EEG activity there was the increase of power spectrum of theta activity in the central and frontal parts of both cerebral hemispheres, so it was associated with the cortical-hippocampal interactions to achieve a successful biofeedback.

Coupling can take different forms as it associates the phase, frequency, and/or amplitude of coupled oscillations. These specific forms of coupling are a signature for the underlying network physiology and probably relate to distinct cognitive functions. Here I discuss three caveats in data analysis that can lead to mistake one specific form of CFC for another: (1) bicoherence assesses the level of phase amplitude and not of phase phase coupling (PPC) as commonly accepted; (2) a test for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) can indeed signal phase-frequency coupling (PFC) when the higher frequency signal is extracted using a too narrow band; (3) an oscillation whose frequency fluctuates may induce spurious amplitude anticorrelations between neighboring frequency bands. I indicate practical rules to avoid such misidentifications and correctly identify the specific nature of cross-frequency coupled signals.

Action-related mu suppression was measured in eleven 3-year-old children and their mothers during a 'live, largely unscripted social interaction. High-density EEG was recorded from children and synchronized with motion-captured records of children's and mothers' hand actions, and with video recordings. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to separate brain and non-brain source signals in toddlers' EEG records. EEG source dynamics were compared across three kinds of epochs: toddlers' own actions (execution), mothers' actions (observation), and between-turn intervals (no action). Mu (6-9 Hz) power was suppressed in left and right somatomotor cortex during both action execution and observation, as reflected by independent components of individual children's EEG data. These mu rhythm components were accompanied by beta-harmonic (similar to 16 Hz) suppression, similar to findings from adults. The toddlers' power spectrum and scalp density projections provide converging evidence of adult-like mu-suppression features. Mu-suppression components' source locations were modeled using an age-specific 4-layer forward head model. Putative sources clustered around somatosensory cortex, near the hand/arm region. The results demonstrate that action-locked, event-related EEG dynamics can be measured, and source-resolved, from toddlers during social interactions with relatively unrestricted social behaviors.

In humans, SWs are generated and propagate on a structural backbone of highly interconnected cortical regions that form most of the default mode network, such as the insula, cingulate cortices, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and medial frontal lobe. Regions in this network undergo cortical thinning and breakdown in structural and functional connectivity over the course of normal aging. In this study, we investigated how changes in cortical thickness (CT), a measure of gray matter integrity, are involved in modifications of sleep SWs during adulthood in humans. Thirty young (mean age = 23.49 years; SD = 2.79) and 33 older (mean age = 60.35 years; SD = 5.71) healthy subjects underwent a nocturnal polysomnography and T1 MRI. We show that, when controlling for age, higher SW density (nb/min of nonrapid eye movement sleep) was associated with higher CT in cortical regions involved in SW generation surrounding the lateral fissure (insula, superior temporal, parietal, middle frontal), whereas higher SW amplitude was associated with higher CT in middle frontal, medial prefrontal, and medial posterior regions. Mediation analyses demonstrated that thinning in a network of cortical regions involved in SW generation and propagation, but also in cognitive functions, explained the age-related decrease in SW density and amplitude. Altogether, our results suggest that microstructural degradation of specific cortical regions compromise SW generation and propagation in older subjects, critically contributing to age-related changes in SW oscillations.

Spontaneous EEG theta/beta ratio and delta-beta coupling in relation to attentional network functioning and self-reported attentional control	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Spontaneous EEG; Theta/beta ratio; Delta-beta coupling; Attentional network functioning; Attentional control	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; TRAIT ANXIETY; INFORMATION; SYMPTOMS; EMOTION; INDEPENDENCE; INTERFERENCE; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION	Relationships between electroencephalographic (EEG) slow- and fast-wave frequency bands are considered to be of interest in the study of dispositional affective traits, emotion regulation, and attentional phenomena. However, to date, no previous studies had explored whether both state performance-based and self-reported attentional control (AC) measures potentially relate to different patterns of spontaneous EEG measures, in the absence of emotional stimuli. In the present study, individual differences in spontaneous EEG theta/beta ratio and delta-beta coupling at frontal and parietal sites were explored in a sample of 110 healthy volunteers as potential correlates of individual differences in performance-based attentional network functioning, as measured through the Attentional Network Test for Interactions (ANT-I) and self-reported AC. We found that stronger delta-beta coupling at parietal sites was associated with higher self-reported AC. However, no significant associations were found between executive control network functioning and the EEG ratio or coupling measures. Furthermore, a lower spontaneous fronto-parietal theta/beta ratio was found to be associated with better orienting network functioning. These results are discussed with a focus on the potential utility of spontaneous EEG measures in several cortical regions for capturing trait-like individual differences in temperament-related factors.

Heightened Delta Power during Slow-Wave-Sleep in Patients with Rett Syndrome Associated with Poor Sleep Efficiency	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG; CHILDREN; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; AGE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; TRAJECTORIES; METAANALYSIS; MATURATION	Sleep problems are commonly reported in Rett syndrome (RTT); however the electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers underlying sleep dysfunction are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of quantitative EEG (qEEG) biomarkers in overnight EEGs recorded from girls (2-9 yrs. old) diagnosed with RTT using a non-traditional automated protocol. In this study, EEG spectral analysis identified high delta power cycles representing slow wave sleep (SWS) in 8-9h overnight sleep EEGs from the frontal, central and occipital leads (AP axis), comparing age-matched girls with and without RTT. Automated algorithms quantitated the area under the curve (AUC) within identified SWS cycles for each spectral frequency wave form. Both age-matched RTT and control EEGs showed similar increasing trends for recorded delta wave power in the EEG leads along the antero-posterior (AP). RTT EEGs had significantly fewer numbers of SWS sleep cycles; therefore, the overall time spent in SWS was also significantly lower in RTT. In contrast, the AUC for delta power within each SWS cycle was significantly heightened in RTT and remained heightened over consecutive cycles unlike control EEGs that showed an overnight decrement of delta power in consecutive cycles. Gamma wave power associated with these SWS cycles was similar to controls. However, the negative correlation of gamma power with age (r = -.59; p<0.01) detected in controls (2-5 yrs. vs. 6-9 yrs.) was lost in RTT. Poor % SWS (i.e., time spent in SWS overnight) in RTT was also driven by the younger age-group. Incidence of seizures in RTT was associated with significantly lower number of SWS cycles. Therefore, qEEG biomarkers of SWS in RTT evolved temporally and correlated significantly with clinical severity.

Given the growing popularity of video gaming and the increasing literature on cognitive aspects of video gamers, there is a growing need for novel approaches to assessment of the cognitive processes that occur while persons are immersed in video games. In this study, we assessed various stimulus modalities and gaming events using an off-the-shelf EEG devise. A significant difference was found among different stimulus modalities with increasingly difficult cognitive demands. Specifically, beta and gamma power were significantly increased during high intensity events when compared to low intensity gaming events. Our findings suggest that the Emotiv EEG can be used to differentiate between varying stimulus modalities and accompanying cognitive processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Significant reductions were found for the absolute power spectral density (PSD) in the central region for delta and theta, and in the posterior region for sigma and beta bands, lateralized to the right hemisphere. When comparing VwA versus the V-A in the midline regions, we found significant decrements of absolute PSD for delta, theta and alpha, and increments for the beta and gamma bands. In autistics, VwA versus V-A tended to show lower coherence values in the right hemisphere. An impairment of visual and auditory sensory integration in autistics might explain our results.

This article aims at studying whether or not the characteristics of the brain activity induced by the combined motor imagery (MI) of both hands can be assumed as the superposition of the activity generated during simple hand MIs. After analyzing the sensorimotor rhythms in EEG signals of five healthy subjects, results show that the imagination of both hands movement generates in each brain hemisphere similar activity as the one produced by each simple hand MI in the contralateral side. Furthermore, during simple hand MIs, brain activity over the ipsilateral hemisphere presents similar characteristics as those observed during the rest condition. Thus, it is shown that the proposed scheme is valid and promising for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) control, allowing to easily detect patterns induced by combined MIs.

Methods From 30 patients with PD, Dementia with Lewy Bodies/Dementia associated with PD, or MSA undergoing nocturnal video-polysomnography for presumed dream enactment behavior, we were able to select 2 PD and 2 MSA patients featuring NREM Parasomnia Behviors (NPBs). We identified episodes during which the subjects seemed to enact dreams or presumed dream-like mentation (NPB arousals) versus episodes with physiological movements (no-NPB arousals). A time-frequency analysis (Morlet Wavelet Transform) of the scalp EEG signals around each NPB and no-NPB arousal onset was performed, and the amplitudes of the spectral frequencies were compared between NPB and no-NPB arousals. Results 19 NPBs were identified, 12 of which consisting of 'elementary' NPBs while 7 resembling confusional arousals. With quantitative EEG analysis, we found an amplitude reduction in the 5-6 Hz band 40 seconds before NPBs arousal as compared to no-NPB arousals at F4 and C4 derivations (p< 0.01). Conclusions Many PD and MSA patients feature various NREM sleep-related behaviors, with clinical and electrophysiological differences and similarities with arousal parasomnias in the general population.

Deep belief network (DBN) gaining great successes in images and speech is still a novel method to develop sleep spindle detection system. In this paper, crowdsourcing replacing gold standard was applied to generate three different labeled samples and constructed three classes of datasets with a combination of these samples. An F1-score measure was estimated to compare the performance of DBN to other three classifiers on classifying these samples, with the DBN obtaining an result of 92.78%. Then a comparison of two feature extraction methods based on power spectrum density was made on same dataset using DBN. In addition, the DBN trained in dataset was applied to detect sleep spindle from raw EEG recordings and performed a comparable capacity to expert group consensus.

This study examined large-scale oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) during language-driven mental imagery using dense-array EEG. Three experiments demonstrated relative increases in alpha amplitude: (1) during imagery prompted by words compared to fixation without imagery instruction, (2) during imagery of word content compared to imagery of geometric shapes, and (3) during imagery of emotionally evocative words compared to imagery of less emotionally arousing content. Alpha increases for semantically loaded imagery were observed in parieto-occipital regions, sustained throughout the imagery period. Findings imply that alpha oscillations index active memory and internal cognitive processing, reflecting neural communication in cortical networks representing motor, semantic, and perceptual aspects of the imagined scene.

This review focuses on four areas of recent progress in our understanding of these events. Thus, it has now been conclusively demonstrated that the full expression of slow waves, both of natural sleep and anesthesia, requires an essential contribution by the thalamus. Furthermore, the modulatory role of brainstem transmitters, the function of cortical inhibition and the relative contribution of single neocortical neurons to EEG slow waves have started to be carefully investigated. Together, these new data confirm the view that a full understanding of slow waves can only be achieved by considering the thalamocortical network as a single functional and dynamic unit for the generation of this key EEG rhythm.

These coordinated body movements convey communicative intentions, and modulate how listeners perceive the message in a subtle, but important way. In the present perspective, we put the focus on the role that congruent non-verbal information from beat gestures may play in the neural responses to speech. Whilst delta-theta oscillatory brain responses reflect the time-frequency structure of the speech signal, we argue that beat gestures promote phase resetting at relevant word onsets. This mechanism may facilitate the anticipation of associated acoustic cues relevant for prosodic/syllabic-based segmentation in speech perception. We report recently published data supporting this hypothesis, and discuss the potential of beats (and gestures in general) for further studies investigating continuous AV speech processing through low-frequency oscillations.

Several recent studies have shown that memory retrieval can be facilitated by reactivating memories during their consolidation during sleep. However, it is still unknown whether reactivation during sleep also enhances subsequent retrieval-related neural oscillations. We have recently demonstrated that foreign vocabulary cues presented during sleep improve later recall of the associated translations. Here, we examined the effect of cueing foreign vocabulary during sleep on oscillatory activity during subsequent recognition testing after sleep. We show that those words that were replayed during sleep after learning (cued words) elicited stronger centroparietal theta activity during recognition as compared to noncued words. The reactivation-induced increase in theta oscillations during later recognition testing might reflect a strengthening of individual memory traces and the integration of the newly learned words into the mental lexicon by cueing during sleep.

We emphasize this spectral domain in probing sensor coherence issues raised by these studies using Hilbert phase coherences in the human MEG. In addition, we ask: will temporal-spatial phase coherence in regional brain oscillations obtained from the ultraslow spectral bands of multi-channel magnetoencephalograms (MEG) differentiate resting, "task-free" MEG records of normal control and schizophrenic subjects? The goal of the study is a comparison of the relative persistence of intra-regional phase locking values (PLVs), among 10, region-defined, sensors in examined in the resting multichannel, MEG records as a function of spectral frequency bands and diagnostic category. The following comparison of Hilbert-transform-engendered relative phases of each designated spectral band was made using their pair-wise PLVs. This indicated the proportion of shared cycle time in which the phase relations between the index location and reference leads were maintained. Leave one out, bootstrapping of the PLVs via a support vector machine (SVM), classified clinical status with 97.3% accuracy. It was generally the case that spectral bands <= 1.0 Hz generated the highest values of the PLVs and discriminated best between control and patient populations. We conclude that PLV analysis of the oscillatory patterns of MEG recordings in the ultraslow frequency bands suggest their functional significance in intra-regional signal coherence and provide a higher rate of classification of patients and normal subjects than the other spectral domains examined.

However, many clinical prognostic markers after resuscitation have become less reliable under hypothermia. In this study, we applied and compared two developed quantitative measures - information quantity (IQ) and sub-band IQ (SIQ) - to evaluate the accuracy of EEG markers on predicting cortical recovery under therapeutic hypothermia. A total of 14 rats under 9-min asphyxial-CA, leading to severe brain injury, were randomly divided into two groups: hypothermia (32 degrees C-34 degrees C) and normothermia (36.5-37.5 degrees C) (n= 7 per group). For each rat, EEG and temperature were continuously recorded for the first 15 hrs. EEG was then recorded for serial 30 mins at 24, 48 and 72 hrs. The neurologic deficit score was evaluated daily to assess the neurologic recovery. Early SIQ and IQ were both significantly correlated with the 72-hr NDS, when the rats remained comatose. Both IQ and SIQ were able to discriminate the animals with good and bad functional outcomes starting from 1 hr after resuscitation. There was no significant difference in 72-hr NDS results (hypothermia (median (25th, 75th), 65 (52, 67)) versus normothermia (53.5 (52.25, 66.75))) (p> 0.05) due to the high mortality rate (5/14) with severe brain injury. Contrary to IQ recovery but similarly to NDS scores, the SIQ recovery was not significantly different between the hypothermia (0.66 +/- 0.04) and normothermia (0.64 +/- 0.04) groups (p> 0.05). IQ could identify the presence of high-frequency oscillations during the recovery from severe brain injury. We demonstrated that while SIQ was able to provide additional sub-band EEG information related to the recovery of different brain functions, both early IQ and SIQ markers are able to accurately predict neurologic outcome after CA.

Voxel seed coherent source analysis on transient global amnesia patients	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			MEMORY; STATE	Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a rare neurological disorder with a sudden, temporary episode of memory loss which usually occurs in old age. The episodic loss of memory becomes normal after a stipulated time of approximately 24 hours. The precise pathology is not yet completely understood. Moreover, there is no proper neuroimaging method to assess this condition. In this study, the EEG was measured at two time points one with the occurrence of the episode (acute) and the second time point after the patient returns to the normal memory condition (follow-up). The aim of the study was to look at the pathological network involved during the acute phase and the follow up phase in these patients for the five frequency bands, namely, delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. The method used for the source analyses was a beamforming approach called dynamic imaging of coherent sources in the frequency domain. The seed voxel was the lesion area taken from the anatomical MRI of each patient. The cortical and subcortical network comprised of the caudate and cerebellum in case of the delta band frequency. Two temporal sources in case of the theta band. Temporal, medial frontal, parietal, putamen, and thalamus sources were found in case of the alpha band. Prefrontal, parietal, and thalamus sources were found in case of the beta band. Temporal and thalamus in case of the gamma band frequency. All these sources were involved in the acute phase. Moreover, in the follow-up phase the motor area, in all frequency bands except gamma band, was additionally active followed by parietal and occipital regions in alpha and gamma frequencies. The differences involved in the network of sources between the two phases gives us better understanding of this neurological disorder.

Posterior EEG alpha at rest and during task performance: Comparison of current source density and field potential measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Surface Laplacian; Current source density (CSD); Recording reference; EEG alpha; Event related desynchronization (ERD); Individual differences	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ELECTRICAL DISTANCE; GENERATOR PATTERNS; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; ANTIDEPRESSANT	Resting and task-related EEG alpha are used in studies of cognition and psychopathology. Although Laplacian methods have been applied, apprehensions about loss of global activity dissuade researchers from greater use except as a supplement to reference-dependent measures. The unfortunate result has been continued reliance on reference strategies that differ across labs, and a systemic preference for a montage-dependent average reference over true reference-free measures. We addressed these concerns by comparing resting- and task-related EEG alpha using three EEG transformations: nose- (NR) and average-referenced (AR) EEG, and the corresponding CSD. Amplitude spectra of resting and prestimulus task-related EEG (novelty oddball) and event-related spectral perturbations were scaled to equate each transformation. Alpha measures quantified for 8-12 Hz bands were: 1) net amplitude (eyes-closed minus eyes-open) and 2) overall amplitude (eyes-closed plus eyes-open); 3) task amplitude (prestimulus baseline) and 4) task event-related desynchronization (ER])). Mean topographies unambiguously represented posterior alpha for overall, net and task, as well as poststimulus alpha ERD. Topographies were similar for the three transformations, but differed in dispersion, CSD being sharpest and NR most broadly distributed. Transformations also differed in scale, AR showing less attenuation or spurious secondary maxima at anterior sites, consistent with simulations of distributed posterior generators. Posterior task alpha and alpha ER]) were positively correlated with overall alpha, but not with net alpha. CSD topographies consistently and appropriately represented posterior EEG alpha for all measures. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Compensation mechanisms counteract synaptic loss and prevent the catastrophic amnesia induced by synaptic loss via maintaining the activity levels of neural circuits. In this chapter we investigate the interplay between various synaptic degeneration and compensation mechanisms, and abnormal cortical and thalamocortical oscillations based on two studies involving different implementations of a large-scale neural network model. Study 1 involves a large scale cortical model (C-model) and includes 100,000 neurons exhibiting several cortical firing patterns, 8.5 million synapses, short-term plasticity, axonal delays and receptor kinetics. The structure of the model is inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. Study 2 involves an extended model, a thalamocortical network model which oscillates within the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) as recorded in the wakeful relaxed state with closed eyes. The thalamocortical network model (TC-model) includes different types of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons recurrently connected to thalamic and reticular thalamic regions with the ratios and distances derived from the mammalian thalamocortical system. The results of Study 1 suggest that cortical oscillations respond differently to compensation mechanisms. Local compensation preserves the baseline activity of theta (5-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations whereas delta (1-4 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations are maintained via global compensation. Applying compensation mechanisms independently shows greater effects than combining both compensation mechanisms in one model and applying them in parallel. Consequently, it can be speculated that enhancing local compensation might recover the neural processes and cognitive functions that are associated with theta and alpha oscillations whereas inducing global compensation might contribute to the repair of neural (cognitive) processes which are associated with delta and beta band activity. Study 2 focuses on investigating the impacts of four types of connectivity loss on the model's spectral dynamics, namely degeneration of corticocortical, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and corticoreticular couplings, with an emphasis on the influence of each modelled case on the spectral output of the model. Synaptic compensation has been included in each model to examine the interplay between synaptic deletion and compensation mechanisms, and the oscillatory activity of the network. The results of power spectra and event related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/S) analyses show that the dynamics of the thalamic and cortical oscillations are significantly influenced by corticocortical synaptic loss. Interestingly, the patterns of changes in thalamic spectral activity are correlated with those in the cortical model. Similarly, the thalamic oscillatory activity is diminished after partial corticothalamic denervation. Given the results, it can be speculated that thalamic atrophy is a secondary pathology to cortical shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, this study finds that the inhibition from neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) to thalamic relay (TCR) neurons plays a key role in regulating thalamic oscillations; disinhibition disrupts thalamic oscillatory activity even though TCR neurons are more depolarized after being released from RTN inhibition. Both study 1 and study 2 indicate that compensation mechanisms may vary across cortical regions and the activation of inappropriate compensation mechanism in a particular region may fail to recover network dynamics and/or induce secondary pathological changes in the network. Both studies provide a better understanding on the neural causes of abnormal oscillatory activity in neurodegeneration.

Increase in short-term memory capacity induced by down-regulating individual theta frequency via transcranial alternating current stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						short-term memory; working memory; theta-gamma coupling; tACS; phase-amplitude coupling	WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS STORAGE; EEG DYNAMICS; GAMMA; RETRIEVAL; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; BUFFER	Working memory (WM) and short-term memory (STM) supposedly rely on the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of neural oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency ranges. The ratio between the individually dominant gamma and theta frequencies is believed to determine an individual's memory capacity. The aim of this study was to establish a causal relationship between the gamma/theta ratio and VVM/STM capacity by means of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). To achieve this, tACS was delivered at a frequency below the individual theta frequency. Thereby the individual ratio of gamma to theta frequencies was changed, resulting in an increase of STM capacity. Healthy human participants (N = 33) were allocated to two groups, one receiving verum tACS, the other underwent a sham control protocol. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured before stimulation and analyzed with regard to the properties of PAC between theta and gamma frequencies to determine individual stimulation frequencies. After stimulation, EEG was recorded again in order to find after-effects of tACS in the oscillatory features of the EEG. Measures of STM and WM were obtained before, during and after stimulation. Frequency spectra and behavioral data were compared between groups and different measurement phases. The tACS- but not the sham stimulated group showed an increase in STM capacity during stimulation. WM was not affected in either groups. An increase in task-related theta amplitude after stimulation was observed only for the tACS group. These augmented theta amplitudes indicated that the manipulation of individual theta frequencies was successful and caused the increase in STM capacity.

Sensitivity of frontal beta oscillations to reward valence but not probability	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Beta oscillations; Reward prediction error; Reinforcement learning	FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE; SIGNALS	Reward feedback elicits a brief increase in power in the high-beta frequency range of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) over frontal areas of the scalp, but the functional role of this oscillatory activity remains unclear. An observed sensitivity to reward expectation (HajiHosseini, Rodriguez-Fomells, and Marco-Pallares, 2012; [2]) suggests that reward-related beta may index a reward prediction error (RPE) signal for reinforcement learning. To investigate this possibility we reanalyzed EEG data from two prior experiments that revealed RPEs in the human event-related brain potential (Holroyd and Krigolson, 2007 [12]; Holroydet al., 2008 [13]). We found that feedback stimuli that indicated reward, when compared to feedback stimuli that indicated no-reward, elicited relatively more beta power (20-30 Hz) over a frontal area of the scalp. However, beta power was not sensitive to feedback probability. These results indicate that reward-related beta does not index an RPE but rather relates to a different reward processing function.

Extracting such sources from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, however, proves to be difficult for most applications as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in EEG typically is low. In an offline study with EEG data from three healthy subjects, we investigated the use of a recently introduced data-driven spatial filtering method called Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) [1]. Based on the trial-to-trial performance metric of a hand motor task, SPoC derives individually optimized linear spatial filters. They are optimized such that the resulting oscillatory signal component comodulates in band power with the performance metric at an increased SNR. Based on short intervals [-800, 0] ms prior to the go cue of approximate to 200 trials, we were able to identify individual oscillatory components. Their alpha band power comodulates with the reaction time (RT) during an isometric force control task of the hand. Using these components, it is possible to reach an average correlation of 0.19, with the best feature explaining up to 17% of the RT variation between single trials.

Evidence from task-related neuroimaging has shown that extraversion is associated with activations in regions of the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and the amygdala. Currently, resting-state neuroimaging is being widely used in cognitive neuroscience. Initial exploration of extraversion has revealed correlations with the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and the precuneus. Recent research work has indicated that the long-range temporal dependence of the resting-state spontaneous oscillation has high test-retest reliability. Moreover, the long-range temporal dependence of the resting-state networks is highly correlated with personality traits, and this can be used for the prediction of extraversion. As the long-range temporal dependence reflects real-time information updating in individuals, this method may provide a new approach to research on personality traits.

Slow waves, the electroencephalographic characteristic of deep sleep, reflected on the neuronal level by synchronous slow oscillations, seem crucial for these benefits. Traveling to moderate altitudes decreases deep sleep. In a randomized cross-over design healthy male subjects performed a visuo-motor learning task in Zurich (490 m) and at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m) in random order. Memory performance was assessed immediately after learning, before sleep, and in the morning after a night of sleep. Sleep EEG recordings were performed during the nights. Our findings show an altitude induced reduction of sleep dependent memory performance. Moreover, this impaired sleep dependent memory performance was associated with reduced slow wave derived measures of neuronal synchronization. Our results are consistent with a critical role of slow waves for the beneficial effects of sleep on memory that is susceptible to natural environmental influences. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Redistribution of neural phase coherence reflects establishment of feedforward map in speech motor adaptation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						speech motor learning; neural oscillations; feedforward map	SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG DATA; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; FREQUENCY; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION; MEMORY	Despite recent progress in our understanding of sensorimotor integration in speech learning, a comprehensive framework to investigate its neural basis is lacking at behaviorally relevant timescales. Structural and functional imaging studies in humans have helped us identify brain networks that support speech but fail to capture the precise spatiotemporal coordination within the networks that takes place during speech learning. Here we use neuronal oscillations to investigate interactions within speech motor networks in a paradigm of speech motor adaptation under altered feedback with continuous recording of EEG in which subjects adapted to the real-time auditory perturbation of a target vowel sound. As subjects adapted to the task, concurrent changes were observed in the theta-gamma phase coherence during speech planning at several distinct scalp regions that is consistent with the establishment of a feedforward map. In particular, there was an increase in coherence over the central region and a decrease over the fronto-temporal regions, revealing a redistribution of coherence over an interacting network of brain regions that could be a general feature of error-based motor learning in general. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of speech motor learning and could elucidate how transient breakdown of neuronal communication within speech networks relates to speech disorders.

Vigabatrin therapy implicates neocortical high frequency oscillations in an animal model of infantile spasms	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; West syndrome; HFOs; Hypsarrhythmia; Anticonvulsant	GAMMA-VINYL-GABA; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; EEG; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; HZ; EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; BRAIN; NETWORK	Abnormal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in EEG recordings are thought to be reflections of mechanisms responsible for focal seizure generation in the temporal lobe and neocortex. HFOs have also been recorded in patients and animal models of infantile spasms. If HFOs are important contributors to infantile spasms then anticonvulsant drugs that suppress these seizures should decrease the occurrence of HFOs. In experiments reported here, we used long-term video/EEG recordings with digital sampling rates capable of capturing HFOs. We tested the effectiveness of vigabatrin (VGB) in the TTX animal model of infantile spasms. VGB was found to be quite effective in suppressing spasms. In 3 of 5 animals, spasms ceased after a daily two week treatment. In the other 2 rats, spasm frequency dramatically decreased but gradually increased following treatment cessation. In all animals, hypsarrhythmia was abolished by the last treatment day. As VGB suppressed the frequency of spasms, there was a decrease in the intensity of the behavioral spasms and the duration of the ictal EEG event. Analysis showed that there was a burst of high frequency activity at ictal onset, followed by a later burst of HFOs. VGB was found to selectively suppress the late HFOs of ictal complexes. VGB also suppressed abnormal HFOs recorded during the interictal periods. Thus VGB was found to be effective in suppressing both the generation of spasms and hypsarrhythmia in the TTX model. Vigabatrin also appears to preferentially suppress the generation of abnormal HFOs, thus implicating neocortical HFOs in the infantile spasms disease state. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) have been linked to each pattern, with ripples predominating during LVF seizures and fast ripples predominating during HYP seizures in the rat pilocarpine model. This evidence led us to hypothesize that these two seizureonset patterns reflect the contribution of neural networks with distinct transmitter signaling characteristics. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing the seizure activity induced with the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 4-5 mg/kg ip), which enhances both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, or the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (3-5 mg/kg ip); rats were implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and the subiculum. We found that LVF onset occurred in 82% of 4AP-induced seizures whereas seizures after picrotoxin were always HYP. In addition, high-frequency oscillation analysis revealed that 4AP-induced LVF seizures were associated with higher ripple rates compared with fast ripples (P < 0.05), whereas picrotoxin-induced seizures contained higher rates of fast ripples compared with ripples (P < 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that two distinct patterns of seizure onset result from different pathophysiological mechanisms.

Because neuronal oscillations may reflect rhythmic modulations of neuronal excitability, phase-coupled oscillatory networks could be the functional building block for routing information through the brain. Current techniques are not suited for directly characterizing such networks. To be able to extract phase-coupled oscillatory networks we developed a new method, which characterizes networks by phase coupling between sites. Importantly, this method respects the fact that neuronal oscillations have energy in a range of frequencies. As a consequence, we characterize these networks by between-site phase relations that vary as a function of frequency, such as those that result from between-site temporal delays. Using human electrocorticographic recordings we show that our method can uncover phase-coupled oscillatory networks that show interesting patterns in their between-site phase relations, such as travelling waves. We validate our method by demonstrating it can accurately recover simulated networks from a realistic noisy environment. By extracting phase-coupled oscillatory networks and investigating patterns in their between-site phase relations we can further elucidate the role of oscillations in neuronal communication.

These BCI systems and motor rehabilitation in general involve several motor tasks for training. This study investigates the neurophysiological bases of an EEG-oscillation-driven BCI combined with a neuroprosthetic device to define the specific oscillatory signature of the BCI task. Controlling movements of a hand robotic orthosis with motor imagery of the same movement generates sensorimotor rhythm oscillation changes and involves three elements of tasks also used in stroke motor rehabilitation: passive and active movement, motor imagery, and motor intention. We recorded EEG while nine healthy participants performed five different motor tasks consisting of closing and opening of the hand as follows: 1) motor imagery without any external feedback and without overt hand movement, 2) motor imagery that moves the orthosis proportional to the produced brain oscillation change with online proprioceptive and visual feedback of the hand moving through a neuroprosthetic device (BCI condition), 3) passive and 4) active movement of the hand with feedback (seeing and feeling the hand moving), and 5) rest. During the BCI condition, participants received contingent online feedback of the decrease of power of the sensorimotor rhythm, which induced orthosis movement and therefore proprioceptive and visual information from the moving hand. We analyzed brain activity during the five conditions using time-frequency domain bootstrap-based statistical comparisons and Morlet transforms. Activity during rest was used as a reference. Significant contralateral and ipsilateral event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm was present during all motor tasks, largest in contralateral-postcentral, medio-central, and ipsilateral-precentral areas identifying the ipsilateral precentral cortex as an integral part of motor regulation. Changes in task-specific frequency power compared with rest were similar between motor tasks, and only significant differences in the time course and some narrow specific frequency bands were observed between motor tasks. We identified EEG features representing active and passive proprioception (with and without muscle contraction) and active intention and passive involvement (with and without voluntary effort) differentiating brain oscillations during motor tasks that could substantially support the design of novel motor BCI-based rehabilitation therapies. The BCI task induced significantly different brain activity compared with the other motor tasks, indicating neural processes unique to the use of body actuators control in a BCI context.

However, relations between their dynamical properties and behavior have not been well studied. Here, we used ECoG grids to cover large areas of motor cortex and some somatosensory cortex in monkeys while they performed an unconstrained reaching and a lever pulling task in three dimensional space with or without go cue. We used percentage of phase locking (PPL) as a dynamical property of beta oscillations aligned to behaviorally relevant events, reaching onsets (RO), lever onset (LO), and holding onset (HO) as well as multiple peaks of electromyography (EMG) recorded from various upper limb muscles. We showed that relative strength of PPL alinged to RO and LO were reserved with or without the external go cues. Furthermore, among the muscles that we recorded EMGs from, beta oscillations were not closely phase locked to any of EMG onsets. Therefore, phase locking of beta oscillations is related more to the attentive state and external cues as opposed to detailed muscle activities.

Furthermore, clinical studies suggest that a subset of EEG biomarkers is associated with symptoms. This review addresses the relationship between EEG and behavior in preclinical models of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor hypofunction, as well as how these models can be used to screen therapies. Data from schizophrenia patients are juxtaposed with data from animal models, and EEG and behavioral data from mice with disruption of NMDA receptors in excitatory and/or inhibitory neurons are then compared to the pattern observed in schizophrenia. Also discussed are results following exposure to potential therapeutic agents, including GABA(B) agonists. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates that elevated resting gamma power is associated with deficits in social interactions. Consistent with elevated baseline noise, excitatory neurons from transgenic mice show increased intrinsic excitability in in vitro-slice patch-clamp studies across model systems. GABAB receptor agonists reduce this excitability, improve gamma-band responses, and reverse behavioral deficits in mice. Data suggest that baseline gamma power is associated with social function and GABAB agonists may be useful for schizophrenia. Translational EEG biomarkers reflect target engagement and can contribute to the design of more efficient drug trials, likely accelerating the development of new therapeutics for central nervous system disorders.

The principle advantage of tvPDC lies in the combination of directionality, time variance and frequency selectivity simultaneously, offering a more differentiated view into complex brain networks. Yet the advantages specific to tvPDC also cause a large number of results, leading to serious problems in interpretability. To counter this issue, we propose the decomposition of multi-dimensional tvPDC results into a sum of rank-1 outer products. This leads to a data condensation which enables an advanced interpretation of results. Furthermore it is thereby possible to uncover inherent interaction patterns of induced neuronal subsystems by limiting the decomposition to several relevant channels, while retaining the global influence determined by the preceding multivariate AR estimation and tvPDC calculation of the entire scalp. Finally a comparison between several subjects is considerably easier, as individual tvPDC results are summarized within a comprehensive model equipped with subject-specific loading coefficients. A proof-of-principle of the approach is provided by means of simulated data; EEG data of an experiment concerning visual evoked potentials are used to demonstrate the applicability to real data.

The power of high frequency (>30 Hz) oscillations in LFPs is locked to the phase of low frequency (<30 Hz) oscillations, an effect known as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). While PAC has been observed in a variety of cortical regions and animal models, its functional role particularly in primate visual cortex is largely unknown. Here, we document PAC for LFPs recorded from extra striate area MT of macaque monkeys, an area specialized for the processing of visual motion. We further show that directing spatial attention into the receptive field of MT neurons decreases the coupling between the low frequency phase and high frequency power of LFPs. This attentional suppression of PAC increases neuronal discriminability for attended visual stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that visual cortex uses PAC to regulate inter-neuronal correlations and thereby enhances the coding of relevant stimuli.

Synchronizing theta oscillations with direct-current stimulation strengthens adaptive control in the human brain	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; neural synchrony; adaptive control; schizophrenia; transcranial direct current stimulation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERROR-CORRECTING BEHAVIOR; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURONAL INTERACTIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Executive control and flexible adjustment of behavior following errors are essential to adaptive functioning. Loss of adaptive control may be a biomarker of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly in the schizophrenia spectrum. Here, we provide support for the view that oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex underlies adaptive adjustments in cognitive processing following errors. Compared with healthy subjects, patients with schizophrenia exhibited low frequency oscillations with abnormal temporal structure and an absence of synchrony over medial-frontal and lateral-prefrontal cortex following errors. To demonstrate that these abnormal oscillations were the origin of the impaired adaptive control in patients with schizophrenia, we applied noninvasive dc electrical stimulation over the medial-frontal cortex. This noninvasive stimulation descrambled the phase of the low-frequency neural oscillations that synchronize activity across cortical regions. Following stimulation, the behavioral index of adaptive control was improved such that patients were indistinguishable from healthy control subjects. These results provide unique causal evidence for theories of executive control and cortical dysconnectivity in schizophrenia.	[Reinhart, Robert M.

Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) predicted successful memory formation, with the involvement of gamma oscillations suggesting memory-relevant local processing in the ATN. The importance of the theta frequency range in memory processing is well-established, and phase alignment of oscillations is considered to be necessary for synaptic plasticity. We hypothesized that theta phase alignment in the ATN would be necessary for memory encoding. Further analysis of the electrophysiological data reveal that phase alignment in the theta rhythm was greater during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding, and that this alignment was correlated with the CFC. These findings support an active processing role for the ATN during memory formation.

This study investigated whether COMT genotype influences resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the frontal, parietal and midline regions in healthy volunteers. EEG recordings were conducted in the resting-state in 13 postmenopausal healthy woman carriers of the Val/Val genotype and 11 with the Met/Met genotype. The resting EEG spectral absolute power in the frontal (F3, F4, F7, F8, F03 and FC4), parietal (CP3, CP4, P3 and P4) and midline (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz and Oz) was analyzed during the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The frequency bands considered were the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2. EEG data of the Val/Val and Met/Met genotypes, brain regions and conditions were analyzed using a general linear model analysis. In the individuals with the Met/Met genotype, delta activity was increased in the eyes closed condition, theta activity was increased in the eyes closed and in the eyes open conditions, and alpha1 band, alpha2 band and beta1 band activity was increased in the eyes-closed condition. A significant interaction between COMT genotypes and spectral bands was observed. Met homozygote individuals exhibited more delta, theta and beta1 activity than individuals with the Val/Val genotype. No significant interaction between COMT genotypes and the resting-state EEG regional power and conditions were observed for the three brain regions studied. Our findings indicate that the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism does not directly impact resting-state EEG regional power, but instead suggest that COMT genotype can modulate resting state EEG spectral power in postmenopausal healthy women.

The situation worsens in the affected patient when the epilepsy becomes intractable, that simply means failure of anti-epileptic drugs (AED) to achieve seizure freedom. It is also associated with an increased prevalence of mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The present review is focused on the recent advances being utilized world over for the effective management of epilepsy patients. The review article discusses the efficacy and importance of recent AED drugs in use for management of epilepsy on one hand and on other hand highlights the use of modern advancements like High frequency oscillations, Network analysis, Seizure localization, Epilepsy surgery in curing intractable epilepsy.

Event-related potentials to tones show differences between children with multiple risk factors for dyslexia and control children before the onset of formal reading instruction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing; Children; Dyslexia; EEG; Event-related potentials; Mismatch negativity; N250; Preschool	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY-SYSTEM ACTIVITY; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; LITERACY SKILLS; FAMILIAL RISK; MATURATION; SOUND; FREQUENCY; DISCRIMINATION	Multiple risk factors can affect the development of specific reading problems or dyslexia. In addition to the most prevalent and studied risk factor, phonological processing, auditory discrimination problems have also been found in children and adults with reading difficulties. The present study examined 37 children between the ages of 5 and 6, 11 of which had multiple risk factors for developing reading problems. The children participated in a passive oddball EEG experiment with sinusoidal sounds with changes in sound frequency, duration, or intensity. The responses to the standard stimuli showed a negative voltage shift in children at risk for reading problems compared to control children at 107-215 ms in frontocentral areas corresponding to P1 offset and N250 onset. Source analyses showed that the difference originated from the left and right auditory cortices. Additionally, the children at risk for reading problems had a larger late discriminative negativity (LDN) response in amplitude for sound frequency change than the control children. The amplitudes at the P1-N250 time window showed correlations to letter knowledge and phonological identification whereas the amplitudes at the LDN time window correlated with verbal short-term memory and rapid naming. These results support the view that problems in basic auditory processing abilities precede the onset of reading instruction and can act as one of the risk factors for dyslexia.

Oscillatory phase shapes syllable perception	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; phase; audiovisual; speech; temporal processing	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH; RECALIBRATION; MECHANISM; RESPONSES; SOUNDS	The role of oscillatory phase for perceptual and cognitive processes is being increasingly acknowledged. To date, little is known about the direct role of phase in categorical perception. Here we show in two separate experiments that the identification of ambiguous syllables that can either be perceived as / da/ or / ga/ is biased by the underlying oscillatory phase as measured with EEG and sensory entrainment to rhythmic stimuli. The measured phase difference in which perception is biased toward / da/ or / ga/ exactly matched the different temporal onset delays in natural audiovisual speech between mouth movements and speech sounds, which last 80 ms longer for / ga/ than for / da/. These results indicate the functional relationship between prestimulus phase and syllable identification, and signify that the origin of this phase relationship could lie in exposure and subsequent learning of unique audiovisual temporal onset differences.

Evidence is conflicting relating SWA to memory consolidation during nap however. Objective/hypothesis: We applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) - which, with a cross-hemispheric electrode montage (F3 and F4 - International 10:20 EEG system), is able to disrupt brain oscillations-to determine if disruption of low frequency oscillation generation during afternoon nap is causally related to disruption in declarative memory consolidation. Methods: Eight human subjects each participated in stimulation and sham nap sessions. A verbal paired associate learning (PAL) task measured memory changes. During each nap period, five 5-min stimulation (0.75 Hz cross-hemispheric frontal tACS) or sham intervals were applied with 1-min post-stimulation intervals (PSI's). Spectral EEG power for Slow (0.7-0.8 Hz), Delta (1.0-4.0 Hz), Theta (4.0-8.0 Hz), Alpha (8.0-12.0 Hz), and Spindle-range (12.0-14.0) frequencies was analyzed during the 1-min preceding the onset of stimulation and the 1-min PSI's. Results: As hypothesized, power reduction due to stimulation positively correlated with reduction in word-pair recall post-nap specifically for Slow (P < 0.0022) and Delta (P < 0.037) frequency bands. Conclusions: These results provide preliminary evidence suggesting a causal and specific role of SWA in declarative memory consolidation during nap. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we intend to analyze the changes in alpha absolute power under two experimental conditions, bromazepam and placebo. We also included analyses of theta and beta frequencies. We collected electroencephalographic data before, during, and after motor task execution. We used a Two Way ANOVA to investigate the condition (PL x Br6 mg) and moment (pre and post) variables for the following electrodes: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, C3, CZ and C4. We found a main effect for condition on the electrodes FP1, F7, F3, Fz, F4, C3 and CZ, for alpha and beta bands. For beta band we also found a main effect for condition on the electrodes Fp2, F8 and C4; for theta band we identified a main effect for condition on C3, Cz and C4 electrodes. This finding suggests that the motor task did not have any influence on the electrocortical activity in alpha, and that the existing modifications were a consequence due merely to the drug use. Despite its anxiolytic and sedative action, bromazepam did not show any significant changes when the individuals executed a finger extension motor task.

J	Baltus, A; Herrmann, CS				Baltus, Alina; Herrmann, Christoph Siegfried			Auditory temporal resolution is linked to resonance frequency of the auditory cortex	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Auditory steady state; Resonance; Gamma oscillations; Gap detection; Auditory temporal resolution	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; CHANNEL GAP DETECTION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; BACKGROUND-NOISE; WITHIN-CHANNEL; HUMAN EEG; SPEECH; PERCEPTION; STIMULUS	A brief silent gap embedded in an otherwise continuous sound is missed by a human listener when it falls below a certain threshold: the gap detection threshold. This can be interpreted as an indicator that auditory perception is a non-continuous process, during which acoustic input is fragmented into a discrete chain of events. Current research provides evidence for a covariation between rhythmic properties of speech and ongoing rhythmic activity in the brain. Therefore, the discretization of acoustic input is thought to facilitate speech processing. Ongoing oscillations in the auditory cortex are suggested to represent a neuronal mechanism which implements the discretization process and leads to a limited auditory temporal resolution. Since gap detection thresholds seem to vary considerably between individuals, the present study addresses the question of whether individual differences in the frequency of underlying ongoing oscillatory mechanisms can be associated with auditory temporal resolution. To address this question we determined an individual gap detection threshold and a preferred oscillatory frequency for each participant. The preferred frequency of the auditory cortex was identified using an auditory steady state response (ASSR) paradigm: amplitude-modulated sounds with modulation frequencies in the gamma range were presented binaurally; the frequency which elicited the largest spectral amplitude was considered the preferred oscillatory frequency. Our results show that individuals with higher preferred auditory frequencies perform significantly better in the gap detection task. Moreover, this correlation between oscillation frequency and gap detection was supported by high test retest reliabilities for gap detection thresholds as well as preferred frequencies.

Progesterone-associated increase in ERP amplitude correlates with an improvement in performance in a spatial attention paradigm	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Attention; Menstrual cycle; Progesterone; Event-related potential; Alpha oscillation	MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; EEG; PREFERENCES; MASCULINITY; ESTROGEN; ACCESS; SYSTEM; MEMORY	Ovarian sex hormones modulate neuronal circuits not directly involved in reproductive functions. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenous fluctuations of estradiol and progesterone during the menstrual cycle are associated with early cortical processing stages in a cued spatial attention paradigm. EEG was monitored while young women responded to acoustically cued visual stimuli. Women with large mean amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP) (80-120 ms following visual stimuli) responded faster to visual stimuli. In luteal women, mean amplitude of the ERP as well as alpha amplitude, an indicator of attentional modulation, correlated positively with progesterone. Further, cerebral asymmetry in ERP amplitude in the alpha frequency band following target presentation was restricted to luteal women. Critically, early follicular women responded slower to right hemifield compared to left hemifield targets. In late follicular or luteal women, we did not detect a right hemifield disadvantage. Progesterone correlated negatively with RTs in luteal women. Therefore, whereas our behavioral data indicate a functional cerebral asymmetry in early follicular women, EEG recording reveal a physiological cerebral hemisphere asymmetry in the alpha frequency band in luteal women. We assume that a progesterone-associated enhancement in synchronization of synaptic activity in the alpha frequency band in luteal women improves early categorization of visual targets in a cued spatial attention paradigm.

Localization of electrophysiological responses to semantic and syntactic anomalies in language comprehension with MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; SAM beamforming; ERF; N400m; Semantic; Syntax; Sentence comprehension	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG-ALPHA; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POWER INCREASES; SPEECH; SYNCHRONIZATION; FREQUENCY	Syntactically and semantically anomalous words encountered during sentence comprehension are known to elicit dissociable electrophysiological responses, which are thought to reflect distinct aspects of language processing. However, the sources of these responses have not been well characterized. We used beamforming analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to map generators of electrophysiological responses to linguistic anomalies. Anomalous words occurred in the context of a sentence acceptability judgement task conducted in both visual and auditory modalities. Time-frequency analysis revealed that both kinds of violations elicited event-related synchronization (ERS) in the delta-theta frequency range (1-5 Hz), and desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-beta range (8-30 Hz). In addition, these responses were differentially modulated by violation type and presentation modality. 1-5 Hz responses were consistently localized within medial prefrontal cortex and did not vary significantly across violation types, but were stronger for visual presentation. In contrast, 8-30 Hz ERD occurred in different regions for different violation types. For semantic violations the distribution was predominantly in the bilateral occipital cortex and left temporal and inferior frontal regions, and these effects did not differ for visual and auditory presentation. In contrast, syntactic responses were strongly affected by presentation modality. Under visual presentation, syntactic violations elicited bilateral 8-30 Hz ERD extending into dorsal parietal and frontal regions, whereas effects were much weaker and mostly statistically insignificant in the auditory modality. These results suggest that delta-theta ERS reflects generalized increases in working memory demands related to linguistic anomaly detection, while alpha-beta ERD reflects specific activation of cortical regions involved in distinct aspects of linguistic processing, such as semantic vs. phonological short-term memory. Beamforming analysis of time-domain average signals (ERFs) revealed an N400m effect for semantic anomalies in both modalities, localized to left superior temporal and posterior frontal regions, and a later P600-like effect for syntactic anomalies in both modalities, widespread over bilateral frontal, posterior temporal, and parietal regions. These results indicate that time-domain averaged responses and induced oscillatory responses have distinct properties, including localization and modality dependence, and likely reflect dissociable and complementary aspects of neural activity related to language comprehension and additional task-related processes.

Primary somatosensory contextual modulation is encoded by oscillation frequency change	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Primary somatosensory cortex; Median nerve; 600 Hz wavelets; Auditory oddball	EVOKED POTENTIALS; MEDIAN-NERVE; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; LATENCY ACTIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AROUSAL CHANGES; HZ COMPONENTS; TOP-DOWN; STIMULATION	Objective: This study characterized thalamo-cortical communication by assessing the effect of context-dependent modulation on the very early somatosensory evoked high-frequency oscillations (HF oscillations). Methods: We applied electrical stimuli to the median nerve together with an auditory oddball paradigm, presenting standard and deviant target tones representing differential cognitive contexts to the constantly repeated electrical stimulation. Median nerve stimulation without auditory stimulation served as unimodal control. Results: A model consisting of one subcortical (near thalamus) and two cortical (Brodmann areas 1 and 3b) dipolar sources explained the measured HF oscillations. Both at subcortical and the cortical levels HF oscillations were significantly smaller during bimodal (somatosensory plus auditory) than unimodal (somatosensory only) stimulation. A delay differential equation model was developed to investigate interactions within the 3-node thalamo-cortical network. Importantly, a significant change in the eigenfrequency of Brodmann area 3b was related to the context-dependent modulation, while there was no change in the network coupling. Conclusion: This model strongly suggests cortico-thalamic feedback from both cortical Brodmann areas 1 and 3b to the thalamus. With the 3-node network model, thalamo-cortical feedback could be described. Significance: Frequency encoding plays an important role in contextual modulation in the somatosensory thalamo-cortical network. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Do task demands modulate how information is retrieved, or only how it is used? We used EEG/MEG recordings to assess whether, when, and how task contexts modify early retrieval of specific psycholinguistic information in occipito-temporal cortex, an area likely to contribute to early stages of visual word processing. Using a parametric approach, we analyzed the spatiotemporal response patterns of occipitotemporal cortex for orthographic, lexical, and semantic variables in three psycholinguistic tasks: silent reading, lexical decision, and semantic decision. Task modulation of word frequency and imageability effects occurred simultaneously in ventral occipito-temporal regions-in the vicinity of the putative visual word form area-around 160 msec, following task effects on orthographic typicality around 100 msec. Frequency and typicality also produced task-independent effects in anterior temporal lobe regions after 200 msec. The early task modulation for several specific psycholinguistic variables indicates that occipitotemporal areas integrate perceptual input with prior knowledge in a task-dependent manner. Still, later task-independent effects in anterior temporal lobes suggest that word recognition eventually leads to retrieval of semantic information irrespective of task demands. We conclude that even a highly overlearned visual task like word recognition should be described as flexible rather than automatic.

A neutral/positive/negative face recognition task was administered the evening before (learning and immediate recognition) and the morning after (delayed recognition) sleep. The number of rapid eye movements (REMs), beta and theta EEG activity over the visual areas were measured during REM sleep. Compared to neurotypical children, children with ASD showed more theta activity and longer reaction time (RT) for correct responses in delayed recognition of neutral faces. Both groups showed a positive correlation between sleep and performance but different patterns emerged: in neurotypical children, accuracy for recalling neutral faces and overall RT improvement overnight was correlated with EEG activity and REMs; in children with ASD, overnight RT improvement for positive and negative faces correlated with theta and beta activity, respectively. These results suggest that neurotypical and children with ASD use different sleep-related brain networks to process faces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there are still open questions regarding whether brain activity for swallowing control is altered while performing this chin-tuck maneuver. Methods: In this study, we collected EEG signals from 55 healthy adults while swallowing in the neutral and chin-tuck head positions. The time-frequency based synchrony measure was used to form brain networks. We investigated both the small-world properties of these brain networks and differences among the constructed brain networks for the two head positions during swallowing tasks. Results: We showed that brain networks for swallowing in both head positions exhibit small-world properties. Furthermore, we showed that swallowing in the chin-tuck head position affects brain networks in the Alpha and Gamma frequency bands. Conclusions: According to these results, we can tell that the parameter of head position should be considered in future investigations which utilize EEG signals during swallowing activity.

Intermediate latency evoked potentials of cortical multimodal vestibular areas: Acoustic stimulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Acoustic stimulation; Brain Evoked Source Analysis BESA; EEG; Vestibular cortex; Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials; VEMP	CORTEX; VEMPS	Objective: Loud acoustic stimuli at 500 Hz activate the vestibular system. Intermediate-latency vestibular cortical potentials of multimodal cortex regions were investigated, beyond the 20 ms time range. Methods: Eighteen healthy subjects with 32-channel EEG and one epilepsy patient with right-sided intracortical electrodes received three types of stimuli: tone bursts capable of evoking vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) in neck muscles and sham stimuli matched for either frequency or amplitude, which cannot evoke myogenic responses. Results: VEMP-capable stimuli activated anterior insula and posterior operculum bilaterally at 20, 30, 60 and 110 ms, frontal brain regions at 70 and 110 ms, determined by Brain Evoked Source Analysis BESA. Recordings from intracranial electrodes revealed corresponding peaks at identical latencies. Stimulus-locked high and low beta and mu band modulations were found in vestibular, parietal and occipital regions, beyond 20 ms. Sham stimuli only evoked late acoustic potentials. Corresponding vestibular potentials were also seen in an eight-channel bipolar Laplacian montage. Conclusions: The sequentially appearing cortical potentials evoked by VEMP-capable stimuli co-locate with data from functional imaging studies. Frequency-specific activity (induced potentials) in these areas may reflect multimodal proprioceptive and visual sensory crosstalk. Significance: Vestibular cortical evoked potentials may see clinical use in vertigo disorders. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the exact length of the preictal state is unclear and varies from seizure to seizure. We propose a novel statistical approach for proper selection of the preictal period, which can also be considered either as a measure of predictability of a seizure or as the prediction capability of an understudy feature. The optimal preictal periods (OPPs) obtained from the training samples can be used for building a more accurate classifier model. The proposed method uses amplitude distribution histograms of features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. To evaluate this method, we extract spectral power features in different frequency bands from monopolar and space-differential EEG signals of 18 patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Furthermore, comparisons among monopolar channels with space-differential channels, as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG) and surface EEG (sEEG) signals, indicate that while monopolar signals perform better in iEEG recordings, no significant difference is noticeable in sEEG recordings.

Fourteen overweight and obese patients (3 men and 11 women) with three or more FA symptoms and fourteen overweight and obese patients (3 men and 11 women) with two or less FA symptoms were included in the study. EEG was recorded during three different conditions: 1) five minutes resting state (RS), 2) five minutes resting state after a single taste of a chocolate milkshake (ML-RS), and 3) five minutes resting state after a single taste of control neutral solution (N-RS). EEG analyses were conducted by means of the exact Low Resolution Electric Tomography software (eLORETA). Significant modification was observed only in the ML-RS condition. Compared to controls, patients with three or more FA symptoms showed an increase of delta power in the right middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area [BA] 8) and in the right precentral gyrus (BA 9), and theta power in the right insula (BA 13) and in the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). Furthermore, compared to controls, patients with three or more FA symptoms showed an increase of functional connectivity in fronto-parietal areas in both the theta and alpha band. The increase of functional connectivity was also positively associated with the number of FA symptoms. Taken together, our results show that FA has similar neurophysiological correlates of other forms of substance-related and addictive disorders suggesting similar psychopathological mechanisms.

Subjects with a higher alpha 3/alpha 2 frequency power ratio showed lower brain perfusion than in the low alpha 3/alpha 2 group. The two groups show significantly different hippocampal volumes and correlation with theta frequency activity. Methods: Seventy-four adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, and high resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-seven of them underwent EEG recording and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) evaluation. The alpha 3/alpha 2 power ratio and cortical thickness were computed for each subject. The difference in cortical thickness between the groups was estimated. Results: In the higher upper/low alpha group, memory impairment was more pronounced in both the MRI group and the SPECT MCI groups. An increase in the production of theta oscillations was associated with greater interhemisperic coupling between temporal areas. It also correlated with greater cortical atrophy and lower perfusional rate in the temporoparietal cortex. Conclusion: High EEG upper/low a power ratio was associated with cortical thinning and lower perfusion in temporoparietal areas. Moreover, both atrophy and lower perfusion rate significantly correlated with memory impairment in MCI subjects. Therefore, the increase in the EEG upper/low alpha frequency power ratio could be useful in identifying individuals at risk for progression to AD dementia in a clinical context.

The approach relies on fitting, in an iterative way, functions from a large predefined set (called dictionary) to an analyzed signal. Usually, symmetric functions coming from the Gabor family (sine modulated Gaussian) are used. However Gabor functions may not be optimal in describing waveforms present in physiological and medical signals. Many biomedical signals contain asymmetric components, usually with a steep rise and slower decay. For the decomposition of this kind of signal we introduce a dictionary of functions of various degrees of asymmetry - from symmetric Gabor atoms to highly asymmetric waveforms. The application of this enriched dictionary to Otoacoustic Emissions and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method. The approach provides more sparse representation, allows for correct determination of the latencies of the components and removes the "energy leakage" effect generated by symmetric waveforms that do not sufficiently match the structures of the analyzed signal. Additionally, we introduced a time-frequency-amplitude distribution that is more adequate for representation of asymmetric atoms than the conventional time-frequency-energy distribution.

Three types of imaginary fist movements have been decoded: sustained opening and closing of right fist, sustained opening and closing of left fist and rest. Initially, the registers were band-pass filtered to separate frequency ranges given by mu rhythms (7.5-12.5 Hz), beta rhythms (12.5-30 Hz), mu& beta rhythms, and a broad range of 0.5-30 Hz. Afterward, the signals of the separated subbands were epoched in time windows of 0-0.5, 0-1, 0-1.5 and 0-2 seconds, as well as preprocessed with two techniques of spatial filtering: common spatial patterns and independent component analysis. In both cases, a set of selected channels was established for feature extraction, by calculation of the logarithms of the variance in the time series corresponding to each preprocessed and selected channel. The classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. The results showed that the combination given by common spatial patterns and support vector machines allowed to reach a mean decoding accuracy close to 99.9%, where epoching and filtering to separate subbands did not influence the results in a noticeable way.

Regression analysis of individual alpha peak frequency's meanings, total power of biopotentials in eight frequency ranges indicated that a decrease of IQ correlates with age increase, or with decrease of individual alpha peak frequency with positive contribution of the alpha3 power and negative - of the betal. High meaning of the alpha3 power and low meaning of the betal are the predictors of high intelligence in the younger group. High intelligence in the elder group is accompanied by a trend to increase of the individual alpha peak frequency and to decrease of the theta/betal power ration together with significant decrease of the alpha3/alpha2 power ratio.

As they typically lack visible expressions, indirect methods like analysis of facial expressions are ineffective at best. Towards solving such problem, we present a statistical approach to predict cognitive load from single trial electrophysiological recordings of brain activity (i.e., EEG). We evaluated the utility of two commonly used sets of features, namely, wavelet entropy and band-specific power (theta, alpha, and beta) to predict levels of cognitive load. We show that performance of the model (i.e., support vector machine) could be improved by feature fusion (such as wavelet entropy and spectral power features together) and also integrating nonlinear representations learned through deep belief networks. Our results demonstrate predictions of cognitive load across four different levels with an overall accuracy of 92% during execution of a memory task.

According to one influential view, these assemblies are characterized by synchronized gamma-band activity (GBA) [5-11] that reflects stimulus-specific representations [12-14]. However, recent studies have shown that GBA is closely correlated with the overall amount of cellular activity and may be detrimental for precise representations of specific stimuli [15,16]. Until now, the role of GBA for the formation of dynamically changing representations has been unknown. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis (RSA) [17] to intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data from ten presurgical epilepsy patients to identify stimulus-specific neural representations. Patients first learned and then retrieved their paths through virtual houses. Dynamic representations were identified by the rapidly changing distributions of frequency-specific global (spatial) activity patterns across the brain. We found that GBA patterns during successful (but not unsuccessful) retrieval of one sequence were more similar to activity during encoding of that same sequence compared to other sequences. The contribution of individual electrodes to these global representations was correlated with local similarity in individual electrodes (i.e., with RSA across time). Moreover, time-resolved RSA values were negatively correlated with the magnitude of iEEG gamma power: RSA values were higher at time points when gamma power was reduced. Both global and local representations relied on a small proportion of electrodes. These results show that behaviorally relevant neural representations of specific dynamically changing stimuli can be tracked by iEEG recordings and that they are associated with reductions of gamma power.

Various issues in translating findings from animal to human studies can be identified. Here we discuss whether EEG could be considered as a possible tool to translate the effects of cognition enhancers across species. Three different aspects of EEG measures are evaluated: frequency bands, event-related potentials, and coherence analysis. On basis of the comparison of these measures between species, and effects of drugs that improve or impair memory performance (mainly cholinergic drugs), it appears that event-related potentials and coherence analyses could be considered as potential translational tools to study cognition-enhancing drug effects in rodents and animals.

To test whether prior neuronal activity in the cortex or in subcortical regions drives sleep rebound, we systemically administered atropine (100 mg/kg) to rats, producing a dissociated state with slow-wave cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) but waking behavior (e.g. locomotion). Atropine injections during the light period produced 6 h of slow-wave cortical EEG but also subcortical arousal. Afterward, rats showed a significant increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, compared to the same period on a baseline day. Consistent with the behavioral and cortical EEG state produced by systemic atropine, c-Fos expression was low in the cortex but high in multiple subcortical arousal systems. These data suggest that subcortical arousal and behavior are sufficient to drive sleep homeostasis, while a sleep-like pattern of cortical activity is not sufficient to satisfy sleep homeostasis.

The preferred tempo is believed to be associated with rhythmic body movements as well as motor cortex activity. However, a long-standing question is whether preferred tempo is determined biologically. To uncover the neural correlates of preferred tempo, we first determined an individual's preferred tempo using a multistep procedure. Subsequently, we correlated the preferred tempo with a general EEG timing parameter as well as perceptual and motor EEG correlatesnamely, individual alpha frequency, auditory evoked gamma band response, and motor beta activity. Results showed a significant relation between preferred tempo and the frequency of motor beta activity. These findings suggest that individual tempo preferences result from neural activity in the motor cortex, explaining the interindividual variation.

These abrupt shifts are induced by a sleep-regulating flip-flop mechanism which is destabilized in narcolepsy without obvious alterations in EEG oscillations. Here, we focus on the question whether the pathology of narcolepsy is reflected in EEG microstate patterns. 30 channel awake and NREM sleep EEGs of 12 narcoleptic patients and 32 healthy subjects were analyzed. Fitting back the dominant amplitude topography maps into the EEG led to a temporal sequence of maps. Mean microstate duration, ratio total time (RTT), global explained variance (GEV) and transition probability of each map were compared between both groups. Nine patients reached N1, 5 N2 and only 4 N3. All healthy subjects reached at least N2, 19 also N3. Four dominant maps could be found during wakefulness and all NREM- sleep stages in healthy subjects. During N3, narcolepsy patients showed an additional fifth map. The mean microstate duration was significantly shorter in narcoleptic patients than controls, most prominent in deep sleep. Single maps' GEV and RTT were also altered in narcolepsy. Being aware of the limitation of our low sample size, narcolepsy patients showed wake-like features during sleep as reflected in shorter microstate durations. These microstructural EEG alterations might reflect the intrusion of brain states characteristic of wakefulness into sleep and an instability of the sleep-regulating flip-flop mechanism resulting not only in pathological switches between REM- and NREM-sleep but also within NREM sleep itself, which may lead to a microstructural fragmentation of the EEG.

Previous studies investigating ToM usually employed verbal paradigms and functional neuroimaging methods. Here, we studied oscillatory responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in a non-verbal social cognition task. The aim of this study was twofold: First, we wanted to investigate differences in oscillatory responses to animations differing with regard to the complexity of social "interactions". Secondly, we intended to evaluate the basic cognitive processes underlying social cognition. To this end, we analyzed theta, alpha, beta and gamma task-related de-/synchronization (TRD/TRS) during presentation of six non-verbal videos differing in the complexity of (social) "interactions" between two geometric shapes. Videos were adopted from Castelli et al. (2000)and belonged to three conditions: Videos designed to evoke attributions of mental states (ToM), interaction descriptions (goal-directed, GD) and videos in which the shapes moved randomly (R). Analyses revealed that only theta activity consistently varied as a function of social "interaction" complexity. Results suggest that ToM/GD videos attract more attention and working-memory resources and may have activated related memory contents. Alpha and beta results were less consistent. While alpha effects suggest that observation of social "interactions" may benefit from inhibition of self-centered processing, oscillatory responses in the beta range could be related to action observation. In summary, the results provide insight into basic cognitive processes involved in social cognition and render the paradigm attractive for the investigation of social cognitive processes in non-verbal populations.

In the present research we were interested in additional load imposed on executive functions by link-selection processes during computer-based reading. For obtaining process measures, we used a methodology of concurrent electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking data recording that allowed us to compare epochs of pure text reading with epochs of hyperlink-like selection processes in an online reading situation. Furthermore, this methodology allowed us to directly compare the two physiological load-measures EEG alpha frequency band power and pupil dilation. We observed increased load on executive functions during hyperlink-like selection processes on both measures in terms of decreased alpha frequency band power and increased pupil dilation. Surprisingly however, the two measures did not correlate. Two additional experiments were conducted that excluded potential perceptual, motor, or structural confounds. In sum, EEG alpha frequency band power and pupil dilation both turned out to be sensitive measures for increased load during hyperlink-like selection processes in online text reading.

We investigated here whether subtle cognitive deterioration in a population of healthy elderly individuals could be predicted by EEG signals at baseline under cognitive activation. Continuous EEG was recorded in 97 elderly control subjects and 45 age-matched mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases during a simple attentional and a 2-back working memory task. Upon 18-month neuropsychological follow-up, the final sample included 55 stable (sCON) and 42 deteriorated (dCON) controls. We examined the P1, N1, P3, and PNwm event-related components as well as the oscillatory activities in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (14-25 Hz) frequency ranges (ERD/ERS: event-related desynchronization/synchronization, and ITC: inter-trial coherence). Behavioral performance, P1, and N1 components were comparable in all groups. The P3, PNwm, and all oscillatory activity indices were altered in MCI cases compared to controls. Only three EEG indices distinguished the two control groups: alpha and beta ERD (dCON > sCON) and beta ITC (dCON < sCON). These findings show that subtle cognitive deterioration has no impact on EEG indices associated with perception, discrimination, and working memory processes but mostly affects attention, resulting in an enhanced recruitment of attentional resources. In addition, cognitive decline alters neural firing synchronization at high frequencies (14-25 Hz) at early stages, and possibly affects lower frequencies (4-13 Hz) only at more severe stages.

Here we provide a new design of a versatile reusable hybrid infusion-recording (HIME) system which can be utilized in freely moving mice performing cognitive tasks. The HIME system allows monitoring neuronal activity in multiple layers in several brain structures. Here, we provide examples of bilateral injection and recordings of full spectrum of learning and memory related oscillations, i.e., theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100) and ripple activity (130-150 Hz), in five hippocampal layers as well as in the CA1 and CA2 regions. Furthermore, the system is designed to be used for parallel recordings in the amygdala, cortex and other brain areas, before and after infusion of reagents of interest, either in or off a cognitive test. We anticipate that the HIME system can be particularly convenient to advance functional neuroglycobiological studies and molecular deciphering of mechanisms governing long-term memory consolidation.

However, the errors made may or may not be in line with the neural processing. In particular in experiments with time pressure or studies where the threshold of perception is measured, the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the structure in the underlying experimental set-up. When we base our analysis on the behavioral labels as usually done, then we ignore this problem of systematic and structured (non-uniform) label noise and are likely to arrive at wrong conclusions in our data analysis. This paper contributes a remedy to this important scenario: we present a novel approach for a) measuring label noise and b) removing structured label noise. We demonstrate its usefulness for EEG data analysis using a standard d2 test for visual attention (N = 20 participants). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Their performances were simultaneously rated by two expert observers for team resilience using a team process rubric adopted by the US Navy Submarine Force. Symbolic neurodynamic (NS) representations of the 1-40 Hz EEG amplitude fluctuations of the crew were created each second displaying the EEG levels of each team member in the context of the other crew members and in the context of the task. Quantitative estimates of the NS fluctuations were made using a moving window of entropy. Periods of decreased entropy were considered times of increased team neurodynamic organization; e.g. when there were prolonged and restricted relationships between the EEG-PSD levels of the crew. Resilient teams showed significantly greater neurodynamic organization in the pre-simulation Briefing than the less resilient teams. Most of these neurodynamic organizations occurred in the 25 -40 Hz PSD bins. In contrast, the more resilient teams showed significantly lower neurodynamic organization during the Scenario than the less resilient teams with the greatest differences in the 12-20 Hz PSD bins. The results indicate that the degree of neurodynamic organization reflects the performance dynamics of the team with more organization being important during the pre-mission briefing while less organization (i.e. more flexibility) important while performing the task.

One of this disruptive effects is loss of synchronization. Global Field Synchronization indice that is calculated by Global Field Synchronization Method can detect degree of synchronization of EEG. According to analysis results, significantly difference was found between Global Field Synchronization Indice of OCD patients and healthy group in theta and delta frequency bands. For the purpose of testing success of GFS method in detecting OCD, GFS values of OCD patients and healthy group classified with Support Vector Machine method. In order to increase the performance of classification model, training and test data was selected by Cross Validation Method. Accuracy rate of classification results was found at 94.75 in delta band and 78.048 percent in theta band. The system can assist the physicians for diagnosing OCD. The classification results has shown that GFS is a successful method for to diagnose OCD.

Changes in resting EEG following methadone treatment in opiate addicts	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Methadone; Resting EEG; Opiate dependence	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DEPENDENT SUBJECTS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; SEVERITY INDEX; THETA POWER; MAINTENANCE; BETA; HEROIN; PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: This study investigated the electrophysiological activity associated with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Methods: The resting EEG spectrum of beta (14.5-30 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz) and delta (1.5-3.5 Hz) rhythm were measured in 32 patients undertaking chronic MMT, 17 opiate users and 25 healthy volunteers. Differences in the EEG components of each group were evaluated using a repeated measures Analyses of Variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc comparisons were Bonferroni corrected. Results: Our results show that either patients undertaking MMT or active opiate users exhibited a significant increase in the power of beta and theta bands relative to healthy control subjects. However, the spectral power of patients undertaking MMT fell between that of current opiate users and healthy control subjects on many regional EEG measures. There was an inverse correlation between the power of beta or theta bands and cognitive performance. Conclusion: The abnormal neural electrical activity present in those still using illicit opiates might be reduced following MMT.

Atypical Hemispheric Specialization for Faces in Infants at Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; EEG coherence; face processing; hemispheric specialization; endophenotype; gamma; infancy	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; ABNORMAL-DEVELOPMENT; OBJECT RECOGNITION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SOCIAL-PERCEPTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EYE GAZE; EEG	Among the many experimental findings that tend to distinguish those with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are face processing deficits, reduced hemispheric specialization, and atypical neurostructural and functional connectivity. To investigate the earliest manifestations of these features, we examined lateralization of event-related gamma-band coherence to faces during the first year of life in infants at high risk for autism (HRA; defined as having an older sibling with ASD) who were compared with low-risk comparison (LRC) infants, defined as having no family history of ASD. Participants included 49 HRA and 46 LRC infants who contributed a total of 127 data sets at 6 and 12 months. Electroencephalography was recorded while infants viewed images of familiar/unfamiliar faces. Event-related gamma-band (30-50Hz) phase coherence between anterior-posterior electrode pairs for left and right hemispheres was computed. Developmental trajectories for lateralization of intra-hemispheric coherence were significantly different in HRA and LRC infants: by 12 months, HRA infants showed significantly greater leftward lateralization compared with LRC infants who showed rightward lateralization. Preliminary results indicate that infants who later met criteria for ASD were those that showed the greatest leftward lateralization. HRA infants demonstrate an aberrant pattern of leftward lateralization of intra-hemispheric coherence by the end of the first year of life, suggesting that the network specialized for face processing may develop atypically. Further, infants with the greatest leftward asymmetry at 12 months where those that later met criteria for ASD, providing support to the growing body of evidence that atypical hemispheric specialization may be an early neurobiological marker for ASD.

The steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs; the representative form of the SSRs) have been widely used in the cognitive and clinical neurosciences and brain-computer interface research. However, the steady-state evoked potentials have limitations in examining high-frequency neural oscillations and basic cognition. In addition, synchronous neural oscillations in the low frequency range (<1 Hz) and in higher-order cognition have received a little attention. Therefore, we examined the SSRs in the low frequency range using a new index, the steady-state BOLD responses (SSBRs) evoked by semantic stimuli. Our results revealed that the significant SSBRs were induced at the fundamental frequency of stimuli and the first harmonic in task-related regions, suggesting the enhanced variability of neural oscillations entrained by exogenous stimuli. The SSBRs were independent of neurovascular coupling and characterized by sensorimotor bias, an indication of regional-dependent neuroplasticity. Furthermore, the amplitude of SSBRs may predict behavioral performance and show the psychophysiological relevance. Our findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of the SSRs evoked by higher-order cognition and how the SSRs modulate low-frequency neural oscillations.

However, while EEG studies reported involvement of (pre)frontal midline structures in synchronization, functional neuroimaging elucidated the importance of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in working memory (WM). Verbal and spatial WM rely on lateralized subsystems (phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, respectively), yet only trends for hemispheric dissociation of networks supporting rehearsal of verbal and spatial information were identified by EEG. As oscillatory activity is WM load dependent, we applied an individually tailored submaximal load for verbal (V) and spatial (S) task to enhance synchronization in the relevant functional networks. To map these networks, we used high-density EEG and coherence analysis. Our results imply that the synchronized activity is limited to highly specialized areas that correspond well with the areas identified by functional neuroimaging. In both V and S task, two independent networks of theta synchronization involving dorsolateral PFC of each hemisphere were revealed. In V task, left prefrontal and left parietal areas were functionally coupled in gamma frequencies. Theta synchronization thus provides the necessary interface for storage and manipulation of information, while left-lateralized gamma synchronization could represent the EEG correlate of the phonological loop.

Here, we explored whether entrainment of neuronal oscillations underpins this phenomenon. Participants viewed a regular stream of images in silence, or in-synchrony or out-of-synchrony with an unmarked beat position of a slow (1.3 Hz) auditory rhythm. Focusing on occipital recordings, we analyzed evoked oscillations shortly before and event-related potentials (ERPs) shortly after image onset. The phase of beta-band oscillations in the in-synchrony condition differed from that in the out-of-synchrony and silence conditions. Additionally, ERPs revealed rhythm effects for a stimulus onset potential (SOP) and the N1. Both were more negative for the in-synchrony as compared to the out-of-synchrony and silence conditions and their amplitudes positively correlated with the beta phase effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that rhythmic expectations are supported by a reorganization of neural oscillations that seems to benefit stimulus processing at expected time points. Importantly, this reorganization emerges from global rhythmic cues, across modalities, and for frequencies significantly higher than the external rhythm. As such, our findings support the idea that entrainment of neuronal oscillations represents a general mechanism through which the brain uses predictive elements in the environment to optimize attention and stimulus perception.

Top-down control of the phase of alpha-band oscillations as a mechanism for temporal prediction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neural oscillations; prediction; attention; visual awareness; alpha-band phase	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; TIME; EXPECTATION; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; AWARENESS	The physiological state of the brain before an incoming stimulus has substantial consequences for subsequent behavior and neural processing. For example, the phase of ongoing posterior alpha-band oscillations (8-14 Hz) immediately before visual stimulation has been shown to predict perceptual outcomes and downstream neural activity. Although this phenomenon suggests that these oscillations may phasically route information through functional networks, many accounts treat these periodic effects as a consequence of ongoing activity that is independent of behavioral strategy. Here, we investigated whether alpha-band phase can be guided by top-down control in a temporal cueing task. When participants were provided with cues predictive of the moment of visual target onset, discrimination accuracy improved and targets were more frequently reported as consciously seen, relative to unpredictive cues. This effect was accompanied by a significant shift in the phase of alpha-band oscillations, before target onset, toward each participant's optimal phase for stimulus discrimination. These findings provide direct evidence that forming predictions about when a stimulus will appear can bias the phase of ongoing alpha-band oscillations toward an optimal phase for visual processing, and may thus serve as a mechanism for the top-down control of visual processing guided by temporal predictions.

In this study, we investigated the role of task focus for change detection in emotional prosody by measuring changes in event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power. EEG was recorded for prosodies with and without emotion change while subjects performed emotion change detection task (explicit) and visual probe detection task (implicit). We found that vocal emotion change induced theta event-related synchronization during 100-600 ms regardless of task focus. More importantly, vocal emotion change induced significant beta event-related desynchronization during 400-750 ms under explicit instead of implicit task condition. These findings suggest that the detection of emotional changes is independent of task focus, while the task focus effect in neural processing of vocal emotion change is specific to the integration of emotional deviations.

Action potentials generating some HFOs are observed in the vicinity of neurons in experimental animals. However electrodes that are remote from neurons, as in case of clinical situations, should not record action potentials. We propose to resolve this question by a realistic simulation of epileptic neuronal network. Methods: The rat dentate gyrus with sclerosis was simulated in silico. We computed the current dipole moment generated by each granule cell and the field potentials in a measurement area far from neurons. Results: The dentate gyrus was stimulated through synaptic input to evoke discharges resembling interictal epileptiform discharges, which had superimposed HFOs <= 295 Hz that were recordable with remote electrodes and represented bursts of action potentials of granule cells. The increase in power of HFOs was associated with the progression of sclerosis, the reduction of GABAergic inhibition, and the increase in cell connectivity. Spectral frequency of HFOs had similar tendencies. Conclusions: HFOs recorded with electrodes remote from neurons could actually be generated by clusters of action potentials. Significance: The phenomenon of action potentials recorded with remote electrodes can possibly extend the clinical meaning of EEG. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this experiment, various GBR-based mental states were generated with three factors (level of mathematical ability, task complexity, and short-term learning) modulating the level of neural activation. A feature subset selection method based on the sequential forward floating search algorithm was used to identify an "optimal" combination of EEG channel locations, where the corresponding GBR feature subset could obtain the highest accuracy in discriminating pairwise mental states influenced by each experiment factor. The integrative results from multi-factor selections suggest that the right-lateral fronto-parietal system is highly involved in neural efficiency of the math-gifted brain, primarily including the bilateral superior frontal, right inferior frontal, right-lateral central and right temporal regions. By means of the localization method based on single-trial classification of mental states, new GBR features and EEG channel-based brain regions related to mathematical giftedness were identified, which could be useful for the brain function improvement of children/adolescents in mathematical learning through brain-computer interface systems.

These reactions are observed through the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings using non-invasive EEG surface electrodes. For this research, four checkerboard patterned visual stimuli were used to induce brain responses related to the visual system. The responses were later recorded and analyzed using wavelet decomposition for characterizing selected visual anomaly, namely myopia. Although the analysis of visually evoked responses (VEP) for visual anomaly can be traced back to the early 80's, the advancement of digital signal processing techniques has yet to be fully utilized for investigating these responses. Therefore, this work serves as an important milestone for investigating the characteristics of VEP's using biortogonal spline wavelet to define the time-frequency characteristics of the signals. Probablistic neural network (PNN) was used to evaluate the performance of the extracted features in discriminating the myopia as well as healthy controls and the proposed method is able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 95.07%.

Theta and alpha EEG frequency interplay in subjects with mild cognitive impairment: evidence from EEG, MRI, and SPECT brain modifications	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						theta; alpha; EEG; SPECT; MRI; midl cognitive impairment	ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; VASCULAR DAMAGE; HMPAO-SPECT; DISEASE; MEMORY; PERFUSION	Background: Temporo-parietal and medial temporal cortex atrophy are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as the reduction of regional cerebral blood perfusion in hippocampus. Moreover, the increase of EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio has been associated with MCI due to AD and with an increase in theta frequency power in a group of subjects with impaired cerebral perfusion in hippocampus. Methods: Seventy four adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and high resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among the patients, a subset of 27 subjects underwent also perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and hippocampal atrophy evaluation. Alpha3/alpha2 power ratio as well as cortical thickness was computed for each subject. Three MCI groups were detected according to increasing tertile values of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio and difference of cortical thickness among the groups estimated. Results: Higher alpha3/alpha2 power ratio group had wider cortical thinning than other groups, mapped to the Supramarginal and Precuneus bilaterally. Subjects with higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio showed a constant trend to a lower perfusion than lower alpha3/alpha2 group. Moreover, this group correlates with both a bigger hippocampal atrophy and an increase of theta frequency power. Conclusion: Higher EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio was associated with temporoparietal cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and reduction of regional cerebral perfusion in medial temporal cortex. In this group an increase of theta frequency power was detected inMCI subjects. The combination of higher EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio, cortical thickness measure and regional cerebral perfusion reveals a complex interplay between EEG cerebral rhythms, structural and functional brain modifications.

Resizing artificial neural networks for automatic detection of epileptiform discharges: a comparison between Principal Component and Linear Discriminant Analysis	2015 TWELVE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS COMPUTER AND COMPUTATION (ICECCO)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Electronics Computer and Computation (ICECCO)	SEP 27-30, 2015	Suleyman Demirel Univ, Almaty, KAZAKHSTAN	Turgut Ozal Univ, Inter Ataturk Alatoo Univ	Suleyman Demirel Univ	artificial neural networks; epileptiform patterns; principal component analysis; linear discriminant analysis; size reduction	EEG; EPILEPSY; SIGNALS	Among the all of the different Artificial Intelligence tools, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are widely used for automated pattern recognition and classification process. One of its many applications in Biomedical Engineering is its use in the development of accurate and reliable methods for automatic identification of epileptiform discharges in long term electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Several methods have been proposed using neural networks as a classifier in which either segments of EEG signal or features extracted from them are presented as ANN input stimuli. Depending on the sampling frequency and signal size, the networks can become quite large, which would affect the performance of a system where this process is inserted. A solution to reduce the dimensionality of the networks is the use of methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the input stimuli and consequently the size of the network. This study aims to analyze and compare the application of PCA and LDA as a tool for dimensionality reduction neural networks that use morphological descriptors to perform the automatic detection of epileptiform discharges. The average efficiency performance of the neural networks with components and LDA selected descriptors as input stimuli was, respectively, 85.58% and 82.28% which is close to the average efficiency (85.46%) achieved with the whole group of descriptors. Throughout the simulations performed in this study we could not detect any apparent relation, direct or otherwise, between the input size reduction and the neural network performance results. However, after simulations we could observe that Principal Component Analysis was better for resizing the neural networks since it had a slightly better efficiency performance at the same time that it reduced the input size in approximately 56%.

Previous work has shown that entrainment is reduced when the quality of the acoustic input is degraded, but has also linked rhythmic activity at similar time scales to the encoding of temporal expectations. To understand these bottom-up and top-down contributions to rhythmic entrainment, we manipulated the temporal predictive structure of speech by parametrically altering the distribution of pauses between syllables or words, thereby rendering the local speech rate irregular while preserving intelligibility and the envelope fluctuations of the acoustic signal. Recording EEG activity in human participants, we found that this manipulation did not alter neural processes reflecting the encoding of individual sound transients, such as evoked potentials. However, the manipulation significantly reduced the fidelity of auditory delta (but not theta) band entrainment to the speech envelope. It also reduced left frontal alpha power and this alpha reduction was predictive of the reduced delta entrainment across participants. Our results show that rhythmic auditory entrainment in delta and theta bands reflect functionally distinct processes. Furthermore, they reveal that delta entrainment is under top-down control and likely reflects prefrontal processes that are sensitive to acoustical regularities rather than the bottom-up encoding of acoustic features.

How our brain utilizes cortical resources during multi-tasking is one of many interesting research topics. In this study, we tested whether a dual-task can be differentiated in the neural and behavioral responses of healthy subjects with varying degree of working memory capacity (WMC). We combined word recall and oculomotor tasks because they incorporate common neural networks including the fronto-parietal (FP) network. Three different types of oculomotor tasks (eye fixation, Fix-EM; predictive and random smooth pursuit eye movement, P-SPEM and R-SPEM) were combined with two memory load levels (low-load: five words, high-load: 10 words) for a word recall task. Each of those dual-task combinations was supposed to create varying cognitive loads on the FP network. We hypothesize that each dual-task requires different cognitive strategies for allocating the brain's limited cortical resources and affects brain oscillation of the FP network. In addition, we hypothesized that groups with different WMC will show differential neural and behavioral responses. We measured oscillatory brain activity with simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings and behavioral performance by word recall. Prominent frontal midline (FM) theta (4-6 Hz) synchronization emerged in the EEG of the high-WMC group experiencing R-SPEM with high-load conditions during the early phase of the word maintenance period. Conversely, significant parietal upper alpha (10-12 Hz) desynchronization was observed in the EEG and MEG of the low-WMC group experiencing P-SPEM under high-load conditions during the same period. Different brain oscillatory patterns seem to depend on each individual's WMC and varying attentional demands from different dual-task combinations. These findings suggest that specific brain oscillations may reflect different strategies for allocating cortical resources during combined word recall and oculomotor dual-tasks.

J	Kang, JH; Kim, SJ; Cho, YS; Kim, SP				Kang, Jae-Hwan; Kim, Su Jin; Cho, Yang Seok; Kim, Sung-Phil			Modulation of Alpha Oscillations in the Human EEG with Facial Preference	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AVERAGE REFERENCE; FACE PERCEPTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; MEMORY; ATTRACTIVENESS; ASYMMETRY; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; BEAUTY; SPACE	Facial preference that results from the processing of facial information plays an important role in social interactions as well as the selection of a mate, friend, candidate, or favorite actor. However, it still remains elusive which brain regions are implicated in the neural mechanisms underlying facial preference, and how neural activities in these regions are modulated during the formation of facial preference. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory power with facial preference. For the reliable assessments of facial preference, we designed a series of passive viewing and active choice tasks. In the former task, twenty-four face stimuli were passively viewed by participants for multiple times in random order. In the latter task, the same stimuli were then evaluated by participants for their facial preference judgments. In both tasks, significant differences between the preferred and non-preferred faces groups were found in alpha band power (8-13 Hz) but not in other frequency bands. The preferred faces generated more decreases in alpha power. During the passive viewing task, significant differences in alpha power between the preferred and non-preferred face groups were observed at the left frontal regions in the early (0.15-0.4 s) period during the 1-s presentation. By contrast, during the active choice task when participants consecutively watched the first and second face for 1 s and then selected the preferred one, an alpha power difference was found for the late (0.65-0.8 s) period over the whole brain during the first face presentation and over the posterior regions during the second face presentation. These results demonstrate that the modulation of alpha activity by facial preference is a top-down process, which requires additional cognitive resources to facilitate information processing of the preferred faces that capture more visual attention than the non-preferred faces.

Several studies suggest that the reinstatement of neural encoding patterns is beneficial for memory retrieval (Manning et al., 2011; Staresina et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014). However, reinstatement of the original encoding context is not always helpful, for instance, when retrieving a memory in a different contextual situation (Smith and Vela, 2001). It is an open question whether such context-dependent memory effects can be captured by the reinstatement of neural patterns. We investigated this question by applying temporal and spatial pattern similarity analysis in MEG and intracranial EEG in a context-match paradigm. Items (words) were tagged by individual dynamic context stimuli (movies). The results show that beta oscillatory phase in visual regions and the parahippocampal cortex tracks the incidental reinstatement of individual context trajectories on a single-trial level. Crucially, memory benefitted from reinstatement when the encoding and retrieval contexts matched but suffered from reinstatement when the contexts did not match.

Methods: We studied eight children with ES, who underwent IVEEG before resective surgery for epilepsy. We quantified the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of the fast and slow components of ictal activities during ES and IIED. We compared the concordance between the spatial distributions of the fast and slow components of ES and IIED. Results: There was a larger concordance between the spatial distributions of the fast and slow components in IIED than in ES (p = 0.0206 and 0.0401). Conclusions: The spatial concordance between the fast and slow EEG components was significantly different between ES and IIED. Significance: The mechanisms underlying the generation of slow EEG components may differ between ES and IIED. The slow EEG components of ES might indicate an extensive epileptic network involving remote symptomatic zones for ES in either the cortical or subcortical areas. The high spatial concordance between the fast and slow components of IIED suggests the involvement of a local inhibitory process within the epileptic cortex.

Here, we illustrate the dynamics of neural oscillations in the motor system of the brain. We used a non-directional cue to instruct participants to prepare a motor response with either the left or the right hand and recorded electroencephalography during the preparation of the response. Consistent with previous findings, the amplitude of alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations significantly decreased over the motor region contralateral to the hand prepared for the response. Prior to this decrease, there were a number of inter-regional phase synchronies at lower frequencies (2-4 Hz; delta band). Cross-frequency coupling was quantified to further explore the direct link between alpha amplitudes and delta synchrony. The cross-frequency coupling of showed response-specific modulation, whereby the motor region contralateral to the preparation hand exhibited an increase in coupling relative to the baseline. The amplitude of alpha oscillations had an unpreferred and a preferred delta phase, in which the amplitude was modulated negatively and positively, respectively. Given the amplitude of alpha-band oscillations decreased over the analyzed period, the alpha amplitude might be down-regulated by the phase-amplitude coupling, although we do not have direct evidence for that. Taken together, these results show global-to-local computation in the motor system, which started from inter-regional delta phase synchrony and ended at an effector-specific decrease in the amplitude of alpha-band oscillations, with phase-amplitude coupling connecting both computations.

Spatial Patterns of Correlations between Amplitudes of the Main EEG Rhythms in Children in the Norm and with Central Disorders of Motor Activity	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG activity; motor disorders; cerebral palsy; EEG rhythms; amplitude; correlations; spatial pattern		We recorded resting-state ongoing EEG in two groups of 8- to 12-year-old children, boys and girls, with no disorders in the motor sphere and with a clinically diagnosed form of cerebral palsy (control and CP groups, n = 100 and n = 78, respectively). The sign and intensity of correlations between values of the mean amplitudes of oscillations of the delta, theta, alpha, and beta rhythms in the pairs of eight recording sites were estimated. Recording electrodes were positioned in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital loci of the left and right hemispheres (28 pairs of leads). Cases with the modulus of the correlation coefficient, vertical bar r vertical bar, 0.30-0.49, 0.50-0.69, and 0.70-0.99, respectively, were classified as those of weak, moderate, and strong correlation between the amplitudes. At vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.30, correlations were considered insignificant. Cases of significant direct (positive) and inverse (negative) correlations, including those with rather high r values, were observed in children of both examined groups, but the numbers of such correlations demonstrated certain intergroup differences. In children suffering from CP, such cases were met noticeably more frequently than in the control group. In boys and girls of the control group, the total number of significant (both direct and inverse) correlations between oscillations of the four above-mentioned rhythms, normalized with respect to the number of all lead pairs (n = 28), varied from 14 to 50%, and only in two cases among 16 (4 analyzed rhythms x 2 examined groups x x 2 gender subgroups) did it exceed 40%. In children with CP, this index varied between 32 and 68%, and only in two cases was it smaller than 40%. Patterns of correlations between amplitudes of the EEG rhythms in girls of both examined groups significantly differed from those in boys; girls were characterized by more frequent cases of inverse correlations.

Here, we studied the relation between neural oscillations during motor preparation and amount of uncertainty about the direction of the upcoming target. Ten right-handed volunteers participated in a cued center-out task. A brief visual cue identified the region of space in which the target would appear. Three cue sizes were used to vary the amount of information about the direction of the upcoming target. The target appeared at a random location within the region indicated by the cue, and the participants moved a joystick-controlled cursor toward it. Time-frequency analyses showed phasic increases of power in low (delta/theta: <7 Hz) and high (gamma: >30 Hz) frequency-bands in relation to the onset of visual stimuli and of the motor response. More importantly in regard to motor preparation, there was a tonic reduction of power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) bands during the period between cue presentation and target onset. During motor preparation, the main source of change of power of the alpha band was localized over the contralateral sensorimotor region and both parietal cortices, whereas for the beta-band the main source was the contralateral sensorimotor region. During cue presentation, the reduction of power of the alpha-band in the occipital lobe showed a brief differentiation of condition: the wider the visual cue, the more the power of the alpha-band decreased. However, during motor preparation, only the power of the beta-band was dependent on directional uncertainty: the less the directional uncertainty, the more the power of the beta-band decreased. In conclusion, the results indicate that the power in the alpha-band is associated briefly with cue size, but is otherwise an undifferentiated indication of neural activation, whereas the power of the beta-band reflects the level of motor preparation.

Physiological correlates of mental effort as manipulated through lane width during simulated driving	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING AND INTELLIGENT INTERACTION (ACII)	International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction		English	Proceedings Paper	6th AAAC Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction International Conference (ACII)	SEP 21-24, 2015	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	AAAC		driving; mental effort; workload; stress; arousal; EEG; physiology; heart rate; HRV; skin conductance; respiration	TASK; WORKLOAD; VARIABLES; SIGNALS; DEMAND; TIME	Previous studies suggest that physiological effects of mental effort as manipulated trough cognitive task difficulty differ from effects of mental effort as manipulated trough a visuomotor task such as lane keeping in simulated driving. Most notably, heart rate increases with mental effort in the former but not in the latter task. EEG seems to be indicative of mental effort in both cases. In previous research [1], Brouwer and colleagues examined effects of mental effort as manipulated in a cognitive (memory) task on a range of physiological signals. In the present research we examine the same types of physiological signals using the same kind of analysis in a visuomotor (simulated driving) task. In this case, mental effort was manipulated using wide and narrow lanes. Effects of task difficulty on both subjective mental effort and behavioral variables were comparable across tasks. Effect of task difficulty was replicated for respiration frequency and to some extent for EEG alpha activity. However, in contrast to the cognitive task [1], skin conductance and heart rate related variables were not significantly affected by task difficulty in the current visuomotor task. We argue that differences in visual attention and cerebral energy demand between the types of tasks may be at the basis of this.	[Brouwer, Anne-Marie; van Erp, Jan B.

J	Luft, CD; Bhattacharya, J				Luft, Caroline Di Bernardi; Bhattacharya, Joydeep			Aroused with heart: Modulation of heartbeat evoked potential by arousal induction and its oscillatory correlates	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA; CARDIAC AWARENESS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; INTEROCEPTIVE SENSITIVITY; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; FLUCTUATIONS	Recent studies showed that the visceral information is constantly processed by the brain, thereby potentially influencing cognition. One index of such process is the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an ERP component related to the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP is sensitive to a number of factors such as motivation, attention, pain, which are associated with higher levels of arousal. However, the role of arousal and its associated brain oscillations on the HEP has not been characterized, yet it could underlie the previous findings. Here we analysed the effects of high-(HA) and low-arousal (LA) induction on the HEP. Further, we investigated the brain oscillations and their role in the HEP in response to HA and LA inductions. As compared to LA, HA was associated with a higher HEP and lower alpha oscillations. Interestingly, individual differences in the HEP modulation by arousal induction were correlated with alpha oscillations. In particular, participants with higher alpha power during the arousal inductions showed a larger HEP in response to HA compared to LA. In summary, we demonstrated that arousal induction affects the cortical processing of heartbeats; and that the alpha oscillations may modulate this effect.

Brain computer interface to enhance episodic memory in human participants	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BCI; episodic memory; ECoG; theta	PREDICTS LATER RECOLLECTION; FREE-RECALL; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SERIAL POSITION; NETWORK REORGANIZATION; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PRESTIMULUS THETA; TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIPPOCAMPAL	Recent research has revealed that neural oscillations in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) bands are predictive of future success in memory encoding. Because these signals occur before the presentation of an upcoming stimulus, they are considered stimulus-independent in that they correlate with enhanced memory encoding independent of the item being encoded. Thus, such stimulus-independent activity has important implications for the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory as well as the development of cognitive neural prosthetics. Here, we developed a brain computer interface (BCI) to test the ability of such pre-stimulus activity to modulate subsequent memory encoding. We recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in neurosurgical patients as they performed a free recall memory task, and detected iEEG theta and alpha oscillations that correlated with optimal memory encoding. We then used these detected oscillatory changes to trigger the presentation of items in the free recall task. We found that item presentation contingent upon the presence of pre-stimulus theta and alpha oscillations modulated memory performance in more sessions than expected by chance. Our results suggest that an electrophysiological signal may be causally linked to a specific behavioral condition, and contingent stimulus presentation has the potential to modulate human memory encoding.

In this paper, we have introduced a novel method for detecting and predicting the seizure attack. After signal preprocessing, the time and frequency domain features are extracted. In our scenario, by estimating the power spectrum using time samples of windowed signal, the features such as non-linearity model and complexity of power for demonstrating the signal behavior are extracted. Our complexity-based feature is named Power Complexity Feature (PCF). The optimal features are selected by a hybrid model of Firefly optimization algorithm (FA) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). With these features, initial optimized MLP is trained in offline mode. A Dynamic Neural Network (DNN) based on Non-Auto Regressive (NAR) architecture estimates the EEG signal. With the trained classifier in offline mode, the predicted signals with optimal features are recognized in two classes. The initial classifier in each training stage is updated. Also, the initial dead part of signal and length of prediction by Monte-Carlo analysis and considering a similarity criterion are improved. Ultimately, the seizure signals by optimized features are recognized with accuracy rate of 86.8% in offline mode and also accuracy rate of 85.7% for the predicted signal with prediction time of 3.12 seconds is obtained.

The aim of this study was to assess if rapid eye movement (REM) sleep reduced generalized IEDs and revealed lateralized IEDs to identify the epileptogenic hemisphere in children with generalized IEDs and normal/subtle changes on MRI. MethodsWe studied 20 children with generalized IEDs on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and normal/subtle changes on MRI who underwent intracranial video-EEG for epilepsy surgery. We assessed a minimum of 100 IEDs during REM, non-REM, and wakefulness, and assigned the distribution (generalized, left, or right hemisphere) to each IED. The number of lobes in the resected areas and seizure outcome were compared between 20 children with generalized IEDs and a comparison group of 28 children without generalized IEDs. ResultsThe mean occurrence rate of generalized IEDs during REM (37%) was significantly lower than that during non-REM (67%, p<0.001) and wakefulness (54%, p=0.003). The number of children whose largest number of IEDs was lateralized in REM was significantly higher than that in non-REM (15 vs. 3 children, 75% vs. 15%, p<0.001). The hemisphere with lateralized IEDs among three states corresponded with the surgical side in 16 children with generalized IEDs. Seventeen children (85%) with generalized IEDs and 27 (96%) without generalized IEDs underwent resective surgery. Multilobar resection was required for 16 children (94%) with generalized IEDs more frequently than 7 children (26%) without generalized IEDs (p<0.001). Thirteen children (77%) with generalized IEDs and 19 (73%) without generalized IEDs were seizure-free with a mean of 3.3 years of follow-up. SignificanceOur study demonstrates the importance of assessing REM in children with generalized IEDs as it reveals lateralized epileptogenic spikes. Seizure freedom may be achieved with multilobar resection in these children with generalized IEDs and normal/subtle changes on MRI. Generalized IEDs in children with normal/subtle changes on MRI should not preclude surgical resection.

J	Popov, T; Popova, P				Popov, Tzvetan; Popova, Petia			Same clock, different time read-out: Spontaneous brain oscillations and their relationship to deficient coding of cognitive content	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG-DATA; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITORY NEURONS; RESTING-STATE; PLACE CELLS	Neuronal oscillations provide an efficient means of communication, fostering functional neural states supporting action and reaction. High in the action hierarchy, cognitive abilities are severely compromised in neuropsychiatric disease such as schizophrenia. Current thinking highlights a clocking mechanism provided by the phase of an ongoing slow oscillation that offers a temporal frame for coding of perceptual and computational elements. Yet unclear is whether and how a dysregulated clocking mechanism accounts for diminished cognitive performance. Neuromagnetic oscillatory activity was related to cognitive performance assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery in 58 healthy individuals (HC) and 46 schizophrenia patients (SZ). HC showed a correlation between gamma-band oscillations (>40 Hz) and working memory performance. This relationship was disrupted in several ways in SZ. First, patients evidenced lower gamma power, poorer working memory performance, and no relationship between these measures. Second, the power spectra were dominated by similar to 10 Hz alpha oscillations with no group differences in amplitude. However, analysis of phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) revealed exaggerated clocking of gamma activity by alpha phase in SZ, associated with poor working memory performance. Third, despite entrainment by the same 10 Hz clock, gamma amplitude was abnormally distributed across the duty cycle in SZ, a potential consequence of compromised interneuron inhibition. Fourth, SZ showed over-engagement of a fronto-parietal network measured by gamma phase coherence, suggesting a brain state hindering cognitive output. Such an endogenous temporal organization may be a core dysfunction in SZ: a segregation/integration input imbalance fostering reduced cognitive performance and compromised behavioral output.

It is reported to parametrically increase with cognitive load and is thought to be generated in medial prefrontal cortex. Here we explored the possibility of using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over frontal sites to enhance frontal-midline theta activity and to increase sustained attention performance. We used a small preliminary sample to test a novel direct current stimulation electrode configuration by which we were able to significantly increase frontal-midline theta amplitude in a resting condition after the end of the stimulation period. Using standardised low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis the effect in the surface EEG was localised to right prefrontal and left medial prefrontal brain areas. Transcranial direct current stimulation did, however, not have any impact on behavioural performance during a sustained attention task. This most likely was due to a very fast washout of the stimulation's after effect on theta activity. Although these are only preliminary results from a rather small sample, this study demonstrates that transcranial direct current stimulation can be used to rather selectively enhance frontal-midline theta amplitude.

An enhanced excitability and synchronous firing in surviving neurons are among the sequels of neuronal death in these diseases and also in some epileptic syndromes. Here, we attempted to increase neuronal cholesterol levels, using a short hairpin RNA to suppress expression of the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 46, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 gene (CYP46A1). This protein hydroxylates cholesterol and so facilitates transmembrane extrusion. A short hairpin RNA CYP46A1construction coupled to the adeno-associated virus type 5 was injected focally and unilaterally into mouse hippocampus. It was selectively expressed first in neurons of the cornu ammonis (hippocampus) (CA)3a region. Cytoplasmic and membrane cholesterol increased, and the neuronal soma volume increased and then decreased before pyramidal cells died. As CA3a pyramidal cells died, interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) events occurred during exploration and non-rapid eye movement sleep. With time, neuronal death spread to involve pyramidal cells and interneurons of the CA1 region. CA1 neuronal death was correlated with a delayed local expression of phosphorylated tau. Astrocytes were activated throughout the hippocampus and microglial activation was specific to regions of neuronal death. CA1 neuronal death was correlated with distinct aberrant EEG activity. During exploratory behaviour and rapid eye movement sleep, EEG oscillations at 7-10Hz (theta) could accelerate to 14-21Hz (beta) waves. They were accompanied by low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations of peak power at similar to 300Hz and a range of 250-350Hz. Although episodes of EEG acceleration were not correlated with changes in exploratory behaviour, they were followed in some animals by structured seizure-like discharges. These data strengthen links between increased cholesterol, neuronal sclerosis and epileptic behaviour.

We have developed an asynchronous brain-machine interface (BMI)-based lower limb exoskeleton control system based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Approach. By decoding electroencephalography signals in real-time, users are able to walk forward, turn right, turn left, sit, and stand while wearing the exoskeleton. SSVEP stimulation is implemented with a visual stimulation unit, consisting of five light emitting diodes fixed to the exoskeleton. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method for the extraction of frequency information associated with the SSVEP was used in combination with k-nearest neighbors. Main results. Overall, 11 healthy subjects participated in the experiment to evaluate performance. To achieve the best classification, CCA was first calibrated in an offline experiment. In the subsequent online experiment, our results exhibit accuracies of 91.3 +/- 5.73%, a response time of 3.28 +/- 1.82 s, an information transfer rate of 32.9 +/- 9.13 bits/min, and a completion time of 1100 +/- 154.92 s for the experimental parcour studied. Significance. The ability to achieve such high quality BMI control indicates that an SSVEP-based lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance is becoming feasible.

We report on our recent studies of the extents to which vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the head of a user can serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. New method: In the proposed tactile and bone-conduction auditory BCI novel multiple head positions are used to evoke combined somatosensory and auditory (via the bone conduction effect) P300 brain responses, in order to define a multimodal tactile and bone-conduction auditory brain computer interface (tbcaBCI). In order to further remove EEG interferences and to improve P300 response classification synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is applied. SST outperforms the classical time-frequency analysis methods of the non-linear and non-stationary signals such as EEG. The proposed method is also computationally more effective comparing to the empirical mode decomposition. The SST filtering allows for online EEG preprocessing application which is essential in the case of BCI. Results: Experimental results with healthy BCI-naive users performing online tbcaBCI, validate the paradigm, while the feasibility of the concept is illuminated through information transfer rate case studies. Comparison with existing method(s): We present a comparison of the proposed SST-based preprocessing method, combined with a logistic regression (LR) classifier, together with classical preprocessing and LDA-based classification BCI techniques. Conclusions: The proposed tbcaBCI paradigm together with data-driven preprocessing methods are a step forward in robust BCI applications research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the modern world, morality is considered as the social capital, which determines a level of society well-being. Participants were showed 24 moral dilemma and 24 control task vignettes represented artist-sketched cartoons of control and dilemma scenarios. For all participants and every experimental condition, the model of localization equivalent dipoles electroencephalogram (EEG) components was made. Individual localization of EEG electrodes was matched with a model of localization of electrodes of head, which was used for determining the equivalent dipoles. Event-related spectral perturbations were calculated to estimate induced responses via the EEGLAB toolbox. The dataset was prepared for clustering by the original PCA method. The correction for multiple comparisons was made by the False Discovery Rate method. To determine the correlations cortical sources of EEG activity with Social Intellect, sLORETA was applied to the data. Differences between moral dilemmas and control tasks without moral choice were found in delta, theta, alpha and beta diapasons in clusters localized in temporal and frontal lobe. Social intellect positively correlated with difference between the test interval and the baseline during making moral dilemma choice in theta in the left middle temporal gyrus and beta in the left middle frontal gyrus.

DEVELOPMENTAL ALTERATIONS IN NOXIOUS-EVOKED EEG ACTIVITY RECORDED FROM RAT PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; nociception; somatosensory cortex; pain; development	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; DEPENDENT CHANGES; BARREL CORTEX; DORSAL-HORN; PAIN; BRAIN; STIMULATION; FREQUENCY; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS	Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contains a nociceptive map that localizes potential tissue damage on the body and encodes stimulus intensity. An objective and specific biomarker of pain however is currently lacking and is urgently required for use in non-verbal clinical populations as well as in the validation of pre-clinical pain models. Here we describe studies to see if the responses of the S1 in juvenile rats are different to those in the adult. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) responses from S1 of lightly-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats at either postnatal day 21 or postnatal day 40 during the presentation of noxious (55 degrees C) or innocuous (30 degrees C) thermal stimuli applied to the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. The total EEG power across the recording period was the same in both ages after stimulation but the frequency distribution was significantly affected by age. Noxious heat evoked a significant increase in theta band (4-8 Hz) activity in adults only (P < 0.0001 compared to baseline; P < 0.0001 compared to juveniles). There were no significant differences in EEG responses to innocuous thermal stimuli. These data show that there are significant alterations in the processing of nociceptive inputs within the maturing cortex and that cortical theta activity is involved only in the adult cortical response to noxious stimulation.

Nonlinear dynamics of the patient's response to drug effect during general anesthesia	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Bispectral index; Depth of anesthesia; Drug delivery; Identification; Predictive control; Wavelet analysis	CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL; BISPECTRAL INDEX; PROPOFOL; PHARMACODYNAMICS; REMIFENTANIL; MODEL; PHARMACOKINETICS; SYSTEM; AGE	In today's healthcare paradigm, optimal sedation during anesthesia plays an important role both in patient welfare and in the socio-economic context. For the closed-loop control of general anesthesia, two drugs have proven to have stable, rapid onset times: propofol and remifentanil. These drugs are related to their effect in the bispectral index, a measure of EEG signal. In this paper wavelet time-frequency analysis is used to extract useful information from the clinical signals, since they are time-varying and mark important changes in patient's response to drug dose. Model based predictive control algorithms are employed to regulate the depth of sedation by manipulating these two drugs. The results of identification from real data and the simulation of the closed loop control performance suggest that the proposed approach can bring an improvement of 9% in overall robustness and may be suitable for clinical practice.

J	Bastiaansen, M; Hagoort, P				Bastiaansen, Marcel; Hagoort, Peter			Frequency-based Segregation of Syntactic and Semantic Unification during Online Sentence Level Language Comprehension	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG; NEUROBIOLOGY; INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONY; RETRIEVAL; DYNAMICS; MEMORY	During sentence level language comprehension, semantic and syntactic unification are functionally distinct operations. Nevertheless, both recruit roughly the same brain areas (spatially overlapping networks in the left frontotemporal cortex) and happen at the same time (in the first few hundred milliseconds after word onset). We tested the hypothesis that semantic and syntactic unification are segregated by means of neuronal synchronization of the functionally relevant networks in different frequency ranges: gamma (40 Hz and up) for semantic unification and lower beta (10-20 Hz) for syntactic unification. EEG power changes were quantified as participants read either correct sentences, syntactically correct though meaningless sentences (syntactic prose), or sentences that did not contain any syntactic structure (random word lists). Other sentences contained either a semantic anomaly or a syntactic violation at a critical word in the sentence. Larger EEG gamma-band power was observed for semantically coherent than for semantically anomalous sentences. Similarly, beta-band power was larger for syntactically correct sentences than for incorrect ones. These results confirm the existence of a functional dissociation in EEG oscillatory dynamics during sentence level language comprehension that is compatible with the notion of a frequency-based segregation of syntactic and semantic unification.

Ictal onset patterns in bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have not been comprehensively studied. A retrospective review of intracranial electrographic data was undertaken to establish whether it is possible to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy based on ictal onset patterns, including periodic preictal spiking. Methods. A total of 470 ictal onset patterns were analyzed by bitemporal extraoperative electrocorticography in 13 patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal onset patterns were categorized, by frequency, as type A (<12 Hz), type B (12-40 Hz) and type C (>40 Hz). Preictal rhythmic spiking, of at least five seconds duration, and time to contralateral propagation were also measured with each ictal event. We determined if the proportion of "ictal onset pattern frequencies" or "incidence of preictal spiking" differed between unilateral and bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results. Seven patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy received surgery and achieved Engel class I outcomes, while the remaining six did not undergo resective surgery, due to the bilateral ictal onsets in extraoperative electrocorticography. The proportion of patients experiencing any preictal spikes was higher in unitemporal than in bitemporal cases (100% vs 50%; p=0.069). Of the 470 ictal onset patterns analyzed (174 unitemporal and 296 bitemporal), a significant greater percentage of preictal spikes was found in unilateral cases (78% unitemporal vs 14% bitemporal; p=0.002). Low-frequency patterns were more evident in bitemporal cases (45%) than in unitemporal (10%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.129). No differences were detected between the unitemporal and bitemporal groups regarding age at onset or at presentation. Conclusion. A greater proportion of preictal spiking, based on extraoperative electrocorticography, was present in unilateral, compared to bilateral, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Further studies are warranted to determine the causal significance of preictal spiking in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

J	Schreiner, T; Lehmann, M; Rasch, B				Schreiner, Thomas; Lehmann, Mick; Rasch, Bjoern			Auditory feedback blocks memory benefits of cueing during sleep	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REACTIVATION; RECONSOLIDATION; REPLAY; CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; SPECIFICITY; RETRIEVAL; PATTERNS	It is now widely accepted that re-exposure to memory cues during sleep reactivates memories and can improve later recall. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. As reactivation during wakefulness renders memories sensitive to updating, it remains an intriguing question whether reactivated memories during sleep also become susceptible to incorporating further information after the cue. Here we show that the memory benefits of cueing Dutch vocabulary during sleep are in fact completely blocked when memory cues are directly followed by either correct or conflicting auditory feedback, or a pure tone. In addition, immediate (but not delayed) auditory stimulation abolishes the characteristic increases in oscillatory theta and spindle activity typically associated with successful reactivation during sleep as revealed by high-density electroencephalography. We conclude that plastic processes associated with theta and spindle oscillations occurring during a sensitive period immediately after the cue are necessary for stabilizing reactivated memory traces during sleep.

Moreover, the number of different analysis approaches is expanding along with the rising interest in this research area. The comparison between studies can therefore be challenging and discussion is needed to underscore methodological opportunities and pitfalls in functional connectivity and network studies. In this overview we discuss methodological considerations throughout the analysis pipeline of recording and analyzing resting state EEG and MEG data, with a focus on functional connectivity and network analysis. We summarize current common practices with their advantages and disadvantages; provide practical tips, and suggestions for future research. Finally, we discuss how methodological choices in resting state research can affect the construction of functional networks. When taking advantage of current best practices and avoid the most obvious pitfalls, functional connectivity and network studies can be improved and enable a more accurate interpretation and comparison between studies.

We sought to investigate EEG changes that occur during the transitional period from wakefulness to sleep in a 3-dimensional manner to gain a better understanding of the physiological meaning of sleep for the brain. We examined EEG 3-dimensionally using LORETA (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography), to localize the brain region associated with changes that occur during the sleep onset period (SOP). Thirty-channel EEG was recorded in 61 healthy subjects. EEG power spectra and intracortical standardized LORETA were compared between 4 types of 30-second states, including the wakeful stage, transition stage, early sleep stage 1, and late sleep stage 1. Sleep onset began with increased delta and theta power and decreased alpha-1 power in the occipital lobe, and increased theta power in the parietal lobe. Thereafter, global reductions of alpha-1 and alpha-2 powers and greater increases of theta power in the occipito-parietal lobe occurred. As sleep became deeper in sleep stage 1, beta-2 and beta-3, powers decreased mainly in the frontal lobe and some regions of the parieto-temporo-limbic area. These findings suggest that sleep onset includes at least 3 steps in a sequential manner, which include an increase in theta waves in the posterior region of the brain, a global decrease in alpha waves, and a decrease in beta waves in the fronto-central area.

J	Balconi, M; Pagani, S				Balconi, Michela; Pagani, Silvia			Social hierarchies and emotions: Cortical prefrontal activity, facial feedback (EMG), and cognitive performance in a dynamic interaction	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain oscillations; Social ranking; Nonverbal behavior; EEG; Emotions; EMG; Cognitive performance	FACE RECOGNITION; DOMINANCE; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; ASYMMETRY; CORTEX; POWER; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES	In the present research, we manipulated the perceived superior/inferior status during a competitive cognitive task. In two experiments, we created an explicit and strongly reinforced social hierarchy based on incidental rating on an attentional task. Based on our hypotheses, social rank may influence nonverbal cues (such as facial mimic related to emotional response), cortical lateralized activity in frontal areas (brain oscillations), and cognitive outcomes in response to rank modulation. Thus, the facial mimic (corrugators vs. zygomatic muscle activity), frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta), and real cognitive performance [(error rate (ER); response times (RTs)] were considered. Specifically, a peer-group comparison was enrolled and an improved (experiment 1, N=29) or decreased (experiment 2, N=31) performance was artificially manipulated by the experimenter. Results showed a significant improved cognitive performance (decreased ER and RTs), an increased zygomatic activity (positive emotions), and a more prefrontal left-lateralized cortical response in the case of a perceived increased social ranking. On the contrary, a significant decreased cognitive performance (increased ER and RTs), an increased corrugators activity (negative emotions), and a less left-lateralized cortical response were observed as a consequence of a perceived decreased social ranking. Moreover, the correlational values revealed a consistent trend between behavioral (RTs) and EMG and EEG measures for both experiments. The present results suggest that social status not only guides social behavior, but it also influences cognitive processes and subjects' performance.

Each brain state is represented as a point in a physiologically parametrized space. Overtime, changes in brain state cause these points to trace continuous trajectories, unlike the artificial discrete jumps in sleep stage that occur with traditional sleep staging. The discrete Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep stages are associated with regions in the physiological parameter space based on their electroencephalographic features, which enables interpretation of traditional sleep stages in terms of physiological trajectories. Wake states are found to be associated with strong positive corticothalamic feedback compared to sleep. The existence of physiologically valid trajectories between brain states in the model is demonstrated. Actual trajectories for an individual can be determined by fitting the model using EEG alone, and enable analysis of the physiological differences between subjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how epileptogenesis develops after FSs. The present study was designed to investigate acquired seizure susceptibility and analyze local field potentials during the latent period after FSs. We found that the seizure susceptibility decreased in 35-day-old (P35) FS rats but increased in P60 FS rats. Consistently, hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) power in every band was decreased at P35 but increased at P60 in FS rats. Our results provide direct evidence for hypoactivity but not hyperactivity during the early phase of the latent period, displaying a broad decrease in hippocampal rhythms. These characteristic EEG changes can be a useful biomarker for the early diagnosis of epileptogenesis induced by FSs.

This study explored EEG activity in the theta frequency band, previously shown to predict successful learning in adults, to directly study infants' cognitive engagement, beyond visual attention. We tested 11-month-old infants (N = 23) and demonstrated that differences in frontal theta-band oscillations, recorded during infants' object exploration, predicted differential subsequent recognition of these objects in a preferential-looking test. Given that theta activity is modulated by motivation to learn in adults, these findings set the ground for future investigation into the drivers of infant learning.

Joint coupling of awake EEG Frequency activity and MRI gray Matter Volumes in the Psychosis Dimension: a BSNIP study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; schizoaffective; psychotic bipolar; joint independent component analysis; endophenotypes; biomarkers; EEG; gray matter	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; BIPOLAR-SCHIZOPHRENIA NETWORK; PHENOTYPES B-SNIP; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; RESTING EEG; INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES; WORKING-MEMORY; 1ST EPISODE; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS	Background: Many studies have examined either electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency activity or gray matter volumes (GMV) in various psychoses [including schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective (SZA), and psychotic bipolar disorder (PBP)]. Prior work demonstrated similar EEG and gray matter abnormalities in both SZ and PBP. Integrating EEG and GMV and jointly analyzing the combined data fully elucidates the linkage between the two and may provide better biomarker-or endophenotype-specificity for a particular illness. Joint exploratory investigations of EEG and GMV are scarce in the literature and the relationship between the two in psychosis is even less explored. We investigated a joint multivariate model to test whether the linear relationship or linkage between awake EEG (AEEG) frequency activity and GMV is abnormal across the psychosis dimension and if such effects are also present in first-degree relatives. Methods: We assessed 607 subjects comprising 264 probands [105 SZ, 72 SZA, and 87 PBP], 233 of their first degree relatives [82 SZ relatives (SZR), 71 SZA relatives (SZAR), and 80 PBP relatives (PBPR)], and 110 healthy comparison subjects (HC). All subjects underwent structural MRI (sMRI) and EEG scans. Frequency activity and voxel-based morphometric GMV were derived from EEG and sMRI data, respectively. Seven AEEG frequency and gray matter components were extracted using Joint independent component analysis (jICA). The loading coefficients (LC) were examined for group differences using analysis of covariance. Further, the LCs were correlated with psychopathology scores to identify relationship with clinical symptoms. Results: Joint ICA revealed a single component differentiating SZ from HC (p < 0.006), comprising increased posterior alpha activity associated with decreased volume in inferior parietal lobe, supramarginal, parahippocampal gyrus, middle frontal, inferior temporal gyri, and increased volume of uncus and culmen. No components were aberrant in either PBP or SZA or any relative group. No significant association was identified with clinical symptom measures. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a joint EEG and GMV model yielded a biomarker specific to SZ, not abnormal in PBP or SZA. Alpha activity was related to both increased and decreased volume in different cortical structures. Additionally, the joint model failed to identify endophenotypes across psychotic disorders.

Nevertheless, the excessive and prolonged coupling among brain sites is relevant with disturbed information routing. In the present study we investigated the possibility that the sustained oscillatory states and the common mode in which several brain sites vary their functional connectivity inhibit the ability of the brain in perceiving and processing information. The hypothesis, that in many interacting systems, greater regularity-rhythmicity corresponds to grater component self-organization and isolation, is investigated in the case of thought blocks (under persistent auditory verbal hallucinations) and epileptic absences (under spike wave discharges). Our findings indicate that the observed common mode of coupling significantly restrains the normal flow of mental processes. This erroneous "connectivity mode" in the presence of symptoms such as thought blocks and absences respectively, was found to eliminate the spontaneous synchrony variability, essentially needed for the information processing, by fixating the functional specificity of the respected brain sites.

Conditional Granger causality and partitioned Granger causality: differences and similarities	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Conditional Granger causality (cGC); Partitioned Granger causality (pGC); Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model		Neural information modeling and analysis often requires a measurement of the mutual influence among many signals. A common technique is the conditional Granger causality (cGC) which measures the influence of one time series on another time series in the presence of a third. Geweke has translated this condition into the frequency domain and has explored the mathematical relationships between the time and frequency domain expressions. Chen has observed that in practice, the expressions may return (meaningless) negative numbers, and has proposed an alternative which is based on a partitioned matrix scheme, which we call partitioned Granger causality (pGC). There has been some confusion in the literature about the relationship between cGC and pGC; some authors treat them as essentially identical measures, while others have noted that some properties (such as the relationship between the time and frequency domain expressions) do not hold for the pGC. This paper presents a series of matrix equalities that simplify the calculation of the pGC. In this simplified expression, the essential differences and similarities between the cGC and the pGC become clear; in essence, the pGC is dependent on only a subset of the parameters in the model estimation, and the noise residuals (which are uncorrelated in the cGC) need not be uncorrelated in the pGC. The mathematical results are illustrated with a simulation, and the measures are applied to an EEG dataset.

While the evoked response is given by peaks and troughs in the signal, time-locked and phase-locked to the stimuli, the induced response is time- but not phase-locked, and can be considered as an increase or a decrease in the power of EEG in a specific frequency band at a specific time range with regard to the stimulus onset. The induced response does not have the same phase following successive stimuli. It is believed that cognition and perception of a stimulus present themselves primarily as the induced response in the EEG. In this paper, the induced response of the brain to auditory speech stimuli is investigated and different approaches to detect induced activity are compared. It is shown that there is an increase in theta and delta power in response to words compared to the baseline, starting around 500 ms after their onset. During this time, there is also an increase in pairwise coherence between the posterior electrodes. In response to tone bursts, a change in pairwise coherence was observed in the beta band starting around 200 ms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such responses have been described using simple protocols without complex stimulus manipulations being involved. Responses in the EEG to speech rather than the more conventional tone-bursts or clicks suggests that it may be feasible to use the EEG as an objective means to demonstrate brain activation to salient real world stimuli. This would be of particular benefit in investigating access to speech in patients who are unable or unwilling to reliably respond to conventional subjective experimental protocols, such as infants.

Recent evidence implicates posterior parietal areas, in addition to lower-level sensory processing regions, in the neurobiological mechanisms involved in synesthesia. Furthermore, these mechanisms seem to differ for projectors (synesthetes who report seeing the color out there in the real world) versus associators (synesthetes who report the color to be only an internal experience). Relatively little is known about possible electrophysiological characteristics of grapheme-color synesthesia. Here we used EEG to investigate functional oscillatory differences among associators, projectors, and non-synesthetes. Projectors had stronger stimulus-related alpha-band (similar to 10Hz) power over posterior parietal electrodes, compared to both associators and non-synesthetes. Posterior alpha activity was not statistically significantly different between associators from non-synesthetes. We also performed a test-retest assessment of the projector-associator score and found strong retest reliability, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient of .85. These findings demonstrate that the projector-associator distinction is highly reliable over time and is related to neural oscillations in the alpha band.

Fast Oscillatory Commands from the Motor Cortex Can Be Decoded by the Spinal Cord for Force Control	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						conductance-based model; cortical oscillation; force control; motoneuron; motor control; simulation	EFFECTIVE CORTICOSPINAL INTERACTION; TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; PRECISION GRIP TASK; EEG-EMG COHERENCE; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MUSCLE FORCE; VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS; ISOMETRIC COMPENSATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGE PROPERTIES	Oscillations in the beta and gamma bands (13-30 Hz; 35-70 Hz) have often been observed in motor cortical outputs that reach the spinal cord, acting on motoneurons and interneurons. However, the frequencies of these oscillations are above the muscle force frequency range. A current view is that the transformation of the motoneuron pool inputs into force is linear. For this reason possible roles for these oscillations are unclear, since if this transformation is linear, the high frequencies in the motoneuron inputs (e.g., 20 Hz from pyramidal tract neurons) would be filtered out by the muscle and have no effect on force control. A biologically inspired mathematical model of the neuromuscular system was used to investigate the impact of high-frequency cortical oscillatory activity on force control. The model simulation results evidenced that a typical motoneuron pool has a nonlinear behavior that enables the decoding of a high-frequency oscillatory input. An input at a single frequency (e.g., beta band) leads to an increase in the steady-state force generated by the muscle. When the input oscillation was amplitude modulated at a given low frequency, the force oscillated at this frequency. In both cases, the mechanism relies on the recruitment and derecruitment of motor units in response to the oscillatory descending drive. Therefore, the results from this study suggest a potential role in force control for cortical oscillations at frequencies at or above the beta band, despite the low-pass behavior of the muscles.

Although clinically highly relevant, the neural mechanisms underlying placebo anxiolysis are poorly understood. In two studies in humans, we tested whether the administration of an inactive treatment along with verbal suggestions of anxiolysis can attenuate experimentally induced states of phasic fear and/or sustained anxiety. Phasic fear is the response to a well defined threat and includes attentional focusing on the source of threat and concomitant phasic increases of autonomic arousal, whereas in sustained states of anxiety potential and unclear danger requires vigilant scanning of the environment and elevated tonic arousal levels. Our placebo manipulation consistently reduced vigilance measured in terms of undifferentiated reactivity to salient cues (indexed by subjective ratings, skin conductance responses and EEG event-related potentials) and tonic arousal [indexed by cue-unrelated skin conductance levels and enhanced EEG alpha (8 - 12 Hz) activity], indicating a downregulation of sustained anxiety rather than phasic fear. We also observed a placebo-dependent sustained increase of frontal midline EEG theta (4 - 7 Hz) power and frontoposterior theta coupling, suggesting the recruitment of frontally based cognitive control functions. Our results thus support the crucial role of treatment expectations in placebo anxiolysis and provide insight into the underlying neural mechanisms.	[Meyer, Benjamin; Yuen, Kenneth S.

J	Zaretskaya, N; Bartels, A				Zaretskaya, Natalia; Bartels, Andreas			Gestalt perception is associated with reduced parietal beta oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; EEG; Oscillations; Gestalt; Parietal cortex	BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; DOMINANCE DURATIONS; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; CORTICAL NETWORKS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG-DATA	The ability to perceive composite objects as a whole is fundamental for visual perception in a complex and cluttered natural environment. This ability may be mediated by increased communication between neural representations of distinct object elements, and has been linked to increased synchronization of oscillatory brain activity in the gamma band. Previous studies of perceptual grouping either guided attention between local and global aspects of a given stimulus or manipulated its physical properties to achieve grouped and ungrouped perceptual conditions. In contrast to those studies, we fully matched the physical properties underlying global and local percepts using a bistable stimulus that causes the viewer to perceive either local motion of multiple elements or global motion of two illusory shapes without any external change. To test the synchronization hypothesis we recorded brain activity with EEG, while human participants viewed the stimulus and reported changes in their perception. In contrast to previous findings we show that power of the beta-band was lower during perception of global Gestalt than during that of local elements. Source localization places these differences in the posterior parietal cortex, overlapping with a site previously associated with both attention and Gestalt perception. These findings reveal a role of parietal beta-band activity in internally, rather than externally or attention-driven processes of Gestalt perception. They also add to the growing evidence for shared neural substrates of attention and Gestalt perception, both being linked to parietal cortex. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show an elevated grip force in dynamic object handling, but temporal aspects of anticipatory grip force control are relatively preserved. In PD patients, beta frequency oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is suppressed prior to externally paced movements. However, the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anticipatory grip force control is not known. Methods: After implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the STN, PD patients performed adaptive and voluntary grip force tasks, while we recorded subthalamic local field potentials (LFP) and scalp EEG. Results: During adaptive grip force control (Shake), we found event related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band, which was time-locked to the grip force. In contrast, during voluntary grip force control (Press) we recorded a biphasic ERD, corresponding to peak grip force and grip force release. Beta synchronization between STN and cortical EEG was reduced during adaptive grip force control. Conclusion: The time-locked suppression of beta oscillatory activity in the STN is in linewith previous reports of beta ERD prior to voluntarymovements. Our results show that the STN is involved in anticipatory grip force control in PD patients. The difference in the phasic beta ERD between the two tasks and the reduction of cortico-subthalamic synchronization suggests that qualitatively different neuronal network states are involved in different grip force control tasks.

However, the way in which tremor is represented in the output of the spinal cord circuitries is largely unknown because of the difficulties in identifying the behavior of individual motor units from tremulous muscles. By using novel methods for the decomposition of multichannel surface EMG, we provide a systematic analysis of the discharge properties of motor units in nine ET patients, with concurrent recordings of EEG activity. This analysis allowed us to infer the contribution of common synaptic inputs to motor neurons in ET. Motor unit short-term synchronization was significantly greater in ET patients than in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the strong association between the degree of synchronization and the peak in coherence between motor unit spike trains at the tremor frequency indicated that the high synchronization levels were generated mainly by common synaptic inputs specifically at the tremor frequency. The coherence between EEG and motor unit spike trains demonstrated the presence of common cortical input to the motor neurons at the tremor frequency. Nonetheless, the strength of this input was uncorrelated to the net common synaptic input at the tremor frequency, suggesting a contribution of spinal afferents or secondary supraspinal pathways in projecting common input at the tremor frequency. These results provide the first systematic analysis of the neural drive to the muscle in ET and elucidate some of its characteristics that determine pathological tremulous muscle activity.

Interaction of synchronized dynamics in cortex and basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; LFP; subthalamic nucleus; synchronization	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; COHERENCE; MOVEMENT; NETWORKS	Parkinson's disease pathophysiology is marked by increased oscillatory and synchronous activity in the beta frequency band in cortical and basal ganglia circuits. This study explores the functional connections between synchronized dynamics of cortical areas and synchronized dynamics of subcortical areas in Parkinson's disease. We simultaneously recorded neuronal units (spikes) and local field potentials (LFP) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the scalp in parkinsonian patients, and analysed the correlation between the time courses of the spike-LFP synchronization and inter-electrode EEG synchronization. We found the (non-invasively obtained) time course of the synchrony strength between EEG electrodes and the (invasively obtained) time course of the synchrony between spiking units and LFP in STN to be weakly, but significantly, correlated with each other. This correlation is largest for the bilateral motor EEG synchronization, followed by bilateral frontal EEG synchronization. Our observations suggest that there may be multiple functional modes by which the cortical and basal ganglia circuits interact with each other in Parkinson's disease: not only may synchronization be observed between some areas in cortex and the basal ganglia, but also synchronization within cortex and within basal ganglia may be related, suggesting potentially a more global functional interaction. More coherent dynamics in one brain region may modulate or activate the dynamics of another brain region in a more powerful way, causing correlations between changes in synchrony strength in the two regions.

Cortical delta activity reflects reward prediction error and related behavioral adjustments, but at different times	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Prediction error; Delta; Reward positivity; Reinforcement learning; Decision making; Hierarchy	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; DECISION-MAKING; EEG DYNAMICS; MODEL; DOPAMINE; UNCERTAINTY; ADAPTATION	Recent work has suggested that reward prediction errors elicit a positive voltage deflection in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG); an event sometimes termed a reward positivity. However, a strong test of this proposed relationship remains to be defined. Other important questions remain unaddressed: such as the role of the reward positivity in predicting future behavioral adjustments that maximize reward. To answer these questions, a three-armed bandit task was used to investigate the role of positive prediction errors during trial-by-trial exploration and task-set based exploitation. The feedback-locked reward positivity was characterized by delta band activities, and these related EEG features scaled with the degree of a computationally derived positive prediction error. However, these phenomena were also dissociated: the computational model predicted exploitative action selection and related response time speeding whereas the feedback-locked EEG features did not. Compellingly, delta band dynamics time-locked to the subsequent bandit (the P3) successfully predicted these behaviors. These bandit-locked findings included an enhanced parietal to motor cortex delta phase lag that correlated with the degree of response time speeding, suggesting a mechanistic role for delta band activities in motivating action selection. This dissociation in feedback vs. bandit locked EEG signals is interpreted as a differentiation in hierarchically distinct types of prediction error, yielding novel predictions about these dissociable delta band phenomena during reinforcement learning and decision making.

Specifically, 32 healthy subjects (16 females) interacted with a haptic device able to convey caress-like stimuli while varying force and velocity of the device itself. More specifically, 2 values of force (i.e., "strength of the caress") and 3 velocity levels (i.e. "velocity of the caress") were combined to control the device during the experiment. Subjects were also asked to self-assess the haptic stimuli in terms of arousal (activation/ deactivation) and valence (pleasure/displeasure) scores. Results, shown in terms of p-values topographic maps, revealed a suppression of the oscillations over the controlateral somatosensory cortex, during caresses performed with the lowest force (2N) and the highest velocity (65 mm/s).This occurred in all of the frequency bands considered, alpha, beta, and gamma. Lower velocities (9.4 mm/s and 37 mm/s) did not significantly modify EEG reactivity in such bands. Concerning caresses administered at high force (6N), there was a significant decrease of EEG oscillatory activity focused on mid-frontal electrodes, in all of the considered frequency bands, when the velocity of the caresses was the lowest one. Significant sparse decrease of EEG power spectra, in all of the considered frequency bands, occurred at higher strength and velocity of the caress.

One of the most replicated EEG findings in MDD is resting frontal asymmetry in the alpha band (FAA), which is thought to be a correlate of withdrawal behavior and reduced approach motivation. The purpose of this study was to assess psychomotor alterations, alpha band power, FAA and investigate the association between them. Methods: 20 MDD patients and 19 healthy subjects were enrolled. Alpha power and FAA scores were calculated from a resting state EEG. Wrist actigraphy was recorded from the non-dominant arm for 24 h and activity level scores (AL) were extrapolated from the wakeful periods. Results: MDD patients had a left-lateralized frontal alpha activity and lower AL scores when compared to healthy subjects. A significant correlation was found between mean FAA and AL scores. A negative covariance between power in the lower alpha range and AL scores over the motor cortex bilaterally was detected. Limitations: Relatively small sample size. Patients were pharmacologically treated with antidepressants. Conclusions: This study replicates the Finding of left-lateralized FAA and lower AL scores in MDD patients, and establishes the first evidence of significant correlations between alpha power. FAA scores and measures of motor activity, which may be interpreted as an expression of impaired motivational drive in MDD. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both experimental (EG) and age-and skill-matched control group (CG) consisted of eighteen athletes (ten males and eight females). After 7-month training EG demonstrated changes in the amplitude of mean electrical activity of the EEG alpha bend at rest and an improvement was significantly changing and an improvement in almost all components of Kraepelin test. The same examined variables in CG were unchanged following the period without the intervention. Summing up, combining audio-visual relaxation with autogenic training significantly improves athlete's ability to perform a prolonged mental effort. These changes are accompanied by greater amplitude of waves in alpha band in the state of relax. The results suggest usefulness of relaxation techniques during performance of mentally difficult sports tasks (sports based on speed and stamina, sports games, combat sports) and during relax of athletes.

Seizure outcome of resective surgery for focal seizures associated with focal lesions is satisfactory. Particularly for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, surgical treatment should be considered from the earlier stage of the disease. Meanwhile, surgical outcome in nonlesional extratemporal lobe epilepsy is still to be improved using various approaches. Disconnective surgeries reduce surgical complications of extensive resections while achieving equivalent or better seizure outcomes. Multiple subpial transection is still being modified expecting a better outcome by transection to the vertical cortices along the sulci- and multi-directional transection from a single entry point. Hippocampal transection is expected to preserve memory function while interrupting the abnormal epileptic synchronization. Proper selection or combination of subdural and depth electrodes and a wide-band analysis of electroencephalography may improve the accurate localization of epileptogenic region. Patients for whom curative resective surgery is not indicated because of generalized or bilateral multiple nature of their epilepsies, neuromodulation therapies are options of treatment which palliate their seizures.

Although the mechanisms of cognitive impairment are not completely understood, we make an attempt to describe, from a systems perspective, how information processing is affected in epilepsy disorders. The aim of this review is to (1) define the nature of cognitive deficits associated with epilepsy, (2) review fundamental systems-level mechanisms underlying information processing, and (3) describe how information processing is dysfunctional in epilepsy and investigate the relative contributions of etiology, seizures, and interictal discharges (IDs). We conclude that these mechanisms are likely to be important and deserve more detailed scrutiny in the future.

Forecasting Seizures Using Intracranial EEG Measures and SVM in Naturally Occurring Canine Epilepsy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; PREICTAL STATE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY; ANIMAL-MODELS; DOGS; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Management of drug resistant focal epilepsy would be greatly assisted by a reliable warning system capable of alerting patients prior to seizures to allow the patient to adjust activities or medication. Such a system requires successful identification of a preictal, or seizure-prone state. Identification of preictal states in continuous long-duration intracranial electroenceph-alographic (iEEG) recordings of dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy was investigated using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The dogs studied were implanted with a 16-channel ambulatory iEEG recording device with average channel reference for a mean (st. dev.) of 380.4 (+87.5) days producing 220.2 (+104.1) days of intracranial EEG recorded at 400 Hz for analysis. The iEEG records had 51.6 (+52.8) seizures identified, of which 35.8 (+30.4) seizures were preceded by more than 4 hours of seizure-free data. Recorded iEEG data were stratified into 11 contiguous, non-overlapping frequency bands and binned into one-minute synchrony features for analysis. Performance of the SVM classifier was assessed using a 5-fold cross validation approach, where preictal training data were taken from 90 minute windows with a 5 minute pre-seizure offset. Analysis of the optimal preictal training time was performed by repeating the cross validation over a range of preictal windows and comparing results. We show that the optimization of feature selection varies for each subject, i.e. algorithms are subject specific, but achieve prediction performance significantly better than a time-matched Poisson random predictor (p<0.05) in 5/5 dogs analyzed.

Here we investigated the neural oscillatory patterns associated with perceiving native, foreign, and unknown speech. Spectral power and phase synchronization were compared to those of a silent context. Power synchronization to native speech was found in frequency ranges corresponding to the theta band, while no synchronization patterns were found for the foreign speech context and the unknown language context. For phase synchrony, the native and unknown languages showed higher synchronization in the theta-band than the foreign language when compared to the silent condition. These results suggest that neural synchronization patterns are markedly different for native and foreign languages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Several studies have reported strictly additive effects of these 2 variables. Predictability also reliably influences the amplitude of the N400 component in event-related potential studies, However, previous research suggests that while :frequency affects the N400 in single-word tasks, it may have little or no effect on the N400 when a word is presented with a preceding sentence context. The present study assessed this apparent dissociation between the results from the 2 methods using a coregistration paradigm in which the frequency and predictability of a target word were manipulated while readers' eye movements and electroencephalograms were simultaneously recorded. We replicated the pattern of significant, and additive; effects of the 2 manipulations on eye fixation durations. We also replicated the predictability effect on the N400, time-locked to the onset of the reader's :first fixation on the target word. However there was no indication of a frequency effect in the electroencephalogram record. We suggest that this pattern has implications both for the interpretation of the N400 and for the interpretation of frequency and predictability effects in language comprehension.

Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of the developing ASD cortex, examples of physiological brain lateralization in young children with ASD have yet to be well examined. MethodsThirty-eight boys with ASD (aged 3-7 years) and 38 typically developing (TD) boys (aged 3-8 years) concentrated on video programs and their brain activities were measured non-invasively. We employed a customized child-sized magnetoencephalography system in which the sensors were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in young children. To produce a credible laterality index of the brain oscillations, we defined two clusters of sensors corresponding to the right and left hemispheres. We focused on the laterality index ([left - right]/[left+right]) of the relative power band in seven frequency bands. ResultsThe TD group displayed significantly rightward lateralized brain oscillations in the theta-1 frequency bands compared to the ASD group. ConclusionsThis is the first study to demonstrate unusual brain lateralization of brain oscillations measured by magnetoencephalography in young children with ASD.

Coherent neural oscillations predict future motor and language improvement after stroke	BRAIN			English	Article						plasticity; aphasia; cerebral infarction; stroke: imaging; clinical neurophysiology	UPPER-LIMB RECOVERY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BRAIN; REORGANIZATION; NETWORKS; PLASTICITY; MECHANISMS; IMAGERY	Recent findings have demonstrated that stroke lesions affect neural communication in the entire brain. However, it is less clear whether network interactions are also relevant for plasticity and repair. This study investigated whether the coherence of neural oscillations at language or motor nodes is associated with future clinical improvement. Twenty-four stroke patients underwent high-density EEG recordings and standardized motor and language tests at 2-3 weeks (T0) and 3 months (T1) after stroke onset. In addition, EEG and motor assessments were obtained from a second population of 18 stroke patients. The graph theoretical measure of weighted node degree at language and motor areas was computed as the sum of absolute imaginary coherence with all other brain regions and compared to the amount of clinical improvement from T0 to T1. At T0, beta-band weighted node degree at the ipsilesional motor cortex was linearly correlated with better subsequent motor improvement, while beta-band weighted node degree at Broca's area was correlated with better language improvement. Clinical recovery was further associated with contralesional theta-band weighted node degree. These correlations were each specific to the corresponding brain area and independent of initial clinical severity, age, and lesion size. Findings were reproduced in the second stroke group. Conversely, later coherence increases occurring between T0 and T1 were associated with less clinical improvement. Improvement of language and motor functions after stroke is therefore associated with inter-regional synchronization of neural oscillations in the first weeks after stroke. A better understanding of network mechanisms of plasticity may lead to new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Mapping the coherence of ictal high frequency oscillations in human extratemporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Coherence	NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; 80-500 HZ; RESECTION; BRAIN; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; CHILDREN	Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have recently been recorded in epilepsy patients and proposed as possible novel biomarkers of epileptogenicity. Investigation of additional HFO characteristics that correlate with the clinical manifestation of seizures may yield additional insights for delineating epileptogenic regions. To that end, this study examined the spatiotemporal coherence patterns of HFOs (80-400 Hz) so as to characterize the strength of HFO interactions in the epileptic brain. We hypothesized that regions of strong HFO coherence identified epileptogenic networks believed to possess a pathologic locking nature in relation to regular brain activity. Methods: We applied wavelet phase coherence analysis to the intracranial EEG (iEEG)s of patients (n = 5) undergoing presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). We have also computed HFO intensity (related to the square-root of the power), to study the relationship between HFO amplitude and coherence. Results: Strong HFO (80-270 Hz) coherence was observed in a consistent and spatially focused channel cluster during seizures in four of five patients. Furthermore, cortical regions possessing strong ictal HFO coherence coincided with regions exhibiting high ictal HFO intensity, relative to all other channels. Significance: Because HFOs have been shown to localize to the epileptogenic zone, and we have demonstrated a correlation between ictal HFO intensity and coherence, we propose that ictal HFO coherence can act as an epilepsy biomarker. Moreover, the seizures studied here showed strong spatial correlation of ictal HFO coherence and intensity in the 80-270 Hz frequency range, suggesting that this band may be targeted when defining seizure-related regions of interest for characterizing ETLE.

Despite all these efforts, the function and the neuronal mechanisms behind slow cortical rhythms remain only partially understood. In this review we will provide an overview of the techniques available for the in vivo study of slow cortical oscillations in animal models. Our goal is to provide an up to date resource for the selection of the best experimental strategies to study specific aspects of slow oscillations. We will cover both traditional, population-level electrophysiological approaches (EEG, local field potentials) as well as more recent techniques, such as two photon calcium imaging and optogenetics. Overall, we believe that new breakthrough in our understanding of slow cortical rhythms will require the integration of different techniques, to bridge the gap between different spatio-temporal scales and go from a correlative to a causal level of analysis.

Increased Stimulus Expectancy Triggers Low-frequency Phase Reset during Restricted Vigilance	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL EXPECTATION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; CROSSMODAL BINDING; VISUAL RESPONSES; ENTRAINMENT; SPEECH; CORTEX; EEG	Temporal cues can be used to selectively attend to relevant information during abundant sensory stimulation. However, such cues differ vastly in the accuracy of their temporal estimates, ranging from very predictable to very unpredictable. When cues are strongly predictable, attention may facilitate selective processing by aligning relevant incoming information to high neuronal excitability phases of ongoing low-frequency oscillations. However, top-down effects on ongoing oscillations when temporal cues have some predictability, but also contain temporal uncertainties, are unknown. Here, we experimentally created such a situation of mixed predictability and uncertainty: A target could occur within a limited time window after cue but was always unpredictable in exact timing. Crucially to assess top-down effects in such a mixed situation, we manipulated target probability. High target likelihood, compared with low likelihood, enhanced delta oscillations more strongly as measured by evoked power and intertrial coherence. Moreover, delta phase modulated detection rates for probable targets. The delta frequency range corresponds with half-a-period to the target occurrence window and therefore suggests that low-frequency phase reset is engaged to produce a long window of high excitability when event timing is uncertain within a restricted temporal window.

In addition to medical treatment, non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a therapeutic technique to improve the functional state of the brain. Although during the last years tACS was applied in numerous studies to improve motor, somatosensory, visual and higher order cognitive functions, our knowledge is still limited regarding the mechanisms as to which type of ACS can affect cortical functions and altered neuronal oscillations seem to be the key mechanism. Because alternating current send pulses to the brain at predetermined frequencies, the online- and after-effects of ACS strongly depend on the stimulation parameters so that "optimal" ACS paradigms could be achieved. This is of interest not only for neuroscience research but also for clinical practice. In this study, we summarize recent findings on ACS effects under both normal conditions and in brain diseases.

In the present study we investigate what kind of physiological process might be responsible for inducing an evoked traveling wave. We used a semantic judgment task which already proved useful to study evoked traveling alpha waves that coincide with the appearance of the P1 component. We found that the P1 latency of the leading electrode is significantly correlated with prestimulus amplitude size and that this event is associated with a transient change in alpha frequency. We assume that cortical background excitability, as reflected by an increase in prestimulus amplitude, is responsible for the observed change in alpha frequency and the initiation of an evoked traveling trajectory.

Here, we manipulated whether repetitions were massed (consecutive) or distributed (intermixed) and measured event-related potentials and oscillatory activity, investigating the question of whether there is evidence of spontaneous episodic retrieval for distributed, but not massed, repetition. Results showed that distributed repetition uniquely prompted a significant centroparietal old-new effect as well as enhanced theta, compared to either novel presentations or massed repetitions, consistent with a hypothesis of spontaneous retrieval. Massed repetition, on the other hand, prompted repetition suppression and reduction of the N2/P2. Taken together, the data suggest that distributed repetition may facilitate later memory performance because it spontaneously retrieves prior representations.

The essence of SSVEP recognition is to recognize the frequency component of target stimulus focused by a subject significantly present in EEG spectrum. New method: In this paper, a novel statistical approach based on sequence detection (SD) is proposed for improving the performance of SSVEP recognition. This method uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA) coefficients to observe SSVEP signal sequence. And then, a threshold strategy is utilized for SSVEP recognition. Results: The result showed the classification performance with the longer duration of time window achieved the higher accuracy for most subjects. And the average time costing per trial was lower than the predefined recognition time. It was implicated that our approach could improve the speed of BCI system in contrast to other methods. Comparison with existing method(s): In comparison with other resultful algorithms, experimental accuracy of SD approach was better than those using a widely used CCA-based method and two newly proposed algorithms, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) recognition model as well as multivariate synchronization index (MSI) method. Furthermore, the information transfer rate (ITR) obtained by SD approach was higher than those using other three methods for most participants. Conclusions: These conclusions demonstrated that our proposed method was promising for a highspeed online BCI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the neural oscillations underlying occurrence of the interference in different levels have not been understood well. Here, we reveal such a neural oscillation modulation by combining a 4:2 mapping design (two targets are mapped into one response key) with a practice paradigm (pretest, practice, and posttest) when healthy human participants were performing a novel color word flanker task. Response time (RI) results revealed constant stimulus conflict (SC, stimulus incongruent minus congruent, SI-CO) but increased response conflict (RC, response incongruent minus stimulus incongruent, RI-SI) with practice. Event-related potential (ERP) results demonstrated stable P3 amplitude differences for the SI-CO in the centro-parietal region across practice, which may reflect maintenance of the stimulus processing: and significantly larger P3 amplitudes in the same region for the RI relative to SI trial type in posttest, which may reflect inhibition of the distraction response. Further, neural oscillatory results showed that with practice, the lower alpha band in the frontal region and the upper alpha band in the occipital-parietal region distinguished between stimulus- and response-conflicts, respectively, suggesting that practice reduces the alertness (sensitiveness) of the brain to conflict occurrence, and enhances stimulus response associations.

We applied a novel task paradigm consisting of flanker stimuli presented within an n-back task and studied the interaction between inhibitory demands and load on WM updating using behavioral measures, EEG, and pupil dilation. In contrast to studies that examine the interaction between inhibitory demands and load on WM storage components, the current task paradigm allowed testing the interaction between the executive WM components updating and inhibition. We found a reduced flanker interference effect for the highest (2-back) updating load condition compared to lower updating load conditions on most measures. We interpret these findings as indicating that inhibitory control and WM updating are closely intertwined executive functions. Increased load on updating seemed to result in an overall more activated attentional network thus enhancing inhibitory control, such that task performance is less susceptible to distracting information.

Support Vector Machines Using EEG Features of Cross-Frequency Coupling Can Predict Treatment Outcome in Mecp2-Deficient Mice	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			MOUSE MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; MECP2	Anti-convulsive drug treatments of epilepsy typically produce varied outcomes from one patient to the next, often necessitating patients to go through several anticonvulsive drug trials until an appropriate treatment is found. The focus of this study is to predict treatment outcome using a priori electroencephalogram (EEG) features for a rare genetic model of epilepsy seen in patients with Rett Syndrome. Previous work on Mecp2-deficient mice, exhibiting the symptoms of Rett syndrome, have revealed EEG-based biomarkers that track the pathology well. Specifically the presence of cross-frequency coupling of the delta-like (3-6 Hz) frequency range phase with the fast ripple (400 - 600 Hz) frequency range amplitude in long duration discharges was found to track seizure pathology. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained with features generated from phase-amplitude comodulograms and tested on (n=6) Mecp2-deficient mice to predict treatment outcome to Midazolam, a commonly used anti-convulsive drug. Using SVMs it was shown that it is possible to generate a likelihood score to predict treatment outcomes on all of the animal subjects. Identifying the most appropriate treatment a priori would potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes.

Cortical processes associated with continuous balance control as revealed by EEG spectral power	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Balance; EEG; Postural control; Theta; Error detection	MODULATION; RESPONSES; CORTEX; THETA	Balance is a crucial component in numerous every day activities such as locomotion. Previous research has reported distinct changes in cortical theta activity during transient balance instability. However, there remains little understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying continuous balance control. This study aimed to investigate cortical theta activity during varying difficulties of continuous balance tasks, as well as examining the relationship between theta activity and balance performance. 37 subjects completed nine balance tasks with different levels of surface stability and base of support. Throughout the balancing task, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 32 scalp locations. ICA-based artifact rejection was applied and spectral power was analyzed in the theta frequency band. Theta power increased in the frontal, central, and parietal regions of the cortex when balance tasks became more challenging. In addition, fronto-central and centro-parietal theta power correlated with balance performance. This study demonstrates the involvement of the cerebral cortex in maintaining upright posture during continuous balance tasks. Specifically, the results emphasize the important role of frontal and parietal theta oscillations in balance control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-robot interface; brain-machine interface; brain-computer interface; resting state network; work load; neurorehabilitation; neurofeedback	ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC BIOFEEDBACK; STROKE; EEG; BCI; SOFTWARE	Objective. Novel rehabilitation strategies apply robot-assisted exercises and neurofeedback tasks to facilitate intensive motor training. We aimed to disentangle task-specific and subject-related contributions to the perceived workload of these interventions and the related cortical activation patterns. Approach. We assessed the perceived workload with the NASA Task Load Index in twenty-one subjects who were exposed to two different feedback tasks in a cross-over design: (i) brain-robot interface (BRI) with haptic/proprioceptive feedback of sensorimotor oscillations related to motor imagery, and (ii) control of neuromuscular activity with feedback of the electromyography (EMG) of the same hand. We also used electroencephalography to examine the cortical activation patterns beforehand in resting state and during the training session of each task. Main results. The workload profile of BRI feedback differed from EMG feedback and was particularly characterized by the experience of frustration. The frustration level was highly correlated across tasks, suggesting subject-related relevance of this workload component. Those subjects who were specifically challenged by the respective tasks could be detected by an interhemispheric alpha-band network in resting state before the training and by their sensorimotor theta-band activation pattern during the exercise. Significance. Neurophysiological profiles in resting state and during the exercise may provide task-independent workload markers for monitoring and matching participants' ability and task difficulty of neurofeedback interventions.

J	Tenke, CE; Kayser, J				Tenke, Craig E.; Kayser, Juergen			Surface Laplacians (SL) and phase properties of EEG rhythms: Simulated generators in a volume-conduction model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Phase; Coherence; Oscillation; Volume conduction; Surface Laplacian; Current source density (CSD)	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ARTIFACTUALLY HIGH COHERENCES; SCALP CURRENT-DENSITY; WAVE-FORMS; SPLINE COMPUTATION; INFINITY REFERENCE; GENERIC METHOD; POTENTIALS; RECORDINGS; PATTERNS	Surface Laplacian (SL) methods offer advantages in spectral analysis owing to the well-known implications of volume conduction. Although recognition of the superiority of SL over reference-dependent measures is widespread, well-reasoned cautions have precluded their universal adoption. Notably, the expected selectivity of SL for superficial rather than deep generators has relegated SL to the role of an add-on to conventional analyses, rather than as an independent area of inquiry, despite empirical findings supporting the consistency and replicability of physiological effects of interest. It has also been reasoned that the contrast-enhancing effects of SL necessarily make it insensitive to broadly distributed generators, including those suspected for oscillatory rhythms such as EEG alpha. These concerns are further exacerbated for phase-sensitive measures (e.g., phase-locking, coherence), where key features of physiological generators have yet to be evaluated. While the neuronal generators of empirically-derived EEG measures cannot be precisely known due to the inverse problem, simple dipole generator configurations can be simulated using a 4-sphere head model and linearly combined. We simulated subdural and deep generators and distributed dipole layers using sine and cosine waveforms, quantified at 67-scalp sites corresponding to those used in previous research. Reference-dependent (nose, average, mastoids reference) EEG and corresponding SL topographies were used to probe signal fidelity in the topography of the measured amplitude spectra, phase and coherence of sinusoidal stimuli at and between "active" recording sites. SL consistently outperformed the conventional EEG measures, indicating that continued reluctance by the research community is unfounded. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies have identified alterations in gamma-band (30-80 Hz) cortical activity in schizophrenia and mood disorders, consistent with neural models of disturbed glutamate (and GABA) neuron influence over cortical pyramidal cells. Genetic evidence suggests specific deficits in GABA-A receptor function in schizoaffective bipolar disorder (SABP), a clinical syndrome with features of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This study investigated gamma oscillations in this under-researched disorder. Method. MEG was used to measure induced gamma and evoked responses to a visual grating stimulus, known to be a potent inducer of primary visual gamma oscillations, in 15 individuals with remitted SABP, defined using Research Diagnostic Criteria, and 22 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Results. Individuals with SABP demonstrated increased sustained visual cortical power in the gamma band (t(35)=-2.56, p=0.015) compared to controls. There were no group differences in baseline gamma power, transient or sustained gamma frequency, alpha band responses or pattern onset visual-evoked responses. Conclusions. Gamma power is increased in remitted SABP, which reflects an abnormality in the cortical inhibitory-excitatory balance. Although an interaction between gamma power and medication can not be ruled out, there were no group differences in evoked responses or baseline measures. Further work is needed in other clinical populations and at-risk relatives. Pharmaco-magnetoencephalography studies will help to elucidate the specific GABA and glutamate pathways affected.

Changes in Theta and Beta Oscillations as Signatures of Novel Word Consolidation	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LEXICAL-SEMANTIC RETRIEVAL; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; POWER INCREASES; ALPHA-BAND; MEMORY; RESPONSES; EEG; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; LANGUAGE	The complementary learning systems account of word learning states that novel words, like other types of memories, undergo an offline consolidation process during which they are gradually integrated into the neocortical memory network. A fundamental change in the neural representation of a novel word should therefore occur in the hours after learning. The present EEG study tested this hypothesis by investigating whether novel words learned before a 24-hr consolidation period elicited more word-like oscillatory responses than novel words learned immediately before testing. In line with previous studies indicating that theta synchronization reflects lexical access, unfamiliar novel words elicited lower power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) than existing words. Recently learned words still showed a marginally lower theta increase than existing words, but theta responses to novel words that had been acquired 24 hr earlier were indistinguishable from responses to existing words. Consistent with evidence that beta desynchronization (16-21 Hz) is related to lexical-semantic processing, we found that both unfamiliar and recently learned novel words elicited less beta desynchronization than existing words. In contrast, no difference was found between novel words learned 24 hr earlier and existing words. These data therefore suggest that an offline consolidation period enables novel words to acquire lexically integrated, word-like neural representations.

We investigated the electrophysiological changes in absolute theta power within the frontal cortex when individuals performed a visuomotor task under bromazepam. The sample of 17 healthy individuals was randomized into 2 experimental conditions, under which bromazepam 6 mg and placebo were administered on different days. All subjects were right -handed, with no mental or physical illness and were not using any psychoactive or psychotropic substance during the entire period of the study. We found an increase in reaction time under bromazepam compared with placebo . With regard to the electrophysiological variable, we found a lower theta power value in the prefrontal cortex prior to task execution, compared with after. We therefore suggested that this could be an increase of neural activity in this region, because of the subjects' readiness to perform the task, that is, because of their higher alertness. The right lateral frontal region showed lower theta power under bromazepam for pre- and post-finger movement. This could have occurred because of more effort to execute the task. In the left frontal region: premovement did not demonstrate any difference between conditions, possibly because the proposed task was simple to execute. In conclusion, theta power plays an important role in the analysis of visuomotor performance, assuming that bromazepam causes impairment on sustained attention and sensory perception.

The close association between behavioral states and EEG rhythms is reached late during development, after birth in humans and by the end of the second postnatal week in rats and mice. This critical time is also when cortical activity switches from a discontinuous to a continuous pattern. We review the major cellular and network changes that can account for this transition. After this close link is established, new evidence suggests that the slow waves of non-rapid eye movement sleep may function as markers to track cortical development. However, before the EEG can be used to identify behavioral states, two distinct sleep phases-quiet sleep and active sleep-are identified based on behavioral criteria and muscle activity. During this early phase of development, cortical activity is far from being disorganized, despite the presence of long periods of neuronal silence and the poor modulation by behavioral states. Specific EEG patterns, such as spindle bursts and gamma oscillations, have been identified very early on and are believed to play a significant role in the refinement of brain circuits. Because most early EEG patterns do not map to a specific behavioral state, their contribution to the presumptive role of sleep in brain maturation remains to be established and should be a major focus for future research.

Better perfoimance in various activities was also reported after relaxation trainings, another popular method in therapeutic practice. Both these methods are used as a part of professional coaching in sports training centers. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of such holistic training on physiological (EEG) and behavioral measures on semi-professional athletes. EEG-NFB paradigm was intended for amplification of the amplitudes of SAM (12-15 Hz) and betal (13-20 Hz) bands and simultaneous redaction of the amplitude of theta (4-7.5 Hz) and beta2 (20-30 Hz). Participation in NFB sessions was accompanied with self-administration of relaxing, audio-visual stimulation after each daily athletic training session. The training program resulted in the increase of alpha and betal power of trained participants when assessed in rest with eyes-closed. In eyes - open state, participants of the trained group maintained the same level in all frequency bands, in opposite to the control subjects, whose power decreased in the second measurement in betal band when compared to the first one. The trained group exhibited greater reduction of reaction times in a test-of visual attention than the control group and showed improvement in several performance measures of Kraepeli-n's work-curve, used to evaluate speed, effectiveness and work accuracy. Together, these results present initial support for the use of holistic, rteurophysiological training in sports workout.

As a benchmark example for validation we used intracranial electroencephalographic signals in a human subject. These data were used to infer the (effective connectivity) architecture of synaptic connections among neural populations assumed to generate seizure activity. Dynamic causal modelling allowed us to quantify empirical changes in spectral activity in terms of a trajectory in parameter space -identifying key synaptic parameters or connections that cause observed signals. Using recordings from three seizures in one patient, we considered a network of two sources (within and just outside the putative ictal zone). Bayesian model selection was used to identify the intrinsic (within-source) and extrinsic (between-source) connectivity. Having established the underlying architecture, we were able to track the evolution of key connectivity parameters (e.g., inhibitory connections to superficial pyramidal cells) and test specific hypotheses about the synaptic mechanisms involved in ictogenesis. Our key finding was that intrinsic synaptic changes were sufficient to explain seizure onset, where these changes showed dissociable time courses over several seconds. Crucially, these changes spoke to an increase in the sensitivity of principal cells to intrinsic inhibitory afferents and a transient loss of excitatory-inhibitory balance. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Twenty-eight subjects (12 females; mean age 22.5) participated. The experimental conditions consisted of two lighting environments: direct/indirect lighting (400 lx downlight, 300 lx uplight) and direct lighting (700 lx downlight). On each trial, a luminance environment was presented for 4 min, followed by participants rated their emotional feelings of the lighting environment. EEG data were recorded during the experiment. Spectral analysis was performed for the range of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. The participants felt cooler and more pleasant and theta oscillations on the F4, F8, T4, and TP7 electrodes were more enhanced in the direct/indirect lighting environment compared to the direct lighting environment. There was significant correlation between the "cool" rating and the theta power of the F8 electrode. The participants felt more pleasant in the direct/indirect lighting environment, indicating that space with direct/indirect lighting modulated subjective perception. Additionally, our results suggest that theta oscillatory activity can be used as a biological marker that reflects emotional status in different lighting environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We previously developed a rodent model of temporal lobe seizures that recapitulates the human electroencephalography (EEG) signature of ictal and postictal neocortical slow waves associated with behavioral impairments in level of consciousness. The mechanism of slow-wave production in epilepsy may involve suppression of the subcortical arousal systems including the brainstem and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. We hypothesized that intralaminar thalamic stimulation may lead to electrophysiologic and functional rescue from postictal slow waves and behavioral arrest. MethodsWe electrically stimulated the central lateral thalamic nucleus (a member of the intralaminar nuclei) under anesthesia and after electrically induced hippocampal seizures in anesthetized and in awake-behaving animal model preparations. ResultsWe demonstrated a proof-of-principle restoration of electrophysiologic and behavioral measures of consciousness by stimulating the intralaminar thalamic nuclei after seizures. We measured decreased cortical slow waves and increased desynchronization and multiunit activity in the cortex with thalamic stimulation following seizures. Functionally, thalamic stimulation produced resumption of exploratory behaviors in the postictal state. SignificanceTargeting of nodes in the neural circuitry of consciousness has important medical implications. Impaired consciousness with epilepsy has dangerous consequences including decreased school/work performance, social stigmatization, and impaired airway protection. These data suggest a novel therapeutic approach for restoring consciousness after seizures. If paired with responsive neurostimulation, this may allow rapid implementation to improve level of consciousness in patients with epilepsy.

Perception and Cognition of Cues Used in Synchronous Brain-Computer Interfaces Modify Electroencephalographic Patterns of Control Tasks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; classification accuracy; electroencephalographic patterns; human factors	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; RHYTHMS; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS	A motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that enables humans to interact with their environment by translating their brain signals into control commands for a target device. In particular, synchronous BCI systems make use of cues to trigger the motor activity of interest. So far, it has been shown that electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns before and after cue onset can reveal the user cognitive state and enhance the discrimination of MI-related control tasks. However, there has been no detailed investigation of the nature of those EEG patterns. We, therefore, propose to study the cue effects on MI-related control tasks by selecting EEG patterns that best discriminate such control tasks, and analyzing where those patterns are coming from. The study was carried out using two methods: standard and all-embracing. The standard method was based on sources (recording sites, frequency bands, and time windows), where the modulation of EEG signals due to motor activity is typically detected. The all-embracing method included a wider variety of sources, where not only motor activity is reflected. The findings of this study showed that the classification accuracy (CA) of MI-related control tasks did not depend on the type of cue in use. However, EEG patterns that best differentiated those control tasks emerged from sources well defined by the perception and cognition of the cue in use. An implication of this study is the possibility of obtaining different control commands that could be detected with the same accuracy. Since different cues trigger control tasks that yield similar CAs, and those control tasks produce EEG patterns differentiated by the cue nature, this leads to accelerate the brain-computer communication by having a wider variety of detectable control commands. This is an important issue for Neuroergonomics research because neural activity could not only be used to monitor the human mental state as is typically done, but this activity might be also employed to control the system of interest.

Voluntary control of a phantom limb	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; INTENTION; MOVEMENT; HAND; CORTEX; MODEL; DESYNCHRONIZATION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXECUTION	Voluntary actions are often accompanied by a conscious experience of intention. The content of this experience, and its neural basis, remain controversial. On one view, the mind just retrospectively ascribes intentions to explain the occurrence of actions that lack obvious triggering stimuli. Here, we use EEG frequency analysis of sensorimotor rhythms to investigate brain activity when a participant (CL, co-author of this paper) with congenital absence of the left hand and arm, prepared and made a voluntary action with the right or the phantom "left hand". CL reported the moment she experienced the intention to press a key. This timepoint was then used as a marker for aligning and averaging EEG. In a second condition, CL was asked to prepare the action on-all trials, but then, on some trials, to cancel the action at the last moment. For the right hand, we observed a typical reduction in beta-band spectral power prior to movement, followed by beta rebound after movement. When CL prepared but then cancelled a movement, we found a characteristic EEG pattern reported previously, namely a left frontal increase in spectral power close to the time of the perceived intention to move. Interestingly, the same neural signatures of positive and inhibitory volition were also present when CL prepared and inhibited movements with her phantom left hand. These EEG signals were all similar to those reported previously in a group of 14 healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that conscious intention may depend on preparatory brain activity, and not on making, or ever having made, the corresponding physical body movement. Accounts that reduce conscious volition to mere retrospective confabulation cannot easily explain our participant's neurophenomenology of action and inhibition. In contrast, the results are consistent with the view that specific neural events prior to movement may generate conscious experiences of positive and negative volition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To enable a stable, non-interfering representation of multiple items, such a theta-gamma neural code may be reflected by phase-phase coupling, i.e., a precise locking of gamma subcycles to specific theta phases. Recent data have indicated that the hippocampus critically contributes to multi-item working memory. Therefore, we investigated phase-phase coupling patterns in the hippocampus based on intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients performing a variant of the serial Sternberg WM task. In accordance with predictions of the theta-gamma coding theory, we observed increased phase-phase coupling between theta and beta/gamma activity during working memory maintenance compared to inter-trial intervals. These phase-phase coupling patterns were apparent during maintenance of two and four items, but not during maintenance of a single item, where prominent lower coupling ratios occurred. Furthermore, we observed that load-dependent changes of coupling factors correlated with individual WM capacities. Our data demonstrate that multi-item WM is associated with changes in hippocampal phase-phase coupling between theta and beta/gamma activity.

BACLOFEN AND GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE DIFFERENTIALLY ALTERED BEHAVIOR, EEG ACTIVITY AND SLEEP IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Baclofen; GHB; sleep; EEG; rats	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; MEDIAN RAPHE NUCLEUS; FREELY MOVING RAT; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; SODIUM OXYBATE; INTRATHECAL BACLOFEN; BINDING-SITES; POTASSIUM CONDUCTANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Objectives: Animal and human studies have shown that sleep may have an impact on functional recovery after brain damage. Baclofen (Bac) and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) have been shown to induce physiological sleep in humans, however, their effects in rodents are unclear. The aim of this study is to characterize sleep and electroencelphalogram (EEG) after Bac and GHB administration in rats. We hypothesized that both drugs would induce physiological sleep. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with EEG/electromyogram (EMG) electrodes for sleep recordings. Bac (10 or 20 mg/kg), GHB (150 or 300 mg/kg) or saline were injected 1 h after light and dark onset to evaluate time of day effect of the drugs. Vigilance states and EEG spectra were quantified. Results: Bac and GHB induced a non-physiological state characterized by atypical behavior and an abnormal EEG pattern. After termination of this state, Bac was found to increase the duration of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (similar to 90 and 10 min, respectively), reduce sleep fragmentation and affect NREM sleep episode frequency and duration (p < 0.05). GHB had no major effect on vigilance states. Bac drastically increased EEG power density in NREM sleep in the frequencies 1.5-6.5 and 9.5-21.5 Hz compared to saline (p < 0.05), while GHB enhanced power in the 1-5-Hz frequency band and reduced it in the 7-9-Hz band. Slow-wave activity in NREM sleep was enhanced 1.5-3-fold during the first 1-2 h following termination of the non-physiological state. The magnitude of drug effects was stronger during the dark phase. Conclusion: While both Bac and GHB induced a non-physiological resting state, only Bac facilitated and consolidated sleep, and promoted EEG delta oscillations thereafter. Hence, Bac can be considered a sleep-promoting drug and its effects on functional recovery after stroke can be evaluated both in humans and rats. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

State of the evidence	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Seizure; Epilepsy; Electrode; Implanted	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURE-ONSET; PATTERNS; ELECTRODES; RECORDINGS; LOBECTOMY; PROPAGATION	ObjectiveA major limitation of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is recording from a confined region. This may falsely localize seizure onset if the distinction between ictal onset zone, proximity, and spread is unclear, or if the ictal rhythm is not clearly identified. Delineation of the ictal onset zone is crucial for surgical success. We appraised the evidence to determine whether specific iEEG ictal patterns are associated with the ictal onset zone. MethodsWe searched Embase for articles in English until September 30, 2014, with MeSH keywords related to intracranially implanted electrodes and seizures. Two authors independently screened abstracts, reviewed full text articles, and abstracted data. The association between seizure outcome and type of ictal onset pattern (IOP), and its extent, location, and spread were explored visually or by univariate analysis when sufficient data were provided. Methodologic quality of each study was assessed. ResultsWe reviewed 1,987 abstracts from which 21 articles were analyzed. Fifteen IOPs were reported. Low frequency high amplitude repetitive spiking (LFRS) was the most frequently reported IOP by studies that dealt with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and investigated with depth electrodes. In neocortical epilepsy, low voltage fast activity (LVFA) was the most commonly described IOP. Delta activity was an infrequently reported IOP and was described mostly as a spread pattern. SignificanceLFRS is associated with good surgical outcome in mTLE and has a strong relation with mesial temporal pathology and its severity. LVFA is associated with neocortical temporal epilepsy and focal LVFA is associated with better surgical outcome. Electrodecrement may be associated with regional or widespread onsets. Rhythmic delta is a propagation rhythm rather than an IOP. Focal IOPs and slower propagation times are associated with better outcomes. The quality of the studies is suboptimal and there are methodological problems. Interobserver agreement is poorly documented.

EEG artifact elimination by extraction of ICA-component features using image processing algorithms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Independent component analysis; ICA; EEG; Artifact elimination; Image processing; Local binary patterns; Range filter; Geometric features	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; FACE RECOGNITION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; OCULAR ARTIFACT; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; REMOVAL; NOISE	Artifact rejection is a central issue when dealing with electroencephalogram recordings. Although independent component analysis (ICA) separates data in linearly independent components (IC), the classification of these components as artifact or EEG signal still requires visual inspection by experts. In this paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of feature vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing algorithms. We compare the performance of this automated classifier to visual classification by experts and identify range filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential for automated IC artifact recognition (accuracy rate 88%). We obtain almost the same level of recognition performance for geometric features and local binary pattern (LBP) features. Compared to the existing automated solutions the proposed method has two main advantages: First, it does not depend on direct recording of artifact signals, which then, e.g. have to be subtracted from the contaminated EEG. Second, it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact. In summary, the present method is an automatic, reliable, real-time capable and practical tool that reduces the time intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact removal. The results are very promising despite the relatively small channel resolution of 25 electrodes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These rehabilitation devices are possibly too supportive during the exercises. Neurophysiological signals might be one way of avoiding slacking and providing robotic support only when the brain is particularly responsive to peripheral input. We tested the feasibility of three-dimensional robotic assistance for reaching movements with a multi-joint exoskeleton during motor imagery (MI)-related desynchronization of sensorimotor oscillations in the beta-band. We also registered task-related network changes of cortical functional connectivity by electroencephalography via the imaginary part of the coherence function. Healthy subjects and stroke survivors showed similar patterns but different aptitudes of controlling the robotic movement. All participants in this pilot study with nine healthy subjects and two stroke patients achieved their maximum performance during the early stages of the task. Robotic control was significantly higher and less variable when proprioceptive feedback was provided in addition to visual feedback, i.e., when the orthosis was actually attached to the subject's arm during the task. A distributed cortical network of task-related coherent activity in the theta-band showed significant differences between healthy subjects and stroke patients as well as between early and late periods of the task. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) may successfully link three-dimensional robotic training to the participants' efforts and allow for task-oriented practice of activities of daily living with a physiologically controlled multi-joint exoskeleton. Changes of cortical physiology during the task might also help to make subject specific adjustments of task difficulty and guide adjunct interventions to facilitate motor learning for functional restoration, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.

In this study we explored how the brain connectivity changes over the time for face-sensitive processing. We investigated the dynamic functional connectivity in face perception by analyzing time dependent EEG phase synchronization in four different frequency bands: theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz), beta (15-24 Hz), and gamma (25-45 Hz) bands in the early stages of face processing from 30 to 300 ms. High density EEG were recorded from subjects who were passively viewing faces, buildings, and chairs. The dynamic connectivity within the core system and between the extended system were investigated. Significant differences between faces and non-faces mainly appear in theta band connectivity: (1) at the time segment of 90-120 ms between parietal area and occipito-temporal area in the right hemisphere, and (2) at the time segment of 150-180 ms between bilateral occipito-temporal areas. These results indicate (1) the importance of theta-band connectivity in the face-sensitive processing, and (2) that different parts of network are involved for the initial stage of face categorization and the stage of face structural encoding.

Repetitive Transcorneal Alternating Current Stimulation Reduces Brain Idling State After Long-term Vision Loss	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Non-invasive brain stimulation; Alternating current stimulation; Brain state; EEG; Optic nerve crush; Visual cortex; Vision restoration	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; RESTORATION; MORPHOLOGY; DAMAGE; CELLS	Background: Deafferentation of visual system structures following brain or optic nerve injury leaves cortical areas deprived of visual input. Deprived cortical areas have a reduced sensory information processing and are characterized with localized enhanced or synchronized rhythms believed to represent an "idling state". Objective/hypothesis: We hypothesized that cortical idling can be modified with transcorneal alternating current stimulation (tACS) known to modulate cortical oscillations and thus change the functional state of the deafferented areas. Methods: tACS was applied in rat model of severe optic nerve crush using a protocol similar to our clinical studies (200 mu A, 2-8 Hz) for 5 treatment days right after the lesion and at the chronic stage (3 months later). EEG and VEP were recorded over the visual cortices. In vivo confocal neuroimaging of the retina and histology of the optic nerves were performed. Results: Morphological investigations showed massive retinal ganglion cells death and degeneration of the optic nerves after crush. Visual loss was associated with increased EEG spectral power and lower coherence, indicating an "idling state". Stimulation induced a significant decrease of EEG power towards normal values. These effects were especially pronounced in the chronic stage. Conclusion: Our results suggest that alternating current injected via the eye is able to modulate visually deprived brain areas and thus reduce cortical idling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In our study, corticomuscular coherence is used as a method of estimating this correlation. EEG is known to reflect the brain activity, and it is often used to detect or treat some certain illness. EMG, which is related to muscle contractions, is widely used in rehabilitation and ergonomics. These two signals are recorded synchronously to calculate the corticomuscular coherence. Three movement modes, including imagination, stimulation and execution, are explored to reveal the inner mechanism of human's behaviours. Subjects were asked to imagine or execute the flexion of the middle finger, and the electrical stimulation was used for subjects to induce stimulated finger flexion. Wavelet- based coherence is first proposed in our study to observe the coherence in time-frequency domain. During the execution task, 5 of 10 subjects showed significant coherence; 8 of 10 subjects showed strong coherence in the stimulation task. According to the statistical analysis, the coherence during stimulation is stronger than that during imagination and execution. In addition, the significant coherence appeared in different time for different tasks. This shows that stronger relationship between the brain and muscles exists in actual movements. However, how the control paths for execution and stimulation tasks are different still remains unclear according to our result.

A powerful tool may be represented by neural oscillations which entrain their high-excitability phase to important input while their low-excitability phase attenuates irrelevant information. Indeed, the alignment between brain oscillations and speech improves intelligibility and helps dissociating speakers during a "cocktail party". Although well-investigated, the contribution of low- and high-level processes to phase entrainment to speech sound has only recently begun to be understood. Here, we review those findings, and concentrate on three main results: (1) Phase entrainment to speech sound is modulated by attention or predictions, likely supported by top-down signals and indicating higher-level processes involved in the brain's adjustment to speech. (2) As phase entrainment to speech can be observed without systematic fluctuations in sound amplitude or spectral content, it does not only reflect a passive steady-state "ringing" of the cochlea, but entails a higher-level process. (3) The role of intelligibility for phase entrainment is debated. Recent results suggest that intelligibility modulates the behavioral consequences of entrainment, rather than directly affecting the strength of entrainment in auditory regions. We conclude that phase entrainment to speech reflects a sophisticated mechanism: several high-level processes interact to optimally align neural oscillations with predicted events of high relevance, even when they are hidden in a continuous stream of background noise.

Entrainment and function control of neuronal networks	NERVENARZT			German	Article						Brain oscillations; Parkinson's disease; Cognitive processes; Transcranial brain stimulation; Tinnitus	COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; GAMMA; MEMORY	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a new technique for the modulation of oscillatory brain activity as measured in the electroencephalogram (EEG). In contrast to well-established stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, tACS applies a sinusoidal alternating current at a specific frequency. This enables the modulation of the amplitude and frequency of endogenous brain oscillations as well as related cognitive processes. Therefore, the use of tACS has the possibility to evaluate well-known correlations between brain oscillations and cognitive processes in terms of causality. Such causal relationships have been documented in numerous neurocognitive studies on sensory, motor and perceptual processes; however, the clinical application of tACS is still in its infancy. In principle, any pathology that can reliably be connected with brain oscillations of a defined frequency is treatable. A current main focus of clinical research is on symptoms of Parkinson's disease and to a lesser degree, tinnitus. For an effective application of tACS it is important to choose the electrode positions as well as the frequency, intensity and duration of the stimulation in a theory-based and symptom-related manner. A successful therapeutic intervention requires the persistence of the tACS effect after stimulation has ceased. A mechanism that offers not only an explanation to the origin of persistent tACS effects but is also of high therapeutic benefit is neural plasticity. Therefore, one current focus of research aims at a better understanding of tACS after effects.	[Vosskuhl, J.; Strueber, D.; Herrmann, C.

Studying brain oscillations as measures of local and inter-regional processing, we shed light on the neural dynamics underlying memory suppression. Employing the think/no-think paradigm, 24 healthy human subjects repeatedly retrieved (think condition) or avoided thinking of (no-think condition) a previously learned target memory upon being presented with a reminder stimulus. Think and no-think instructions were delivered by means of a precue that preceded the reminder by 1 s. This allowed us to segregate neural control mechanisms that were triggered by the precue from the effect of suppression on target memory networks after presentation of the reminder. Control effects were reflected in increased power in the theta (5-9 Hz) frequency band in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and higher long-range alpha (10-14 Hz) phase synchronization. Successful suppression of target memories was reflected in a decrease of theta oscillatory power in the medial temporal lobes and reduced long-range theta phase synchronization emerged after presentation of the reminder. Our results suggest that intentional memory suppression correlates with increased neural communication in cognitive control networks that act in down-regulating local and inter-regional processing related to memory retrieval.

However, it is currently unknown whether the phase of the ongoing alpha activity can be manipulated by top-down factors such as attention or expectancy. Using three variants of a cross-modal attention paradigm with constant predictable stimulus onsets, we examined if cues signaling to attend to either the visual or the auditory domain influenced the phase of alpha oscillations in the associated sensory cortices. Importantly, intermixed in all three experiments, we included trials without a target to estimate the phase at target presentation without contamination from the early evoked responses. For these blank trials, at the time of expected target and distractor onset, we examined (1) the degree of the uniformity in phase angles across trials, (2) differences in phase angle uniformity compared with a pretarget baseline, and (3) phase angle differences between visual and auditory target conditions. Across all three experiments, we found that, although the cues induced a modulation in alpha power in occipital electrodes, neither the visual condition nor the auditory cue condition induced any significant phase-locking across trials during expected target or distractor presentation. These results suggest that, although alpha power can be modulated by top-down factors such as attention and expectation, the phase of the ongoing alpha oscillation is not under such control.

Early Psychosocial Neglect Adversely Impacts Developmental Trajectories of Brain Oscillations and Their Interactions	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EARLY INTERVENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; INFANT BRAIN; FOSTER-CARE; EEG; CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Rhythmicity is a fundamental property of neural activity at multiple spatiotemporal scales, and associated oscillations represent a critical mechanism for communication and transmission of information across brain regions. During development, these oscillations evolve dynamically as a function of neural maturation and may be modulated by early experiences, positive and/or negative. This study investigated the impact of psychosocial deprivation associated with institutional rearing in early life and the effects of subsequent foster care intervention on developmental trajectories of neural oscillations and their cross-frequency correlations. Longitudinally acquired nontask EEGs from three cohorts of children from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project were analyzed. These included abandoned children initially reared in institutions and subsequently randomized to be placed in foster care or receive care as usual (prolonged institutional rearing) and a group of never-institutionalized children. Oscillation trajectories were estimated from 42 to 96 months, that is, 1-3 years after all children in the intervention arm of the study had been placed in foster care. Significant differences between groups were estimated for the amplitude trajectories of cognitive-related gamma, beta, alpha, and theta oscillations. Similar differences were identified as a function of time spent in institutions, suggesting that increased time spent in psychosocial neglect may have profound and widespread effects on brain activity. Significant group differences in cross-frequency coupling were estimated longitudinally between gamma and lower frequencies as well as alpha and lower frequencies. Lower cross-gamma coupling was estimated at 96 months in the group of children that remained in institutions at that age compared to the other two groups, suggesting potentially impaired communication between local and long-distance brain networks in these children. In contrast, higher cross-alpha coupling was estimated in this group compared to the other two groups at 96 months, suggesting impaired suppression of alpha-theta and alpha-delta activity, which has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Age at foster care placement had a significant positive modulatory effect on alpha and beta trajectories and their mutual coupling, although by 96 months these trajectories remained distinct from those of never-institutionalized children. Overall, these findings suggest that early psychosocial neglect may profoundly impact neural maturation, particularly the evolution of neural oscillations and their interactions across a broad frequency range. These differences may result in widespread deficits across multiple cognitive domains.

Temporal Expectation and Attention Jointly Modulate Auditory Oscillatory Activity in the Beta Band	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; HUMAN BRAIN; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DATA	The neural response to a stimulus is influenced by endogenous factors such as expectation and attention. Current research suggests that expectation and attention exert their effects in opposite directions, where expectation decreases neural activity in sensory areas, while attention increases it. However, expectation and attention are usually studied either in isolation or confounded with each other. A recent study suggests that expectation and attention may act jointly on sensory processing, by increasing the neural response to expected events when they are attended, but decreasing it when they are unattended. Here we test this hypothesis in an auditory temporal cueing paradigm using magnetoencephalography in humans. In our study participants attended to, or away from, tones that could arrive at expected or unexpected moments. We found a decrease in auditory beta band synchrony to expected (versus unexpected) tones if they were unattended, but no difference if they were attended. Modulations in beta power were already evident prior to the expected onset times of the tones. These findings suggest that expectation and attention jointly modulate sensory processing.

It is unclear whether these alterations are associated with clinical depression or exist already at preclinical stages. Here, in clinically healthy individuals, a combination of neuroticism and introversion was used as a predisposition to depression (PD) scale. Participants were presented with pictures of emotional facial expressions and performed the gender discrimination task, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The affective processing bias (i.e., longer reaction time and higher error rate for angry faces) was found in low, but not in high PD scorers. High PD scorers also showed reduced theta synchronization and enhanced alpha desynchronization in the test interval and higher delta and theta power in the interstimuli interval. The latter effect implies that activity of emotional circuits, which is mirrored in low-frequency oscillations, is tonically increased in predisposed-to-depression individuals, thus precluding an adequate response to external emotional cues. This results in unspecific general activation reflected in enhanced alpha desynchronization and in disrupted ability to differentiate incoming emotional information.

So far, there are only few studies concerning the effects of PAS on the modulation of EEG power. Hence, aim of the present study was to investigate rPAS long term after-effects on cortical excitability looking at EEG power spectra. In four experimental sessions, separated by 2 weeks interval, 12 awake subjects received rPAS of the right median nerve and left M1 at a fixed interval (ISI) of 25 ms (real condition), 5 Hz-TMS on left M1, 5 Hz-ENS, of the right median nerve, and rPAS with changing ISI (sham condition). We measured peak-to-peak MEP amplitude, evoked from the target muscle (right abductor pollicis brevis muscle) at rest and the absolute power (POW) in four frequency bands: alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30), theta (4-7) and delta (1-3), under rest conditions. All these parameters were evaluated in three detection blocks: baseline, immediately after and after 30' from the end of the conditioning protocol. Real rPAS induced a long-lasting homotopic cortical excitability modulation, as indexed by MEP amplitude increase, that was paralleled by a long-lasting reduction of alpha/beta-POW and by a widespread theta-delta-POW modulation. rPAS applied over the sensory-motor cortex induced an LTP-like plasticity, as indexed by a robust reduction in the alpha/beta POW positively correlated with the MEP amplitude increase. rPAS(25ms) may be a useful tool for motor neurorehabilitation promoting a sensory-motor coupling within beta oscillations.

This technique allows to investigate dynamics of transmitter release both under normal and experimentally evoked conditions. The PPST can be modified so that it is possible to determine release of endogenous transmitters simultaneously with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, recordings of evoked potentials or the on-line determination of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) released into the synaptic cleft. Because of the good time resolution, the method provides further the possibility to modify the collection periods of superfusates depending on the neuronal function that is analyzed. For instance, investigation of central cardiovascular control, behavioral tasks or mnemonic processes requires very short collection periods, because changes in transmitter release occur within seconds. Even more important is the time resolution when rates of transmitter release are correlated with evoked extracellular potentials or EEG recordings. This review provides an overview of the different devices which might be combined with the PPST and perspectives for future work.

Neural body maps in human infants: Somatotopic responses to tactile stimulation in 7-month-olds	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Infant; EEG; Somatotopy; SEP; Touch; Body maps	SOMATOSENSORY CORTICES; HEALTHY NEWBORNS; MOTOR; HAND; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; IMITATION; EEG	A large literature has examined somatotopic representations of the body in the adult brain, but little attention has been paid to the development of somatotopic neural organization in human infants. In the present study we examined whether the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) elicited by brief tactile stimulation of infants' hands and feet shows a somatotopic response pattern at 7 months postnatal age. The tactile stimuli elicited a prominent positive component in the SEP at central sites that peaked around 175 ms after stimulus onset. Consistent with a somatotopic response pattern, the amplitude of the response to hand stimulation was greater at lateral central electrodes (C3 and C4) than at the midline central electrode (Cz). As expected, the opposite pattern was obtained to foot stimulation, with greater peak amplitude at Cz than at C3 and C4. These results provide evidence of somatotopy in human infants and suggest that the developing body map can be delineated using readily available methods such as EEG. These findings open up possibilities for further work investigating the organization and plasticity of infant body maps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, brain activity was recorded using electroencephalogram while volunteers were listening or reading small texts and had to select pictures that translate meaning of these texts. Several techniques for EEG analysis were used to show this distributed character of neuronal enrollment associated with the comprehension of oral and written descriptive texts. Low Resolution Tomography identified the many different sets (s(i)) of neurons activated in several distinct cortical areas by text understanding. Linear correlation was used to calculate the information H(e(i)) provided by each electrode of the 10/20 system about the identified s(i). H(e(i)) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to study the temporal and spatial activation of these sources s(i). This analysis evidenced 4 different patterns of H(e(i)) covariation that are generated by neurons located at different cortical locations. These results clearly show that the distributed character of language processing is clearly evidenced by combining available EEG technologies.

We review evidence indicating that top-down neocortical processes are carried by interareal synchrony, particularly in the beta frequency band. We hypothesize that top-down neocortical signals in the beta band convey behavioral context to low-level sensory neurons. We further speculate that large-scale distributed networks, self-organized at the highest hierarchical levels, are the source of top-down signals in the neocortex.

Based on these fundamental principles, we formulate conceptually novel social neuroscience paradigm (OSIMAS), which envisages social systems emerging from the coherent neurodynamical processes taking place in the individual mind-fields. In this way, societies are understood as global processes emerging from the superposition of the conscious and subconscious mind-fields of individual members of society. For the experimental validation of the biologically inspired OSIMAS paradigm, we have designed a framework of EEG-based experiments. Initial baseline individual tests of spectral cross-correlations of EEG-recorded brainwave patterns for some mental states have been provided in this paper. Preliminary experimental results do not refute the main OSIMAS postulates. This paper also provides some insights for the construction of OSIMAS-based simulation models.

Gamma-band oscillations (e.g., the early auditory evoked gamma-band response, aeGBR) have been suggested to mediate cognitive and perceptual processes by driving the synchronization of local neuronal populations. Reduced aeGBR is a consistent finding in patients with schizophrenia and high-risk subjects, and has been proposed to represent an endophenotype for the illness. However, it is still unclear whether this reduction represents a deficit in sensory or cognitive processes, or a combination of the two. The present study investigated this question by manipulating the difficulty of an auditory reaction task in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls. Methods. A 64-channel EEG was recorded in 23 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls during two conditions of an auditory reaction task: an easy condition that merely required low-level vigilance, and a difficult condition that placed significant demands on attention and working memory. Results. In contrast to healthy controls, patients failed to increase aeGBR power and phase-locking in the difficult condition. In patients, aeGBR power and phase-locking indices were associated with working memory deficits. Conclusions. The observed results confirm the applicability of aeGBR disturbances as a stable endophenotype of schizophrenia, and suggest a cognitive, rather than sensory, deficit at their origin.

Thus far, these effects have been established for manual responses only. Here we investigate entrainment preceding leg movements. Methods: High-density EEG was recorded while participants were standing and responded to series of rhythmically presented arrow stimuli by making brisk leg movements. The standard interval between reaction stimuli differed between series and was either 1500 or 2000 ms. Each series' final interval was 1750 ms, representing a timing perturbation. Results: Entrainment was manifested in the CNV time course, where the maximum amplitude was reached just before the next stimulus was presented. The pattern of beta-(de) synchronization similarly entrained to the task rhythm. CNV scalp topographies suggested effector dependency of the entrainment-induced CNV. Conclusion: We demonstrate that lower limb motor control, like upper limb control, readily entrains to a regular task rhythm. Significance: These findings are relevant to Parkinson's disease (PD), where problems are found in rhythm processing and temporal preparation.

In this article, we investigate which causal statements are warranted and which ones are not supported by empirical evidence. We argue that the distinction between encoding and decoding models is not sufficient for this purpose: relevant features in encoding and decoding models carry a different meaning in stimulus-and in response-based experimental paradigms. We show that only encoding models in the stimulus-based setting support unambiguous causal interpretations. By combining encoding and decoding models trained on the samedata, however, we obtain insights into causal relations beyond those that are implied by each individual model type. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical findings on EEG data recorded during a visuo-motor learning task. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, the focus is on levels of alpha asymmetry between high- and low-neuroticism females across the menstrual cycle. Resting alpha asymmetry in healthy females who scored high or low on neuroticism was assessed during the menstrual phase, the late follicular phase, and the midlate luteal phase. High-neuroticism females exhibited lower relative left prefrontal activity than did low-neuroticism females during the midlate luteal phase, as indexed by alpha(1) and alpha(Total) asymmetry scores at the prefrontal electrode positions (FP1/2). EEG results demonstrate that the resting frontal alpha asymmetry of high- and low-neuroticism females was moderated by the menstrual cycle, and high-neuroticism females should pay particular attention to their emotional experience during the midlate luteal phase.

To date, the contributions of icEEG have been limited to the individual-level analyses or cohorts whose data are not integrated in any way. Here we discuss how grouped approaches to icEEG overcome challenges related to sparse-sampling, correct for individual variations in response and provide statistically valid models of brain activity in a population. By the generation of whole-brain activity maps, grouped icEEG enables the study of intra and interregional dynamics between distributed cortical substrates exhibiting task-dependent activity. In this fashion, grouped icEEG analyses can provide significant advances in understanding the mechanisms by which cortical networks give rise to cognitive functions.

Commonly designed BCIs use band power changes in single channel electroencephalograms (EEGs) to discriminate different MI tasks. In this paper, we studied the information about interactions of spatially separated brain areas by considering the relationships between brain source signals through functional connectivity. We investigated dynamic time-frequency connectivity patterns during four motor imagery movements including left hand, right hand, both feet and tongue by means of Coherence measure estimated from multivariate adaptive autoregressive model coefficients. To tackle the volume conduction problem, sensor space signals were transformed into source space using independent component analysis technique. We showed distinct time-varying Coherence for different motor imageries. For tongue MI movement, bilateral connectivity was observed in hand areas of both hemispheres. The similar connectivity was detected for feet MI task, but with more focus on right hemisphere. During right and left hand MI, bilateral and contralateral brain connectivities were observed respectively. Results provided valuable information for possible classification of MI tasks by considering brain source functional connectivity patterns for BCIs.	[Hamedi, Mahyar; Salleh, Sh-Hussain; Samdin, S.

Spontaneous activity in the waiting brain: A marker of impulsive choice in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; Spontaneous oscillations; Default mode network; Waiting; Impulsivity; Delay aversion	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; RESTING BRAIN; DELAY AVERSION; EEG; ADHD; FMRI; HYPERACTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; ALPHA	Background: Spontaneous very low frequency oscillations (VLFO), seen in the resting brain, are attenuated when individuals are working on attention demanding tasks or waiting for rewards (Hsu et al., 2013). Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display excess VLFO when working on attention tasks. They also have difficulty waiting for rewards. Here we examined the waiting brain signature in ADHD and its association with impulsive choice. Methods: DC-EEG from 21 children with ADHD and 21 controls (9-15 years) were collected under four conditions: (i) resting; (ii) choosing to wait; (iii) being "forced" to wait; and (iv) working on a reaction time task. A questionnaire measured two components of impulsive choice. Results: Significant VLFO reductions were observed in controls within anterior brain regions in both working and waiting conditions. Individuals with ADHD showed VLFO attenuation while working but to a reduced level and none at all when waiting. A closer inspection revealed an increase of VLFO activity in temporal regions during waiting. Excess VLFO activity during waiting was associated with parents' ratings of temporal discounting and delay aversion. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential role for waiting-related spontaneous neural activity in the pathophysiology of impulsive decision-making of ADHD. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Praxis relies on a network consisting of inferior parietal and premotor regions, particularly on the left, and is thought to require transformation of spatio-temporal representations (parietal) into movement sequences (premotor). Method: We examined praxis network dynamics by measuring EEG effective connectivity while healthy subjects performed a praxis task. Results: Propagation from parietal to frontal regions was not statistically greater on the left than the right. However, propagation from left parietal regions to all other regions was significantly greater during gesture preparation than execution. Moreover, during gesture preparation only, propagation from the left parietal region to bilateral frontal regions was greater than reciprocal propagations to the left parietal region. This directional specificity was not observed for the right parietal region. Conclusions: These findings represent direct electrophysiological evidence for directionally predominant propagation in left frontal-parietal networks during praxis behavior, which may reflect neural mechanisms by which representations in the human brain select appropriate motor sequences for subsequent execution. Significance: In addition to bolstering the classic view of praxis network function, these results also demonstrate the relevance of additional information provided by directed connectivity measures.

(2014a,b) showed that the increase in beta-power typically observed after a movement above sensorimotor regions (beta-rebound) is attenuated when movement-execution errors are induced by visual perturbations. Moreover, akin to sensorimotor adaptation, the effect depended on the context in which the errors are experienced. Thus the beta-rebound attenuation might relate to neural processes involved in trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms. In two EEG experiments with human participants, along with the beta-rebound, we examine beta-activity during the preparation of reaches immediately following perturbed movements. In the first experiment, we show that both foreperiod and postmovement beta-activities are parametrically modulated by the sizes of kinematic errors produced by unpredictable mechanical perturbations (force field) independent of their on-line corrections. In the second experiment, we contrast two types of reach errors: movement-execution errors that trigger trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms and goal errors that do not elicit sensorimotor adaptation. Movement-execution errors were induced by mechanical or visual perturbations, whereas goal errors were caused by unexpected displacements of the target at movement initiation. Interestingly, foreperiod and postmovement beta-activities exhibit contrasting patterns, pointing to important functional differences of their underlying neuronal activity. While both types of reach errors attenuate the postmovement beta-rebound, only the kinematic errors that trigger trial-to-trial motor-command updates influenced beta-activity during the foreperiod. These findings suggest that the error-related modulation of the beta-rebound may reflect salience processing, independent of sensorimotor adaptation. In contrast, modulations in the foreperiod beta-power might relate to the motor-command adjustments activated after movement-execution errors are experienced.

Seizures occur in conjunction with abnormal electrical brain activity which can be recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG). Often, this abnormal brain activity consists of high amplitude regular spike-wave oscillations as opposed to low amplitude irregular oscillations in the non-seizure state. Active brain stimulation has been proposed as a method to terminate seizures prematurely, however, a general and widely-applicable approach to optimal stimulation protocols is still lacking. In this study we use a computational model of epileptic spike-wave dynamics to evaluate the effectiveness of a pseudospectral method to simulated seizure abatement. We incorporate brain connectivity derived from magnetic resonance imaging of a subject with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We find that the pseudospectral method can successfully generate time-varying stimuli that abate simulated seizures, even when including heterogeneous patient specific brain connectivity. The strength of the stimulus required varies in different brain areas. Our results suggest that seizure abatement, modeled as an optimal control problem and solved with the pseudospectral method, offers an attractive approach to treatment for in vivo stimulation techniques. Further, if optimal brain stimulation protocols are to be experimentally successful, then the heterogeneity of cortical connectivity should be accounted for in the development of those protocols and thus more spatially localized solutions may be preferable.

J	Dumpelmann, M; Jacobs, J; Schulze-Bonhage, A				Duempelmann, Matthias; Jacobs, Julia; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas			Temporal and spatial characteristics of high frequency oscillations as a new biomarker in epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Biomarker; Epilepsy surgery; High frequency oscillations; Automatic detection; Invasive EEG	MIRROR DISEASE-ACTIVITY; EEG RECORDINGS; LOBE; HZ; SLEEP; MACROELECTRODES; BRAIN; DEPTH; HELPS	ObjectiveInterictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising candidate as a biomarker in epilepsy as well as for defining the seizure-onset zone as for the prediction of the surgical outcome after epilepsy surgery. The purpose of the study is to investigate properties of HFOs in long-term recordings with respect to the sleep-wake cycle and anatomic regions to verify previous results based on observations from short intervals and patients mainly with temporal lobe epilepsy to the analysis of hours of recordings and focal epilepsies with extratemporal origin. MethodsAutomatic HFO detection using a radial basis function neural network detector was performed in long-term recordings of 15 presurgical patients investigated with subdural strip, grid, and depth contacts. Periods with visual marked sleep stages based on parallel scalp recordings from two consecutive nights were compared to awake intervals. Statistical analysis was based on the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank correlations. ResultsHFO rates in seizure-onset contacts differed from other brain regions independent of the sleep-wake cycle. For temporal contacts, the HFO rate increased significantly with sleep stage. In addition, contacts covering the parietal lobe, including rolandic cortex, showed a significant increase of HFO rates during sleep. However, no significant HFO rate changes depending on the sleep-wake cycle were found for frontal contacts. SignificanceThe rate of interictal HFOs predicted the SOZ with statistical significance at the group level, but properties other than the HFO rate may need to be considered to improve the diagnostic utility of HFOs. This study gives evidence that the modulation of HFO rates by states of the sleep-wake cycle has particular characteristics within different neocortical regions and in mesiotemporal structures, and contributes to the establishment of HFOs as a biomarker in epilepsy.

Stimulus train duration but not attention moderates gamma-band entrainment abnormalities in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Auditory; Steady-state; Gamma; Attention	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PROCESSING DYSFUNCTION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PERCEPTION; AMPLITUDE; COGNITION; DYNAMICS; RANGE	Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies of auditory steady-state responses (aSSRs) non-invasively probe gamma-band (40-Hz) oscillatory capacity in sensory cortexwith high signal-to-noise ratio. Consistent reports of reduced 40-Hz aSSRs in persons with schizophrenia (SZ) indicate its potential as an efficient biomarker for the disease, but studies have been limited to passive or indirect listening contexts with stereotypically short (500 ms) stimulus trains. An inability to modulate sensorineural processing in accord with behavioral goals or within the sensory environmental context may represent a fundamental deficit in SZ, but whether and how this deficit relates to reduced aSSRs is unknown. We systematically varied stimulus duration and attentional contexts to further mature the 40-Hz aSSR as biomarker for future translational or mechanistic studies. Eighteen SZ and 18 healthy subjects (H) were presented binaural pure-tones with or without sinusoidal amplitude modulation at 40-Hz. Stimulus duration (500-ms or 1500-ms) and attention (via a button press task) were varied across 4 separate blocks. Evoked potentials recorded with dense-array EEGs were analyzed in the time-frequency domain. SZ displayed reduced 40-Hz aSSRs to typical stimulation parameters, replicating previous findings. In H, aSSRs were reduced when stimuli were presented in longer trains and were slightly enhanced by attention. Only the former modulation was impaired in SZ and correlated with sensory discrimination performance. Thus, gamma-band aSSRs are modulated by both attentional and stimulus duration contexts, but only modulations related to physical stimulus properties are abnormal in SZ, supporting its status as a biomarker of psychotic perceptual disturbance involving non-attentional sensori-cortical circuits.

Methods: Lithium-pilocarpine-induced chronic epileptic rats were used in the present study. Animals were given levetiracetam (LEV), LEV + SB202190, LEV + BQ788, SB202190 or BQ788 over a 3-day period using an osmotic pump. Seizure activity was recorded by video-EEG monitoring with 2 h of recording per day at the same time of day. We also performed western blot after EEG analysis. Results: Compared to control animals, PGP, ETB receptor and p38MAPK expression was increased in the hippocampus of epileptic animals. Neither SB202190 nor BQ788 affected the spontaneous seizure activity in epileptic rats. Three of ten rats were responders and achieved complete seizure control or significant reduction in seizure activity by LEV. In four of ten rats, seizure frequency was unaltered by LEV (non-responders). LEV + SB202190 reduced seizure duration, but not seizure frequency, in both responders and non-responders. LEV + BQ788 alleviated seizure frequency and seizure duration in both responders and non-responders. Compared to responders, PGP and ETB receptor expression was enhanced in the hippocampus of non-responders. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first indications of the role of ETB receptor in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Therefore, the present data suggest that the regulation of the ETB receptor-mediated signaling pathway may be important for identification of new therapeutic strategies for improving antiepileptic drug efficacy.

Melatonin improves sleep in children with epilepsy: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Seizure frequency; Sleep latency; WASO; Sleep architecture; Natural supplement; EEG spikes	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; DISORDERS; INSOMNIA; BEHAVIOR; QUESTIONNAIRE; INDIVIDUALS; METABOLISM	Objective: Insomnia, especially maintenance insomnia, is widely prevalent in epilepsy. Although melatonin is commonly used, limited data address its efficacy. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to identify the effects of melatonin on sleep and seizure control in children with epilepsy. Methods: Eleven prepubertal, developmentally normal children aged 6-11 years with epilepsy were randomized by a software algorithm to receive placebo or a 9-mg sustained release (SR) melatonin formulation for four weeks, followed by a one-week washout and a four-week crossover condition. The pharmacy performed blinding; patients, parents, and study staff other than a statistician were blinded. The primary outcomes were sleep onset latency and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) measured on polysomnography. The secondary outcomes included seizure frequency, epileptiform spike density per hour of sleep on electroencephalogram (EEG), and reaction time (RT) measures on psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Statistical tests appropriate for crossover designs were used for the analysis. Results: Data were analyzed from 10 subjects who completed the study. Melatonin decreased sleep latency (mean difference, MD, of 11.4 min and p = 0.02) and WASO (MD of 22 min and p = 0.04) as compared to placebo. No worsening of spike density or seizure frequency was seen. Additionally, slow-wave sleep duration and rapid eye movement (REM) latency were increased with melatonin and REM sleep duration was decreased. These changes were statistically significant. Worsening of headache was noted in one subject with migraine on melatonin. Conclusion: SR melatonin resulted in statistically significant decreases in sleep latency and WASO. No clear effects on seizures were observed, but the study was too small to allow any conclusions to be drawn in this regard. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among these methods, the ones that quantify synchronization between brain areas, are the most important methods. However, to date, a practically acceptable result has not been reported. In this paper, we use a synchronization measurement method that is derived according to the ability of bi-spectrum in determining the nonlinear properties of a system. In this method, first, temporal variation of the bi-spectrum of different channels of electro cardiography (ECoG) signals are obtained via an extended wavelet-based time-frequency analysis method; then, to compare different channels, the bi-phase correlation measure is introduced. Since, in this way, the temporal variation of the amount of nonlinear coupling between brain regions, which have not been considered yet, are taken into account, results are more reliable than the conventional phase-synchronization measures. It is shown that, for 21 patients of FSPEEG database, bi-phase correlation can discriminate the pre-ictal and ictal states, with very low false positive rates (FPRs) (average: 0.078/h) and high sensitivity (100%). However, the proposed seizure predictor still cannot significantly overcome the random predictor for all patients.

Neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) are hallmarks of such critical dynamics in neuronal activity and occur at fast (subsecond) and slow (seconds to hours) timescales, respectively. The critical dynamics at different timescales can be characterized by their power-law scaling exponents. However, insight into the avalanche dynamics and LRTCs in the human brain has been largely obtained with sensor-level MEG and EEG recordings, which yield only limited anatomical insight and results confounded by signal mixing. We investigated here the relationship between the human neuronal dynamics at fast and slow timescales using both source-reconstructed MEG and intracranial stereotactical electroencephalography (SEEG). Both MEG and SEEG revealed avalanche dynamics that were characterized parameter-dependently by power-law or truncated-power-law size distributions. Both methods also revealed robust LRTCs throughout the neocortex with distinct scaling exponents in different functional brain systems and frequency bands. The exponents of power-law regimen neuronal avalanches and LRTCs were strongly correlated across subjects. Qualitatively similar power-law correlations were also observed in surrogate data without spatial correlations but with scaling exponents distinct from those of original data. Furthermore, we found that LRTCs in the autonomous nervous system, as indexed by heart-rate variability, were correlated in a complex manner with cortical neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in MEG but not SEEG. These scalp and intracranial data hence show that power-law scaling behavior is a pervasive but neuroanatomically inhomogeneous property of neuronal dynamics in central and autonomous nervous systems.

J.; Reichenbach, Tobias			The steady-state response of the cerebral cortex to the beat of music reflects both the comprehension of music and attention	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory neuroscience; auditory cognition; auditory cortex; music processing; cortical response; cortical oscillations; auditory attention	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; CONGENITAL AMUSIA; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPEECH; BRAIN; EEG; PERCEPTION; SYNTAX	The brain's analyses of speech and music share a range of neural resources and mechanisms. Music displays a temporal structure of complexity similar to that of speech, unfolds over comparable timescales, and elicits cognitive demands in tasks involving comprehension and attention. During speech processing, synchronized neural activity of the cerebral cortex in the delta and theta frequency bands tracks the envelope of a speech signal, and this neural activity is modulated by high-level cortical functions such as speech comprehension and attention. It remains unclear, however, whether the cortex also responds to the natural rhythmic structure of music and how the response, if present, is influenced by higher cognitive processes. Here we employ electroencephalography to show that the cortex responds to the beat of music and that this steady-state response reflects musical comprehension and attention. We show that the cortical response to the beat is weaker when subjects listen to a familiar tune than when they listen to an unfamiliar, non-sensical musical piece. Furthermore, we show that in a task of intermodal attention there is a larger neural response at the beat frequency when subjects attend to a musical stimulus than when they ignore the auditory signal and instead focus on a visual one. Our findings may be applied in clinical assessments of auditory processing and music cognition as well as in the construction of auditory brain-machine interfaces.

J	Elmer, S; Rogenmoser, L; Kuhnis, J; Jancke, L				Elmer, Stefan; Rogenmoser, Lars; Kuehnis, Juerg; Jaencke, Lutz			Bridging the Gap between Perceptual and Cognitive Perspectives on Absolute Pitch	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						absolute pitch; associative memory; intracerebral functional connectivity; pitch labeling; resting-state EEG; theta phase synchronization	AUDITORY-CORTEX; RELATIVE PITCH; CORTICAL THICKNESS; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; CODING STRATEGIES; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; MUSICIANS	Absolute pitch (AP) refers to the rare ability to identify the chroma of a tone or to produce a specific pitch without reference to keyality (e. g., G or C). Previously, AP has been proposed to rely on the distinctive functional-anatomical architecture of the left auditory-related cortex (ARC), this specific trait possibly enabling an optimized early "categorical perception". In contrast, currently prevailing models of AP postulate that cognitive rather than perceptual processes, namely "pitch labeling" mechanisms, more likely constitute the bearing skeleton of AP. This associative memory component has previously been proposed to be dependent, among other mechanisms, on the recruitment of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as on the integrity of the left arcuate fasciculus, a fiber bundle linking the posterior supratemporal plane with the DLPFC. Here, we attempted to integrate these two apparently conflicting perspectives on AP, namely early "categorical perception" and "pitch labeling". We used electroencephalography and evaluated resting-state intracranial functional connectivity between the leftARCand DLPFC in a sample of musicians with and without AP. Results demonstrate significantly increased left-hemispheric theta phase synchronization in AP compared with non-AP musicians. Within the AP group, this specific electrophysiological marker was predictive of absolute-hearing behavior and explained similar to 30% of variance. Thus, we propose that in AP subjects the tonal inputs and the corresponding mnemonic representations are tightly coupled in such a manner that the distinctive electrophysiological signature of AP can saliently be detected in only 3 min of resting-state measurements.

Yet, schizophrenia-like experiences (schizotypy) are very common in the healthy population, indicating a continuum between normal mental functioning and the psychosis found in schizophrenic patients. A continuum between schizotypy and schizophrenia would be supported if they share the same neurobiological origin. Two such neurobiological markers of schizophrenia are: (1) a reduction of sleep spindles (12-15 Hz oscillations during nonrapid eye movement sleep), likely reflecting deficits in thalamo-cortical circuits and (2) increased glutamine and glutamate (Glx) levels in the thalamus. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether sleep spindles and Glx levels are related to schizotypal personality traits in healthy subjects. Methods: Twenty young male subjects underwent 2 all-night sleep electroencephalography recordings (128 electrodes). Sleep spindles were detected automatically. After those 2 nights, thalamic Glx levels were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subjects completed a magical ideation scale to assess schizotypy. Results: Sleep spindle density was negatively correlated with magical ideation (r = -.64, P < .01) and thalamic Glx levels (r = -.70, P < .005). No correlation was found between Glx levels in the thalamus and magical ideation (r = .12, P > .1). Conclusions: The common relationship of sleep spindle density with schizotypy and thalamic Glx levels indicates a neurobiological overlap between nonclinical schizotypy and schizophrenia. Thus, sleep spindle density and magical ideation may reflect the anatomy and efficiency of the thalamo-cortical system that shows pronounced impairment in patients with schizophrenia.

Robust disruptions in electroencephalogram cortical oscillations and large-scale functional networks in autism	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						ASD; EEG; Functional networks; Biomarker; Classification; Autism; Power spectra; Validation	COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; INFANT EEG ACTIVITY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; PROMISING APPROACH; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly prevalent and have a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families. Currently, the diagnosis is determined by clinical judgment and no definitive physiological biomarker for ASD exists. Quantitative biomarkers obtainable from clinical neuroimaging data - such as the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) - would provide an important aid to clinicians in the diagnosis of ASD. The interpretation of prior studies in this area has been limited by mixed results and the lack of validation procedures. Here we use retrospective clinical data from a well-characterized population of children with ASD to evaluate the rhythms and coupling patterns present in the EEG to develop and validate an electrophysiological biomarker of ASD. Methods: EEG data were acquired from a population of ASD (n = 27) and control (n = 55) children 4-8 years old. Data were divided into training (n = 13 ASD, n = 24 control) and validation (n = 14 ASD, n = 31 control) groups. Evaluation of spectral and functional network properties in the first group of patients motivated three biomarkers that were computed in the second group of age-matched patients for validation. Results: Three biomarkers of ASD were identified in the first patient group: (1) reduced posterior/anterior power ratio in the alpha frequency range (8-14 Hz), which we label the "peak alpha ratio", (2) reduced global density in functional networks, and (3) a reduction in the mean connectivity strength of a subset of functional network edges. Of these three biomarkers, the first and third were validated in a second group of patients. Using the two validated biomarkers, we were able to classify ASD subjects with 83 % sensitivity and 68 % specificity in a post-hoc analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that clinical EEG can provide quantitative biomarkers to assist diagnosis of autism. These results corroborate the general finding that ASD subjects have decreased alpha power gradients and network connectivities compared to control subjects. In addition, this study demonstrates the necessity of using statistical techniques to validate EEG biomarkers identified using exploratory methods.

RETRACTED: Visual Causality Judgments Correlate with the Phase of Alpha Oscillations (Retracted article. See vol. 32, pg. 1212, 2020)	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Retracted Publication							LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ENTRAINMENT; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; MECHANISM	The detection of causality is essential for our understanding of whether distinct events relate. A central requirement for the sensation of causality is temporal contiguity: As the interval between events increases, causality ratings decrease; for intervals longer than approximately 100 msec, the events start to appear independent. It has been suggested that this effect might be due to perception relying on discrete processing. According to this view, two events may be judged as sequential or simultaneous depending on their temporal relationship within a discrete neuronal process. To assess if alpha oscillations underlie this discrete neuronal process, we investigated how these oscillations modulate the judgment of causality. We used the classic launching effect with concurrent recording of EEG signal. In each trial, a disk moved horizontally toward a second disk at the center of the screen and stopped when they touched each other. After a delay that varied between 0 and 400 msec after contact, the right disk began to move. Participants were instructed to judge whether or not they had a feeling that the first disk caused the movement of the second disk. We found that frontocentral alpha phase significantly biased causality estimates. Moreover, we found that alpha phase was concentrated around different angles for trials in which participants judged events as causally related versus not causally related. We conclude that alpha phase plays a key role in biasing causality judgments.	[Cravo, Andre Mascioli; Santos, Karin Moreira; Reyes, Marcelo Bussotti; Caetano, Marcelo Salvador; Claessens, Peter M.

J	Cecere, R; Rees, G; Romei, V				Cecere, Roberto; Rees, Geraint; Romei, Vincenzo			Individual Differences in Alpha Frequency Drive Crossmodal Illusory Perception	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; HUMAN V1; OSCILLATIONS; TIME; VENTRILOQUISM; INTEGRATION; CORTICES; SPACE; RESET	Perception routinely integrates inputs from different senses. Stimulus temporal proximity critically determines whether or not these inputs are bound together. Despite the temporal window of integration being a widely accepted notion, its neurophysiological substrate remains unclear. Many types of common audio-visual interactions occur within a time window of similar to 100 ms [1-5]. For example, in the sound-induced double-flash illusion, when two beeps are presented within similar to 100 ms together with one flash, a second illusory flash is often perceived [2]. Due to their intrinsic rhythmic nature, brain oscillations are one candidate mechanism for gating the temporal window of integration. Interestingly, occipital alpha band oscillations cycle on average every similar to 100 ms, with peak frequencies ranging between 8 and 14 Hz (i.e., 120-60 ms cycle). Moreover, presenting a brief tone can phase-reset such oscillations in visual cortex [6, 7]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the duration of each alpha cycle might provide the temporal unit to bind audio-visual events. Here, we first recorded EEG while participants performed the sound-induced double-flash illusion task [4] and found positive correlation between individual alpha frequency (IAF) peak and the size of the temporal window of the illusion. Participants then performed the same task while receiving occipital transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), to modulate oscillatory activity [8] either at their IAF or at off-peak alpha frequencies (IAF +/- 2 Hz). Compared to IAF tACS, IAF-2 Hz and IAF+2 Hz tACS, respectively, enlarged and shrunk the temporal window of illusion, suggesting that alpha oscillations might represent the temporal unit of visual processing that cyclically gates perception and the neurophysiological substrate promoting audio-visual interactions.

The goal of this study is to increase the number of targets using fewer stimulation high frequencies, with diminishing subject's fatigue and reducing the risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures. The new paradigm is HighFrequency Combination Coding-Based High-Frequency Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (HFCC-SSVEP). Firstly, we studied SSVEP high frequency(beyond 25 Hz) response of SSVEP, whose paradigm is presented on the LED. The SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of high frequency(beyond 40 Hz) response is very low, which is been unable to be distinguished through the traditional analysis method; Secondly we investigated the HFCC-SSVEP response (beyond 25 Hz) for 3 frequencies (25Hz, 33.33Hz, and 40Hz), HFCC-SSVEP produces nn with n high stimulation frequencies through Frequence Combination Code. Further, Animproved Hilbert-huang transform (IHHT)-based variable frequency EEG feature extraction method and a local spectrum extreme target identification algorithmare adopted to extract timefrequency feature of the proposed HFCC-SSVEP response. Linear predictions and fixed sifting (iterating) 10 time is used to overcome the shortage of end effect and stopping criterion, generalized zero-crossing (GZC) is used to compute the instantaneous frequency of the proposed SSVEP respondent signals, the improved HHT-based feature extraction method for the proposed SSVEP paradigm in this study increases recognition efficiency, so as to improve ITR and to increase the stability of the BCI system. what is more, SSVEPs evoked by high-frequency stimuli (beyond 25Hz) minimally diminish subject's fatigue and prevent safety hazards linked to photo-induced epileptic seizures, So as to ensure the system efficiency and undamaging. This study tests three subjects in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

Methods: For inducing amygdala kindling and deep brain stimulation, bipolar stainless-steel electrodes were implanted in SD rats into right basolateral amygdala and right GPe, respectively. The effects of deep brain stimulation were evaluated in the amygdala kindling model, maximal electroshock model (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model. Moreover, the background EEGs in the amygdala and GPe were recorded. Results: Low-frequency stimulation (0.1 ms, 1 Hz, 15 min) at the GPe slowed the progression of seizure stages and shortened the after-discharge duration (ADD) during kindling acquisition. Furthermore, low-frequency stimulation significantly decreased the incidence of generalized seizures, suppressed the average stage, and shortened the cumulative ADD and generalized seizure duration in fully kindled rats. In addition, low-frequency stimulation significantly suppressed the average stage of MES-induced seizures and increased the latency to generalized seizures in the PTZ model. High-frequency stimulation (0.1 ms, 130 Hz, 5 min) at the GPe had no anti-epileptic effect and even aggravated epileptogenesis induced by amygdala kindling. EEG analysis showed that low-frequency stimulation at the GPe reversed the increase in delta power, whereas high-frequency stimulation at the GPe had no such effect. Conclusion: Low-frequency stimulation, but not high-frequency stimulation, at the GPe exerts therapeutic effect on temporal lobe epilepsy and tonic-colonic generalized seizures, which may be due to interference with delta rhythms. The results suggest that modulation of GPe activity using low-frequency stimulation or drugs may be a promising epilepsy treatment.

MethodsThe recording or stimulation electrodes were implanted into both hippocampi (CA1 area). Using the kainic acid (chronic: experiment duration 24days) and the 4-aminopyridine (acute: experiment duration 2h) models of paroxysms in rats, a real-time feedback stimulation paradigm was implemented, which triggered a short periodic electrical stimulus (5Hz for 5s) upon detecting a seizure precursor. Our seizure precursor detection algorithm relied on the monitoring of the real-time phase synchronization analysis, and detected/anticipated electrographic seizures as early as a few seconds to a few minutes before the behavioral and electrographic seizure onset, with a very low false-positive rate of the detection. ResultsThe baseline mean seizure frequencies were 5.39 seizures per day (chronic) and 13.2 seizures per hour (acute). The phase synchrony analysis detected 88% (434 of 494) of seizures with a mean false alarm of 0.67 per day (chronic) and 83% (86 of 104) of seizures with a mean false alarm of 0.47 per hour (acute). The feedback stimulation reduced the seizure frequencies to 0.41 seizures per day (chronic) and 2.4 seizures per hour (acute). Overall, the feedback stimulation paradigm reduced seizure frequency by a minimum of 80% to a maximum of 100% in 10 rats, with 83% of the animals rendered seizure-free. SignificanceThis approach represents a simple and efficient manner for stopping seizure development. Because of the short on-demand stimuli, few or no associated side effects are expected in clinical application in patients with epilepsy. Abnormal synchrony patterns are common features in epilepsy and other neurologic and psychiatric syndromes; therefore, this type of feedback stimulation paradigm could be a novel therapeutic modality for use in various neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

Infusion of A beta(1-42) protein (1.5 mu l) into the CA1 region two weeks before EEG testing diminished hippocampal theta (3.8-8.4 Hz) predominance and eliminated cortical beta (12.9-26.2 Hz) predominance observed in baseline EEG of rats infused with saline (control) or with C60HyFn alone. In contrast, these A beta(1-42) effects were abolished in rats pretreated with C(60)HyFn, 30 min apart. Dopaminergic mediation in AD has been shown to be involved in neuronal plasticity and A beta transformation in different ways. To clarify its role in the cortex-hippocampus interplay in the A beta model of AD, we used peripheral injection of a dopamine agonist, apomorphine (APO), at a low dose (0.1 mg/kg). In rats infused with C(60)HyFn or A beta(1-42) alone, APO attenuated the cortical beta predominance, with immediate and delayed phases evident in the A beta(1-42)-rats. Pretreatment with C(60)HyFn diminished the APO effect in the A beta(1-42)-treated rats. Thus, we show that intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42) dramatically disrupts cortical versus hippocampal EEG interrelations and that pretreatment with the fullerene eliminates this abnormality. We suggest that some effects of C(60)HyFn may be mediated through presynaptic dopamine receptors and that water-soluble C-60 fullerenes have a neuroprotective potential.

Based on a modified spatially-extended Taylor & Baier neural field model, we here propose a computational framework to mathematically describe the transition dynamics between these epileptic seizures. We first demonstrate the existence of various transition types that are induced by disinhibitory functions between two inhibitory variables in an isolated Taylor & Baier model. Moreover, we show that these disinhibition-induced transitions can lead to stable tonic-clonic oscillations as well as periodic spike with slow-wave discharges, which are the hallmark of absence seizures. We also observe fascinating dynamical states, such as periodic 2-spike with slow-wave discharges, tonic death, bursting oscillations, as well as saturated firing. Most importantly, we identify paths that represent physiologically plausible transitions between absence and tonic-clonic seizures in the modified spatially-extended Taylor & Baier model.

Frequency Band-Specific Electrical Brain Stimulation Modulates Cognitive Control Processes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INCREASES THETA ENERGY; MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; HIGHER RESPONSE-TIME; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ADAPTATION	A large body of findings has tied midfrontal theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillatory activity to adaptive control mechanisms during response conflict. Thus far, this evidence has been correlational. To evaluate whether theta oscillations are causally involved in conflict processing, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the theta band to a midfrontal scalp region, while human subjects performed a spatial response conflict task. Conflict was introduced by incongruency between the location of the target stimulus and the required response hand. As a control condition, we used alpha-band (8-12 Hz) tACS over the same location. The exact stimulation frequencies were determined empirically for each subject based on a pre-stimulation EEG session. Behavioral results showed general conflict effects of slower response times (RT) and lower accuracy for high conflict trials compared to low conflict trials. Importantly, this conflict effect was reduced specifically during theta tACS, which was driven by slower response times on low conflict trials. These results show how theta tACS can modulate adaptive cognitive control processes, which is in accordance with the view of midfrontal theta oscillations as an active mechanism for cognitive control.

In the present study we addressed this by investigating the effect of cognitive stimulation on interictal high frequency oscillations in the ripple range (80-250 Hz) within epileptic (EH) and non-epileptic hippocampus (NH). Methods: We analyzed depth EEG recordings in 10 patients with intractable epilepsy, in whom hippocampal activity was recorded initially during quiet wakefulness and subsequently during a simple cognitive task. Using automated detection of ripples based on amplitude of the power envelope, we analyzed ripple rate (RR) in the cognitive and resting period, within EH and NH. Results: Compared to quiet wakefulness we observed a significant reduction of RR during cognitive stimulation in EH, while it remained statistically marginal in NH. Further, we investigated the direct impact of cognitive stimuli on ripples (i.e. immediately post-stimulus), which showed a transient statistically significant suppression of ripples in the first second after stimuli onset in NH only. Conclusion: Our results point to a differential reactivity of ripples within EH and NH to cognitive stimulation.

This chapter reviews information that is fundamental for the complete and comprehensive understanding of this complex interdisciplinary research field, namely an overview of the motor system, an overview of recent findings in neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies of the motor cortical anatomy and networks, and the engineering approaches used to analyze motor cortical signals and translate them into control signals that computer programs and devices can interpret. Specifically, the anatomy and physiology of the human motor system, focusing on the brain areas and spinal elements involved in the generation of volitional movements is reviewed. The stage is then set for introducing human prototypical motion attributes, sensorimotor learning, and several computational models suggested to explain psychophysical motor phenomena based on the current knowledge in the field of neurophysiology. An introduction to invasive and non-invasive neural recording techniques, including functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and sMRI), electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), intracortical single unit activity (SU) and multiple unit extracellular recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is integrated with coverage aimed at elucidating what is known about sensory motor oscillations and brain anatomy, which are used to generate control signals for brain actuated devices and alternative communication in BCI. Emphasis is on latest findings in these topics and on highlighting what information is accessible at each of the different scales and the levels of activity that are discernible or utilizable for the effective control of devices using intentional activation sensorimotor neurons and/or modulation of sensorimotor rhythms and oscillations. The nature, advantages, and drawbacks of various approaches and their suggested functions as the neural correlates of various spatiotemporal motion attributes are reviewed. Sections dealing with signal analysis techniques, translation algorithms, and adaption to the brain's non-stationary dynamics present the reader with a wide-ranging review of the mathematical and statistical techniques commonly used to extract and classify the bulk of neural information recorded by the various recording techniques and the challenges that are posed for deploying BCI systems for their intended uses, be it alternative communication and control, assistive technologies, neurorehabilitation, neurorestoration or replacement, or recreation and entertainment, among other applications. Lastly, a discussion is presented on the future of the field, highlighting newly emerging research directions and their potential ability to enhance our understanding of the human brain and specifically the human motor system and ultimately how that knowledge may lead to more advanced and intelligent computational systems.

Effects of Feedback Latency on P300-based Brain-computer Interface	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Feedback has been shown to affect performance when using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on sensorimotor rhythms. In contrast, little is known about the influence of feedback on P300-based BCIs. There is still an open question whether feedback affects the regulation of P300 and consequently the operation of P300-based BCIs. In this paper, for the first time, the influence of feedback on the P300-based BCI speller task is systematically assessed. For this purpose, 24 healthy participants performed the classic P300-based BCI speller task, while only half of them received feedback. Importantly, the number of flashes per letter was reduced on a regular basis in order to increase the frequency of providing feedback. Experimental results showed that feedback could significantly improve the P300-based BCI speller performance, if it was provided in short time intervals (e.g. in sequences as short as 4 to 6 flashes per row/column). Moreover, our offline analysis showed that providing feedback remarkably enhanced the relevant ERP patterns and attenuated the irrelevant ERP patterns, such that the discrimination between target and nontarget EEG trials increased.

We compared AO and MI in promoting early learning of a complex four-limb, hand foot coordination task, using electroencephalographic (EEG) and kinematic analysis. Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned into three groups to perform a training period in which AO watched a video of the task, MI had to imagine it, and Control (C) was involved in a distracting computation task. Subjects were then asked to actually perform the motor task with kinematic measurement of error time with respect to the correct motor performance. EEG was recorded during baseline, training and task execution, with task-related power (TRPow) calculation for sensorimotor (alpha and beta) rhythms reactive with respect to rest. During training, the AO group had a stronger alpha desynchronization than the MI and C over frontocentral and bilateral parietal areas. However, during task execution, AO group had greater beta synchronization over bilateral parietal regions than MI and C groups. This beta synchrony furthermore demonstrated the strongest association with kinematic errors, which was also significantly lower in AO than in MI. These data suggest that sensorimotor activation elicited by action observation enhanced motor learning according to motor performance, corresponding to a more efficient activation of cortical resources during task execution. Action observation may be more effective than motor imagery in promoting early learning of a new complex coordination task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Increasing evidence suggests that both motor and sensory functions are regulated by rhythmic processes reflecting alternating states of neuronal excitability, and these may be involved in mediating sensory-motor interactions. Here we show an oscillatory fluctuation in early visual processing time locked with the execution of voluntary action, and, crucially, even for visual stimuli irrelevant to the motor task. Human participants were asked to perform a reaching movement toward a display and judge the orientation of a Gabor patch, near contrast threshold, briefly presented at random times before and during the reaching movement. When the data are temporally aligned to the onset of movement, visual contrast sensitivity oscillates with periodicity within the theta band. Importantly, the oscillations emerge during the motor planning stage, similar to 500 ms before movement onset. We suggest that brain oscillatory dynamics may mediate an automatic coupling between early motor planning and early visual processing, possibly instrumental in linking and closing up the visual-motor control loop.

In particular, while rTMS interference over vIPS impaired target discrimination at contralateral attended locations, interference over mSPL affected performance following shifts of attention regardless of the visual field (Capotosto et al., 2013). Here, using rTMS interference in conjunction with EEG recordings of brain rhythms during the presentation of cues that indicate to either shift or maintain spatial attention, we tested whether this functional anatomical segregation involves different mechanisms of rhythm synchronization. The transient inactivation of vIPS reduced the amplitude of the expected parieto-occipital low-alpha (8 - 10 Hz) desynchronization contralateral to the cued location. Conversely, the transient inactivation of mSPL, compared with vIPS, reduced the high-alpha (10 - 12 Hz) desynchronization induced by shifting attention into both visual fields. Furthermore, rTMS induced a frequency-specific delay of task-related modulation of brain rhythms. Specifically, rTMS over vIPS or mSPL during maintenance (stay cues) or shifting (shift cues) of spatial attention, respectively, caused a delay of alpha parieto-occipital desynchronization. Moreover, rTMS over vIPS during stay cues caused a delay of delta (2-4 Hz) frontocentral synchronization. These findings further support the anatomo-functional subdivision of the dorsal attention network in subsystems devoted to shifting or maintaining covert visuospatial attention and indicate that these mechanisms operate in different frequency channels linking frontal to parieto-occipital visual regions.

All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.

Age-related decrease in theta and gamma coherence across dorsal ca1 pyramidale and radiatum layers	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						local field potentials; oscillations; hippocampus; encoding; novelty; physostigmine; EEG; cholinergic	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; SEPTOTEMPORAL AXIS; FIELD POTENTIALS; MEMORY TASK; OSCILLATIONS; RETRIEVAL; RHYTHM; CELLS; ACETYLCHOLINE; ORGANIZATION	In both humans and rodents, aging is linked to impairments in hippocampus dependent learning. Given such deficits, one would expect corresponding changes in hippocampal local field potentials, which represent the integration of multiple inputs onto a given dendritic field within the hippocampus. The current experiment examined coherence of theta and gamma in young and aged rats at sub-millimeter and millimeter distant locations both within and across layers in CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. The degree to which different dendritic layers show coherent oscillations indicates the uniformity of the inputs and local circuitry, and may form an important element for processing information. Aged rats had lower coherence in all frequency ranges; this was most marked within a layer as the distance between electrodes increased. Notably, unlike younger rats, in the aged rats coherence was not affected by running on the maze. Furthermore, despite the previously reported effects of cholinergic activation on theta frequency and power, there was no effect of the cholinomimetic physostigmine on coherence. These data indicate an age related fragmentation in hippocampal processing that may underlie some of the observed learning and memory deficits. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is thought to be metabolically beneficial to align ongoing oscillatory activity to the relevant inputs in a predictable stream, so that they will enter at optimal processing phases of the spontaneously occurring rhythmic excitability fluctuations. However, some contexts have a more predictable temporal structure than others. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the processing of rhythmic sounds is more efficient than the processing of irregularly timed sounds. To do this, we simultaneously measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electro-encephalograms (EEG) while participants detected oddball target sounds in alternating blocks of rhythmic (e.g., with equal inter-stimulus intervals) or random (e.g., with randomly varied inter-stimulus intervals) tone sequences. Behaviorally, participants detected target sounds faster and more accurately when embedded in rhythmic streams. The fMRI response in the auditory cortex was stronger during random compared to random tone sequence processing. Simultaneously recorded N1 responses showed larger peak amplitudes and longer latencies for tones in the random (vs. the rhythmic) streams. These results reveal complementary evidence for more efficient neural and perceptual processing during temporally predictable sensory contexts.

The effect of brief BB stimulation on scalp EEG is not conclusively demonstrated. Further, no studies have examined the impact of musical training associated with BB stimulation, yet musicians' brains are often associated with enhanced auditory processing. In this study, we analysed EEG brain responses from two groups, musicians and non-musicians, when stimulated by short presentation (1 min) of binaural beats with beat frequency varying from 1 Hz to 48 Hz. We focused our analysis on alpha and gamma band EEG signals, and they were analysed in terms of spectral power, and functional connectivity as measured by two phase synchrony based measures, phase locking value and phase lag index. Finally, these measures were used to characterize the degree of centrality, segregation and integration of the functional brain network. We found that beat frequencies belonging to alpha band produced the most significant steady-state responses across groups. Further, processing of low frequency (delta, theta, alpha) binaural beats had significant impact on cortical network patterns in the alpha band oscillations. Altogether these results provide a neurophysiological account of cortical responses to BB stimulation at varying frequencies, and demonstrate a modulation of cortico-cortical connectivity in musicians' brains, and further suggest a kind of neuronal entrainment of a linear and nonlinear relationship to the beating frequencies.

EEG functional connectivity is partially predicted by underlying white matter connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Probabilistic tractography; Electrical source imaging; Structural networks; DTI; High density EEG	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; MATURATION; SYNCHRONY; OPTIMIZATION; DYNAMICS; NEURONS; CORTEX	Over the past decade, networks have become a leading model to illustrate both the anatomical relationships (structural networks) and the coupling of dynamic physiology (functional networks) linking separate brain regions. The relationship between these two levels of description remains incompletely understood and an area of intense research interest. In particular, it is unclear how cortical currents relate to underlying brain structural architecture. In addition, although theory suggests that brain communication is highly frequency dependent, how structural connections influence overlying functional connectivity in different frequency bands has not been previously explored. Here we relate functional networks inferred from statistical associations between source imaging of EEG activity and underlying cortico-cortical structural brain connectivity determined by probabilistic white matter tractography. We evaluate spontaneous fluctuating cortical brain activity over a long time scale (minutes) and relate inferred functional networks to underlying structural connectivity for broadband signals, as well as in seven distinct frequency bands. We find that cortical networks derived from source EEG estimates partially reflect both direct and indirect underlying white matter connectivity in all frequency bands evaluated. In addition, we find that when structural support is absent, functional connectivity is significantly reduced for high frequency bands compared to low frequency bands. The association between cortical currents and underlyingwhite matter connectivity highlights the obligatory interdependence of functional and structural networks in the human brain. The increased dependence on structural support for the coupling of higher frequency brain rhythms provides new evidence for how underlying anatomy directly shapes emergent brain dynamics at fast time scales.

Cardiovascular and nervous system changes during meditation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						meditation; heart rate variability; blood pressure; wireless sensor technology; personalized medicine	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Background: A number of benefits have been described for the long-term practice of meditation, yet little is known regarding the immediate neurological and cardiovascular responses to meditation. Wireless sensor technology allows, for the first time, multi-parameter and quantitative monitoring of an individual's responses during meditation. The present study examined inter-individual variations to meditation through continuous monitoring of EEG, blood pressure, heart rate and its variability (HRV) in novice and experienced meditators. Methods: Participants were 20 experienced and 20 novice meditators involved in a week-long wellness retreat. Monitoring took place during meditation sessions on the first and last full days of the retreat. All participants wore a patch that continuously streamed ECG data, while half of them also wore a wireless EEG headset plus a non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitor. Results: Meditation produced variable but characteristic EEG changes, significantly different from baseline, even among novice meditators on the first day. In addition, although participants were predominately normotensive, the mean arterial blood pressure fell a small (2-3 mmHg) but significant (p < 0.0001) amount during meditation. The effect of meditation on HRV was less clear and influenced by calculation technique and respiration. No clear relationship between EEG changes, HRV alterations, or mean blood pressure during meditation was found. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate neurological and cardiovascular responses during meditation in both novice and experienced meditators using novel, wearable, wireless devices. Meditation produced varied inter-individual physiologic responses. These results support the need for further investigation of the short- and long-term cardiovascular effects of mental calm and individualized ways to achieve it.

Traditional fMRI and EEG studies have helped identifying brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in these tasks. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic defects in prefrontal function per se contribute to poor performance in schizophrenia, given the presence of confounds like reduced motivation and psychotic symptoms. TMS/hd-EEG measurements are obtained without cognitive effort, and can be calculated in any cortical area. MethodsWe performed TMS/hd-EEG recordings in parietal, motor, premotor, and PFC in healthy individuals (N=20) and schizophrenia patients (N=20). Source modeling of TMS-evoked responses was performed, and measures of cortical activity (significant current density, SCD) and connectivity (significant current scattering, SCS) were computed. Patients with schizophrenia also performed Penn Word memory delayed (CPWd) and Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET). CPWd evaluates EM and involves primarily PFC, whereas PCET reflects EF and implicates PFC with other brain regions. FindingsWe found no difference in SCD and SCS after TMS of parietal/motor cortices, whereas those parameters were reduced in premotor/prefrontal areas in schizophrenia patients. In PFC, where these measures were most defective, SCD was negatively correlated with performance in CPWd whereas higher SCS values were associated with more errors in PCET. ConclusionThese findings indicate that schizophrenia patients have intrinsic defects in both activity and connectivity of PFC, and that these defects are specifically associated with impairments in cognitive abilities.

This work already provides compelling evidence that diverse cognitive functions are based on similar basic neuronal mechanisms. More recent data suggest that even cognitive functions realized only in human brains rely on these canonical neuronal mechanisms. Here we argue that language, like other cognitive functions, depends on distributed computations in specialized cortical areas forming large-scale dynamic networks and examine to what extent empirical results support this view.

J	Kong, YY; Somarowthu, A; Ding, N				Kong, Ying-Yee; Somarowthu, Ala; Ding, Nai			Effects of Spectral Degradation on Attentional Modulation of Cortical Auditory Responses to Continuous Speech	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						cortical entrainment; cochlear implant; spectral degradation; sound segregation; event-related potentials; auditory scene analysis	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COCKTAIL PARTY; ENTRAINMENT; CUES; RECOGNITION; CORTEX; SOUND	This study investigates the effect of spectral degradation on cortical speech encoding in complex auditory scenes. Young normal-hearing listeners were simultaneously presented with two speech streams and were instructed to attend to only one of them. The speech mixtures were subjected to noise-channel vocoding to preserve the temporal envelope and degrade the spectral information of speech. Each subject was tested with five spectral resolution conditions (unprocessed speech, 64-, 32-, 16-, and 8-channel vocoder conditions) and two target-to-masker ratio (TMR) conditions (3 and 0 dB). Ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and speech comprehension were measured in each spectral and TMR condition for each subject. Neural tracking of each speech stream was characterized by cross-correlating the EEG responses with the envelope of each of the simultaneous speech streams at different time lags. Results showed that spectral degradation and TMR both significantly influenced how top-down attention modulated the EEG responses to the attended and unattended speech. That is, the EEG responses to the attended and unattended speech streams differed more for the higher (unprocessed, 64 ch, and 32 ch) than the lower (16 and 8 ch) spectral resolution conditions, as well as for the higher (3 dB) than the lower TMR (0 dB) condition. The magnitude of differential neural modulation responses to the attended and unattended speech streams significantly correlated with speech comprehension scores. These results suggest that severe spectral degradation and low TMR hinder speech stream segregation, making it difficult to employ top-down attention to differentially process different speech streams.

Indeed the indubitable vantage of acquiring both the autonomic (arousal-related) and the central (cortical-related) activities stands in the possibility to better elucidate the reciprocal interplay of the two compartments. In the present study EEG (frequency band analysis), systemic SCR and heart rate (HR) were all recorded simultaneously with hemodynamic (NIRS, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) measurements as potential biological markers of emotions, related to both central and peripheral systems. These multiple measures were then related to the self-report correlates, that is the subjective appraisal in term of valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (high vs. low) by using SAM rating. Twenty subjects were submitted to emotional cues processing (IAPS) when fNIRS, frequency bands (alpha, beta, delta, theta), SCR and HR were recorded. As shown by O2Hb increasing within the right hemisphere, the contribution of prefrontal cortex was elucidated, by pointing out a relevant lateralization effect (more right-PFC activity) induced by the specific valence (negative) of the emotional patterns. Secondly, EEG activity (mainly low-frequency theta and delta bands) was intrinsically associated with the cortical. hemodynamic responsiveness to the negative emotional patterns, within the right side. Finally SCR increased mainly in response to negative patterns, and the autonomic behavior was related to explicit (SAM) and cortical (NIRS; EEG) activity. The intrinsic relationships between these three different levels are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Orienting attention during the maintenance period of STM by a retrospective cue (retro-cue) strengthens the representation of the cued item and improves the subsequent STM performance. In a recent article, Backer et al. (Backer KC, Binns MA, Alain C. J Neurosci 35: 1307-1318, 2015) extended these findings from the visual to the auditory domain and combined electroencephalography to dissociate neural mechanisms underlying feature-based and object-based attention orientation. Both event-related potentials and neural oscillations explained the behavioral benefits of retro-cues and favored the theory that feature-based and object-based attention orientation were independent.

On day 1, subjects implicitly learned the location of 39 objects by exploring a room and popping bubbles that hid the objects. On day 2, they again popped bubbles in the same environment. In most cases, the objects hidden underneath the bubbles were in the same place as on day 1. However, a varying third of them were misplaced in each block. Subjects indicated their certainty that the object was in the same location as the day before. Compared with bubble pops revealing correctly placed objects, bubble pops revealing misplaced objects evoked a decreased negativity starting at 145 ms, with scalp topography consistent with generation in medial parietal cortex. There was also an increased negativity starting at 515 ms to misplaced objects, with scalp topography consistent with generation in inferior temporal cortex. Additionally, misplaced objects elicited an increase in frontal midline theta power. These findings suggest that the successive neurocognitive stages of processing allocentric space may include an initial template matching, integration of the object within its spatial cognitive map, and memory recall, analogous to the processing negativity N400 and theta that support verbal cognitive maps in humans.

Cerebral activity was recorded using electroencephalograph in young and older individuals performing a spatial memory task that required the creation of cognitive maps. Power spectra were computed in the frontal and parietal regions and correlated with recognition performance. We found that accuracy of cognitive mapping was positively correlated with left frontal theta activity during encoding in young adults but not in older individuals. Compared with young adults, older participants were impaired in the creation of cognitive maps and showed reduced theta and alpha activity at encoding. These results suggest that encoding processes are impaired in older individual, which may explain age-related cognitive mapping deficits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This concern highlights the need for a personalized approach in the meditation practice adjusted for a concrete individual. This can be done by using an objective screening procedure that detects the weak and strong cognitive skills in brain function, thus helping design a tailored meditation training protocol. Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) is a suitable tool that allows identification of individual neurophysiological types. Using qEEG screening can aid developing a meditation training program that maximizes results and minimizes risk of potential negative effects. This brief theoretical-conceptual review provides a discussion of the problem and presents some illustrative results on the usage of qEEG screening for the guidance of mediation personalization.

The brain must judge a source event of these sensory informations and integrate them. It is thought that judging the simultaneity of such multisensory stimuli is an important cue when we discriminate whether the stimuli are derived from one event or not. Although previous studies have investigated the correspondence between an auditory-visual (AV) simultaneity perceptions and the neural responses, there are still few studies of this. Electrophysiological studies have reported that ongoing oscillations in human cortex affect perception. Especially, the phase resetting of ongoing oscillations has been examined as it plays an important role in multisensory integration. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of phase resetting for the judgment of AV simultaneity judgement tasks. The subjects were successively presented with auditory and visual stimuli with intervals that were controlled as and they were asked to report whether they perceived them simultaneously or not. We investigated the effects of the phase of ongoing oscillations on simultaneity judgments with AV stimuli with SOAs in which the detection rate of asynchrony was 50 %. It was found that phase resetting at the beta frequency band in the brain area that related to the modality of the following stimulus occurred after preceding stimulus onset only when the subjects perceived AV stimuli as simultaneous. This result suggested that beta phase resetting occurred in areas that are related to the subsequent stimulus, supporting perception multisensory stimuli as simultaneous.

Alpha and Theta Intensive Neurofeedback Protocol for Age-related Cognitive Deficits	2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 22-24, 2015	Montpellier, FRANCE	IEEE, EMBS			EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHM	With the growing life expectancy, the number of elderly people is increasing tremendously worldwide. The progressive decrease of synaptic plasticity and neuronal inter-connectivity in the ageing brain, concomitant with alterations in key cognitive abilities such as working memory and attention, may be delayed, stopped or reversed by neurorehabilitation. Hence, current approaches used to modify cognitive capabilities are of utmost importance to contemporary society and often divided into behavioral training procedures and techniques for direct modulation of neural mechanisms. Neurofeedback (NF), which is based on electroencephalogram signals, is used to train individuals on learning how to influence brain function by modulating their own brain rhythms. However, the potential effects of rehabilitation through behavioral training, neuromodulation and even a combined methodology are poorly understood. Differently from the frequently reported longer protocols, an alpha and theta intensive neurofeedback protocol was applied on 14 subjects ageing more than 55. Although the herein presented results suggest that the proposed protocol succeeded to modulate alpha and theta rhythms and led to moderate cognitive improvements, no modulation was apparent on post-training resting state EEG rhythms.

The view emerges, however, that they play complementary roles and may be more related than research recognizes. In the present study, participants (N = 52) created their own intelligence tasks: 3 x 3 matrices featuring relations between geometrical components. Using task related alpha synchronization, we demonstrated that intelligence integrates with creativity in a problem solving process evolving in open problem space. Activity was especially visible at prefrontal and frontal sites when information processing was most demanding, i.e., at the start of the creative process due to multiplicity of ideas, and at the end due to narrowing down alternatives. This research could open the way to an approach to cognition where intelligence-related abilities are studied in open problem spaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As most workers will not choose to spend their entire workday walking, this study investigated the short-term delayed effect of treadmill desk usage. An experiment was conducted in which participants either sat or walked while they read a text and received emails. Afterward, all participants performed a task to evaluate their attention and memory. Behavioral, neurophysiological, and perceptual evidence showed that participants who walked had a short-term increase in memory and attention, indicating that the use of a treadmill desk has a delayed effect. These findings suggest that the treadmill desk, in addition to having health benefits for workers, can also be beneficial for businesses by enhancing workforce performance. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Based on their very singular morphology, sleep spindles can be visually recognized and detected, even though this approach can lead to significant mis-detections. For this reason, many efforts have been put in developing a reliable algorithm for spindle automatic detection, and a number of methods, based on different techniques, have been tested via visual validation. This work aims at improving current pattern recognition procedures for sleep spindles detection by taking into account their physiological sources of variability. We provide a method as a synthesis of the current state of art that, improving dynamic threshold adaptation, is able to follow modification of spindle characteristics as a function of sleep depth and inter-subjects variability. The algorithm has been applied to physiological data recorded by a high density EEG in order to perform a validation based on visual inspection and on evaluation of expected results from normal night sleep in healthy subjects.

Beyond this original medical motivation the fusion of multiple modalities has created successful interesting research opportunities that have furthered our understanding of the brain and cognition[15]. In BCI recently multimodal fusion concepts have received great attention under the label hybrid BCI[13]. Fusing information has also been a very common practice in the sciences and engineering [17]. Recently a family of novel multimodal data analysis methods have emerged that can extract nonlinear relations between data[1,2,5-10]. They are rooted in the modern machine learning and signal processing techniques that are now available for analysing EEG, for decoding mental states etc[3,11,12,14,16]. The talk will first discuss recent multimodal analysis techniques such as SPoC[5-7]. Furthermore if time permits we will discuss a novel reliable method for estimating the Hurst exponent, a quantity that has recently become popular for describing network properties and is being used for diagnostic purposes [4]. Both nonlinear techniques allow for a better and more reliable and robust analysis of complex phenomena in neurophysiological data.

Applied to university learning, the demand towards students no longer focuses only in the results of the process but, ideally, in the development of individual styles based on cognitive preferences and learning strategies. Several tests such as Kolb and VAK or Hermann dominances allow distinguishing some learning styles such as: Divergent, Assimilator, Convergent and Accommodator; Visual; Kinesthetic; and Auditory. Meanwhile, by using electrophysiological tools like an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording it is now possible to measure individual differences in the varying electrical activity present in the cerebral cortex while a student face a cognitive problem or performs a test of intelligence. In this study, we tested 20 students from their early years of engineering to be classified in three systems of learning styles. The students were then subjected to a test of intelligence (Raven test, abbreviated version of 15 questions) with increasing levels of complexity. The time length to solve the test taken for students previously classified in four main styles yielded by the Kolb test, were analyzed. Then we grouped them by correspondences with the visual, auditory and kinesthetic predominance yielded by the VAK test. The response time was measured and the absolute frequency of response time for each question was calculated. During the Raven test execution an electroencephalogram with Emotiv Epoc Brain-Computer Interface of 14 channels was recorded. After subtracting baseline and eliminating common artifacts with the help of EEGLAB toolbox under Matlab, we obtained clean signals for theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Using the set of learning styles classificatory tools and the electrophysiological analysis we started to look for variability and consistencies that support or rise new questions about adequate usefulness of common used psycho-cognitive and behavioral learning styles tests. In our sample we found relatively low discriminative resolution from all learning styles test applied, but a promising research field to study electrical brain activity phenomenology associated with learning and solving problem strategies of the brain.

Uncertainty and conflict may arise on various levels. On the perceptual level, the hippocampus has been associated with signaling of contextual deviance [8-10] and disambiguation of similar items (i.e., pattern separation) [11-13]. Furthermore, conflicts can occur on the response level. Animal experiments showed a role of the hippocampus for inhibition of prevailing response tendencies and suppression of automatic stimulus-response mappings [14-17], potentially related to increased theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) [18]. In humans, a recent fMRI study demonstrated hippocampal involvement in approach-avoidance conflicts [19]. However, the more general significance of hippocampal activity for dealing with response conflicts also on a cognitive level is still unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the hippocampus for response conflict in the Stroop task by combining intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients with region of interest-based fMRI in healthy participants. Both methods revealed converging evidence that the hippocampus is recruited in a regionally specific manner during response conflict. Moreover, our iEEG data show that this activation depends on theta oscillations and is relevant for successful response conflict resolution.

Idle mode detection is a vital problem to be solved in self-paced (asynchronized) BCI, because patients need to control the BCI system whenever he or she wants, rather than output commands according to the system cues which is essentially different between self-paced and synchronized BCIs. With the detection of idle mode, we can finally increase the performance of real-time BCI. Approach. In this work, we introduce a new experiment paradigm to research the difference between idle mode and task mode from those domains of time, frequency and spatial. The experiment is carried out with 14 volunteers from 19 to 26 years old. Main results. Off-line analysis shows significant differences of the distribution of EEG power spectrum between task mode and idle mode. When the subjects execute a left or right hand selective sensation, there appears an obvious ERD/ERS in the subject's contralateral cortex. However, there is no ERD/ERS during idle mode periods even with simultaneously applied vibration. With combining data set of left and right hand sensation for classifier calibration, we recognize idle mode from mixed task mode with TPR value of 86%, and this result is significantly higher than that TPR achieved from single task type (left or right hand sensation) with p < 0.05. Significance. The new proposed calibration method is demonstrated to be feasible for idle mode detection in SS-BCI. With the combination of two mental tasks, we can improve the BCI performance by increasing true positive rate, and limit false positive rate at the same level compared to the idle mode recognition from single task type.

The current research explored the impact of reward bias and cortical frontal asymmetry (left lateralization effect) in SUD in response to a decisional task (Iowa Gambling Task). Fifty SUD participants and 40 controls (CG) were tested using the Iowa Gambling Task. Electrophysiology (electroencephalography) recording was performed during task execution. We measured left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex power activity. Behavioral responses (gain/loss options); frequency band modulation (asymmetry index) for delta, theta, alpha, and beta band; and cortical source localization (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) were considered. The SUD group opted in favor of the immediate reward option (loss) more frequently than the long-term option (gain) when compared to the CG. Secondly, SUD showed increased left-hemisphere activation in response to losing (with immediate reward) choices in comparison with the CG. The left hemispheric unbalance effect and the "reward bias" were adduced to explain the decisional impairment in SUD.

This paper proposes an effective approach of analyzing the sleep stages based on ballistocardiography (BCG), which can be continuously detected with micro-movement sensitive mattress (MSM) in this work, during non-intrusive sleep in home environment. This paper focuses on extracting features from BCG from the following three aspects: multi-resolution wavelet analysis of the heartbeat intervals based time-domain features, Welch's power spectrum estimation based frequency-domain features and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) value for long term correlation based features. Moreover, the support vector machine (SVM) with or without the factor of sleep rhythm, and recurrent neural network (RNN) are adopted to build the classifiers, and both the personal model and self-independent model are investigated for different scenarios. Experimental result of 56 subjects [25 women and 31 men, aged from 16 to 71] was evaluated applying the proposed method and compared to the result provided by professional visual scoring by ECG and EEG.

Altered modulation of gamma oscillation frequency by speed of visual motion in children with autism spectrum disorders	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						ASD; Visual gamma oscillation frequency; Stimulus velocity; Oblique line orientation threshold	BAND ACTIVITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL FREQUENCY; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; PEAK FREQUENCY; CORTEX; EEG; MEG; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION	Background: Recent studies link autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an altered balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in cortical networks. The brain oscillations in high gamma-band (50-120 Hz) are sensitive to the E/I balance and may appear useful biomarkers of certain ASD subtypes. The frequency of gamma oscillations is mediated by level of excitation of the fast-spiking inhibitory basket cells recruited by increasing strength of excitatory input. Therefore, the experimental manipulations affecting gamma frequency may throw light on inhibitory networks dysfunction in ASD. Methods: Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate modulation of visual gamma oscillation frequency by speed of drifting annular gratings (1.2, 3.6, 6.0 degrees/s) in 21 boys with ASD and 26 typically developing boys aged 7-15 years. Multitaper method was used for analysis of spectra of gamma power change upon stimulus presentation and permutation test was applied for statistical comparisons. We also assessed in our participants visual orientation discrimination thresholds, which are thought to depend on excitability of inhibitory networks in the visual cortex. Results: Although frequency of the oscillatory gamma response increased with increasing velocity of visual motion in both groups of participants, the velocity effect was reduced in a substantial proportion of children with ASD. The range of velocity-related gamma frequency modulation correlated inversely with the ability to discriminate oblique line orientation in the ASD group, while no such correlation has been observed in the group of typically developing participants. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abnormal velocity-related gamma frequency modulation in ASD may constitute a potential biomarker for reduced excitability of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons in a subset of children with ASD.

Impact of sleep loss before learning on cortical dynamics during memory retrieval	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Acute sleep restriction; Associative memory; EEG oscillations; Memory retrieval; Sleep loss	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; STORED INFORMATION; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; EVENT CONGRUENCY; FAMILIAR PEOPLE	Evidence shows that sleep loss before learning decreases activation of the hippocampus during encoding and promotes forgetting. But it remains to be determined which neural systems are functionally affected during memory retrieval after one night of recovery sleep. To investigate this issue, we evaluated memory for pairs of famous people's faces with the same or different profession (i.e., semantically congruent or incongruent faces) after one night of undisturbed sleep in subjects who either underwent 4 hours of acute sleep restriction (ASR, N = 20) or who slept 8 hours the pre-training night (controls, N = 20). EEG recordings were collected during the recognition memory task in both groups, and the cortical sources generating this activity localized by applying a spatial beamforming filter in the frequency domain. Even though sleep restriction did not affect accuracy of memory performance, controls showed a much larger decrease of alpha power relative to a baseline period when compared to sleep-deprived subjects. These group differences affected a widespread frontotemporoparietal network involved in retrieval of episodic/semantic memories. Regression analyses further revealed that associative memory in the ASR group was negatively correlated with alpha power in the occipital regions, whereas the benefit of congruency in the same group was positively correlated with delta power in the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Retrieval-related decreases of alpha power have been associated with the reactivation of material-specific memory representations, whereas increases of delta power have been related to inhibition of interferences that may affect the performance of the task. We can therefore draw the conclusion that a few hours of sleep loss in the pre-training night, though insufficient to change the memory performance, is sufficient to alter the processes involved in retrieving and manipulating episodic and semantic information.

The effect of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on gamma activity and working memory in schizophrenia	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Gamma oscillations; Working memory; Schizophrenia	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; TDCS; HUMANS	Working memory impairments in schizophrenia have been strongly associated with abnormalities in gamma oscillations within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). We recently published the first ever study showing that anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to the left DLPFC was able to significantly improve working memory performance in schizophrenia. In the current paper we present a secondary analysis from this study, specifically looking at the effect of tDCS on gamma activity and its relationship to working memory. In a repeated measures design we assessed the impact of anodal tDCS (1mA, 2mA, sham) on gamma activity in the left DLPFC at three time-points post-stimulation (0 min, 20 min, 40 min). EEG data was available for 16 participants in the 2mA condition, 13 in the lmA condition and 12 in the sham condition. Following 2mA stimulation we found a significant increase in gamma event-related synchronisation in the left DLPFC, this was in the context of a significantly improved working memory performance. There was also a significant decrease in gamma event-related synchronisation, with no changes in working memory, following sham stimulation. The current study provides preliminary evidence that tDCS may enhance working memory in schizophrenia by restoring normal gamma oscillatory function. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Resting-State Oscillatory Dynamics in Sensorimotor Cortex in Benign Epilepsy With Centro-Temporal Spikes and Typical Brain Development	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes; resting-state networks; magnetoencephalography; sensorimotor cortex; beta-band oscillations	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ROLANDIC EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; INTERICTAL SPIKES	Benign Epilepsy with Centro-Temporal Spikes (BECTS) is a common childhood epilepsy associated with deficits in several neurocognitive domains. Neurophysiological studies in BECTS often focus on centro-temporal spikes, but these correlate poorly with morphology and cognitive impairments. To better understand the neural profile of BECTS, we studied background brain oscillations, thought to be integrally involved in neural network communication, in sensorimotor areas. We used independent component analysis of temporally correlated sources on magnetoencephalography recordings to assess sensorimotor resting-state network activity in BECTS patients and typically developing controls. We also investigated the variability of oscillatory characteristics within focal primary motor cortex (M1), localized with a separate finger abduction task. We hypothesized that background oscillations would differ between patients and controls in the sensorimotor network but not elsewhere, especially in the beta band (13-30 Hz) because of its role in network communication and motor processing. The results support our hypothesis: in the sensorimotor network, patients had a greater variability in oscillatory amplitude compared to controls, whereas there was no difference in the visual network. Network measures did not correlate with age. The coefficient of variation of resting M1 peak frequency correlated negatively with age in the beta band only, and was greater than average for a number of patients. Our results point toward a "disorganized" functional sensorimotor network in BECTS, supporting a neurodevelopmental delay in sensorimotor cortex. Our findings further suggest that investigating the variability of oscillatory peak frequency may be a useful tool to investigate deficits of disorganization in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of ASD in the developing cortex, the functional connectivity in the brains of young children with ASD has not been well studied. In this study, brain activity was measured non-invasively during consciousness in 50 young human children with ASD and 50 age- and gender-matched typically developing human (TD) children. We employed a custom child-sized magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in which sensors were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in young children. We focused on theta band oscillations because they are thought to be involved in long-range networks associated with higher cognitive processes. The ASD group showed significantly reduced connectivity between the left-anterior and the right-posterior areas, exhibiting a decrease in the coherence of theta band (6 Hz) oscillations compared with the TD group. This reduction in coherence was significantly correlated with clinical severity in right-handed children with ASD. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced long-range functional connectivity in conscious young children with ASD using a novel MEG approach.

Historically, it forms the basis of Donders' difference method, and to date, it underwrites all difference imaging and trial-averaging of cortical activity, including the customary techniques for analyzing fMRI and EEG/MEG data. We describe the assumption and how it licenses common methods in cognitive neuroscience; in particular, we show how it plays out in signal differencing and averaging, and how it misleads us into seeing the brain as a set of static activity sources. In fact, rather than being static, the domains of cortical activity change from moment to moment: Recent research has suggested the importance of traveling waves of activation in the cortex. Traveling waves have been described at a range of different spatial scales in the cortex; they explain a large proportion of the variance in phase measurements of EEG, MEG and ECoG, and are important for understanding cortical function. Critically, traveling waves are not space-time separable. Their prominence suggests that the correct frame of reference for analyzing cortical activity is the dynamical trajectory of the system, rather than the time and space coordinates of measurements. We illustrate what the failure of space-time separability implies for cortical activation, and what consequences this should have for cognitive neuroscience.

The goal of this review is to give a broad empirical and conceptual overview of how ongoing oscillatory activity may support attention processes. Keeping in mind that definitions of cognitive constructs like attention are prone to being blurry and ambiguous, the present review focuses mainly on the neural correlates of 'top-down' attention deployment. In particular, we will discuss modulations of (ongoing) oscillatory activity during spatial, temporal, selective, and internal attention. Across these seemingly distinct attentional domains, we will summarize studies showing the involvement of two oscillatory processes observed during attention deployment: power modulations mainly in the alpha band, and phase modulations in lower frequency bands.

However, the effects of tDCS on the developing brain are still unknown, and knowledge about its tolerability in children and adolescents is still lacking. Safety and tolerability of tDCS was assessed in children and adolescents by self-reports and spectral characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Nineteen typically developing children and adolescents aged 11-16 years participated in the study. Anodal and cathodal tDCS as well as sham stimulation were applied for a duration of 10 mm over the left primary motor cortex (M1), each with an intensity of 1 mA. Subjects were unable to identify whether they had received active or sham stimulation, and all participants tolerated the stimulation well with a low rate of adverse events in both groups and no serious adverse events. No pathological oscillations, in particular, no markers of epileptiform activity after 1 mA tDCS were detected in any of the EEG analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that tDCS with 1 mA intensity over 10 mm is well tolerated, and thus may be used as an experimental and treatment method in the pediatric population.

This mechanism is thought to rely on the mirror neuron system (MNS), a brain network that is active both during action execution and observation. Indirect evidence suggests that (alpha/beta) mu suppression, an electro-encephalographic (EEG) index of MNS activity, is modulated by reward. In this study we aimed to test the plasticity of the MNS by directly investigating the link between (alpha/beta) mu suppression and reward. 40 individuals from a general population sample took part in an evaluative conditioning experiment, where different neutral faces were associated with high or low reward values. In the test phase, EEG was recorded while participants viewed videoclips of happy expressions made by the conditioned faces. Alpha/beta mu suppression (identified using event-related desynchronisation of specific independent components) in response to rewarding faces was found to be greater than for non-rewarding faces. This result provides a mechanistic insight into the plasticity of the MNS and, more generally, into the role of reward in modulating physiological responses linked to empathy.

J	Dickinson, A; Bruyns-Haylett, M; Jones, M; Milne, E				Dickinson, Abigail; Bruyns-Haylett, Michael; Jones, Myles; Milne, Elizabeth			Increased peak gamma frequency in individuals with higher levels of autistic traits	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism; electroencephalography; gamma activity; individual differences; perception	GABA CONCENTRATION; WAVELET COHERENCE; VISUAL-CORTEX; RESTING GABA; DISCRIMINATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION	Individual differences in orientation discrimination threshold are related to both visually-induced peak gamma frequency and the presence of autistic traits. The relationship between peak gamma frequency and orientation discrimination thresholds may be due to both of these factors being mediated by levels of neural inhibition. No study has previously measured the relationship between peak gamma frequency and levels of autistic traits. Thus, this was the aim of the present study. We measured orientation discrimination thresholds and autistic traits in a neurotypical human sample (N=33), and separately recorded electroencephalography to measure visually induced gamma activity. In line with our prediction, we found a significant relationship between peak gamma frequency and level of autistic traits. Consistent with previous work we also found significant relationships between orientation discrimination thresholds and level of autistic traits and between orientation discrimination thresholds and peak gamma frequency. Our results demonstrate that individuals with individuals with higher levels of autistic personality traits have a higher peak-gamma frequency and are better at discriminating between visual stimuli based on orientation. As both higher peak gamma frequency and lower orientation discrimination thresholds have been linked to higher levels of neural inhibition, this suggests that autistic traits co-occur with increased neural inhibition. This discovery is significant as it challenges the currently-held view that autism spectrum conditions are associated with increased neural excitation.

ASSOCIATIONS OF ENDOGENOUS 17-beta-ESTRADIOL WITH THETA AMPLITUDE AND PERFORMANCE IN SEMANTIC CATEGORIZATION IN YOUNG WOMEN	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sex hormone; 17-beta-estradiol; EEG; theta; semantic categorization task.	MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; SPATIAL FUNCTIONS; EEG; MEMORY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; ACCESS	In semantic categorization processes, individuals form a relation between perceived or imagined objects and knowledge about these objects. In the present semantic categorization study, we correlated endogenous 17-beta-estradiol levels (E2) with performance as well as amplitude of theta oscillations in young women (age 23.1 +/- 3.4 years). The semantic categorization task consisted of nouns representing either living or non-living items. Each item was characterized either by many or by few features. We identified parameters associated or not associated with menstrual cycle phases. Irrespective of the menstrual cycle phase, women (1) responded faster to living items as well as to nouns characterized by many features compared to non-living items and items characterized by few features, (2) showed higher accuracy to non-living items and items having many features, and (3) showed negative correlation between response time (RT) and theta amplitude. RT, accuracy and post-stimulus theta amplitude were not statistically significantly different among early follicular, late follicular or luteal women. In early follicular but not in late follicular or luteal women, we observed (1) a positive correlation between E2 and latency in RT, (2) a negative correlation between E2 and accuracy, and (3) a negative correlation between E2 and post-stimulus theta amplitude. A mosaic of menstrual cycle phase-dependent and -independent associations may indicate that a similar performance in each menstrual cycle phase is related to different modulation of synaptic activity by hormones.

In this framework, the mechanism producing active inhibition during the formation, switching, or updating of the cognitive set for recognizing a negative facial expression is analyzed. The significance of the function of temporal interval estimation is shown in providing the flexibility of cognitive processes.

LFP rhythms were mainly characterized by means od power spectral analysis, thus loosing information related to rhythm phase synchronization and to event related phase modulations. Because the application of higher-order spectral analysis methodology can overcome such limitation, here we review the present applications of bispectral and cross-bispectral analysis to LFP recordings. The results obtained up to now showed that higher-order spectral analysis was able to clarify detect different rhythm synchronizations and interactions characterizing different pathologies and patient's states.

Identification of the SOZ in extratemporal epilepsy requires invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings as well as resource intensive and subjective analysis by epileptologists. Expert inspection yields inconsistent localization of the SOZ which leads to comparatively poor post surgical outcomes for patients. This study employs recordings from 6 patients undergoing resection surgery in order to develop an automated and scalable system for identifying regions of interest (ROIs). Leveraging machine learning techniques and features used for seizure detection, a classification system was trained and tested on patients with Engel class I to class IV outcomes, demonstrating superior performance in the class I patients. Further, classification using features based upon both high frequency and low frequency oscillations was best able to identify channels suited for resection. This study demonstrates a novel approach to ROI identification and provides a path for developing tools to improve outcomes in epilepsy surgery.

Here, using three Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures of brain activity, we establish that preverbal 11-month-old infants are sensitive to the non-arbitrary correspondences between language sounds and concepts, that is, to sound symbolism. In each trial, infant participants were presented with a visual stimulus (e.g., a round shape) followed by a novel spoken word that either sound-symbolically matched ("moma") or mismatched ("kipi") the shape. Amplitude increase in the gamma band showed perceptual integration of visual and auditory stimuli in the match condition within 300 msec of word onset. Furthermore, phase synchronization between electrodes at around 400 msec revealed intensified large-scale, left-hemispheric communication between brain regions in the mismatch condition as compared to the match condition, indicating heightened processing effort when integration was more demanding. Finally, event-related brain potentials showed an increased adult-like N400 response an index of semantic integration difficulty in the mismatch as compared to the match condition. Together, these findings suggest that 11-month-old infants spontaneously map auditory language onto visual experience by recruiting a cross-modal perceptual processing system and a nascent semantic network within the first year of life.

At 2 months of age, no difference between conditions was found. In 4- and 9-month-olds, alpha-band activity desynchronized more in response to faces looking at objects compared to faces looking away from objects. Theta activity in 5-month-old infants differed between conditions with more theta synchronization for object-averted eye gaze. Whereas alpha desynchronization might reflect mechanisms of early social object learning, theta is proposed to imply activity in the executive attention network. The interplay between alpha and theta activity represents developmental changes in both kinds of processes during early infancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results of traditional visual methods for localizing the origin of seizures are far from satisfactory in some cases. Signal processing methods could extract substantial information that may complement visual inspection of EEG signals. In this study, EZ localization is changed into a driver identification problem, and a nonlinear interdependence measure, the weighted rank interdependence, is proposed and used as a driver indicator because it can detect coupling information, especially directionality, from EEG signals. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is then explored, using simulations, to establish its suitability for seizure control. The seizure control we propose rests on identifying the EZ using nonlinear interdependence measures of directed functional connectivity. Two directionally coupled neural mass models are employed for simulation investigation. Two parameters can adjust the sensitivity and completeness of the weighted rank interdependence for different applications, and their effect is discussed in the context of neural mass models. Simulation results demonstrate that use of the weighted rank interdependence for EZ identification can be applied to different EZ types, and the approach achieves an overall identification rate of 98.84 % for several EZ types. Simulations also indicate that PID control can effectively regulate synchronization between neural masses.

In this approach, the row/column (RC) paradigm was employed in a SSVEP speller to increase the number of items. The target is detected by subsequently determining the row and column coordinates. To improve spelling accuracy, we added a posterior processing after the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach to reduce the interfrequency variation between different subjects and named the new signal processing method CCA-RV, and designed a real-time biofeedback mechanism to increase attention on the visual stimuli. To achieve reasonable online spelling speed, both fixed and dynamic approaches for setting the optimal stimulus duration were implemented and compared. Experimental results for 11 subjects suggest that the CCA-RV method and the real-time biofeedback effectively increased accuracy compared with CCA and the absence of real-time feedback, respectively. In addition, both optimization approaches for setting stimulus duration achieved reasonable online spelling performance. However, the dynamic optimization approach yielded a higher practical information transfer rate (PITR) than the fixed optimization approach. The average online PITR achieved by the proposed adaptive SSVEP speller, including the time required for breaks between selections and error correction, was 41.08 bit/min. These results indicate that our BCI speller is promising for use in SSVEP-based BCI applications.

The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 makes this congruency benefit smaller, but the neural correlates of this deficit are unknown. Here, we estimated the source generators of EEG oscillatory activity associated with successful encoding of face-location associations preceded by semantically congruent and incongruent cues in HO (N=26) and aMCI subjects (N=34), 16 of which were 4 carriers (4(+)) and 18 4 noncarriers (4(-)). Source estimation was performed in those spectrotemporal windows where the power of low-alpha, high-alpha, and beta oscillatory activity differed either between congruent and incongruent faces or between groups. Differences in high-alpha and beta-oscillatory dynamics indicated that aMCI 4(+) are unable to activate lateral regions of the temporal lobe involved in associative memory and congruency benefit in HO. Interestingly, and regardless of APOE genotype, aMCI activated additional regions relative to HO, through alpha oscillations. However, only activation in a distributed fronto-temporo-parietal network in 4 noncarriers was paralleled by enhanced memory. On the contrary, the redundant prefrontal activation shown by aMCI 4(+) did not prevent performance from decreasing. These results indicate that the effect of aMCI-related degeneracy on functional networks is constrained by the presence of APOE 4. Whereas individuals with aMCI 4(-) activate attentional, perceptual and semantic compensatory networks, aMCI 4(+) show reduced processing efficiency and capacity. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: Spontaneous cortical oscillations of patients with PD were recorded with magnetoencephalography during on and off subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation states. Several features such as average frequency, average power, and relative subband power in regions of interest were extracted in the frequency domain, and these features were correlated with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III evaluation. The same features were also investigated in patients with PD without surgery and healthy controls. Results: Patients with Parkinson disease without surgery compared with healthy controls had a significantly lower average frequency and an increased average power in 1 to 48 Hz range in whole cortex. Higher relative power in theta and simultaneous decrease in beta and gamma over temporal and occipital were also observed in patients with PD. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III rigidity score correlated with the average frequency and with the relative power of beta and gamma in frontal areas. During subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, the average frequency increased significantly when stimulation was on compared with off state. In addition, the relative power dropped in delta, whereas it rose in beta over the whole cortex. Through the course of stimulation, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III rigidity and tremor scores correlated with the relative power of alpha over left parietal. Conclusions: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves the symptoms of PD by suppressing the synchronization of alpha rhythm in somatomotor region.

Whereas the motor aspects of word production have been well characterized as reflected in alpha-beta desynchronization, the memory aspects have remained poorly understood. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the neurophysiological signature of not only motor but also memory aspects of spoken-word production. Participants named or judged pictures after reading sentences. To probe the involvement of the memory component, we manipulated sentence context. Sentence contexts were either constraining or nonconstraining toward the final word, presented as a picture. In the judgment task, participants indicated with a left-hand button press whether the picture was expected given the sentence. In the naming task, they named the picture. Naming and judgment were faster with constraining than nonconstraining contexts. Alpha-beta desynchronization was found for constraining relative to nonconstraining contexts pre-picture presentation. For the judgment task, beta desynchronization was observed in left posterior brain areas associated with conceptual processing and in right motor cortex. For the naming task, in addition to the same left posterior brain areas, beta desynchronization was found in left anterior and posterior temporal cortex (associated with memory aspects), left inferior frontal cortex, and bilateral ventral premotor cortex (associated with motor aspects). These results suggest that memory and motor components of spoken word production are reflected in overlapping brain oscillations in the beta band. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2767-2780, 2015.

Oscillatory Recruitment of Bilateral Visual Cortex during Spatial Attention to Competing Rhythmic Inputs	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; biased competition; delta band; entrainment; harmonics; oscillations	VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; STEADY-STATE; SENSORY SELECTION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; EVOKED RESPONSES; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; ALPHA; MECHANISMS	Selective attention uses temporal regularity of relevant inputs to bias the phase of ongoing population-level neuronal oscillations. This phase entrainment streamlines processing, allowing attended information to arrive at moments of high neural excitability. How entrainment resolves competition between spatially segregated inputs during visuospatial tasks is not yet established. Using high-density electroencephalography in humans, a bilateral entrainment response to the rhythm (1.3 or 1.5 Hz) of an attended stimulation stream was observed, concurrent with a considerably weaker contralateral entrainment to a competing rhythm. That ipsilateral visual areas strongly entrained to the attended stimulus is notable because competitive inputs to these regions were being driven at an entirely different rhythm. Strong modulations of phase locking and weak modulations of single-trial power suggest that entrainment was primarily driven by phase-alignment of ongoing oscillatory activity. In addition, interhemispheric differences in entrained phase were found to be modulated by attended hemifield, implying that the bilateral nature of the response reflected a functional flow of information between hemispheres. This modulation was strongest at the third of at least four harmonics that were strongly entrained. Ipsilateral increases in alpha-band (8-12 Hz) power were also observed during bilateral entrainment, reflecting suppression of the ignored stimulation stream. Furthermore, both entrainment and alpha lateralization significantly affected task performance. We conclude that oscillatory entrainment is a functionally relevant mechanism that synchronizes endogenous activity across the cortical hierarchy to resolve spatial competition. We further speculate that concurrent suppression of ignored input might facilitate the widespread propagation of attended information during spatial attention.

Methods: Ictal onset patterns from intracranial EEG were analysed in 373 electro-clinical seizures and subclinical seizures from 69 patients. Seizure onset patterns were classified as: (a) Diffuse electrodecremental (DEE); (b) Focal fast activity (FA); (c) Simultaneous onset of fast activity and diffuse electrodecremental event (FA-DEE); (d) Spikes; (e) Spike-wave activity; (f) Sharp waves; (g) Alpha activity; (h) Delta activity. Presence of preceding epileptiform discharge (PED) was also studied. Engel and ILAE surgical outcome scales were used. Results: The mean follow-up period was 42.1 months (SD = 30.1). Fast activity was the most common seizure onset pattern seen (33%), followed by (FA-DEE) (20%), DEE (19%), spike-wave activity (12%), sharpwaves (6%), alpha activity (6%), delta activity (3%) and spikes (1%). Preceding epileptiform discharges were present in 75% of patients. FA was associated with favourable outcome (p = 0.0083) whereas DEE was associated with poor outcome (p = 0.0025). A widespread PED was not associated with poor outcome (p = 0.9559). There was no clear association between seizure onset pattern and specific pathology, except possibly between sharp/spike waves and mesial temporal sclerosis. Conclusions: FA activity is associated with favourable outcome. DEE at onset was associated with poor surgical outcome. Widespread/bilateral PEDs were not associated with poor or good outcome. Significance: FA appears to be the best marker for the epileptogenic zone. Surgery should be contemplated with caution if DEE is the first ictal change. However, a widespread/bilateral PED at onset is common and should not discourage surgery. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Initially, the processing of faces seems to be supported by early extrastriate occipital cortices and revealed by modulations of the occipital P1. This early response is thought to reflect the detection of certain primary structural aspects indicating the presence grosso modo of a face within the visual field. The posterior-temporal N170 is more sensitive to the detection of faces as complex-structured stimuli and, therefore, to the presence of its distinctive organizational characteristics prior to within-category identification. In turn, the relatively late and probably more rostrally generated N250r and N400-like responses might respectively indicate processes of access and retrieval of face-related information, which is stored in long-term memory (LTM). New methods of analysis of electrophysiological and neuroanatomical data, namely, dynamic causal modeling, single-trial and time-frequency analyses, are highly recommended to advance in the knowledge of those brain mechanisms concerning face processing.

Two 3D viewing technologies are available: active shutter glasses and passive polarized glasses. However, there are consistent reports of discomfort while viewing in 3D mode where the discomfort may refer to dizziness, headaches, nausea or simply not being able to see in 3D continuously. Methods: In this paper, we propose a theory that 3D technology which projects the two images (required for 3D perception) alternatively, cannot provide true 3D visual experience while the 3D technology projecting the two images simultaneously is closest to the human visual system for depth perception. Then we validate our theory by conducting experiments with 40 subjects and analyzing the EEG results of viewing 3D movie clips with passive polarized glasses while the images are projected simultaneously compared to 2D viewing. In addition, subjective feedback of the subjects was also collected and analyzed. Results: A higher theta and alpha band absolute power is observed across various areas including the occipital lobe for 3D viewing. We also found that the complexity of the signal, e.g. variations in EEG samples over time, increases in 3D as compared to 2D. Various results conclude that working memory, as well as, attention is increased in 3D viewing because of the processing of more data in 3D as compared to 2D. From subjective feedback analysis, 75% of subjects felt comfortable with 3D passive polarized while 25% preferred 3D active shutter technology. Conclusions: We conclude that 3D passive polarized technology provides more comfortable visualization than 3D active shutter technology. Overall, 3D viewing is more attractive than 2D due to stereopsis which may cause of high attention and involvement of working memory manipulations.

Here, we investigate the interplay of task-preparatory and task-related brain activity as represented by pre-stimulus BOLD-fluctuations and spectral EEG from the retention periods of a visual WM task. Visual WM is used to maintain sensory information in the brain enabling the performance of cognitive operations and is associated with mental health. We tested 22 subjects simultaneously with EEG and fMRI while performing a visuo-verbal Sternberg task with two different loads, allowing for the temporal separation of preparation, encoding, retention and retrieval periods. Four temporally coherent networks (TCNs) the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention, the right and the left WM network were extracted from the continuous BOLD data by means of a group ICA. Subsequently, the modulatory effect of these networks' pre-stimulus activation upon retention-related EEG activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequencies was analyzed. The obtained results are informative in the context of state-dependent information processing. We were able to replicate two wellknown load-dependent effects: the frontal-midline theta increase during the task and the decrease of pre-stimulus DMN activity. As our main finding, these two measures seem to depend on each other as the significant negative correlations at frontal-midline channels suggested. Thus, suppressed pre-stimulus DMN levels facilitated later task related frontal midline theta increases. In general, based on previous findings that neuronal coupling in different frequency bands may underlie distinct functions in WM retention, our results suggest that processes reflected by spectral oscillations during retention seem not only to be "online" synchronized with activity in different attention-related networks but are also modulated by activity in these networks during preparation intervals.

The functional role of individual-alpha based frontal asymmetry in stress responding	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Frontal alpha oscillations; Individual alpha frequency; Cortisol; EEG	EEG ASYMMETRY; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; CORTISOL SECRETION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EMOTION; INHIBITION; PERFORMANCE; STATE	Asymmetry in frontal electrical activity has been suggested to index tendencies in affective responding and thus may be associated with hormonal stress responses. To assess the functional role of frontal asymmetry (FA) in stress, we measured FA at rest and following exposure to acute stress induced with the Maastricht Acute Stress Task (MAST; N = 70) in the standard 8-13 Hz band as well as based on individual alpha frequency (IAF) band. IAF-based resting FA(F4-F3) was associated with the stress induced neuroendocrine response, such that left individual frontal activity predicted smaller total cortisol increases in response to the MAST. Like previous studies, we found resting left-sided FA(F8-F7) to predict trait behavioural activation measured with the BIS/BAS scales. FA remained unaffected by stress-induced cortisol response. These findings suggest that individual FA might reflect a trait-like characteristic that moderates the stress response. Our results underscore the utility of IAF in studying individual differences in stress responding. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	[Quaedflieg, C. W. E. M.; Meyer, T.; Smulders, F. T.

EEG correlates of a mental arithmetic task in patients with first episode schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG spectral power; First psychotic episode; Schizophrenia; Schizoaffective disorder; Resting state; Mental arithmetic task	MEMORY PERFORMANCE; NEUROLEPTIC-NAIVE; DELTA-ACTIVITY; RESTING EEG; GAMMA; POWER; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; ASYMMETRY; BRAIN	Objective: To evaluate the spectral power of the cortical bands in patients with first episode schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder at rest and during the performance of a mental arithmetic task. Methods: We analyzed EEG spectral power (SP) in the resting state and subsequently while counting down from 200 in steps of 7, in 32 first episode schizophrenia patients (SZ), 32 patients with first episode schizoaffective disorder (SA) and healthy controls (HC, n = 40). Behavioral parameters such as accuracy and counting speed were also evaluated. Results: Both SZ and SA patients were slower in counting than HC, no difference was obtained in the accuracy and counting speed in the patient groups. In the resting state patients showed elevated midline theta power, off-midline anterior beta 2 power and decreased central/posterior alpha power. The SA group occupied an intermediate position between the schizophrenia patients and controls. In task performance patients lacked a typical increase of midline theta, left anterior beta 2, and anterior gamma power; however, schizoaffective patients demonstrated a growing trend of power in the gamma band in left anterior off-midline sites similar to HC. Moreover, alpha power was less inhibited in schizoaffective patients and more pronounced in schizophrenia patients indicating distinct inhibitory mechanisms in these psychotic disorders. Conclusions: Patients with SA demonstrate less alteration in the spectral power of bands at rest than SZ, and present spectral power changes during cognitive task performance close to the controls.

In the present study, we took advantage of this ability and studied brain activity related to the shift of mental state. Electrophysiological activity, i.e. EEG, was recorded from 11 subjects with varying degrees of meditation experience during Zen meditation (a form of open monitoring meditation) and during non-meditation rest. On a behavioral level, mindfulness scores were assessed using the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS). Analysis of EEG source power revealed the so far unreported finding that MAAS scores significantly correlated with gamma power (30-250 Hz), particularly high-frequency gamma (100-245 Hz), during meditation. High levels of mindfulness were related to increased high-frequency gamma, for example, in the cingulate cortex and somatosensory cortices. Further, we analyzed the relationship between connectivity during meditation and self-reported mindfulness (MAAS). We found a correlation between graph measures in the 160-170 Hz range and MAAS scores. Higher levels of mindfulness were related to lower small worldedness as well as global and local clustering in paracentral, insular, and thalamic regions during meditation. In sum, the present study shows significant relationships of mindfulness and brain activity during meditation indicated by measures of oscillatory power and graph theoretical measures. The most prominent effects occur in brain structures crucially involved in processes of awareness and attention, which also show structural changes in short-and long-term meditators, suggesting continuative alterations in the meditating brain. Overall, our study reveals strong changes in ongoing oscillatory activity as well as connectivity patterns that appear to be sensitive to the psychological state changes induced by Zen meditation.

The success of virtual environments likely depends on whether a sense of presence can be established, where participants become fully immersed in the virtual environment. Exposure to virtual environments is associated with physiological responses, including cortical activation changes. Whether the addition of a real exercise within a virtual environment alters sense of presence perception, or the accompanying physiological changes, is not known. In a randomized and controlled study design, moderate-intensity Exercise (i.e., self-paced cycling) and No-Exercise (i.e., automatic propulsion) trials were performed within three levels of virtual environment exposure. Each trial was 5 minutes in duration and was followed by posttrial assessments of heart rate, perceived sense of presence, EEG, and mental state. Changes in psychological strain and physical state were generally mirrored by neural activation patterns. Furthermore, these changes indicated that exercise augments the demands of virtual environment exposures and this likely contributed to an enhanced sense of presence.

This study explores the three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm with binary choices (yes/no) associated with Empirical Mode Decomposition to extract features used to train and test a Support Vector Machine classifier. Data from standard EEG channels and from the N200-anterior-contralateral (N2ac) response signal were tested. Ten healthy male subjects, age 20 to 27 years, participated in the experiment. The best performance (average classification accuracy of 87.41% and information transfer ratio of 6.48 bit/min) was achieved when features extracted from the N2ac response were added to features extracted from the EEG channels, Also, the results showed that by using target stimuli with larger frequency separation helps the subjects focus better on the desired answer.

Mathematical modeling of emotional states plays a significant role in this scope which can correlate between human cognition, emotion and mental behavior. In this paper, we propose a new approach to model the emotional states with mathematical expressions based on wavelet analysis and trust region algorithm. The brain signals are collected using BIOPAC automated MP36 system and transformed on time-frequency domain using Daubechies4 wavelet function on different emotional states such as relax, memory, pleasant, fear, motor action, and enjoying music to extract the wavelet coefficients of these different states. The emotional states are modeled with different mathematical expressions which can be verified with these wavelet coefficients from the adjusted R-square percentage and the sum of square errors. The adjusted R-square percentage of the mathematical modeled states with the actual emotional states are 78.4% for relax, 77.18% for motor action and for memory, pleasant, enjoying music and fear they are 93%, 95.6%, 97.7% and 91.5% respectively. The main focus of this paper is to propose the mathematical modeling of these states which can be further applied for practical hardware implementation of human emotion based systems.

Using neurophysiological signals that reflect cognitive or affective state: six recommendations to avoid common pitfalls	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						passive BCI; physiological computing; mental state estimation; affective computing; neuroergonomics; EEG; applied neuroscience	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EEG ALPHA; CLASSIFICATION; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; EMOTION	Estimating cognitive or affective state from neurophysiological signals and designing applications that make use of this information requires expertise in many disciplines such as neurophysiology, machine learning, experimental psychology, and human factors. This makes it difficult to perform research that is strong in all its aspects as well as to judge a study or application on its merits. On the occasion of the special topic "Using neurophysiological signals that reflect cognitive or affective state" we here summarize often occurring pitfalls and recommendations on how to avoid them, both for authors (researchers) and readers. They relate to defining the state of interest, the neurophysiological processes that are expected to be involved in the state of interest, confounding factors, inadvertently "cheating" with classification analyses, insight on what underlies successful state estimation, and finally, the added value of neurophysiological measures in the context of an application. We hope that this paper will support the community in producing high quality studies and well-validated, useful applications.	[Brouwer, Anne-Marie; van Erp, Janb.

The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an interesting candidate, being one of the major mammalian enzymes involved in the catabolism of catecholamines. The activity of COMT enzyme is genetically polymorphic due to a guanine-to-adenine transition at codon 158, resulting in a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution. Individuals homozygous for the Val allele show higher COMT activity, and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal cortex (PFC) than subjects homozygous for the Met allele. Since COMT has a crucial role in metabolising dopamine, it was suggested that the common functional polymorphism in the COMTgene impacts on cognitive function related to PFC, sleep-wake regulation, and potentially on sleep pathologies. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism may predict inter-individual differences in brain electroencephalography (EEG) alpha oscillations and recovery processes resulting from partial sleep loss in healthy individuals. The Val158Met polymorphism also exerts a sexual dimorphism and has a strong effect on objective daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsycataplexy. Since the COMT enzyme inactivates catecholamines, it was hypothesized that the response to stimulant drugs differs between COMT genotypes. Modafinil maintained executive functioning performance and vigilant attention throughout sleep deprivation in subjects with Val/Val genotype, but less in those with Met/Met genotype. Also, homozygous Met/Met patients with narcolepsy responded to lower doses of modafinil compared to Val/Val carriers. We review here the critical role of the common functional COMT gene polymorphism, COMT enzyme activity, and the prefrontal dopamine levels in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects, in narcolepsy and other sleep-related disorders, and its impact on the response to psychostimulants.

The aim of this research is to explore the coupling patterns of brain dynamics during an auditory oddball task in schizophrenia (SCH). Approach. Event-related electroencephalographic (ERP) activity was recorded from 20 SCH patients and 20 healthy controls. The coupling changes between auditory response and pre-stimulus baseline were calculated in conventional EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma), using three coupling measures: coherence, phase-locking value and Euclidean distance. Main results. Our results showed a statistically significant increase from baseline to response in theta coupling and a statistically significant decrease in beta-2 coupling in controls. No statistically significant changes were observed in SCH patients. Significance. Our findings support the aberrant salience hypothesis, since SCH patients failed to change their coupling dynamics between stimulus response and baseline when performing an auditory cognitive task. This result may reflect an impaired communication among neural areas, which may be related to abnormal cognitive functions.

Automated Seizure Onset Zone Approximation Based on Nonharmonic High-Frequency Oscillations in Human Interictal Intracranial EEGs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Seizure onset zone; high-frequency oscillations; epilepsy surgery	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NEURONAL COMPLEXITY LOSS; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEURAL-NETWORK; 100-500 HZ; BRAIN; RECORDINGS; NONLINEARITY; DYNAMICS	A novel automated algorithm is proposed to approximate the seizure onset zone (SOZ), while providing reproducible output. The SOZ, a surrogate marker for the epileptogenic zone (EZ), was approximated from intracranial electroencephalograms (iEEG) of nine people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), using three methods: (1) Total ripple length (TRL): Manually segmented high-frequency oscillations, (2) Rippleness (R): Area under the curve (AUC) of the autocorrelation functions envelope, and (3) Autoregressive model residual variation (ARR, novel algorithm): Time-variation of residuals from autoregressive models of iEEG windows. TRL, R, and ARR results were compared in terms of separability, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and performance, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, to the gold standard for SOZ delineation: visual observation of ictal video-iEEGs. TRL, R, and ARR can distinguish signals from iEEG channels located within the SOZ from those outside it (p < 0.01). The ROC AUC was 0.82 for ARR, while it was 0.79 for TRL, and 0.64 for R. ARR outperforms TRL and R, and may be applied to identify channels in the SOZ automatically in interictal iEEGs of people with TLE. ARR, interpreted as evidence for nonharmonicity of high-frequency EEG components, could provide a new way to delineate the EZ, thus contributing to presurgical workup.

Ontogeny of Septohippocampal Modulation of Delay Eyeblink Conditioning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						development; rat pup; associative learning; eyelid conditioning; septum; theta; cerebellum	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POST-TRAINING CONSOLIDATION; PONTINE STIMULATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; FEAR; SYSTEM; RATS; INVOLVEMENT; ALTERNATION	The current study investigated the effects of disrupting the septohippocampal theta system on the developmental emergence of delay eyeblink conditioning. Theta oscillations are defined as electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms with a frequency between 3-8Hz. Hippocampal theta oscillations are generated by inputs from the entorhinal cortex and the medial septum. Theta activity has been shown to facilitate learning in a variety of paradigms, including delay eyeblink conditioning. Lesions of the medial septum disrupt theta activity and slow the rate at which delay eyeblink conditioning is learned (Berry & Thompson, [1979] Science 200:1298-1300). The role of the septohippocampal theta system in the ontogeny of eyeblink conditioning has not been examined. In the current study, infant rats received an electrolytic lesion of the medial septum on postnatal day (P) 12. Rats were later given eyeblink conditioning for 6 sessions with an auditory conditioned stimulus on P17-19, P21-23, or P24-26. Lesions impaired eyeblink conditioning on P21-23 and P24-26 but not on P17-19. The results suggest that the septohippocampal system comes online to facilitate acquisition of eyeblink conditioning between P19 and P21. Developmental changes in septohippocampal modulation of the cerebellum may play a significant role in the ontogeny of eyeblink conditioning. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Brooks, J; Kerick, S				Brooks, Justin; Kerick, Scott			Event-related alpha perturbations related to the scaling of steering wheel corrections	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Visuomotor; Sensorimotor; Alertness; Driving; Steering wheel; ERSP	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MU-RHYTHM; SUSTAINED-ATTENTION; VISUAL FEEDBACK; EEG; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; POWER; PATH	Previously we derived a new measure relating the driver's steering wheel responses to the vehicle's heading error velocity. This measure, the relative steering wheel compensation (RSWC), changes at times coincident with an alerting stimulus, possibly representing shifts in control strategy as measured by a change in the gain between visual input and motor output. In the present study, we sought to further validate this novel measure by determining the relationship between the RSWC and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in brain regions associated with sensorimotor transformation processes. These areas have been shown to exhibit event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in the alpha frequency band that occurs with the onset of corrective steering wheel maneuvers in response to vehicle perturbations. We hypothesized that these regions would show differential alpha activity depending on whether the RSWC was high or low, reflecting changes in gain between visual input and motor output. Interestingly, we find that low RSWC is associated with significantly less peak desynchronization than larger RSWC. In addition we demonstrate that these differences are not attributable to the amount the steering wheel is turned nor the heading error velocity independently. Collectively these results suggest that neural activity in these sensorimotor regions scales with alertness and may represent differential utilization of multisensory information to control the steering wheel.

J	Spironelli, C; Angrilli, A				Spironelli, Chiara; Angrilli, Alessandro			Language-related gamma EEG frontal reduction is associated with positive symptoms in schizophrenia patients	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma EEG rhythm; Psychosis; Delusions; Hallucination; Lateralization	HIGH-RISK; HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; RESOLUTION; FAILURE; BRAIN; DELTA; BAND; LATERALIZATION	Objectives: Frontal hypoactivation has been consistently found in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that patients' deficit is asymmetrical, i.e., centred over the left frontal locations, associated with loss of language-related asymmetry, and correlated with positive symptoms. Method: The amplitude of EEG gamma band (36-48 Hz) was measured during the processing of three linguistic (Phonological vs. Semantic vs. Visuo-perceptual) tasks and used as index of activation/connectivity in 18 schizophrenia patients and 18 healthy participants. Results: Healthy controls showed higher gamma in frontal sites, revealing a significantly greater left vs. right asymmetry in all linguistic tasks, whereas patients exhibited decreased and bilateral gamma amplitude (i.e., reduced activation/connectivity) in frontal regions. The patients' left hypofrontality during phonological processing was positively correlated with higher levels of Delusions (P1) and Hallucination (P3) PANSS sub-scales. A significantly greater left posterior gamma amplitude was found in patients compared with controls. Conclusion: Results suggest, in schizophrenia patients, a functional deficit of left frontal regions including Broca's area, a key site playing a fundamental hierarchical role between and within hemispheres which integrates many basic processes in linguistic and conceptual organization. The significant correlation between lack of the left anterior asymmetry and increased positive symptoms is in line with Crow's hypothesis postulating the aetiological role of disrupted linguistic frontal asymmetry on the onset of the key symptoms of schizophrenia.

There is currently significant debate regarding what sources of brain plasticity underlie these PL-based learning improvements. Here we investigate the hypothesis that PL, among other mechanisms, leads to task automaticity, especially in the presence of the trained stimuli. To investigate this hypothesis, we trained participants for eight sessions to find an oriented target in a field of near-oriented distractors and examined alpha-band activity, which modulates with attention to visual stimuli, as a possible measure of automaticity. Alpha-band activity was acquired via electroencephalogram (EEG), before and after training, as participants performed the task with trained and untrained stimuli. Results show that participants underwent significant learning in this task (as assessed by threshold, accuracy, and reaction time improvements) and that alpha power increased during the pre-stimulus period and then underwent greater desynchronization at the time of stimulus presentation following training. However, these changes in alpha-band activity were not specific to the trained stimuli, with similar patterns of posttraining alpha power for trained and untrained stimuli. These data are consistent with the view that participants were more efficient at focusing resources at the time of stimulus presentation and are consistent with a greater automaticity of task performance. These findings have implications for PL, as transfer effects from trained to untrained stimuli may partially depend on differential effort of the individual at the time of stimulus processing.

The cognitive neuroscience of visual short-term memory	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Review								Our understanding of the neural bases of visual short-term memory (STM), the ability to mentally retain information over short periods of time, is being reshaped by two important developments: the application of methods from statistical machine learning, often a variant of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data sets; and advances in our understanding of the physiology and functions of neuronal oscillations. One consequence is that many commonly observed physiological 'signatures' that have previously been interpreted as directly related to the retention of information in visual STM may require reinterpretation as more general, state-related changes that can accompany cognitive-task performance. Another is important refinements of theoretical models of visual STM.

J	Lundstrom, BN				Lundstrom, Brian Nils			Modeling multiple time scale firing rate adaptation in a neural network of local field potentials	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neural networks; Rate adaptation; Local field potentials; Slow oscillations; Multiple time scale	SPIKE-FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; POWER-LAW ADAPTATION; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; STIMULUS DETECTION; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; SLOW; OSCILLATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; EEG; EXCITABILITY	In response to stimulus changes, the firing rates of many neurons adapt, such that stimulus change is emphasized. Previous work has emphasized that rate adaptation can span a wide range of time scales and produce time scale invariant power law adaptation. However, neuronal rate adaptation is typically modeled using single time scale dynamics, and constructing a conductance-based model with arbitrary adaptation dynamics is nontrivial. Here, a modeling approach is developed in which firing rate adaptation, or spike frequency adaptation, can be understood as a filtering of slow stimulus statistics. Adaptation dynamics are modeled by a stimulus filter, and quantified by measuring the phase leads of the firing rate in response to varying input frequencies. Arbitrary adaptation dynamics are approximated by a set of weighted exponentials with parameters obtained by fitting to a desired filter. With this approach it is straightforward to assess the effect of multiple time scale adaptation dynamics on neural networks. To demonstrate this, single time scale and power law adaptation were added to a network model of local field potentials. Rate adaptation enhanced the slow oscillations of the network and flattened the output power spectrum, dampening intrinsic network frequencies. Thus, rate adaptation may play an important role in network dynamics.

Corkscrew electrodes, considered in this paper, can become faulty due to cold solder that can appear immediately after the manufacturing process or due to mechanical stress after a few months of use. This problem is hard to detect and is usually manifested as noisy output signal. Commonly used method for monitoring the reliability of materials or circuit interconnects is the resistance measurement. Although very easy to implement, this method does not provide a reliable failure detection. Motivated by these facts, in this paper we propose a computer model based on resistance measurements, for predicting and detecting failure in EEG electrodes supported by laboratory measurements. Level and type of noise is obtained from the comparison of resistance fluctuations of the electrodes tip recorded under stress, and simulated signals. Time-frequency analysis has been applied to real and simulated reference and faulty electrode signals and results compared in order to establish a failure detection measure. Since the energy spectrum of the signal is shown to be an unreliable indicator of the failure appearance, the Renyi entropy is used to determine the difference between reference and faulty electrodes. This measure is applied to measured and simulated spectrograms, denoised using the K-means algorithm. It is shown that the difference between global entropies of the reference and faulty electrode spectrograms is significant when K-means based denoising is applied, thus providing a method for reliable failure detection.

Our basic assumptions follow field theoretic consciousness interpretation approach and precede it assuming, that mutually entangled individual mind states create coherent social networks and behavior as well. The latter supposes that collective consciousness can be empirically investigated in a form of simultaneous group-wide coherent brain activations (e.g. using EEG measured delta, theta, alfa and beta oscillations). For the experimental validation of the proposed paradigm we have designed a three level experimental and simulation research framework, which starts from the modeling and benchmark estimates of correlations for the individual mind states, proceeds with estimates of the coherence and synchronicity measures for the group-wide neurodynamics and ends up with construction of oscillations based multi-agent social system simulation model.

Unsupervised Learning for individual e-IQ & IQ relying on memory eliciting (i.e. scent, grandmother images) and IQ baseline profiles could further enhance the ability to uniquely identify and properly diagnose individuals. Sub-threshold changes in a common/probable biomedical biomarker (disorders) means that an individual remains healthy, while a martingale would require further investigation and more measurements taken to determine credibility. Empirical measurements of human actions can discover anomalies hidden in data, which point to biomarkers revealed through stimulus response. We review the approach for forming a single-user baseline having 1-d devices and a scale-invariant representation for N users each (i) having N*d(i) total devices. Such a fractal representation of human-centric data provides self-similar levels information and relationships which are useful for diagnosis and identification causality anywhere from a mental disorder to a DNA match. Biomarkers from biomedical devices offer a robust way to collect data. Biometrics could be envisioned as enhanced and personalized biomedical devices (e.g. typing fist), but used for security. As long as the devices have a shared context origin, useful information can be found by coupling the sensors. In the case of the electroencephalogram (EEG), known patterns have emerged in low frequency Delta Theta Alpha Beta-Gamma (DTAB-G) waves when an individual views a familiar picture in the visual cortex which is shown on EEGs as a sharp peak. Using brainwaves as a functional biomarker for security can lead the industry to create more secure sessions by allowing not only passwords but also visual stimuli and/or keystrokes coupled with EEG to capture and stay informed about real time user e-IQ/IQ data changes. This holistic Computer Science (CS) Knowledge Discovery in Databases, Data Mining (KDD, DM) approach seeks to merge the fields having a shared data origin biomarkers revealed through stimulus response.

Seizure patterns with similar features are reproduced in animal models of partial seizures and epilepsy. However, the network determinants that support interictal spikes, as well as the initiation, progression, and termination of seizures, are still elusive. Recent findings show that inhibitory networks are prominently involved at the onset of these seizures, and that extracellular changes in potassium contribute to initiate and sustain seizure progression. The end of a partial seizure correlates with an increase in network synchronization, which possibly involves both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms.

In contrast, gaze aversions in line-drawn faces do not produce these N170 differences (Rossi et al., 2014), suggesting that physical stimulus properties or experimental context may drive these effects. Here we investigated the role of stimulus-induced context on neurophysiological responses to dynamic gaze. Sixteen healthy adults viewed line-drawn and real faces, with dynamic eye aversion and direct gaze transitions, and control stimuli (scrambled arrays and checkerboards) while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. EEG data from 2 temporo-occipital clusters of 9 electrodes in each hemisphere where N170 activity is known to be maximal were selected for analysis. N170 peak amplitude and latency, and temporal dynamics from Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) were measured in 16 healthy subjects. Real faces generated larger N170s for averted vs. direct gaze motion, however, N170s to real and direct gaze were as large as those to respective controls. N170 amplitude did not differ across line drawn gaze changes. Overall, bilateral mean gamma power changes for faces relative to control stimuli occurred between 150-350 ms, potentially reflecting signal detection of facial motion. Our data indicate that experimental context does not drive N170 differences to viewed gaze changes. Low-level stimulus properties, such as the high sclera/iris contrast change in real eyes likely drive the N170 changes to viewed aversive movements.

Mechanism and significance of global coherence in scalp EEG	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; ORIGIN; PHASE; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS	What distinguishes animals from robots is the neurodynamics of intention. The mechanism is the action-perception cycle that creates and applies knowledge. Knowledge is the condensed, categorized information brains accumulate over lifetimes of experience. Vertebrate intention emerged in the Ordovician period as a tool to prowl first olfactory environments, then environments of other modalities. Action necessitates remembering space-time trajectories. Hence the sensory, motor, and hippocampal cortices interact intimately. Brains create the contextual richness of relevant knowledge almost instantly by exploiting the capacity of cortical neuropil to transit between a gas-like phase with sparse, random firing and a liquid-liked phase of high-energy, narrow band oscillation synchronized widely. They express remembrances in spatial patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) of beta and gamma waves.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of stroke patients to control their own brain activity via NF and evaluated specific effects of different NF protocols on cognition, in particular recovery of memory. Methods: N = 17 stroke patients received up to ten sessions of either SMR (N = 11, 12-15 Hz) or Upper Alpha (N = 6, e.g. 10-12 Hz) NF training. N = 7 stroke patients received treatment as usual as control condition. Furthermore, N = 40 healthy controls performed NF training as well. To evaluate the NF training outcome, a test battery assessing different cognitive functions was performed before and after NF training. Results: About 70 % of both patients and controls achieved distinct gains in NF performance leading to improvements in verbal short- and long-term memory, independent of the used NF protocol. The SMR patient group showed specific improvements in visuo-spatial short-term memory performance, whereas the Upper Alpha patient group specifically improved their working memory performance. NF training effects were even stronger than effects of traditional cognitive training methods in stroke patients. NF training showed no effects on other cognitive functions than memory. Conclusions: Post-stroke victims with memory deficits could benefit from NF training as much as healthy controls. The used NF training protocols (SMR, Upper Alpha) had specific as well as unspecific effects on memory. Hence, NF might offer an effective cognitive rehabilitation tool improving memory deficits of stroke survivors.

In our previous study, we investigated the behavior of switching between synchronized and desynchronized states induced by inhibitory interactions between groups of neurons, and proposed a continuous model for a loop-finding system, where a closed loop is defined as a phase synchronization of a group of oscillators belonging to corresponding nodes (K-I Ueda, Phys Rev E 87:052920, 2013). In this study, we modify the previous models to improve the loop-finding time. It is demonstrated that bidirectional flows of phase synchronized waves and interaction between them can improve the loop-finding time.

J	Lazar, AS; Lazar, ZI; Dijk, DJ				Lazar, Alpar S.; Lazar, Zsolt I.; Dijk, Derk-Jan			Circadian regulation of slow waves in human sleep: Topographical aspects	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Forced desynchrony; Homeostasis; Slope analyses; EEG	RAPID EYE-MOVEMENT; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; DEPENDENT MODULATION; MELATONIN RHYTHMS; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; HOMEOSTASIS; TEMPERATURE; AMPLITUDE	Slow waves (SWs, 0.5-4 Hz) in field potentials during sleep reflect synchronized alternations between bursts of action potentials and periods of membrane hyperpolarization of cortical neurons. SWs decline during sleep and this is thought to be related to a reduction of synaptic strength in cortical networks and to be central to sleep's role in maintaining brain function. A central assumption in current concepts of sleep function is that SWs during sleep, and associated recovery processes, are independent of circadian rhythmicity. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying all SWs from 12 EEG derivations in 34 participants in whom 231 sleep periods were scheduled across the circadian cycle in a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol which allowed estimation of the separate circadian and sleep-dependent modulation of SWs. Circadian rhythmicity significantly modulated the incidence, amplitude, frequency and the slope of the SWs such that the peaks of the circadian rhythms in these slow-wave parameters were located during the biological day. Topographical analyses demonstrated that the sleep-dependent modulation of SW characteristics was most prominent in frontal brain areas whereas the circadian effect was similar to or greater than the sleep-dependent modulation over the central and posterior brain regions. The data demonstrate that circadian rhythmicity directly modulates characteristics of SWs thought to be related to synaptic plasticity and that this modulation depends on topography. These findings have implications for the understanding of local sleep regulation and conditions such as ageing, depression, and neurodegeneration which are associated with changes in SWs, neural plasticity and circadian rhythmicity.

We investigated the mechanisms of voice pitch motor control by examining the spectro-temporal dynamics of EEG signals when non-musicians (NM), relative pitch (RP), and absolute pitch (AP) musicians maintained vocalizations of a vowel sound and received randomized 100 cents pitch-shift stimuli in their auditory feedback. We identified a phase-synchronized (evoked) fronto-central activation within the theta band (5-8 Hz) that temporally overlapped with compensatory vocal responses to pitch-shifted auditory feedback and was significantly stronger in RP and AP musicians compared with non-musicians. A second component involved a non-phase-synchronized (induced) frontal activation within the delta band (1-4 Hz) that emerged at approximately 1 s after the stimulus onset. The delta activation was significantly stronger in the NM compared with RP and AP groups and correlated with the pitch rebound error (PRE), indicating the degree to which subjects failed to re-adjust their voice pitch to baseline after the stimulus offset. We propose that the evoked theta is a neurophysiological marker of enhanced pitch processing in musicians and reflects mechanisms by which humans incorporate auditory feedback to control their voice pitch. We also suggest that the delta activation reflects adaptive neural processes by which vocal production errors are monitored and used to update the state of sensory-motor networks for driving subsequent vocal behaviors. This notion is corroborated by our findings showing that larger PREs were associated with greater delta band activity in the NM compared with RP and AP groups. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of auditory feedback processing for vocal pitch motor control.

The robustness of this effect, however, varies across studies and subjects, putting limits to its interpretation. We hypothesized that variation in the fm-theta effect may reflect individual differences in task difficulty with increasing WM load as indicated by behavioural responses. We further tested whether effects in the alpha range are robust markers of WM load. We recorded 64-channel EEG from 24 healthy adults while they memorized either 2 or 4 unfamiliar symbols (low vs. high WM load) in a modified Sternberg task. The last 2 s of the retention phase were analyzed for WM load-related changes in the theta (5-7 Hz) and alpha range (lower: 8-10 Hz, upper: 10.5-12.5 Hz). Higher WM load led to less accurate and slower responses. The increase of fm-theta with WM load was most pronounced at fm electrodes, localized to anterior cingulate regions, and correlated with the participants' decrease in accuracy due to higher WM load. Alpha peak frequency increased in the high compared to the low WM load condition, corresponding to a decrease in lower alpha range across all channels. The results demonstrate that previously reported variation in fm-theta workload effects can partly be explained by variation in task difficulty indexed by individual task accuracy. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that alpha WM load effects are prominent when separating upper and lower alpha.

Musical Sequence Learning and EEG Correlates of Audiomotor Processing	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AUDITORY-MOTOR INTERACTIONS; MU-RHYTHMS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; NETWORK; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; PIANISTS; MOTION; OSCILLATIONS	Our motor and auditory systems are functionally connected during musical performance, and functional imaging suggests that the association is strong enough that passive music listening can engage the motor system. As predictive coding constrains movement sequence selections, could the motor system contribute to sequential processing of musical passages? If this is the case, then we hypothesized that the motor system should respond preferentially to passages of music that contain similar sequential information, even if other aspects of music, such as the absolute pitch, have been altered. We trained piano naive subjects with a learn-to play-by-ear paradigm, to play a simple melodic sequence over five days. After training, we recorded EEG of subjects listening to the song they learned to play, a transposed version of that song, and a control song with different notes and sequence from the learned song. Beta band power over sensorimotor scalp showed increased suppression for the learned song, a moderate level of suppression for the transposed song, and no suppression for the control song. As beta power is associated with attention and motor processing, we interpret this as support of the motor system's activity during covert perception of music one can play and similar musical sequences.

Epilepsy surgery: recent advances in brain mapping, neuroimaging and surgical procedures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Epilepsy, surgery; Brain mapping; Nervous system diseases	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; EXTRATEMPORAL EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; CORPUS CALLOSOTOMY; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS	The general principle of epilepsy surgery is to achieve seizure freedom without causing any neurological deficit that would outweigh the clinical benefit. To achieve this, the epileptogenic zone, which is the part of the brain responsible for seizure generation, as well as the anatomic location of the eloquent cortex must be precisely identified in order to spare those functions during excision of the epileptogenic tissue. Major technical advances over the last decade have continuously contributed to increase our ability to map the brain and identify these critical areas. These technologies and innovations that can be routinely used today include non-invasive studies such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional MRI (fMRI), simultaneous EEG-fMRI, and nuclear medicine based methods like PET and SPECT as well as invasive studies through chronically implanted electrodes. Electrodes can be either placed subdurally via burr holes and craniotomies or within the brain parenchima via frame-based and frameless stereotactic methods. Apart from a continuous change in these insertion techniques, the most valuable advances here include recordings on high frequency bandwidth (100-600 Hz EEG) that are capable to delineate high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). These HFOs have been recognized as a biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. All of these technical advances have made epilepsy surgery a truly multidisciplinary field and surgeons have to be able to understand and interpret all of the gathered data. Moreover, this development has influenced surgical approaches and techniques and epilepsy surgery today includes a wide variety of procedures. These can be subdivided into resective, disconnective and neuromodulation procedures and vary from a small, targeted lesionectomy to disconnection/resection of one entire hemisphere. This review will give an overview of the available surgical techniques today and will focus on how the technical advances enable us to map the brain and delineate the critical areas.

PEDIATRICS			English	Article							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GABAERGIC MODULATION; HUMAN CORTEX; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; FREQUENCY	The diuretic agent bumetanide has recently been put forward as a novel, promising treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions. Bumetanide can decrease neuronal chloride concentrations and may thereby reinstate g-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, strategies to select appropriate candidates for bumetanide treatment are lacking. We hypothesized that a paradoxical response to GABA-enforcing agents such as benzodiazepines may predict the efficacy of bumetanide treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders. We describe a case of a 10-year-old girl with ASD, epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, and a 15q11.2 duplication who had exhibited marked behavioral arousal after previous treatment with clobazam, a benzodiazepine. We hypothesized that this response indicated the presence of depolarizing excitatory GABA and started bumetanide treatment with monitoring of behavior, cognition, and EEG. The treatment resulted in a marked clinical improvement in sensory behaviors, rigidity, and memory performance, which was substantiated by questionnaires and cognitive assessments. At baseline, the girl's EEG showed a depression in absolute a power, an electrographic sign previously related to ASD, which was normalized with bumetanide treatment. The effects of bumetanide on cognition and EEG seemed to mirror the "nonparadoxical" responses to benzodiazepines in healthy subjects. In addition, temporal lobe epilepsy and cortical dysplasia have both been linked to disturbed chloride homeostasis and seem to support our assumption that the observed paradoxical response was due to GABA-mediated excitation. This case highlights that a paradoxical behavioral response to GABA-enforcing drugs may constitute a framework for targeted treatment with bumetanide.

Methods: The underlying etiology consisted of cortical dysplasia, glioma, hippocampal sclerosis, and low-grade neuroepithelial tumor in nine, four, two, and one patients, respectively. The median number of analyzed seizure events was 8.0 per patient (range: 2-10). Chronic electrocorticographic recording was performed with (1) a band-pass filter of 0.016-600 Hz (or 0.016-300 Hz) and a sampling rate of 2000 Hz (or 1000 Hz). Results: Ictal DC shifts and a sustained form of ictal HFOs were observed in 75.0% and 50.0% of the patients, and 71.3% and 46.3% of the analyzed seizures. Visual assessment revealed that the onset of ictal DC shifts preceded that of ictal HFOs with statistical significance in 5/7 patients. The spatial extent of ictal DC shifts or HFOs was smaller than that of the conventionally defined seizure onset zone in 9/12 patients. Conclusion: Both ictal DC shifts and HFOs might represent the core of tissue generating seizures. Significance: The early occurrence of ictal DC shifts warrants further studies to determine the role of glia (possibly mediating ictal DC shifts) in seizure generation.

Personality and the neural efficiency theory	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						Neural efficiency theory; Personality; EEG; Social interactions; Theta oscillations	DYNAMICS; INTELLIGENCE; SENSITIVITY; ASYMMETRY; ANXIETY; SYSTEM	The neural efficiency theory was formulated in the field of intelligence research and it posits that better performers require less brain activity to successfully perform a task of a given difficulty level. Here we suggest that in the field of personality research, the neural efficiency concept could be reformulated so that habitual behavior requires less brain activity. To test this hypothesis, 46 participants were presented with a social interactions task, in which they had to choose one out of three ways of interaction with a virtual 'person': 'attack', 'avoid', or 'make friends', while EEG was recorded simultaneously. Personality was assessed using the Eysenck Personality Profiler. Extraverts made more friendly choices and these choices were accompanied by smaller event-related theta synchronization in the left prefrontal cortex. Neuroticism did not show significant behavioral effects, but in high neuroticism scorers, the choice of avoidance was accompanied by smaller theta synchronization in the right prefrontal cortex. Psychoticism was positively associated with the number of aggressive choices and in high psychoticism scorers, these choices were accompanied by smaller theta synchronization in the left precentral cortex. These results are consistent with the extension of the neural efficiency concept for personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important for mediating and executing these functions. Functional neuroimaging and molecular studies have consistently shown PFC abnormalities in ScZ. In addition, recent studies have suggested that impairments in oscillatory activity, especially in the gamma band (approximately 30-80 Hz), reflect disturbed cortical information processing in this patient group. Here we review evidence that dysfunctional gamma-band responses (GBR) in the PFC could be a factor contributing to WM and other cognitive deficits in ScZ. We provide an overview of noninvasive electrophysiological studies reporting frontal GBR abnormalities in ScZ patients during WM and other cognitive tasks. In agreement with the often-reported hypofrontality in functional neuroimaging studies, the majority of reviewed studies revealed reduced amplitudes or reduced phase locking of GBR over frontal areas in this patient group. Clinical implications derived from these findings and possibilities to foster future studies on GBR abnormalities in ScZ patients, are discussed. Since oscillatory activity in the gamma band has previously been linked to a variety of neurotransmitters, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic system, the study of prefrontal GBR could also have implications for pharmacologic approaches in the treatment of WM and other cognitive deficits in ScZ.

A novel biomarker of amnestic MCI based on dynamic cross-frequency coupling patterns during cognitive brain responses	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive impairment; ERPs; phase-amplitude coupling; functional connectomics; dynamic coordination; dynome; connectomic biomarkers	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; P300 SUBCOMPONENTS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; EEG COHERENCE; IMPAIRMENT	The detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the transitional stage between normal cognitive changes of aging and the cognitive decline caused by AD, is of paramount clinical importance, since MCI patients are at increased risk of progressing into AD. Electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the spectral content of brainwaves and connectivity at resting state have been associated with early-stage AD. Recently, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have entered into the picture as an easy to perform screening test. Motivated by the recent findings about the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in cognition, we introduce a relevant methodological approach for detecting MCI based on cognitive responses from a standard auditory oddball paradigm. By using the single trial signals recorded at Pz sensor and comparing the responses to target and non-target stimuli, we first demonstrate that increased CFC is associated with the cognitive task. Then, considering the dynamic character of CFC, we identify instances during which the coupling between particular pairs of brainwave frequencies carries sufficient information for discriminating between normal subjects and patients with MCI. In this way, we form a multiparametric signature of impaired cognition. The new composite biomarker was tested using data from a cohort that consists of 25 amnestic MCI patients and 15 age-matched controls. Standard machine-learning algorithms were employed so as to implement the binary classification task. Based on leave-one-out cross validation, the measured classification rate was found reaching very high levels (95%). Our approach compares favorably with the traditional alternative of using the morphology of averaged ERP response to make the diagnosis and the usage of features from spectro-temporal analysis of single-trial responses. This further indicates that task related CFC measurements can provide invaluable analytics in AD diagnosis and prognosis.

Though there has been extensive work, how both parameters are related to the electrical properties of brain tissue and the sources of brain rhythms has not been fully understood. To address the issue, a simulation is done based on the theory of dipole current. When referring to the solution to the forward problem in electroencephalograph, the brain is regarded as a homogenous sphere model, the electrical features of brain tissue are described by an isotropic electrical conductivity. The source of brain rhythms is simulated by the quasi-static dipole current whose activity is described as a sine oscillation at low frequency. The electrical field generated by the dipole current is considered to be quasi-static. By changing the amplitude and the phase time course of oscillatory dipole current, the distribution of potentials produced by the dipole current at a time-point could be calculated by applying the finite element method to the sphere model. Over a time period of sine oscillation, the oscillatory potentials regarded as the brain rhythms could be produced. Instantaneous power and phase of simulated rhythms are estimated by Hilbert transform, and then a method of phase stability in narrow-band is developed for a single oscillator. To highlight this method, three manners are employed to describe it, i.e., mean relative phase value termed phase preserved index, histogram on rose plane, and phase sorting with the help of EEGLAB. Finally the relationship between two physical parameters and the electrical features of brain tissue/the source activity of brain rhythms is investigated under the conditions of (an) isotropy of conductivity, linear or nonlinear phase dynamics and amplitude, eccentricity of dipole current, etc. The statistical methods of t-test and bootstrapping technology are performed respectively to show the significance of power and phase stability. It is obtained that the power of simulated rhythms decreases with the increase of electrical conductivity, and it is not only proportional to the square of the amplitude of dipole current, but also correlated with the anisotropy of conductivity and the locations of dipole current as well as meshes on the sphere model, however no relevance to other factors. On the contrary, the phase stability of simulated rhythms is correlated only with the non-linear time course of their own phase dynamics. The results imply that the power of brain rhythms is related to many factors such as brain tissue and amplitude of rhythm generator as well as placements of recording electrodes, but the phase stability is related only to the non-linear phase dynamics of brain rhythms. Thus, the electrical significance of the power is more complicated than that of the phase stability. This work might be helpful for understanding in depth the significance of both physical parameters from the perspective of electricity. The narrow-band phase stability of simulated rhythms could highlight the non-linear phase dynamics. It is hypothesized that the phase stability could not only map the synchrony in the neural activity as a custom means of phase coherence, but also reflect directly the non-linearity in phase dynamics, and the more divergent the phase dynamics, the lower the phase stability is, and vice verse. Therefore it is suggested that the phase stability of brain rhythms could be related closely to the non-linear factors to affect the phase dynamics of brain rhythms, e.g., the non-linear phase dynamics of rhythm generators. It is also suggested that both parameters of power and phase stability would offer more neural information.

In beta band, decrease of connectivity upon eyes opening was more pronounced in younger than in older participants. The extent of this decrease was associated with reaction time in attention tasks, and this relationship was fully mediated by participants' age, implying that physiological processes, which lead to age-related slowing, include changes in beta reactivity. Graph-theoretical analysis showed a decrease of modularity and clustering in beta and gamma band networks in older adults, implying that age makes brain networks more random. The overall number of nodes identified as hubs in posterior cortical regions decreased in older participants. At the same time, increase of connectedness of anterior nodes, probably reflecting compensatory activation of the anterior attentional system, was observed in beta-band network of older adults. These findings show that normal aging mostly affects interactions in beta band, which are probably involved in attentional processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during "off-line" states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, "p-ripples,"which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. (C) 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Disruption of Neural Synchrony despite Enhanced Gamma Oscillations in a Model of Disrupted Perceptual Coherence	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; BAND ACTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; DECISION-MAKING; AUTISM SPECTRUM; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DORSAL STREAM; FREQUENCY; DISORDERS	It has been hypothesized that neural synchrony underlies perceptual coherence. The hypothesis of loss of central perceptual coherence has been proposed to be at the origin of abnormal cognition in autism spectrum disorders and Williams syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder linked with autism, and a clearcut model for impaired central coherence. We took advantage of this model of impaired holistic processing to test the hypothesis that loss of neural synchrony plays a separable role in visual integration using EEG and a set of experimental tasks requiring coherent integration of local elements leading to 3-D face perception. A profound reorganization of brain activity was identified. Neural synchrony was reduced across stimulus conditions, and this was associated with increased amplitude modulation at 25-45 Hz. This combination of a dramatic loss of synchrony despite increased oscillatory activity is strong evidence that synchrony underlies central coherence. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that dissociation between amplitude and synchrony is reported in a human model of impaired perceptual coherence, suggesting that loss of phase coherence is more directly related to disruption of holistic perception.

Automatic Identification and Classification of Muscle Spasms in Long-Term EMG Recordings	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automatic classification; clonus; motor units; spasticity; spinal cord injury (SCI)	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MOTOR UNITS; CLONUS; SPASTICITY; PATTERNS; EEG	Spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals may be afflicted by spasticity, a condition in which involuntary muscle spasms are common. EMG recordings can be analyzed to quantify this symptom of spasticity but manual identification and classification of spasms are time consuming. Here, an algorithm was created to find and classify spasm events automatically within 24-h recordings of EMG. The algorithm used expert rules and time-frequency techniques to classify spasm events as tonic, unit, or clonus spasms. A companion graphical user interface (GUI) program was also built to verify and correct the results of the automatic algorithm or manually defined events. Eight channel EMG recordings were made from seven different SCI subjects. The algorithm was able to correctly identify an average (+/- SD) of 94.5 +/- 3.6% spasm events and correctly classify 91.6 +/- 1.9% of spasm events, with an accuracy of 61.7 +/- 16.2%. The accuracy improved to 85.5 +/- 5.9% and the false positive rate decreased to 7.1 +/- 7.3%, respectively, if noise events between spasms were removed. On average, the algorithm was more than 11 times faster than manual analysis. Use of both the algorithm and the GUI program provide a powerful tool for characterizing muscle spasms in 24-h EMG recordings, information which is important for clinical management of spasticity.

Performance in sequence learning tasks improves with repetition and involves forming temporal associations over scales of seconds to minutes. To further understand the neural circuits underlying declarative sequence learning over trials, we tracked changes in intracranial field potentials (IFPs) recorded from 1142 electrodes implanted throughout temporal and frontal cortical areas in 14 human subjects, while they learned the temporal-order of multiple sequences of images over trials through repeated recall. We observed an increase in power in the gamma frequency band (30-100 Hz) in the recall phase, particularly in areas within the temporal lobe including the parahippocampal gyrus. The degree of this gamma power enhancement decreased over trials with improved sequence recall. Modulation of gamma power was directly correlated with the improvement in recall performance. When presenting new sequences, gamma power was reset to high values and decreased again after learning. These observations suggest that signals in the gamma frequency band may play a more prominent role during the early steps of the learning process rather than during the maintenance of memory traces.

Top-down and bottom-up modulation of pain-induced oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						pain; EEG; gamma band; attention; functional imaging	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ACTIVITY REFLECTS	Attention is an important factor that is able to strongly modulate the experience of pain. In order to differentiate cortical mechanisms underlying subject-driven (i.e., top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) modes of attentional pain modulation, we recorded electric brain activity in healthy volunteers during painful laser stimulation while spatial attention and stimulus intensity were systematically varied. The subjects' task was to evaluate the pain intensity at the attended finger, while ignoring laser stimuli delivered to the other finger. Top-down (attention) and bottom up (intensity) influences differed in their effects on oscillatory response components. Attention towards pain induced a decrease in alpha and an increase in gamma band power, localized in the insula. Pain intensity modulated delta, alpha, beta and gamma band power. Source localization revealed stimulus driven modulation in the cingulate gyrus (CG) and somatosensory areas for gamma power changes. Our results indicate that bottom-up and top-down modes of processing exert different effects on pain induced slow and fast oscillatory activities. Future studies may examine pain-induced oscillations using this paradigm to test for altered attentional pain control in patients with chronic pain.

Increasing experimental evidence suggests that interactions between those distinct bands play a crucial role in brain processes, but the dynamical mechanisms underlying this cross-frequency coupling are still under investigation. Two approaches have been proposed to address this issue. In the first one distinct nonlinear oscillators representing the brain rhythms involved are coupled actively (bidirectionally), whereas in the second one the oscillators are coupled unidirectionally and thus the driving between them is passive. Here we elaborate the latter approach by implementing a stochastically driven network of coupled neural mass models that operate in the alpha range. This model exhibits a broadband power spectrum with 1/f(b) form, similar to those observed experimentally. Our results show that such a model is able to reproduce recent experimental observations on the effect of slow rocking on the alpha activity associated with sleep. This suggests that passive driving can account for cross-frequency transfer in the brain, as a result of the complex nonlinear dynamics of its underlying oscillators.

In this article we discuss cognitive capacity (the number of items that can be held in mind simultaneously) and suggest that the limit is inherent to processing based on oscillatory brain rhythms, or brain waves, which may regulate neural communication. Neurons that hum together temporarily wire together, allowing the brain to form and re-form networks on the fly, which may explain a hallmark of intelligence and cognition: mental flexibility. But this comes at a cost; only a small number of thoughts can fit into each wave. This explains why you should never talk on a mobile phone when driving.

To investigate this, we focused on participants' alpha activities (8-12 Hz) that closely correlates with insight problem solving and defocused attention while they were solving Chinese logogriphs. Results indicated that in the time window of 800-1400 ms after the presentation of target logogriphs, alpha power over parieto-central electrodes decreased relative to the reference interval in both the successful and unsuccessful logogriphs solving conditions. However, alpha power increased at parieto-occipital electrode sites in successful conditions compared with that in unsuccessful condition. The decrease in alpha activity in both conditions may reflect the cognitive demands in solving the target logogriphs. Furthermore, difference in alpha power between the successful and unsuccessful conditions at parieto-occipital electrode sites is associated with the process of heuristic information. Alpha synchronization observed in the successful condition compared to the unsuccessful condition might reflect a state of defocused attention that facilitates insight problem solving.

Electrocortical evidence of increased post-reappraisal neural reactivity and its link to depressive symptoms	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reappraisal; EEG/ERP; LPP; alpha, depression	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; EMOTION REGULATION; COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES; ALPHA; MEMORY; SELF; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; STRATEGIES; COSTS	Few studies have examined whether effortful emotion regulation has a protracted impact on subsequent affective appraisal, and even fewer have investigated this effect on a trial-by-trial basis. In this study, we hypothesized that engaging cognitive resources via reappraisal during a trial would result in a subsequent period of increased reactivity on the next trial, as quantified using event-related potentials and oscillations. Forty-eight healthy individuals passively viewed unpleasant and neutral pictures followed by an auditory instruction to either continue viewing normally or reappraise emotional response to pictures. Viewing unpleasant pictures yielded increased late positive potential (LPP) and decreased posterior alpha (8-13 Hz) compared with neutral pictures. A similar pattern was observed on trials that immediately 'followed' emotion regulation instructions. Moreover, individuals with increased self-reported depressive symptoms showed greater LPP and alpha modulation following emotion regulation, suggesting that these responses may relate to compromised emotion regulation ability. This study demonstrates that cognitive reappraisal induces subsequent heightened reactivity that may reflect transient resource depletion, and these effects are more pronounced among those with increased depressive symptoms. Interventions that focus on emotion regulation might use these electrocortical markers to track changes in regulatory efficacy.

Despite its potential relevance for understanding healthy and pathological brain function, the standard CFC analysis and physiological interpretation come with fundamental problems. For example, apparent CFC can appear because of spectral correlations due to common non-stationarities that may arise in the total absence of interactions between neural frequency components. To provide a road map towards an improved mechanistic understanding of CFC, we organize the available and potential novel statistica/modeling approaches according to their biophysical interpretability. While we do not provide solutions for all the problems described, we provide a list of practical recommendations to avoid common errors and to enhance the interpretability of CFC analysis.

Scott			The coordination dynamics of social neuromarkers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						social coordination; alpha; mu; phi complex; brain rhythms; coordination dynamics; complexity	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MU-RHYTHM; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; RECIPROCAL IMITATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ACTION-PERCEPTION; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME	Social behavior is a complex integrative function that entails many aspects of the brain's sensory, cognitive, emotional and movement capacities. Its neural processes are seldom simultaneous but occur according to precise spatiotemporal choreographies, manifested by the coordination of their oscillations within and between brains. Methods with good temporal resolution can help to identify so-called "neuromarkers" of social function and aid in disentangling the dynamical architecture of social brains. In our ongoing research, we have used dual-electroencephalography (EEG) to study neuromarker dynamics during synchronic interactions in which pairs of subjects coordinate behavior spontaneously and intentionally (social coordination) and during diachronic transactions that require subjects to perceive or behave in turn (action observation, delayed imitation). In this paper, after outlining our dynamical approach to the neurophysiological basis of social behavior, we examine commonalities and differences in the neuromarkers that are recruited for both kinds of tasks. We find the neuromarker landscape to be task-specific: synchronic paradigms of social coordination reveal medial mu, alpha and the phi complex as contributing neuromarkers. Diachronic tasks recruit alpha as well, in addition to lateral mu rhythms and the newly discovered nu and kappa rhythms whose functional significance is still unclear. Social coordination, observation, and delayed imitation share commonality of context: in each of our experiments, subjects exchanged information through visual perception and moved in similar ways. Nonetheless, there was little overlap between their neuromarkers, a result that hints strongly of task-specific neural mechanisms for social behavior. The only neuromarker that transcended both synchronic and diachronic social behaviors was the ubiquitous alpha rhythm, which appears to be a key signature of visually-mediated social behaviors. The present paper is both an entry point and a challenge: much work remains to determine the nature and scope of recruitment of other neuromarkers, and to create theoretical models of their within- and between-brain dynamics during social interaction.

One neural signature of WM load is enhanced power of alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz). However, it is unknown to what extent common internal, auditory degradation, that is, hearing impairment, affects the neural mechanisms of WM when audibility has been ensured via amplification. Using an adapted auditory Sternberg paradigm, we varied the orthogonal factors memory load and background noise level, while the electroencephalogram was recorded. In each trial, participants were presented with 2, 4, or 6 spoken digits embedded in one of three different levels of background noise. After a stimulus-free delay interval, participants indicated whether a probe digit had appeared in the sequence of digits. Participants were healthy older adults (62-86 years), with normal to moderately impaired hearing. Importantly, the background noise levels were individually adjusted and participants were wearing hearing aids to equalize audibility across participants. Irrespective of hearing loss (HL), behavioral performance improved with lower memory load and also with lower levels of background noise. Interestingly, the alpha power in the stimulus-free delay interval was dependent on the interplay between task demands (memory load and noise level) and HL; while alpha power increased with HL during low and intermediate levels of memory load and background noise, it dropped for participants with the relatively most severe HL under the highest memory load and background noise level. These findings suggest that adaptive neural mechanisms for coping with adverse listening conditions break down for higher degrees of HL, even when adequate hearing aid amplification is in place.

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABA receptors are widely expressed within this network. Herein, we examined the effects of two selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors, the GABA reuptake inhibitor, tiagabine, and their interaction in the somatosensory cortex and thalamus on SWDs in WAG/Rij rats. MethodsMale WAG/Rij rats were equipped with bilateral cannulas in the somatosensory cortex (S1po) or the ventrobasal (VB) thalamic nuclei, and with cortical electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. Rats received a single dose of the mGlu1 receptor PAM, RO0711401, or the mGlu5 receptor PAM, VU0360172, various doses of tiagabine, or VU0360172 combined with tiagabine. ResultsBoth PAMs suppressed SWDs regardless of the site of injection. Tiagabine enhanced SWDs when injected into the thalamus, but, unexpectedly, suppressed SWDs in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the cortex. Intracortical co-injection of VU0360172 and tiagabine produced slightly larger effects as compared to either VU0360172 or tiagabine alone. Intrathalamic co-injections of VU0360172 and subthreshold doses of tiagabine caused an antiabsence effect similar to that exhibited by VU0360172 alone in the first 10min. At 30min, however, the antiabsence effect of VU0360172 was prevented by subthreshold doses of tiagabine, and the combination produced a paradoxical proabsence effect at 40 and 50min. SignificanceThese data (1) show that mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor PAMs reduce absence seizures acting at both thalamic and cortical levels; (2) demonstrate for the first time that tiagabine, despite its established absence-enhancing effect, reduces SWDs when injected into the somatosensory cortex; and (3) indicate that the efficacy of VU0360172 in the thalamus may be critically affected by the availability of (extra)synaptic GABA.

Here we use bifurcation theory and small-noise linear stochastics to study the range of a phase transitions-sudden qualitative changes in the state of a dynamical system emerging from a bifurcation-accessible to the Wilson-Cowan network. Specifically, we examine saddle-node, Hopf, Turing, and Turing-Hopf instabilities. We introduce stochasticity by adding small-amplitude spatio-temporal white noise, and analyze the resulting subthreshold fluctuations using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck linearization. This analysis predicts divergent changes in correlation and spectral characteristics of neural activity during close approach to bifurcation from below. We validate these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations. The results demonstrate the role of noise in the emergence of critically slowed precursors in both space and time, and suggest that these early-warning signals are a universal feature of a neural system close to bifurcation. In particular, these precursor signals are likely to have neurobiological significance as early warnings of impending state change in the cortex. We support this claim with an analysis of the in vitro local field potentials recorded from slices of mouse-brain tissue. We show that in the period leading up to emergence of spontaneous seizure-like events, the mouse field potentials show a characteristic spectral focusing toward lower frequencies concomitant with a growth in fluctuation variance, consistent with critical slowing near a bifurcation point. This observation of biological criticality has clear implications regarding the feasibility of seizure prediction.	[Negahbani, Ehsan; Steyn-Ross, D.

But it is unclear how activity in IFG and TPJ coordinates during attention demanding tasks and whether functional interactions between both structures are related to successful attentional performance. Here, we tested these questions in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in human subjects using a visual detection task that required sustained attentional expectancy in order to detect non-salient, near-threshold visual events. We found that during sustained attention the successful visual detection was predicted by increased phase synchronization of band-limited 15-30 Hz beta band activity that was absent prior to misses. Increased beta-band phase alignment during attentional engagement early during the task was restricted to inferior and lateral prefrontal cortex, but with sustained attention it extended to long-range IFG-TPJ phase synchronization and included superior prefrontal areas. In addition to beta, a widely distributed network of brain areas comprising the occipital cortex showed enhanced and reduced alpha band phase synchronization before correct detections. These findings identify long-range phase synchrony in the 15-30 Hz beta band as the mesoscale brain signal that predicts the successful deployment of attentional expectancy of sensory events. We speculate that localized beta coherent states in prefrontal cortex index 'top-down' sensory expectancy whose coupling with TPJ subregions facilitates the gating of relevant visual information.

Here, we investigated this open question by using a previously established behavioral paradigm in combination with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Healthy human subjects encoded a series of scene images, which was combined with cues predicting an aversive electric shock with different probabilities (0.2, 0.5 or 0.8). After encoding, memory for the studied images was tested using a remember/know recognition task. Behaviorally, pain anticipation did not modulate recollection-based recognition memory per se, but interacted with the perceived unpleasantness of the electric shock [visual analogue scale rating from I (not unpleasant) to 10 (highly unpleasant)]. More precisely, the relationship between pain anticipation and recollection followed an inverted u-shaped function the more unpleasant the shocks were rated by a subject. At the physiological level, this quadratic effect was mimicked in the event-related magnetic fields associated with successful memory formation ('DM-effect') similar to 450 ms after image onset at left frontal sensors. Importantly, across all subjects, shock anticipation modulated oscillatory power in the low beta frequency range (13-20 Hz) in a linear fashion at left temporal sensors. Taken together, our findings indicate that beta oscillations provide a generic mechanism underlying pain anticipation; the effect on subsequent long-term memory, on the other hand, is much more variable and depends on the level of individual pain perception. As such, our findings give new and important insights into how aversive motivational states can drive memory formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous studies showed that SOs and associated memory function can be effectively enhanced by closed-loop auditory stimulation, when clicks are presented in synchrony with upcoming SO up states. However, increasing SOs and synchronized excitability also bear the risk of emerging seizure activity, suggesting the presence of mechanisms in the healthy brain that counter developing hypersynchronicity during SOs. Here, we aimed to test the limits of driving SOs through closed-loop auditory stimulation in healthy humans. Study I tested a "Driving stimulation" protocol (vs "Sham") in which trains of clicks were presented in synchrony with SO up states basically as long as an ongoing SO train was identified on-line. Study II compared Driving stimulation with a "2-Click" protocol where the maximum of stimuli delivered in a train was limited to two clicks. Stimulation was applied during SWS in the first 210 min of nocturnal sleep. Before and after sleep declarative word-pair memories were tested. Compared with the Sham control, Driving stimulation prolonged SO trains and enhanced SO amplitudes, phase-locked spindle activity, and overnight retention of word pairs (all ps < 0.05). Importantly, effects of Driving stimulation did not exceed those of 2-Click stimulation (p > 0.180), indicating the presence of a mechanism preventing the development of hypersynchronicity during SO activity. Assessment of temporal dynamics revealed a rapidly fading phase-locked spindle activity during repetitive click stimulation, suggesting that spindle refractoriness contributes to this protective mechanism.

The pHFOs emerge during a latent period prior to the onset of spontaneous generalized seizures. We used a unilateral suprahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) mouse model of TLE to characterize the properties of hippocampal pHFOs during epileptogenesis. MethodsIn awake head-fixed mice, 4-14 days after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE), we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) with 64-channel silicon probes spanning from CA1 alveus to the DG hilus, or with glass pipettes in the DC mode in the CA1 str radiatum. ResultsThe pHFOs, are observed simultaneously in the CA1 and the DG, or in the DG alone, as early as 4 days post-SE. The pHFOs ride on top of DC deflections, occur during motionless periods, persist through the onset of TLE, and are generated in bursts. Burst parameters remain remarkably constant during epileptogenesis, with a random number of pHFOs generated per burst. In contrast, pHFO duration and spectral dynamics evolve from short events at 4 days post-SE to prolonged discharges with complex spectral characteristics by 14 days post-SE. Simultaneous dural EEG recordings were exceedingly unreliable for detecting hippocampal pHFOs; therefore, such recordings may deceptively indicate a silent period even when massive hippocampal activity is present. SignificanceOur results demonstrate that hippocampal pHFOs exhibit a dynamic evolution during the epileptogenic period following SE, consistent with their role in transitioning to the chronic stage of TLE.

Although these observations suggest a causal link between network rhythms and perception, it remains unknown how precisely they affect the processes by which neural populations encode sounds. We addressed this question by analyzing neural responses in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats using stimulus-response models. These models included a parametric dependence on the phase of local field potential rhythms in both stimulus-unrelated background activity and the stimulus-response transfer function. We found that phase-dependent models better reproduced the observed responses than static models, during both stimulation with a series of natural sounds and epochs of silence. This was attributable to two factors: (1) phase-dependent variations in background firing (most prominent for delta; 1-4 Hz); and (2) modulations of response gain that rhythmically amplify and attenuate the responses at specific phases of the rhythm (prominent for frequencies between 2 and 12 Hz). These results provide a quantitative characterization of how slow auditory cortical rhythms shape sound encoding and suggest a differential contribution of network activity at different timescales. In addition, they highlight a putative mechanism that may implement the selective amplification of appropriately timed sound tokens relative to the phase of rhythmic auditory cortex activity.

SWDreader: A wavelet-based algorithm using spectral phase to characterize spike-wave morphological variation in genetic models of absence epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Spike-wave discharge; Spike-wave complex; Phase differences; Seizure detection algorithm; Harmonic analysis; Fundamental frequency; Morphology; Morlet wavelet transform; Mouse mutant; Absence epilepsy	DISCHARGES; SEIZURES; NEURONS; EEG; INHIBITION; C3H/HEJ	Background: Spike-wave discharges (SWD) found in neuroelectrical recordings are pathognomonic to absence epilepsy. The characteristic spike-wave morphology of the spike-wave complex (SWC) constituents of SWDs can be mathematically described by a subset of possible spectral power and phase values. Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) generates time-frequency representations well-suited to identifying this SWC-associated subset. New method: MWT decompositions of SWDs reveal spectral power concentrated at harmonic frequencies. The phase relationships underlying SWC morphology were identified by calculating the differences between phase values at SWD fundamental frequency from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonics, then using the three phase differences as coordinates to generate a density distribution in a {360 degrees x 360 degrees x 360 degrees} phase difference space. Strain-specific density distributions were generated from SWDs of mice carrying the Gria4, Gabrg2, or Scn8a mutations to determine whether SWC morphological variants reliably mapped to the same regions of the distribution, and if distribution values could be used to detect SWD. Comparison with existing methods: To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is the first to employ spectral phase to quantify SWC morphology, making it possible to computationally distinguish SWC morphological subtypes and detect SWDs. Results/conclusions: Proof-of-concept testing of the SWD finder algorithm shows: (1) a major pattern of variation in SWC morphology maps to one axis of the phase difference distribution, (2) variability between the strain-specific distributions reflects differences in the proportions of SWC subtypes generated during SWD, and (3) regularities in the spectral power and phase profiles of SWCs can be used to detect waveforms possessing SWC-like morphology.

With these techniques, it is possible to match the frequency of the externally applied electromagnetic fields to the intrinsic frequency of oscillatory neural population activity ("frequency-tuning"). Mounting evidence suggests that by this means tACS, otDCS, and rTMS can entrain brain oscillations and promote associated functions in a frequency-specific manner, in particular during (i.e., online to) stimulation. Here, we focus instead on the changes in oscillatory brain activity that persist after the end of stimulation. Understanding such aftereffects in healthy participants is an important step for developing these techniques into potentially useful clinical tools for the treatment of specific patient groups. Reviewing the electrophysiological evidence in healthy participants, we find aftereffects on brain oscillations to be a common outcome following tACS/otDCS and rTMS. However, we did not find a consistent, predictable pattern of aftereffects across studies, which is in contrast to the relative homogeneity of reported online effects. This indicates that aftereffects are partially dissociated from online, frequency-specific (entrainment) effects during tACS/otDCS and rTMS. We outline possible accounts and future directions for a better understanding of the link between online entrainment and offline aftereffects, which will be key for developing more targeted interventions into oscillatory brain activity.

How Attention Changes in Response to Incentives	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SEARCH; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; MOTIVATION; COMPONENT; SALIENCE; PRIORITY	Although the performance of simple cognitive tasks can be enhanced if an incentive is provided, the mechanisms enabling such motivational control are not known. This study sought to uncover how mechanisms of attention and readiness are altered by reward-associated incentive stimuli. We measured EEG/ERP activity as human adults viewed a high- or low-incentive cue, experienced a short preparation interval, and then performed a simple visual search task to gain the predicted reward. Search performance was faster with high versus low incentives, and this was accompanied by distinct incentive-related EEG/ERP patterns at each phase of the task (incentive, preparation, and search). First, and most surprisingly, attention to high but not low incentive cues was actively suppressed, as indexed by a P-D component in response to the incentive display. During the subsequent preparation interval, neural oscillations in the alpha frequency range were reduced after high-incentive cues, indicating heightened visual readiness. Finally, attentional orienting to the target in the search array was deployed with relatively little effort on high-incentive trials, as indexed by a reduced N2pc component. These results reveal the chain of events by which the brain's executive control mechanisms respond to incentives by altering the operation of multiple processing systems to produce optimal performance.

HUNT and brother. BROTH, but not for brothel. BROTH. Few studies have investigated whether this pattern extends to novel complex words, and the results to date (all from novel suffixed words) are mixed. In the current study, we examine whether novel compounds (drugrack. RACK) yield morphological priming which is dissociable from that in novel pseudoembedded words (slegrack. RACK). Using masked priming, we find significant and comparable priming in reaction times for word-final elements of both novel compounds and novel pseudoembedded words. Using overt priming, however, we find greater priming effects (in both reaction times and N400 amplitudes) for novel compounds compared to novel pseudoembedded words. These results are consistent with models assuming across-the-board activation of putative constituents, while also suggesting that morpheme activation may persevere despite the lack of an exhaustive morpheme-based parse when an exhaustive monomorphemic analysis is also unavailable. These findings highlight the critical role of the lexical status of the pseudoembedded prime in dissociating morphological and orthographic priming.

Little is known about the potential combined effects of MP irradiation and caffeine on cognitive functions. Here we investigated whether caffeine intake and concurrent exposure to Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) MP-like irradiation may interactively influence neuro-cognitive function in an active visual oddball paradigm. In a full factorial experimental design, 25 participants performed a simple visual target detection task while reaction time (RT) and electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Target trials were divided into Low and High probability sets based on target-to-target distance. We analyzed single trial RT and alpha-band power (amplitude) in the pre-target interval. We found that RT was shorter in High vs. Low local probability trials, and caffeine further shortened RT in High probability trials relative to the baseline condition suggesting that caffeine improves the efficiency of implicit short-term memory. Caffeine also decreased pre-target alpha amplitude resulting in higher arousal level. Furthermore, pre-target gamma power positively correlated with RT, which may have facilitated target detection. However, in the present pharmacologically validated study UMTS exposure either alone or in combination with caffeine did not alter RT or pre-stimulus oscillatory brain activity.

Little is known about the neural mechanisms that enable internal representation of conspecifics' and inanimate objects' movements during visual occlusion. In this study, 10-month-old infants watched briefly occluded human and object movements. Prior to occlusion, continuous and distorted versions of the movement were shown. EEG recordings were used to assess neural activity assumed to relate to processes of attention (occipital alpha), memory (frontal theta), and sensorimotor simulation (central alpha) before, during, and after occlusion. Oscillatory activity was analyzed using an individualized data approach taking idiosyncrasies into account. Results for occipital alpha were consistent with infants' preference for attending to social stimuli. Furthermore, frontal theta activity was more pronounced when tracking distorted as opposed to continuous movement, and when maintaining object as opposed to human movement. Central alpha did not discriminate between experimental conditions. In sum, we conclude that observing occluded movements recruits processes of attention and memory which are modulated by stimulus and movement properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Correlations between adolescent processing speed and specific spindle frequencies	Frontiers in Human Neuroscience			English	Article						intelligence; processing speed; stage 2; REM; SWS; spindles; sleep	STAGE-2 SLEEP SPINDLES; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; EEG; DENSITY; INTELLIGENCE; INSIGHTS; ABILITY; YOUNG	Sleep spindles are waxing and waning thalamocortical oscillations with accepted frequencies of between 11 and 16 Hz and a minimum duration of 0.5 s. Our research has suggested that there is spindle activity in all of the sleep stages, and thus for the present analysis we examined the link between spindle activity (Stage 2, rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SVVS)) and waking cognitive abilities in 32 healthy adolescents. After software was used to filter frequencies outside the desired range, slow spindles (11.00-13.50 Hz), fast spindles (13.51-16.00 Hz) and spindle-like activity (16.01-18.50 Hz) were observed in Stage 2, SVVS and REM sleep. Our analysis suggests that these specific EEG frequencies were significantly related to processing speed, which is one of the subscales of the intelligence score, in adolescents. The relationship was prominent in SWS and REM sleep. Further, the spindle-like activity (16.01-18.50 Hz) that occurred during SVVS was strongly related to processing speed. Results suggest that the ability of adolescents to respond to tasks in an accurate, efficient and timely manner is related to their sleep quality. These findings support earlier research reporting relationships between learning, learning potential and sleep spindle activity in adults and adolescents.

Threat modulates neural responses to looming visual stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion; oscillatory responses; time-to-collision; visual-evoked potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MOTION-ONSET VEPS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; CORTICAL RESPONSES; ATTENTION; MEMORY; TIME; SYNCHRONIZATION	Objects on a collision course with an observer produce a specific pattern of optical expansion on the retina known as looming, which in theory exactly specifies the time-to-collision (TTC) of approaching objects. It was recently demonstrated that the affective content of looming stimuli influences perceived TTC, with threatening objects judged as approaching sooner than non-threatening objects. Here, the neural mechanisms by which perceived threat modulates spatiotemporal perception were investigated. Participants judged the TTC of threatening (snakes, spiders) or non-threatening (butterflies, rabbits) stimuli, which expanded in size at a rate indicating one of five TTCs. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and oscillatory neural responses measured with electroencephalography were analysed. The arrival time of threatening stimuli was underestimated compared with non-threatening stimuli, though an interaction suggested that this underestimation was not constant across TTCs. Further, both speed of approach and threat modulated both VEPs and oscillatory responses. Speed of approach modulated the N1 parietal and oscillations in the beta band. Threat modulated several VEP components (P1, N1 frontal, N1 occipital, early posterior negativity and late positive potential) and oscillations in the alpha and high gamma band. The results for the high gamma band suggest an interaction between these two factors. Previous evidence suggests that looming stimuli activate sensorimotor areas, even in the absence of an intended action. The current results show that threat disrupts the synchronization over the sensorimotor areas that are likely activated by the presentation of a looming stimulus.

However, the impact of experienced stress on the human aging process has remained an under-researched possibility. This study explored the association between cumulative stressful experiences and cognitive aging, addressing whether higher levels of experienced stress correlate with impaired performance on 2 working memory tasks. Behavioral performance was paired with electroencephalographic recordings to enable insight into the underlying neural processes impacted on by cumulative stress. Thus, the electroencephalogram was recorded while both young and elderly performed 2 different working memory tasks (a Sternberg and N-back paradigm), and cortical oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and gamma bandwidths was measured. Behavioral data indicated that a higher stress score among elderly participants related to impaired performance on both tasks. Electrophysiological findings revealed a reduction in alpha and gamma event-related synchronization among high-stress-group elderly participants, indicating that higher levels of experienced stress may impact on their ability to actively maintain a stimulus in working memory and inhibit extraneous information interfering with successful maintenance. Findings provide evidence that cumulative experienced stress adversely affects cognitive aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Somatosensory mu activity reflects imagined pain intensity of others	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mu activity; Empathy; Perspective taking; Mirror neuron system; Pain perception	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; ALPHA-BAND; EEG ALPHA; EMPATHY; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; RESONANCE; OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION; SUPPRESSION	In accordance with simulation theories of empathy, the somatosensory cortex is involved in the perception of pain of others. Cognitive processes, like perspective taking, can alter empathy-related activity within the somatosensory cortex. The current study investigates whether this modulation is caused by the imagined sensation of pain or by the cognitive load of a perspective-taking task. Applying a within-subject design, participants (N = 30) watched pictures of painful and nonpainful actions, while imagining reduced, normal, or increased pain perception of the observed individual. Mu activity (8-13 Hz), which is inversely correlated with sensorimotor-cortex activity, was measured via EEG. To calculate mu activity (central electrodes) and alpha activity (occipital electrodes), which served as a control for effects of cognitive load, a fast Fourier transform was applied. Mu suppression linearly increased from reduced to normal to increased imagined pain (p < .05), while alpha activity was unaffected by the imagined pain (p > .80). Suppression of the 8-13 Hz band at central and occipital electrodes was stronger in response to painful actions compared to nonpainful actions (p < .01). These results indicate that modulation of mu activity through perspective taking reflects the imagined pain intensity and not the cognitive load induced by the task.

J	Beste, C; Saft, C				Beste, Christian; Saft, Carsten			Action selection in a possible model of striatal medium spiny neuron dysfunction: behavioral and EEG data in a patient with benign hereditary chorea	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Action control; Response selection; EEG; Benign hereditary chorea; Medium spiny neurons	HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; WAVELET ANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN; P3B; OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEMS	Chaining or cascading of different actions and responses is necessary to accomplish a goal. Yet, little is known about the functional neuroanatomical-electrophysiological mechanisms mediating these processes. Computational models suggest that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) play an important role in action cascading, but this assumption has hardly been tested relating neuroanatomical and electrophysiological parameters in a human model of circumscribed MSN dysfunction. As a possible human model of circumscribed MSN dysfunction, we investigate benign hereditary chorea in a case-control study applying bootstrap statistics. To investigate these mechanisms, we used a stop-change paradigm, where we apply mathematical constraints to describe the degree of how task goals are activated with more or less overlap during action cascading. We record event-related potentials and analyze neural synchronization processes. The results show that MSN dysfunctions lead to deficits in action cascading processes only when two response options seek simultaneous access to response selection resources. Attentional selection processes are not affected, but processes reflecting the transition between stimulus evaluation and responding are affected. The results underline computational models of MSN functioning and show that dysfunction in these networks leads to a more parallel and hence inefficient response selection.

Here we examine single-unit activities (n = 2,057) and intracranial electroencephalography across the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex during sleep and wakefulness, and during visual stimulation with fixation. During sleep and wakefulness, REM onsets are associated with distinct intracranial potentials, reminiscent of ponto-geniculate-occipital waves. Individual neurons, especially in the MTL, exhibit reduced firing rates before REMs as well as transient increases in firing rate immediately after, similar to activity patterns observed upon image presentation during fixation without eye movements. Moreover, the selectivity of individual units is correlated with their response latency, such that units activated after a small number of images or REMs exhibit delayed increases in firing rates. Finally, the phase of theta oscillations is similarly reset following REMs in sleep and wakefulness, and after controlled visual stimulation. Our results suggest that REMs during sleep rearrange discrete epochs of visual-like processing as during wakefulness.

Our objective was to describe the incidence and risk factors for seizures in long-term survivors of pediatric brain tumors. MethodsIn a retrospective, longitudinal study, we reviewed all consecutive patients during a 12-month period who were at least 2years post initial diagnosis of a brain tumor. Data collection included age at diagnosis, length of follow-up, extent of initial resection, tumor histology, and treatment modalities. For patients who had experienced seizures at any time, the timing and frequency of seizures, seizure semiology, electroencephalography results, and anticonvulsant use were recorded. Univariate analyses and logistic regression were performed to assess risk factors. ResultsThe cohort included 298 patients (140 female). Average duration of follow-up was 7.6years. Initial surgical resection was gross-total in 109 patients, and subtotal for 143. Twenty-nine patients underwent biopsy alone and 17 had no surgical intervention. Tumor location included posterior fossa (104; 36%), midline (98; 34%), cortical (85; 29%), and other (11; 3%). Most frequent diagnoses were low grade glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma. Other treatments included cranial irradiation (N=163) and chemotherapy (n=127). Tumor recurrence occurred in 92 patients (30%). Seventy-one patients had seizures (24%). Ongoing seizures at the time of most recent follow-up were present in 42 patients. Risk factors for seizures included tumor location, tumor histology, tumor recurrence, and incomplete resection at time of initial presentation. SignificanceSeizures are a frequent comorbidity in pediatric brain tumor survivors, seen at presentation in 24% of patients and ongoing in 14%. Factors predisposing to seizures include tumor pathology (low/high grade glioma, glioneuronal tumor), cortical location, and subtotal resection. These data may assist in identification and management of patients at highest risk for seizures as well as identification of patients for potential treatment trials with antiepileptogenic agents.

The neural noise hypothesis, a dominant view of the basis of this decline, posits that aging is accompanied by an increase in spontaneous, noisy baseline neural activity. Here we analyze data from two different groups of human subjects: intracranial electrocorticography from 15 participants over a 38 year age range (15-53 years) and scalp EEG data from healthy younger (20-30 years) and older (60-70 years) adults to test the neural noise hypothesis from a 1/f noise perspective. Many natural phenomena, including electrophysiology, are characterized by 1/f noise. The defining characteristic of 1/f is that the power of the signal frequency content decreases rapidly as a function of the frequency (f) itself. The slope of this decay, the noise exponent (chi), is often < - 1 for electrophysiological data and has been shown to approach white noise (defined as chi = 0) with increasing task difficulty. We observed, in both electrophysiological datasets, that aging is associated with a flatter (more noisy) 1/f power spectral density, even at rest, and that visual cortical 1/f noise statistically mediates age-related impairments in visual working memory. These results provide electrophysiological support for the neural noise hypothesis of aging.

Negative versus positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5): indices for potential pro-cognitive drug properties based on EEG network oscillations and sleep-wake organization in rats	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						mGluR5 allosteric modulator; Autoradiography; Sleep; Network oscillations; Coherence and functional connectivity; Cognition	HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; IN-VITRO; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DEPENDENT MEMORY; ANTAGONISTS MPEP; COHERENCE; RELEASE	Evidence is emerging that positive and negative modulation of the metabotropic glutamate (mGluR5) receptors has the potential for treating cognitive deficits and neuroprotection associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, respectively. Sleep and synchronisation of disparate neuronal networks are critically involved in neuronal plasticity, and disturbance in vigilance states and cortical network connectivity contribute significantly to cognitive deficits described in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we examined the circadian changes of mGluR5 density and the functional response to modulation of mGluR5 signaling. The current study carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats quantified the density of mGluR5 across the light-dark cycle with autoradiography. The central activity of mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) and [(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) and positive allosteric modulators (S-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-{3-[3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-5-yl]-piperidin-1-yl}-methanone (ADX47273) and (7S)-3-tert-butyl-7-[3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine (LSN2814617) was examined on sleep-wake architecture. The functional effect of mGluR5 modulation on cortical networks communication was described in freely moving animals. The density of mGluR5 in the striatal, cortical, hippocampal and thalamic structures was unchanged across the light-dark cycle. Allosteric blockade of mGluR5 consistently consolidated deep sleep, enhanced sleep efficiency and elicited prominent functional coherent network activity in slow theta and gamma oscillations. However, allosteric activation of mGluR5 increased waking, decreased deep sleep and reduced functional network connectivity following the activation of slow alpha oscillatory activity. This functional study differentiates the pharmacology of allosteric blockade of mGluR5 from that of allosteric activation and suggests that mGluR5 blockade enhances sleep and facilitates oscillatory network connectivity, both processes being known to have relevance in cognition processes.

The imagination of hands movement allows inducing up to three different brain states by considering the activity that each hand produces separately and the one caused by the combination of both. This article presents a new method to extend the classic Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to a multi-class approach which analyses both brain hemispheres separately to solve, together with a stepwise classification strategy, a multi-label Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) problem. The considered approach is based upon the assumption that the brain activity induced by the motor imagery (MI) of the combination of both hands corresponds to the superposition of the activity generated during simple hand MIs. In this way, based on the event-related desynchronization that is detected within each brain hemisphere, the multi-classification task can be reduced into two binary-classification problems, leading to a much simpler recognition scheme that overcomes the drawback of the classical CSP method of being suitable to discriminate only between two classes. After testing the proposed approach over the EEG signals of six healthy subjects performing a four-class multi-label task involving simple and combined hand MIs together with the rest condition, results show that this technique is plausible for BCI control. In terms of accuracy, it outperforms the classical one-vs-one approach by 20% and has the same performance as the one-vs-all method. Nevertheless, to solve a multi-label classification problem involving k classes, the proposed method requires only log2(k) classifiers, whereas the one-vs-one method uses k(k-1)/2 classifiers and the one-vs-all k classifiers, thereby the new approach simplifies the classification task and seems promising for solving multi-label problems involving numerous classes.

Temporal alignment regulates timing of neurobiological phenomena, such as protein phosphorylation. In the current report, we describe the circadian and sleep homeostatic phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K) variations in hypothalamus and pons of rats across 24h as well as after sleep deprivation. In the circadian study, MAP-K expression showed a building-up profile during the dark phase in hypothalamus, whereas an increase across the lights-on period was found in pons. On the other hand, that phosphorylation of MAP-K in hypothalamus and pons displayed a significant reduction after sleep rebound period. Data demonstrate that MAP-K phosphorylation undergoes circadian and sleep homeostatic variations in brain areas linked to sleep modulation.

Thanks to advanced methods of computational psychometrics, in this study, affective states were deeply examined using simultaneous and synchronized recordings of gazes and psychophysiological signals in 28 female students during an investment game. Results showed that participants experienced different affective states according to the type of communication (personal versus impersonal). In particular, participants involved in personal communication felt more relaxed than participants involved in impersonal communication. Moreover, personal communication influenced reciprocity and participants' perceptions about trust and reciprocity. Findings were interpreted in the light of the Arousal/Valence Model and self-disclosure process.

Individualization of stimulation parameters by employing a closed-loop system, i.e. synchronization of stimulation with endogenous brain activity with millisecond precision, has the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy when compared to open-loop systems. In this article the theoretical and experimental results are reviewed including first clinical trials that support the superiority of closed-loop brain stimulation, fundamental aspects in the development of closed loop methods are discussed and clinical studies which could quantify an increase in effectiveness are summarized. A significant increase in the indications for therapeutic applications of closed-loop systems is to be expected in the near future.

Some of the other voltage-dependent calcium channels, e.g., P-/Q-type, Ca(v)2.1; N-type, Ca(v)2.2; E-/R-type, Ca(v)2.3; and T-type, Ca(v)3.3 have been implicated in sleep modulation. However, the contribution of LTCCs to sleep remains largely unknown. Based on recent genome-wide association studies, CACNA1C emerged as one of potential candidate genes associated with both sleep and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, most patients with mental illnesses have sleep problems and vice versa. Design: To investigate an impact of Ca(v)1.2 on sleep-wake behavior and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, polysomnography was performed in heterozygous Cacna1c (HET) knockout mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates under baseline and challenging conditions (acute sleep deprivation and restraint stress). Measurements and Results: HET mice displayed significantly lower EEG spectral power than WT mice across high frequency ranges (beta to gamma) during wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Although HET mice spent slightly more time asleep in the dark period, daily amounts of sleep did not differ between the two genotypes. However, recovery sleep after exposure to both types of challenging stress conditions differed markedly; HET mice exhibited reduced REM sleep recovery responses compared to WT mice. Conclusions: These results suggest the involvement of Cacna1c (Ca(v)1.2) in fast electroencephalogram oscillations and REM sleep regulatory processes. Lower spectral gamma activity, slightly increased sleep demands, and altered REM sleep responses found in heterozygous Cacna1c knockout mice may rather resemble a sleep phenotype observed in schizophrenia patients.

Here, we investigate the function of Pten in cortical GABAergic neurons using conditional mutagenesis in mice. Loss of Pten results in a preferential loss of SST+ interneurons, which increases the ratio of parvalbumin/somatostatin (PV/SST) interneurons, ectopic PV+ projections in layer I, and inhibition onto glutamatergic cortical neurons. Pten mutant mice exhibit deficits in social behavior and changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) power. Using medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) transplantation, we test for cell-autonomous functional differences between human PTEN wild-type (WT) and ASD alleles. The PTEN ASD alleles are hypomorphic in regulating cell size and the PV/SST ratio in comparison to WT PTEN. This MGE transplantation/complementation assay is efficient and is generally applicable for functional testing of ASD alleles in vivo.	[Vogt, Daniel; Cho, Kathleen K.

Functional brain asymmetry and brain connectivity in elite and amateur table tennis players	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Elite athletes; Table tennis; EEG; Functional brain asymmetry; Theta coherence; Flow-experience; Psycho-motor performance	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; SIMULATED MOVEMENT; WORKING-MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; PRESSURE; CHOKING	Functional hemispheric asymmetry is assumed to constitute one underlying neurophysiological mechanism of flow-experience and skilled psycho-motor performance in table tennis athletes. We hypothesized that when initiating motor execution during motor imagery, elite table tennis players show higher right- than left-hemispheric temporal activity and stronger right temporal-premotor than left temporalpremotor theta coherence compared to amateurs. We additionally investigated, whether less pronounced left temporal cortical activity is associated with more world rank points and more flow-experience. To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 experts and 15 amateur table tennis players. Subjects watched videos of an opponent serving a ball and were instructed to imagine themselves responding with a specific table tennis stroke. Alpha asymmetry scores were calculated by subtracting left from right hemispheric 8-13 Hz alpha power. 4-7 Hz theta coherence was calculated between temporal (T31T4) and premotor (Fz) cortex. Experts showed a significantly stronger shift towards lower relative left-temporal brain activity compared to amateurs and a significantly stronger right temporal-premotor coherence than amateurs. The shift towards lower relative left-temporal brain activity in experts was associated with more flow-experience and lower relative left temporal activity was correlated with more world rank points. The present findings suggest that skilled psycho-motor performance in elite table tennis players reflect less desynchronized brain activity at the left hemisphere and more coherent brain activity between fronto-temporal and premotor oscillations at the right hemisphere. This pattern probably reflect less interference of irrelevant communication of verbal-analytical with motor-control mechanisms which implies flow-experience and predict world rank in experts.

Efficacy and Safety of Low-field Synchronized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (sTMS) for Treatment of Major Depression	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Synchronized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (sTMS); Low-intensity magnetic field; Static magnet; Major Depressive Disorder; Clinical treatment trial; Neuromodulation; Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF); Alpha oscillations; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Oscillatory synchrony	ELECTRIC-FIELDS; RATING-SCALE; DOUBLE-BLIND; RTMS; METAANALYSIS; MEDICATION; MULTISITE; EEG; TMS; MODULATION	Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) customarily uses high-field electromagnets to achieve therapeutic efficacy in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Low-field magnetic stimulation also may be useful for treatment of MDD, with fewer treatment-emergent adverse events. Objective/Hypothesis: To examine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of low-field magnetic stimulation synchronized to an individual's alpha frequency (IAF) (synchronized TMS, or sTMS) for treatment of MDD. Methods: Six-week double-blind sham-controlled treatment trial of a novel device that used three rotating neodymium magnets to deliver sTMS treatment. IAF was determined from a single-channel EEG prior to first treatment. Subjects had baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HamD(17)) >= 17. Results: 202 subjects comprised the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample, and 120 subjects completed treatment per-protocol (PP). There was no difference in efficacy between active and sham in the ITT sample. Subjects in the PP sample (N = 59), however, had significantly greater mean decrease in HamD(17) than sham (N = 60) (-9.00 vs. -6.56, P = 0.033). PP subjects with a history of poor response or intolerance to medication showed greater improvement with sTMS than did treatment-naive subjects (-8.58 vs. -4.25, P = 0.017). Efficacy in the PP sample reflects exclusion of subjects who received fewer than 80% of scheduled treatments or were inadvertently treated at the incorrect IAF; these subgroups failed to separate from sham. There was no difference in adverse events between sTMS and sham, and no serious adverse events attributable to sTMS. Conclusions: Results suggest that sTMS may be effective, safe, and well tolerated for treating MDD when administered as intended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Resting and Task-Modulated High-Frequency Brain Rhythms Measured by Scalp Encephalography in Infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Tuberous sclerosis complex; Brain dynamics; EEG; Dominant brain rhythms	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TSC1; IDENTIFICATION; CHILDREN	The electrophysiological correlates of cognitive deficits in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are not well understood, and modulations of neural dynamics by neuroanatomical abnormalities that characterize the disorder remain elusive. Neural oscillations (rhythms) are a fundamental aspect of brain function, and have dominant frequencies in a wide frequency range. The spatio-temporal dynamics of these frequencies in TSC are currently unknown. Using a novel signal decomposition approach this study investigated dominant cortical frequencies in 10 infants with TSC, in the age range 18-30 months, and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Distinct spectral characteristics were estimated in the two groups. High-frequency [in the high-gamma (> 50 Hz) and ripple (> 80 Hz) ranges], non-random EEG components were identified in both TSC and healthy infants at 18 months. Additional components in the lower gamma (30-50 Hz) ranges were also identified, with higher characteristic frequencies in TSC than in controls. Lower frequencies were statistically identical in both sub-groups. A significant shift in the high-frequency spectral content of the EEG was observed as a function of age, independently of task performance, possibly reflecting an overall maturation of developing neural circuits. This shift occurred earlier in healthy infants than in TSC, i.e., by age 20 months the highest dominant frequencies were in the high gamma range, whereas in TSC dominant frequencies above 100 Hz were still measurable. At age 28-30 months a statistically significant decrease in dominant high frequencies was observed in both TSC and healthy infants, possibly reflecting increased myelination and neuronal connection strengthening with age. Although based on small samples, and thus preliminary, the findings in this study suggest that dominant cortical rhythms, a fundamental aspect of neurodynamics, may be affected in TSC, possibly leading to impaired information processing in the brain.

Cognitive control account assumes that PES depends on error information, whereas orienting account posits that it depends on error frequency. This raises the question how the outcome valence and outcome frequency separably influence the generation of PES. To address this issue, we varied the probability of observation errors (50/50 and 20/80, correct/error) the "partner'' committed by employing an observation-execution task and investigated the corresponding behavioral and neural effects. On each trial, participants first viewed the outcome of a flanker-run that was supposedly performed by a 'partner', and then performed a flanker-run themselves afterwards. We observed PES in the two error rate conditions. However, electroencephalographic data suggested error-related potentials (oERN and oPe) and rhythmic oscillation associated with attentional process (alpha band) were respectively sensitive to outcome valence and outcome frequency. Importantly, oERN amplitude was positively correlated with PES. Taken together, these findings support the assumption of the cognitive control account, suggesting that outcome valence and outcome frequency are both involved in PES. Moreover, the generation of PES is indexed by oERN, whereas the modulation of PES size could be reflected on the alpha band.

However, with regards to the influence of prestimulus brain states on perception, this network perspective has rarely been taken. Our recent framework predicts that brain regions crucial for a conscious percept are coupled prior to stimulus arrival, forming pre-established pathways of information flow and influencing perceptual awareness. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and graph theoretical measures, we investigated auditory conscious perception in a near-threshold (NT) task and found strong support for this framework. Relevant auditory regions showed an increased prestimulus interhemispheric connectivity. The left auditory cortex was characterized by a hub-like behavior and an enhanced integration into the brain functional network prior to perceptual awareness. Right auditory regions were decoupled from non-auditory regions, presumably forming an integrated information processing unit with the left auditory cortex. In addition, we show for the first time for the auditory modality that local excitability, measured by decreased alpha power in the auditory cortex, increases prior to conscious percepts. Importantly, we were able to show that connectivity states seem to be largely independent from local excitability states in the context of a NT paradigm.

In the case of voice perception it has been shown that evoked activity elicited by self-generated sounds is suppressed compared with the same sounds played-back externally. We here wanted to reveal whether neural excitability of the auditory cortex-putatively reflected in local alpha band power-is modulated already prior to speech onset, and which brain regions may mediate such a top-down preparatory response. In the left auditory cortex we show that the typical alpha suppression found when participants prepare to listen disappears when participants expect a self-spoken sound. This suggests an inhibitory adjustment of auditory cortical activity already before sound onset. As a second main finding we demonstrate that the medial prefrontal cortex, a region known for self-referential processes, mediates these condition-specific alpha power modulations. This provides crucial insights into how higher-order regions prepare the auditory cortex for the processing of self-generated sounds. Furthermore, the mechanism outlined could provide further explanations to self-referential phenomena, such as "tickling yourself". Finally, it has implications for the so-far unsolved question of how auditory alpha power is mediated by higher-order regions in a more general sense.

Single unit action potentials in humans and the effect of seizure activity	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; EEG; spike sorting; ictal core; ictal penumbra	INDUCED INTERICTAL DISCHARGES; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN LIMBIC NEURONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; NEOCORTICAL SEIZURES; EPILEPTOGENIC FOCI; CAT HIPPOCAMPUS; INHIBITION; PROPAGATION; MECHANISMS	Spike-sorting algorithms have been used to identify the firing patterns of isolated neurons ('single units') from implanted electrode recordings in patients undergoing assessment for epilepsy surgery, but we do not know their potential for providing helpful clinical information. It is important therefore to characterize both the stability of these recordings and also their context. A critical consideration is where the units are located with respect to the focus of the pathology. Recent analyses of neuronal spiking activity, recorded over extended spatial areas using microelectrode arrays, have demonstrated the importance of considering seizure activity in terms of two distinct spatial territories: the ictal core and penumbral territories. The pathological information in these two areas, however, is likely to be very different. We investigated, therefore, whether units could be followed reliably over prolonged periods of times in these two areas, including during seizure epochs. We isolated unit recordings from several hundred neurons from four patients undergoing video-telemetry monitoring for surgical evaluation of focal neocortical epilepsies. Unit stability could last in excess of 40 h, and across multiple seizures. A key finding was that in the penumbra, spike stereotypy was maintained even during the seizure. There was a net tendency towards increased penumbral firing during the seizure, although only a minority of units (10-20%) showed significant changes over the baseline period, and notably, these also included neurons showing significant reductions in firing. In contrast, within the ictal core territories, regions characterized by intense hypersynchronous multi-unit firing, our spike sorting algorithms failed as the units were incorporated into the seizure activity. No spike sorting was possible from that moment until the end of the seizure, but recovery of the spike shape was rapid following seizure termination: some units reappeared within tens of seconds of the end of the seizure, and over 80% reappeared within 3 min (tau(recov) = 104 +/- 22 s). The recovery of the mean firing rate was close to pre-ictal levels also within this time frame, suggesting that the more protracted post-ictal state cannot be explained by persistent cellular neurophysiological dysfunction in either the penumbral or the core territories. These studies lay the foundation for future investigations of how these recordings may inform clinical practice.

DCM addresses observed responses of complex neuronal systems by looking at the neuronal interactions that generate them and how these responses reflect the underlying neurobiology. DCM is a technique for inferring the biophysical properties of cortical sources and their directed connectivity based on distinct neuronal and observation models. The DCM framework uses mathematical formalisms of neural masses, neural fields and mean-fields as forward or generative models for observed neuronal activity. We here consider conductance based neural mass, mean-field and field models-and review their latest technical developments. We use dynamically rich conductance based models to generate responses in laminar-specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models allow for the evaluation of neuronal connections and high-order statistics of neuronal states, using Bayesian estimation and inference. We also discuss recent clinical applications of DCM for convolution based neural mass models, in particular for the study of Parkinson's disease. We present a study of data from Parkinsonian patients, and model the large-scale network changes underlying the pathological excess of beta oscillations that characterise the Parkinsonian state.

Weakening of Corticomuscular Signal Coupling During Voluntary Motor Action in Aging	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Brain aging; Motor control; Biomarkers	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; OLDER-ADULTS; MUSCLE; CORTEX; COHERENCE; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; CONTRACTION; PERFORMANCE	Background. Aging is associated with muscle weakness and impairment in performing skilled motor tasks. Still, little is known about whether the link or functional coupling or connection between the central and peripheral systems during voluntary motor performance is compromised in the elderly subjects. The purposes of this study were to estimate functional corticomuscular connection (CMC) strength in the elderly subjects by calculating EEG-EMG coherence during voluntary motor performance, determine the relationship between the CMC and voluntary muscle force, and compare these between the old and the young subjects. Methods. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of elbow flexion (EF) and EFs at three submaximal (20%, 50%, and 80% MVC) levels were performed in 28 healthy older (74.96 +/- 1.32 years) and 20 young (22.60 +/- 0.90 years) individuals, while EEG and EMG from biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii muscles were recorded simultaneously. Results. Compared with the young, older individuals exhibited significantly weakened CMC at all force levels tested. There was a proportional relationship between the CMC and EF force and high-positive correlation between the CMC and EF strength in both groups. Conclusions. Weakened CMC in aging may be a major factor contributing to age- related muscle weakness, and the linear relationship between the CMC and voluntary muscle force suggests dependence of force output on translation of the descending command to muscle electrical signal.

It has been hypothesized that fast and slow spindles might play a different role in memory processing. Here, we present a new sleep spindle detection algorithm utilizing a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and individual adjustment of slow and fast spindle frequency ranges. Eighteen nap recordings of ten subjects were used for algorithm validation. Our method was compared with both a human scorer and a commercially available SIESTA spindle detector. For the validation set, mean agreement between our detector and human scorer measured during sleep stage 2 using kappa coefficient was 0.45, whereas mean agreement between our detector and SIESTA algorithm was 0.62. Our algorithm was also applied to sleep-related memory consolidation data previously analyzed with a SIESTA detector and confirmed previous findings of significant correlation between spindle density and declarative memory consolidation. We then applied our method to a study in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, examining the genetic component of slow and fast sleep spindle parameters. Our analysis revealed strong genetic influence on variance of all slow spindle parameters, weaker genetic effect on fast spindles, and no effects on fast spindle density and number during stage 2 sleep.

Volumetric imaging of brain activity with spatial-frequency decoding of neuromagnetic signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Wavelet; Spatial filter; Magnetoencephalography; High-frequency oscillation; Neuroimaging; Brain	EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; OSCILLATIONS; MEG; EPILEPSY; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; BEAMFORMER; CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION	Background: The brain generates signals in a wide frequency range (similar to 2840 Hz). Existing magnetoencephalography (MEG) methods typically detect brain activity in a median-frequency range (1-70 Hz). The objective of the present study was to develop a new method to utilize the frequency signatures for source imaging. New method: Morlet wavelet transform and two-step beamforming were integrated into a systematic approach to estimate magnetic sources in time-frequency domains. A grid-frequency kernel (GFK) was developed to decode the correlation between each time-frequency representation and grid voxel. Brain activity was reconstructed by accumulating spatial- and frequency-locked signals in the full spectral data for all grid voxels. To test the new method, MEG data were recorded from 20 healthy subjects and 3 patients with verified epileptic foci. Results: The experimental results showed that the new method could accurately localize brain activation in auditory cortices. The epileptic foci localized with the new method were spatially concordant with invasive recordings. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with well-known existing methods, the new method is objective because it scans the entire brain without making any assumption about the number of sources. The novel feature of the new method is its ability to localize high-frequency sources. Conclusions: The new method could accurately localize both low- and high-frequency brain activities. The detection of high-frequency MEG signals can open a new avenue in the study of the human brain function as well as a variety of brain disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Method: Thirteen healthy right handed individuals were assessed while performing repeated unilateral wrist extension movements with and without MVF. The effect of MVF on EEG oscillations was studied in 3 distinct frequency ranges (low mu, high mu, low beta). Results: Analysis of the low beta range showed that MVF reduces the magnitude of event-related de-synchronization (ERD) in the hemisphere contra-lateral to the moving hand. This effect reached significance when the moving hand was the dominant hand. In the analysis of the low mu range, bi-hemispheric amplification of ERD by the mirror pointed to an added effect of neural recruitment. This effect reached significance when the moving hand was the non-dominant hand. Conclusions: MVF applied during unilateral manual movement (a) attenuates hemispheric activation asymmetry, and (b) is likely to involve recruitment of the mirror neuron system. Significance: As each of the above two effects reached significance only in one hand (dominant and non-dominant, respectively), clinical application of MVF might show a different level of efficacy in the treatment of right and left hemiparesis.

Due to their frequent occurrence in NREM sleep, the detection of sleep spindles is only feasible using automatic algorithms, of which a large number is available. We compared subject averages of the spindle parameters computed by a fixed frequency (FixF) (11-13 Hz for slow spindles, 13-15 Hz for fast spindles) automatic detection algorithm and the individual adjustment method (IAM), which uses individual frequency bands for sleep spindle detection. Fast spindle duration and amplitude are strongly correlated in the two algorithms, but there is little overlap in fast spindle density and slow spindle parameters in general. The agreement between fixed and manually determined sleep spindle frequencies is limited, especially in case of slow spindles. This is the most likely reason for the poor agreement between the two detection methods in case of slow spindle parameters. Our results suggest that while various algorithms may reliably detect fast spindles, a more sophisticated algorithm primed to individual spindle frequencies is necessary for the detection of slow spindles as well as individual variations in the number of spindles in general.

We hypothesize that mechanisms, which result in peri-ictal slow-wave activity as detected by the electroencephalogram, could negatively affect memory processes. Slow waves (<= 4 Hz) can be found in seizures with impairment of consciousness and also occur in focal seizures without impairment of consciousness but with inhibited access to memory functions. Peri-ictal slow waves are regarded as dysfunctional and are probably caused by mechanisms, which are essential to disturb the consolidation of memory entries in these patients. This is in strong contrast to physiological slow-wave activity during deep sleep, which is thought to group memory-consolidating fast oscillatory activity. In patients with epilepsy, slow waves may not only correlate with the peri-ictal clouding of consciousness, but could be the epiphenomenon of mechanisms, which interfere with normal brain function in a wider range. These mechanisms may have transient impacts on memory, such as temporary inhibition of memory systems, altered patterns of hippocampal neocortical interactions during slow-wave sleep, or disturbed cross-frequency coupling of slow and fast oscillations. In addition, repeated tonic clonic seizures over the years in uncontrolled chronic epilepsy may cause a progressive cognitive decline. This hypothesis can only be assessed in long-term prospective studies. These studies could disentangle the reversible short-term impacts of seizures, and the impacts of chronic uncontrolled seizures. Chronic uncontrolled seizures lead to irreversible memory impairment. By contrast, short-term impacts do not necessarily lead to a progressive cognitive decline but result in significantly impaired peri-ictal memory performance.

In this study, we have analyzed the impact of levetiracetam (LEV) in the pilocarpine model of MTLE. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 19) were injected with pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce a status epilepticus. Twelve animals were used as controls and seven were treated with LEV. They were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum and EEG-video monitored continuously from day 4 to day 14 after SE. Results: Only 29% of LEV-treated animals had seizures compared to all controls following a latent period that was similar in duration. Seizure rates were lower in LEV-treated animals. In LEV-treated animals without seizures, lower interictal spike rates were found in all regions compared to controls. Analysis of interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) revealed that LEV-treated animals without seizures had lower rates of interictal spikes with ripples (80-200 Hz) in CA3, EC and subiculum (p < 0.01), whereas rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were significantly lower in CA3 and subiculum, compared to controls. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the anti-ictogenic properties of LEV are mirrored by decreases of interictal spike rate in temporal lobe regions, and are accompanied by subregion-specific decreases of HFO occurrence in CA3 and subiculum. Overall, this evidence suggest that LEV may inhibit neural network activity in regions that are known to play important roles in MTLE. (C) 2014 British Epilepsy Association.

In line with the presence of golden sectioning in natural growth patterns, recent EEG recordings show an absence of coherence between brain frequencies related by the golden ratio, suggesting the potential relevance of the golden section to brain dynamics. Using Mondriantype patterns comprising a number of paired sections in a range of five section-section areal ratios (including golden-sectioned pairs), participants were asked to indicate as rapidly and accurately as possible the polarity (light or dark) of the smallest section in the patterns. They were also asked to independently assess the aesthetic appeal of the patterns. No preference was found for golden-sectioned patterns, while reaction times (RTs) tended to decrease overall with increasing ratio independently of each pattern's fractal dimensionality. (Fractal dimensionality was unrelated to ratio and measured in terms of the Minkowski-Bouligand box-counting dimension). The ease of detecting the smallest section also decreased with increasing ratio, although RTs were found to be substantially slower for golden-sectioned patterns under 8-paired sectioned conditions. This was confirmed by a significant linear relationship between RT and ratio (p < .001) only when the golden-sectioned RTs were excluded [the relationship was non-significant for the full complement of ratios (p = .217)]. Image analysis revealed an absence of spatial frequencies between 4 and 8 cycles-perdegree that was exclusive to the 8-paired (golden)-sectioned patterns. The significance of this was demonstrated in a subsequent experiment by addition of uniformly distributed random noise to the patterns. This provided a uniform spatial-frequency profile for all patterns, which did not influence the decrease in RT with increasing ratio but abolished the elevated RTs to golden-sectioned patterns. This suggests that optical limitation in the form of reduced inter-neural synchronization during spatial-frequency coding may be the foundation for the perceptual effects of golden sectioning.

We identified a specified frequency range where functional connectivity in this network was related to duration of disease. Then, to identify specific thalamic nuclei involved in seizure propagation, we determined the subregions of the thalamus that have increased resting functional oscillations in this frequency range. MethodsResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired from 20 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; 14 right and 6 left) and 20 healthy controls who were each age and gender matched to a specific patient. Wavelet-based fMRI connectivity mapping across the network was computed at each frequency to determine those frequencies where connectivity significantly decreases with duration of disease consistent with impairment due to repeated seizures. The voxel-wise power of the spontaneous blood oxygenation fluctuations of this frequency band was computed in the thalamus of each subject. ResultsFunctional connectivity was impaired in the proposed seizure propagation network over a specific range (0.0067-0.013Hz and 0.024-0.032Hz) of blood oxygenation oscillations. Increased power in this frequency band (<0.032Hz) was detected bilaterally in the pulvinar and anterior nucleus of the thalamus of healthy controls, and was increased over the ipsilateral thalamus compared to the contralateral thalamus in TLE. SignificanceThis study identified frequencies of impaired connectivity in a TLE seizure propagation network and used them to localize the anterior nucleus and pulvinar of the thalamus as subregions most susceptible to TLE seizures. Further examinations of these frequencies in healthy and TLE subjects may provide unique information relating to the mechanism of seizure propagation and potential treatment using electrical stimulation.

The aim of this study was to elucidate when this preictal power imbalance could occur in the SOZ. We analyzed intracranial EEG data from 6 patients with focal cortical dysplasia. During preictal 3-min period, which was divided into three intervals: 0-1 min, 1-2 min 2-3 min before seizure onset, we performed correlation (Spearman's coefficient) and simple linear regression analyses comparing power of spike-related HFOs and PSS. We analyzed 719 +/- 57 (mean +/- SD) spike and slow waves per patient, which were obtained from three seizures. In the SOZ, the positive correlation between spike-related HFO and PSS power was drastically reduced during preictal 3-min period, and the slope of regression line (Delta PSS power/Delta HFO power) decreased significantly during 0-1 min before seizure onset (p < 0.05, Steel-Dwass test). The present results indicate that the preictal dynamics of HFO and PSS power in the SOZ may have utility for early seizure detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neuronal activity during learning triggers cortical plasticity that allows for reorganization of the neuronal network and integration of new information. Animal studies have shown post-learning reactivation of learning-elicited neuronal network activity during subsequent sleep, supporting consolidation of the reorganization. However, no previous studies, to our knowledge, have demonstrated reactivation of specific learning-elicited long-range functional connectivity during sleep in humans. We here show reactivation of learning-induced long-range synchronization of magnetoencephalography power fluctuations in human sleep. Visuomotor learning elicited a specific profile of long-range cortico-cortical synchronization of slow (0.1 Hz) fluctuations in beta band (12-30 Hz) power. The parieto-occipital part of this synchronization profile reappeared in delta band (1-3.5 Hz) power fluctuations during subsequent sleep, but not during the intervening wakefulness period. Individual differences in the reactivated synchronization predicted postsleep performance improvement. The presleep resting-state synchronization profile was not reactivated during sleep. The findings demonstrate reactivation of long-range coordination of neuronal activity in humans, more specifically of reactivation of coupling of infra-slow fluctuations in oscillatory power. The spatiotemporal profile of delta power fluctuations during sleep may subserve memory consolidation by echoing coordinated activation elicited by prior learning. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:67-84, 2015.

The theta EROs occurring in the P3 response, important indicators of neurocognitive function, were elicited during the evaluation of task-relevant target stimuli in visual and auditory oddball tasks. These tasks call upon attentional and working memory resources. Large differences in developmental rates between males and females were found; scalp location and task modality (visual or auditory) differences within males and females were small compared to gender differences. Trajectories of inter-regional and intermodal correlations between ERO power values exhibited increases with age in both genders, but showed a divergence in development between auditory and visual systems during ages 16 to 21. These results are consistent with previous electrophysiological and imaging studies and provide additional temporal detail about the development of neurophysiological indices of cognitive activity. Since measures of the P3 response has been found to be a useful endophenotypes for the study of a number of clinical and behavioral disorders, studies of its development in adolescents and young adults may illuminate neurophysiological factors contributing to the onset of these conditions.

One of the first steps in perception is processing of basic information such as spatial frequencies (SF), which represent details and global information. However, although behavioural perception of SF is well investigated, the developmental trajectory of the temporal characteristics of SF processing is not yet well understood. The speed of processing of this basic visual information is crucial, as it determines the speed and possibly accuracy of subsequent visual and social processes. The current study investigated developmental changes in the temporal characteristics of selective processing of high SF (HSF; details) versus low SF (LSF; global). To this end, brain activity was measured using EEG in 108 children aged 3-15 years, while HSF or LSF grating stimuli were presented. Interest was in the temporal characteristics of brain activity related to LSF and HSF processing, specifically at early (N80) or later (P1 or N2) peaks in brain activity. Analyses revealed that from 7-8 years onwards HSF but not LSF stimuli evoked an N80 peak. In younger children, aged 3-8 years, the visual manipulation mainly affected the visual N2 peak. Selective processing of HSF versus LSF thus occurs at a rather late time-point (N2 peak) in young children. Although behavioural research previously showed that 3-6 year-olds can perceive detailed information, the current results point out that selective processing of HSF versus LSF is still delayed in these children. The delayed processing in younger children could impede the use of LSF and HSF for emotional face processing. Thus, the current study is a starting point for understanding changes in basic visual processing which underlie social development.

Paradigms that rely on reactive control have shown that frontoparietal oscillatory synchronization in the theta frequency band is associated with interference control. This study examines whether proactive control is also associated with connectivity in the same frontoparietal theta network or involves a distinct neural signature. A task-switching paradigm was used to differentiate between proactive and reactive control processes, involved in preparing to switch or repeat a task and resolving post-target interference, respectively. We confirm that reactive control is associated with frontoparietal theta connectivity. Importantly, we show that proactive control is also associated with theta band oscillatory synchronization but in a different frontoparietal network. These findings support the existence of distinct proactive and reactive cognitive control processes that activate different theta frontoparietal oscillatory networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

When the binaural beat beats with the frequency that corresponds to the state of alpha wave range, then it is believed that the overall brain activity changes accordingly. Brainwave activity within the alpha range has been generally correlated with many cognitive functions along with working memory improvement. Therefore, in this study it is assumed that binaural beat corresponding to alpha wave range will enhance subsequently WMC. In the following study, participants were divided into two groups. One group underwent a binaural beat stimulation while listening to the sound of the sea. The other group was listening solely to the sound of the sea without binaural beat stimulation. We measured baseline and post-stimulation working memory capacity using the OSPAN method. As expected, only participants from the binaural beat group showed an improvement in WMC.

The goal of the current study was to determine if exposure to brainwave entrainment (BWE) at the alpha centre frequency before and during performance of a divergent thinking task would result in increases in task-related, event-related synchrony and the production of more highly original ideas. We found that alpha entrainment interfered with the oscillatory dynamics associated with divergent thinking such that only the control group showed greater right hemispheric engagement. Furthermore, the control group showed greater self-rated originality. These findings provide confirmation of the importance of hemispheric asymmetry in alpha power to successful divergent thinking and indicate that refinements are required in order for BWE to be used effectively to improve divergent thinking performance.

Slow waves are locally regulated, and local slow wave dynamics are important for memory, cognition, and behaviour. While several brainstem structures for controlling global sleep states have now been well characterized, a mechanism underlying fast and local modulation of cortical slow waves has not been identified. Here, using optogenetics and whole cortex electrophysiology, we show that local tonic activation of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induces slow wave activity in a spatially restricted region of cortex. These slow waves resemble those seen in sleep, as cortical units undergo periods of silence phase-locked to the slow wave. Furthermore, animals exhibit behavioural changes consistent with a decrease in arousal state during TRN stimulation. We conclude that TRN can induce rapid modulation of local cortical state.

However, this comparison may be contaminated by non-specific attention, alerting, performance, and reporting confounds. Here, we pursue a novel approach, tracking the neuronal coding of consciously and unconsciously perceived contents while keeping behavior identical (blindsight). EEG and MEG were recorded while participants reported the spatial location and visibility of a briefly presented target. Multivariate pattern analysis demonstrated that considerable information about spatial location traverses the cortex on blindsight trials, but that starting approximate to 270 ms post-onset, information unique to consciously perceived stimuli, emerges in superior parietal and superior frontal regions. Conscious access appears characterized by the entry of the perceived stimulus into a series of additional brain processes, each restricted in time, while the failure of conscious access results in the breaking of this chain and a subsequent slow decay of the lingering unconscious activity.

We investigate these questions here by examining intracranial EEG recordings as 28 participants with electrodes placed for seizure monitoring participated in a verbal paired-associates memory task. We found that, preceding successfully remembered word pairs, an orientation cue triggered a low-frequency 2-4 Hz phase reset in the right temporoparietal junction with concurrent increases in low-frequency power across cortical regions that included the prefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe. Regions that exhibited a significant increase in 2-4 Hz power were functionally bound together through progressive low-frequency 2-4 Hz phase synchrony. Our data suggest that the interaction between power and phase synchrony reflects the engagement of attentional networks that in large part determine the extent to which memories are successfully encoded.

This work aims to identify the potential biomarkers related to consciousness from the thalamic deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) in DOC patients. The frequency features of central thalamic LFPs were characterized with spectral analysis. The features were further compared to those of LFPs from the ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) in patients with pain. There are several distinct characteristics of thalamic LFPs found in patients with DOC. The most important feature is the oscillation around 10Hz which could be relevant to the existence of residual consciousness, whereas high power below 8Hz seemed to be associated with loss of consciousness. The invasive deep brain recording tool opens a unique way to explore the brain function in consciousness, awareness and alertness and clarify the potential mechanisms of thalamic stimulation in DOC.

Neural Correlates of Visual Short-term Memory Dissociate between Fragile and Working Memory Representations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ORIENTING ATTENTION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-FREQUENCY; SENSORY MEMORY; EEG ALPHA; CAPACITY; PREDICTS; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONY	Evidence is accumulating that the classic two-stage model of visual STM (VSTM), comprising iconic memory (IM) and visual working memory (WM), is incomplete. A third memory stage, termed fragile VSTM (FM), seems to exist in between IM and WM [Vandenbroucke, A. R. E., Sligte, I. G., & Lamme, V. A. F. Manipulations of attention dissociate fragile visual STM from visual working memory. Neuropsychologia, 49, 1559-1568, 2011; Sligte, I. G., Scholte, H. S., & Lamme, V. A. F. Are there multiple visual STM stores? PLoS One, 3, e1699, 2008]. Although FM can be distinguished from IM using behavioral and fMRI methods, the question remains whether FM is a weak expression of WM or a separate form of memory with its own neural signature. Here, we tested whether FM and WM in humans are supported by dissociable time-frequency features of EEG recordings. Participants performed a partial-report change detection task, from which individual differences in FM and WM capacity were estimated. These individual FM and WM capacities were correlated with time-frequency characteristics of the EEG signal before and during encoding and maintenance of the memory display. FM capacity showed negative alpha correlations over peri-occipital electrodes, whereas WM capacity was positively related, suggesting increased visual processing (lower alpha) to be related to FM capacity. Furthermore, FM capacity correlated with an increase in theta power over central electrodes during preparation and processing of the memory display, whereas WM did not. In addition to a difference in visual processing characteristics, a positive relation between gamma power and FM capacity was observed during both preparation and maintenance periods of the task. On the other hand, we observed that theta-gamma coupling was negatively correlated with FM capacity, whereas it was slightly positively correlated with WM. These data show clear differences in the neural substrates of FM versus WM and suggest that FM depends more on visual processing mechanisms compared with WM. This study thus provides novel evidence for a dissociation between different stages in VSTM.	[Vandenbroucke, Annelinde R. E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vandenbroucke, Annelinde R.

Developmental changes in spontaneous electrocortical activity and network organization from early to late childhood	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE ACTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; MATURATION; ADOLESCENCE	We investigated the development of spontaneous (resting state) cerebral electric fields and their network organization from early to late childhood in a large community sample of children. Critically, we examined electrocortical maturation across one-year windows rather than creating aggregate averages that can miss subtle maturational trends. We implemented several novel methodological approaches including a more fine grained examination of spectral features across multiple electrodes, the use of phase-lagged functional connectivity to control for the confounding effects of volume conduction and applying topological network analyses to weighted cortical adjacency matrices. Overall, there were major decreases in absolute EEG spectral density (particularly in the slow wave range) across cortical lobes as a function of age. Moreover, the peak of the alpha frequency increased with chronological age and there was a redistribution of relative spectral density toward the higher frequency ranges, consistent with much of the previous literature. There were age differences in long range functional brain connectivity, particularly in the alpha frequency band, culminating in the most dense and spatially variable networks in the oldest children. We discovered age-related reductions in characteristic path lengths, modularity and homogeneity of alpha-band cortical networks from early to late childhood. In summary, there is evidence of large scale reorganization in endogenous brain electric fields from early to late childhood, suggesting reduced signal amplitudes in the presence of more functionally integrated and band limited coordination of neuronal activity across the cerebral cortex.

However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG). The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity. Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source. The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation. Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR. In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.	[Aguiar, L. A. A.; Nogueira, R.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of ictal VHFO in neocortical epilepsy. MethodsThis study included 13 patients with neocortical epilepsy who underwent subdural electrode implantation and had at least 1 seizure recorded at a 10-kHz sampling rate and were followed for more than 2 years postoperatively. Extent of resection was determined considering the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and irritative zone, structural lesion, and functional areas. Areas showing VHFO and those with HFO were not taken into consideration. The presence or absence of VHFO (>1,000Hz), HFO (200-1,000Hz) and SOZ, and completeness of resection of these areas were compared with postoperative seizure outcome. ResultsSeven patients had favorable (Engel class Ia) and 6 had unfavorable outcomes (other classes). VHFO was recorded in 6 of 7 patients with a favorable outcome. On the contrary, VHFO was recorded in only 1 of 6 patients with unfavorable outcome. The presence of VHFO was significantly associated with favorable outcome. VHFO was recorded on a limited number of electrodes, and VHFO-generating areas were resected completely, whereas HFO-generating areas and/or SOZ were not always resected completely in both favorable and unfavorable outcome groups. InterpretationThe presence of ictal VHFO may be predictive of favorable outcome. Ictal VHFO may be a more specific marker than ictal HFO or SOZ for identifying the core of epileptogenic zone.

Electrophysiological evidence of statistical learning of long-distance dependencies in 8-month-old preterm and full-term infants	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Language; Infant; Statistics; Learning; Event-related potentials; Frequency tagging; Phase-locking; Prematurity	GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SPEECH; SENSITIVITY; RESPONSES; ACQUISITION; FREQUENCY; MEMORY; SEGMENTATION; PERCEPTION	Using electroencephalography, we examined 8-month-old infants' ability to discover a systematic dependency between the first and third syllables of successive words, concatenated into a monotonous speech stream, and to subsequently generalize this regularity to new items presented in isolation. Full-term and preterm infants, while exposed to the stream, displayed a significant entrainment (phase-locking) to the syllabic and word frequencies, demonstrating that they were sensitive to the word unit. The acquisition of the systematic dependency defining words was confirmed by the significantly different neural responses to rule-words and part-words subsequently presented during the test phase. Finally, we observed a correlation between syllabic entrainment during learning and the difference in phase coherence between the test conditions (rule-words vs part-words) suggesting that temporal processing of the syllable unit might be crucial in linguistic learning. No group difference was observed suggesting that non-adjacent statistical computations are already robust at 8 months, even in preterm infants, and thus develop during the first year of life, earlier than expected from behavioral studies.

Sensitivity to Referential Ambiguity in Discourse: The Role of Attention, Working Memory, and Verbal Ability	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							THETA-POWER INCREASES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA-BAND; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EEG-ALPHA; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RESOLUTION; CONTEXT	The establishment of reference is essential to language comprehension. The goal of this study was to examine listeners' sensitivity to referential ambiguity as a function of individual variation in attention, working memory capacity, and verbal ability. Participants listened to stories in which two entities were introduced that were either very similar (e.g., two oaks) or less similar (e.g., one oak and one elm). The manipulation rendered an anaphor in a subsequent sentence (e.g., oak) ambiguous or unambiguous. EEG was recorded as listeners comprehended the story, after which participants completed tasks to assess working memory, verbal ability, and the ability to use context in task performance. Power in the alpha and theta frequency bands when listeners received critical information about the discourse entities (e.g., oaks) was used to index attention and the involvement of the working memory system in processing the entities. These measures were then used to predict an ERP component that is sensitive to referential ambiguity, the Nref, which was recorded when listeners received the anaphor. Nref amplitude at the anaphor was predicted by alpha power during the earlier critical sentence: Individuals with increased alpha power in ambiguous compared with unambiguous stories were less sensitive to the anaphor's ambiguity. Verbal ability was also predictive of greater sensitivity to referential ambiguity. Finally, increased theta power in the ambiguous compared with unambiguous condition was associated with higher working-memory span. These results highlight the role of attention and working memory in referential processing during listening comprehension.

The main critical feature is the presence of scale-free neural avalanches, whose auto-organization is determined by a critical branching ratio of neural-excitation spreading. Other features, directly associated to second-order phase transitions, are: (i) scale-free-network topology of functional connectivity, stemming from suprathreshold pairwise correlations, superimposable, in waking brain activity, with that of ferromagnets at Curie temperature; (ii) temporal long-range memory associated to renewal intermittency driven by abrupt fluctuations in the order parameters, detectable in human brain via spatially distributed phase or amplitude changes in EEG activity. Herein we study intermittent events, extracted from 29 night EEG recordings, including presleep wakefulness and all phases of sleep, where different levels of mentation and consciousness are present. We show that while critical avalanching is unchanged, at least qualitatively, intermittency and functional connectivity, present during conscious phases (wakefulness and REM sleep), break down during both shallow and deep non-REM sleep. We provide a theory for fragmentation-induced intermittency breakdown and suggest that the main difference between conscious and unconscious states resides in the backwards causation, namely on the constraints that the emerging properties at large scale induce to the lower scales. In particular, while in conscious states this backwards causation induces a critical slowing down, preserving spatiotemporal correlations, in dreamless sleep we see a self-organized maintenance of moduli working in parallel. Critical avalanches are still present, and establish transient auto-organization, whose enhanced fluctuations are able to trigger sleep-protecting mechanisms that reinstate parallel activity. The plausible role of critical avalanches in dreamless sleep is to provide a rapid recovery of consciousness, if stimuli are highly arousing.

Sighted individuals are thought to encode touch in both coordinate systems concurrently, whereas congenitally blind individuals exhibit a strong bias for using anatomical coordinates. We investigated the neural correlates of this differential dominance in the use of anatomical and external reference frames by assessing oscillatory brain activity during a tactile spatial attention task. The EEG was recorded while sighted and congenitally blind adults received tactile stimulation to uncrossed and crossed hands while detecting rare tactile targets at one cued hand only. In the sighted group, oscillatory alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz) in the cue-target interval was reduced contralaterally and enhanced ipsilaterally with uncrossed hands. Hand crossing attenuated the degree of posterior parietal alpha-band lateralization, indicating that attention deployment was affected by external spatial coordinates. Beamforming suggested that this posture effect originated in the posterior parietal cortex. In contrast, cue-related lateralization of central alpha-band as well as of beta-band activity (16-24 Hz) were unaffected by hand crossing, suggesting that these oscillations exclusively encode anatomical coordinates. In the blind group, central alpha-band activity was lateralized, but did not change across postures. The pattern of beta-band activity was indistinguishable between groups. Because the neural mechanisms for posterior alpha-band generation seem to be linked to developmental vision, we speculate that the lack of this neural mechanism in blind individuals is related to their preferred use of anatomical over external spatial codes in sensory processing.

Miniature wireless recording and stimulation system for rodent behavioural testing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						DBS; LFP recording; wireless telemetry; headstage; behaviour; rodent; wireless device	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; FREELY MOVING RATS; TELEMETRY SYSTEM; MEMORY LOAD; OSCILLATIONS; ANIMALS; POTENTIALS; FLIGHT; UNIT	Objective. Elucidation of neural activity underpinning rodent behaviour has traditionally been hampered by the use of tethered systems and human involvement. Furthermore the combination of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and various neural recording modalities can lead to complex and time-consuming laboratory setups. For studies of this type, novel tools are required to drive forward this research. Approach. A miniature wireless system weighing 8.5 g (including battery) was developed for rodent use that combined multichannel DBS and local-field potential (LFP) recordings. Its performance was verified in a working memory task that involved 4-channel fronto-hippocampal LFP recording and bilateral constant-current fimbria-fornix DBS. The system was synchronised with video-tracking for extraction of LFP at discrete task phases, and DBS was activated intermittently at discrete phases of the task. Main results. In addition to having a fast set-up time, the system could reliably transmit continuous LFP at over 8 hours across 3-5m distances. During the working memory task, LFP pertaining to discrete task phases was extracted and compared with well-known neural correlates of active exploratory behaviour in rodents. DBS could be wirelessly activated/deactivated at any part of the experiment during EEG recording and transmission, allowing for a seamless integration of this modality. Significance. The wireless system combines a small size with a level of robustness and versatility that can greatly simplify rodent behavioural experiments involving EEG recording and DBS. Designed for versatility and simplicity, the small size and low-cost of the system and its receiver allow for enhanced portability, fast experimental setup times, and pave the way for integration with more complex behaviour.

Prior research has demonstrated that implicitly selecting features with a genetic programming (GP) algorithm more effectively determined the proper features to discern biomarker and non-biomarker interictal iEEG and fMRI activity than conventional feature selection approaches. However for each the iEEG and fMRI modalities, it is still uncertain whether the stochastic properties of indirect feature selection with a GP yield (a) consistent results within a patient data set and (b) features that are specific or universal across multiple patient data sets. We examined the reproducibility of implicitly selecting features to classify interictal activity using a GP algorithm by performing several selection trials and subsequent frequent itemset mining (FIM) for separate iEEG and fMRI epilepsy patient data. We observed within-subject consistency and across-subject variability with some small similarity for selected features, indicating a clear need for patient-specific features and possible need for patient-specific feature selection or/and classification. For the fMRI, using nearest-neighbor classification and 30 GP generations, we obtained over 60% median sensitivity and over 60% median selectivity. For the iEEG, using nearest-neighbor classification and 30 GP generations, we obtained over 65% median sensitivity and over 65% median selectivity except one patient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Robot-assisted walking devices have been used during rehabilitation of patients with these ailments for regaining and improving walking ability. Previous studies showed the advantage of brain-computer interface (BCI) based robot-assisted training combined with physical therapy in the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. Therefore, stroke patients with walking disorders might also benefit from using BCI robot-assisted training protocols. In order to develop such BCI, it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility to decode walking intention from cortical patterns during robot-assisted gait training. Spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) related to robot-assisted active and passive walking were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.8, six female) and in three acute stroke patients (all male, mean age 46.7 +/- 16.9, Berg Balance Scale 20 +/- 12.8). A logistic regression classifier was used to distinguish walking from baseline in these spectral EEG patterns. Mean classification accuracies of 94.0 +/- 5.4% and 93.1 +/- 7.9%, respectively, were reached when active and passive walking were compared against baseline. The classification performance between passive and active walking was 83.4 +/- 7.4%. A classification accuracy of 89.9 +/- 5.7% was achieved in the stroke patients when comparing walking and baseline. Furthermore, in the healthy volunteers modulation of low gamma activity in central midline areas was found to be associated with the gait cycle phases, but not in the stroke patients. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of BCI-based robotic-assisted training devices for gait rehabilitation.

Putative mechanisms mediating tolerance for audiovisual stimulus onset asynchrony	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						audiovisual stimulus onset asynchrony; auditory evoked potentials; alpha band activity; beta band activity; EEG; oscillatory activity	AUDITORY-CORTEX; TEMPORAL-ORDER; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; VISUAL SPEECH; PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; WINDOW; SIMULTANEITY; ORGANIZATION; INFORMATION	Audiovisual (AV) speech perception is robust to temporal asynchronies between visual and auditory stimuli. We investigated the neural mechanisms that facilitate tolerance for audiovisual stimulus onset asynchrony (AVOA) with EEG. Individuals were presented with AV words that were asynchronous in onsets of voice and mouth movement and judged whether they were synchronous or not. Behaviorally, individuals tolerated (perceived as synchronous) longer AVOAs when mouth movement preceded the speech (V-A) stimuli than when the speech preceded mouth movement (A-V). Neurophysiologically, the P1-N1-P2 auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), time-locked to sound onsets and known to arise in and surrounding the primary auditory cortex (PAC), were smaller for the in-sync than the out-of-sync percepts. Spectral power of oscillatory activity in the beta band (14-30 Hz) following the AEPs was larger during the in-sync than out-of-sync perception for both A-V and V-A conditions. However, alpha power (8-14 Hz), also following AEPs, was larger for the in-sync than out-of-sync percepts only in the V-A condition. These results demonstrate that AVOA tolerance is enhanced by inhibiting low-level auditory activity (e.g., AEPs representing generators in and surrounding PAC) that code for acoustic onsets. By reducing sensitivity to acoustic onsets, visual-to-auditory onset mapping is weakened, allowing for greater AVOA tolerance. In contrast, beta and alpha results suggest the involvement of higher-level neural processes that may code for language cues (phonetic, lexical), selective attention, and binding of AV percepts, allowing for wider neural windows of temporal integration, i.e., greater AVOA tolerance.

Expert and crowd-sourced validation of an individualized sleep spindle detection method employing complex demodulation and individualized normalization	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; spindle; EEG; detection; automated; crowdsourcing	MOTOR MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN RHYTHMS; EEG; FREQUENCY; ABILITY; ARCHITECTURE; FINGERPRINT; STABILITY; INCREASES	A spindle detection method was developed that: (1) extracts the signal of interest (i.e., spindle-related phasic changes in sigma) relative to ongoing "background" sigma activity using complex demodulation, (2) accounts for variations of spindle characteristics across the night, scalp derivations and between individuals, and (3) employs a minimum number of sometimes arbitrary, user-defined parameters. Complex demodulation was used to extract instantaneous power in the spindle band. To account for intra- and inter individual differences, the signal was z-score transformed using a 60 s sliding window, per channel, over the course of the recording. Spindle events were detected with a z-score threshold corresponding to a low probability (e.g., 99th percentile). Spindle characteristics, such as amplitude, duration and oscillatory frequency, were derived for each individual spindle following detection, which permits spindles to be subsequently and flexibly categorized as slow or fast spindles from a single detection pass. Spindles were automatically detected in 15 young healthy subjects. Two experts manually identified spindles from C3 during Stage 2 sleep, from each recording: one employing conventional guidelines, and the other, identifying spindles with the aid of a sigma (11-16 Hz) filtered channel. These spindles were then compared between raters and to the automated detection to identify the presence of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. This method of automated spindle detection resolves or avoids many of the limitations that complicate automated spindle detection, and performs well compared to a group of non-experts, and importantly, has good external validity with respect to the extant literature in terms of the characteristics of automatically detected spindles.

Effects of selective REM sleep deprivation on prefrontal gamma activity and executive functions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Gamma temporal coupling; Gamma synchronization; REM sleep deprivation; Prefrontal functions; Sleep interruptions	BRAIN; WAKE; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; MAINTENANCE; ACTIVATION; VIGILANCE; COGNITION; NETWORK; AROUSAL	Given that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions and is deactivated and decoupled from posterior associative regions during REM sleep, that Gamma temporal coupling involved in information processing is enhanced during REM sleep, and that adult humans spend about 90 min of every 24 h in REM sleep, it might be expected that REM sleep deprivation would modify Gamma temporal coupling and have a deteriorating effect on executive functions. We analyzed EEG Gamma activity and temporal coupling during implementation of a rule-guided task before and after REM sleep deprivation and its effect on verbal fluency, flexible thinking and selective attention. After two nights in the laboratory for adaptation, on the third night subjects (n = 18) were randomly assigned to either selective REM sleep deprivation effectuated by awakening them at each REM sleep onset or, the same number of NREM sleep awakenings as a control for unspecific effects of sleep interruptions. Implementation of abstract rules to guide behavior required greater activation and synchronization of Gamma activity in the frontopolar regions after REM sleep reduction from 20.6% at baseline to just 3.93% of total sleep time. However, contrary to our hypothesis, both groups showed an overall improvement in executive task performance and no effect on their capacity to sustain selective attention. These results suggest that after one night of selective REM sleep deprivation executive functions can be compensated by increasing frontal activation and they still require the participation of supervisory control by frontopolar regions.

J	Modur, P; Miocinovic, S				Modur, Pradeep; Miocinovic, Svjetlana			Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) as predictors of high frequency and conventional seizure onset zones	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						high-frequency oscillations; epilepsy; intracranial EEG; seizure localization; seizure prediction	NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; 80-500 HZ; RESECTION; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION	We investigated the relationship between the interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the seizure onset zones (SOZs) defined by the ictal HFOs or conventional frequency activity (CFA), and evaluated the usefulness of the interictal HFOs as spatial markers of the SOZs. We analysed seizures showing discrete HFOs at onset on intracranial EEGs acquired at 1000-Hz sampling rate in a training cohort of 10 patients with temporal and extratemporal epilepsy. We classified each ictal channel as: HFO+ (HFOs at onset with subsequent evolution), HFO- (HFOs at onset without evolution), CFA (1.6-70-Hz activity at onset with evolution), or non-ictal. We defined the SOZs as: hSOZ (HFO+ channels only), hfo+&-SOZ (HFO+ and HFO- channels), and cSOZ (CFA channels). Using automated methods, we detected the interictal HFOs and extracted five features: density, connectivity, peak frequency, log power, and amplitude. We created logistic regression models using these features, and tested their performance in a separate replication cohort of three patients. The models containing the five interictal HFO features reliably differentiated the channels located inside the SOZ from those outside in the training cohort (p<0.001), reaching the highest accuracy for the classification of hSOZ. Log power and connectivity had the highest odds ratios, both being higher for the channels inside the SOZ compared with those outside the SOZ. In the replication cohort of novel patients, the same models differentiated the HFO+ from HFO- channels, and predicted the extents of the hSOZ and hfo+&-SOZ (F1 measure >0.5) but not the cSOZ. Our study shows that the interictal HFOs are useful in defining the spatial extent of the SOZ, and predicting whether or not a given channel in a novel patient would be involved in the seizure. The findings support the existence of an abnormal network of tightly-linked ictal and interictal HFOs in patients with intractable epilepsy.

Disturbed phase relations in white matter hyperintensity based vascular dementia: An EEG directed connectivity study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Phase Lag Index; Directed phase lag index; Vascular dementia; WMH; Functional connectivity; EEG	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VOLUME CONDUCTION; LAG INDEX; BRAIN; STATE; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATION; IMPAIRMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Objective: White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a feature seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and regarded to reflect small vessel disease, can lead to vascular dementia (WMH-VaD). In WMH-VaD, cognitive deficits typically consist of executive function disturbances, and reduced information processing speed, regarded as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. We aimed to investigate whether this patient group has typical functional differences from controls. Methods: Resting-state encephalography studies of 17 VaD patients and 17 age- and gender matched non-demented controls were analysed in the delta, theta, alpha1 and 2, and beta frequency bands. Undirected functional connectivity between electrodes was established with the Phase Lag Index (PLI) and directed functional connectivity with the directed Phase Lag Index (dPLI). PLI and dPLI were related to performance in cognitive testing. Results: Mean PLI did not differ between patients and controls. In the control group dPLI showed anterior to posterior phase gradients in all bands except the delta band. In the VaD patient group this pattern was significantly different without a clear directional pattern. No relationship with cognition was demonstrated. Conclusions: This study shows a clear front-to-back direction of connectivity in non-demented controls. In VaD patients with extensive WMH, this pattern is disturbed. Significance: Structural damage at the regions of long distance white matter tracts may induce changes in the direction of phase relationships of distinct brain regions.

The Contribution of Attentional Lapses to Individual Differences in Visual Working Memory Capacity	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL THETA; EEG ALPHA; TASK; LOAD; MIND; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Attentional control and working memory capacity are important cognitive abilities that substantially vary between individuals. Although much is known about how attentional control and working memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can distinguish between models in which working memory performance failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task. The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition, we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the trial-by-trial differences in working memory that we observe.	[Adam, Kirsten C.

J	Song, JJ; Vanneste, S; De Ridder, D				Song, Jae Jin; Vanneste, Sven; De Ridder, Dirk			Dysfunctional Noise Cancelling of the Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Tinnitus Patients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL MECHANISMS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; HEARING; DISTRESS; PAIN; DISSOCIATION; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Background Peripheral auditory deafferentation and central compensation have been regarded as the main culprits of tinnitus generation. However, patient-to-patient discrepancy in the range of the percentage of daytime in which tinnitus is perceived (tinnitus awareness percentage, 0 - 100%), is not fully explicable only by peripheral deafferentation, considering that the deafferentation is a stable persisting phenomenon but tinnitus is intermittently perceived in most patients. Consequently, the involvement of a dysfunctional noise cancellation mechanism has recently been suggested with regard to the individual differences in reported tinnitus awareness. By correlating the tinnitus awareness percentage with resting-state source-localized electroencephalography findings, we may be able to retrieve the cortical area that is negatively correlated with tinnitus awareness percentage, and then the area may be regarded as the core of the noise cancelling system that is defective in patients with tinnitus. Methods and Findings Using resting-state cortical oscillation, we investigated 80 tinnitus patients by correlating the tinnitus awareness percentage with their source-localized cortical oscillatory activity and functional connectivity. The activity of bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), left dorsal-and pregenual ACCs for the delta band, bilateral rostral/pregenual/subgenual ACCs for the theta band, and left rostral/pregenual ACC for the beta 1 band displayed significantly negative correlations with tinnitus awareness percentage. Also, the connectivity between the left primary auditory cortex (A1) and the rostral ACC, as well as between the left A1 and the subgenual ACC for the beta 1 band, were negatively correlated with tinnitus awareness percentage. Conclusions These results may designate the role of the rostral ACC as the core of the descending noise cancellation system, and thus dysfunction of the rostral ACC may result in perception of tinnitus. The present study also opens a possibility of tinnitus modulation by neuromodulatory approaches targeting the rostral ACC.

It usually includes arousals secondary to respiratory events, limb movements, and spontaneous arousals. No systematic studies have been undertaken to determine AI cutoff in subjects with negative polysomnography. Three hundred fifty polysomnograms of subjects a parts per thousand yen18 years of age with no sleep disorders (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 5, periodic limb movement index (PLMI) < 10, no upper airway resistance syndrome) or minimum oxygen saturation > 90 % and no comorbid health problems were reviewed. Basic sleep architecture appears within normal range, except for increased stage N2 and decreased stage N3. AI significantly correlated with age (r = 0.7), sleep efficiency (r =-0.16), sleep latency (r = 0.14), rapid eye movement (REM) latency (r = 0.12), stage N1 (r = 0.15), stage N2 (r = 0.12), stage N3 (r = -0.27), AHI (r = 0.24), PLMI (r = 0.18), and nadir oxygen saturation (r = -0.17) [p < 0.05 for all]. A significant correlation was noted between age and sleep efficiency (r = -0.19), REM latency (r = 0.13), stage N1 (r = 0.16), stage N2 (r = 0.21), stage N3 (r = -0.39), and nadir oxygen saturation (r = -0.16) [p < 0.05 for all]. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age is only the independent predictor of AI (R (2) = 0.70, p < 0.01). The prediction equation for the arousal index in subject with negative polysomnography is AI = 0.276 x age (year) + 8.018. Age is the most important independent factor in predicting increasing AI in subjects with negative polysomnography.

Methods: The four methods consisted of: (1) reciprocal high frequency power based on Fast Fourier Transformation, (2) Cardiac Sympathetic Index (CSI), (3) Modified CSI both based on Lorenz plot, and (4) heart rate differential method. Seventeen patients (12 males, 5 females; age 20-55) had 47 seizures (including three secondary generalized tonic-clonic (sGTC)), which were analyzed during their long term video-EEG monitoring of 1-5 days duration. Positive seizure detection was regarded, when the HRV-value during seizures (1 min before to 3 min after seizure-onset) exceeded 105% of the highest value during exercise and non-seizure sample-periods of the same patient. Results: Modified CSI100 was the most accurate method: it detected all seizures for 13 of the 17 patients within 6 s before till 50 s after seizure onset time, even though exercise maximum HR of each patient exceeded that of the seizures. The three sGTC seizures were all detected more than half a minute before the tonic-clonic phase. Conclusion: The results indicate a detectable, sudden and inordinate shift toward sympathetic overdrive in the sympathovagal balance of the autonomic nervous system around seizure-onset time, for most patients.

However, network-level mechanisms that link its activity to brain state remain enigmatic. Here, we combined optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, and video-EEG monitoring to characterize the central thalamus-driven global brain networks responsible for switching brain state. 40 and 100 Hz stimulations of central thalamus caused widespread activation of forebrain, including frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and striatum, and transitioned the brain to a state of arousal in asleep rats. In contrast, 10 Hz stimulation evoked significantly less activation of forebrain, inhibition of sensory cortex, and behavioral arrest. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the frequency-dependent cortical inhibition, we performed recordings in zona incerta, where 10, but not 40, Hz stimulation evoked spindle-like oscillations. Importantly, suppressing incertal activity during 10 Hz central thalamus stimulation reduced the evoked cortical inhibition. These findings identify key brain-wide dynamics underlying central thalamus arousal regulation.

Their reliable acquisition at home, however, is difficult. In comparison, ECG and thoracic respiratory (R) signals are easier to record and can be useful in home sleep monitoring systems. The simultaneous utilization of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and respiratory (R) signals seems a plausible scenario as both heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) vary during different sleep states. Therefore, we explored the combined discriminative capacity (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of ECG/R signals in automatic sleep staging. As baseline, we classified the wakefulness, Stage 2, SWS (slow wave sleep) and REM sleep by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) fed with a set of features extracted from: (a) HRV (34-features), (b) HRV/ECG-Derived Respiration (45-features), and (c) combined HRV/R (45-features) signals. Approach (a) produced reasonable discriminative capacity, while approach (b) significantly improved the classification; however, the best outcomes were achieved by using approach (c). Then, we enhanced the SVM classifier with the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method. The classification results were improved with 35 out of the 45 HRV/RS-EDR features. In comparison, best results were obtained by combining 27 out of the 45 features derived from HRV/R signals, in which the optimal feature set selected by the SVM-RFE method, included a combination of time domain, time-frequency, and fractal features, as well as entropies. Overall, these improvements revealed that it is possible to simplify home monitoring of sleep disorders and achieve high discriminative capacity (accuracy=89.32%, specificity=92.88%, and sensitivity=78.64%) in automatic sleep staging by the exclusive recording of cardiorespiratory signals.

However, whether the influence of beta-amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory is, in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and associated overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here we show that beta-amyloid burden in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) correlates significantly with the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM SWA generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory consolidation and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Furthermore, structural equation models revealed that the association between mPFC beta-amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation was not direct, but instead statistically depended on the intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking beta-amyloid pathology with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a mechanistic pathway through which beta-amyloid pathology may contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly.

The pre-stimulus expectation period was characterized by low-frequency delta-activity (1-4 Hz) with the source (according to criteria of Granger causality) in the prefrontal cortex and also by synchronized theta-rhythm (6-8 Hz) in the hippocampus. The performance of conditioned avoidance reflex was characterized by generation of high-frequency synchronized theta-rhythm (8-11 Hz) simultaneously with delta-activity elimination. The phase of delta- (theta-) activity modulates the envelope of gamma-rhythm (similar to 30-120 Hz) in each of the structures. The elaboration and strengthening of conditioned reflex leads to concurrent theta power and synchronization growth in relation to reflex performance, but not during the prestimulus expectation period.

Passive Transport Disrupts Grid Signals in the Parahippocampal Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HEAD DIRECTION CELLS; MEDIAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX; SPATIAL REPRESENTATION; FIRING PROPERTIES; PATH-INTEGRATION; VESTIBULAR INPUT; SPEED MODULATION; THETA; RAT; FREQUENCY	Navigation is usually thought of relative to landmarks, but neural signals representing space also use information generated by an animal's movements. These signals include grid cells, which fire at multiple locations, forming a repeating grid pattern. Grid cell generation depends upon theta rhythm, a 6-10 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillation that is modulated by the animals' movement velocity. We passively moved rats in a clear cart to eliminate motor related self-movement cues that drive moment-to-moment changes in theta rhythmicity. We found that passive movement maintained theta power and frequency at levels equivalent to low active movement velocity, spared overall head-direction (HD) cell characteristics, but abolished both velocity modulation of theta rhythmicity and grid cell firing patterns. These results indicate that self-movement motor cues are necessary for generating grid-specific firing patterns, possibly by driving velocity modulation of theta rhythmicity, which may be used as a speed signal to generate the repeating pattern of grid cells.

Recently, social signal processing (SSP) has proposed to apply similar methods to human-human interactions with the hope of better understanding and modeling social interactions. Most of the social signals employed are facial expressions, body movements and speech, but studies using physiological signals remain scarce. In this paper, we motivate the use of physiological signals in the context of social interactions. Specifically, we review studies which have investigated the relationship between various physiological indices and social interactions. We then propose two main directions to apply physiological SSP: using physiological signals of individual users as new social cues displayed in the group and using inter-user physiology to measure properties of the interactions such as conflict and social presence. We conclude that physiological measures have the potential to enhance social interactions and to connect people.

Although drivers are held responsible, the neural processes that govern such decisions are not clear. We recorded intracranial EEG signals from six patients engaged in a computer-based driving simulator. Patients decided which way to turn (left/right) and subsequently reported the time of the decision. We show that power modulations of gamma band oscillations (30-100 Hz) preceding the reported time of decision (up to 5.5 sec) allow prediction of decision content with high accuracy (up to 82.4%) on a trial-by-trial basis, irrespective of subsequent motor output. Moreover, these modulations exhibited a spatiotemporal gradient, differentiating left/right decisions earliest in premotor cortices and later in more anterior and lateral regions. Our results suggest a preconscious role for the premotor cortices in early stages of decision-making, which permits foreseeing and perhaps modifying the content of real-life human choices before they are consciously made.

Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular level mechanisms of these drugs, knowledge of their actions on global brain dynamics is still incomplete. Recent imaging studies have found changes in functional coupling between frontal and parietal brain structures, suggesting a modification in information flow between brain regions during acute effects. Methods: Here we assessed the psychedelic-induced changes in directionality of information flow during the acute effects of a psychedelic in humans. We measured modifications in connectivity of brain oscillations using transfer entropy, a nonlinear measure of directed functional connectivity based on information theory. Ten healthy male volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics participated in 2 experimental sessions. They received a placebo or a dose of ayahuasca, a psychedelic preparation containing the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Results: The analysis showed significant changes in the coupling of brain oscillations between anterior and posterior recording sites. Transfer entropy analysis showed that frontal sources decreased their influence over central, parietal, and occipital sites. Conversely, sources in posterior locations increased their influence over signals measured at anterior locations. Exploratory correlations found that anterior-to-posterior transfer entropy decreases were correlated with the intensity of subjective effects, while the imbalance between anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior transfer entropy correlated with the degree of incapacitation experienced. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychedelics induce a temporary disruption of neural hierarchies by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain.

Patients with schizophrenia show a deficit in auditory steady-state response at 40 Hz, and therefore this may be a useful biomarker to study this disorder. Methods: We used auditory steady-state response recordings from the primary auditory cortex, hippocampus, and vertex electroencephalogram sites in awake behaving rats to determine whether pharmacological impairment of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission mimics auditory steady-state response abnormalities in schizophrenia. Results: We found the most robust response to auditory stimuli in the primary auditory cortex, in line with previous studies suggesting this region is the primary generator of the auditory steady-state response in humans. Acute MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) increased primary auditory cortex intertrial coherence during auditory steady-state response at 20 and 40 Hz. Chronic MK-801 (21-day exposure at this daily dose) had no significant effect on 40-Hz auditory steady-state response. Furthermore, we found no effect of acute or chronic picrotoxin (a GABA-A antagonist) on intertrial coherence. Conclusions: Our data indicate that acute N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism increases synchronous activity in the primary auditory cortex in a frequency-specific manner, supporting the widely held view that acute N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonism augments gamma oscillations. Thus, rodent auditory steady-state response could be a valuable method to study the cortical ability to support synchronous activity at specific frequencies.

Causal involvement of visual area MT in global feature-based enhancement but not contingent attentional capture	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Area MT; Frequency tagging; Frontoparietal network; Selective attention; Temporoparietal junction; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; CONTROL SETTINGS	When visual attention is set for a particular target feature, such as color or shape, neural responses to that feature are enhanced across the visual field. This global feature-based enhancement is hypothesized to underlie the contingent attentional capture effect, in which task-irrelevant items with the target feature capture spatial attention. In humans, however, different cortical regions have been implicated in global feature-based enhancement and contingent capture. Here, we applied intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to assess the causal roles of two regions of extrastriate cortex - right area MT and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) - in both global feature-based enhancement and contingent capture. We recorded cortical activity using EEG while participants monitored centrally for targets defined by color and ignored peripheral checkerboards that matched the distractor or target color. In central vision, targets were preceded by colored cues designed to capture attention. Stimuli flickered at unique frequencies, evoking distinct cortical oscillations. Analyses of these oscillations and behavioral performance revealed contingent capture in central vision and global feature-based enhancement in the periphery. Stimulation of right area MT selectively increased global feature-based enhancement, but did not influence contingent attentional capture. By contrast, stimulation of the right TPJ left both processes unaffected. Our results reveal a causal role for the right area MT in feature-based attention, and suggest that global feature-based enhancement does not underlie the contingent capture effect.

Recognition of such images may require an intuitive guess. We determined the spatial-temporal characteristics of intracranially-recorded gamma activity (at 50-120 Hz) augmented differentially by naming of ambiguous and unambiguous images. Methods: We studied 10 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery. Ambiguous and unambiguous images were presented during extraoperative electrocorticography recording, and patients were instructed to overtly name the object as it is first perceived. Results: Both naming tasks were commonly associated with gamma-augmentation sequentially involving the occipital and occipital-temporal regions, bilaterally, within 200 ms after the onset of image presentation. Naming of ambiguous images elicited gamma-augmentation specifically involving portions of the inferior-frontal, orbitofrontal, and inferior-parietal regions at 400 ms and after. Unambiguous images were associated with more intense gamma-augmentation in portions of the occipital and occipital-temporal regions. Conclusions: Frontal-parietal gamma-augmentation specific to ambiguous images may reflect the additional cortical processing involved in exerting intuitive guess. Occipital gamma-augmentation enhanced during naming of unambiguous images can be explained by visual processing of stimuli with richer detail. Significance: Our results support the theoretical model that guessing processes in visual domain occur following the accumulation of sensory evidence resulting from the bottom-up processing in the occipital-temporal visual pathways.

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (ta-VNS) is a newer non-invasive VNS, making it more accessible for treating pediatric epilepsy, yet there is limited clinical evidence for its effectiveness. Methods/Design: A three-center, randomized, parallel, controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate whether ta-VNS improves pediatric epilepsy. Pediatric patients aged 2 to 14 years with epilepsy will be recruited and randomly assigned to transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (ta-VNS) group, transcutaneous auricular non-vagus nerve stimulation (tan-VNS) group, and control group with a 1: 1: sqrt(2) allocation, as per a computer generated randomization schedule stratified by study center using permuted blocks of random sizes. We will use Zelen's design, in which randomization occurs before informed consent. Patients in the stimulation groups will receive tan-VNS or ta-VNS three times a day for 6 months. Patients in the control group will not be provided with any stimulation during the 6 months. The guardians of the patients are required to keep a detailed diary to record the data. Outcome assessment including seizure frequency, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, quality of life (QOL) and adverse events will be made at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 months after ta-VNS initiation. The seizure frequency and adverse events will be followed up at 1 year and 1.5 years after ta-VNS initiation. Discussion: Results of this trial will help clarify whether ta-VNS treatment is beneficial for pediatric patients, and will make clear whether the anticonvulsive effect of ta-VNS is correlated with the improvement of sympathovagal imbalance.

We compare these models to our previously proposed consciousness model in which the thalamus fills-in processed sensory information from corticothalamic feedback loops within a proposed 3D default space, resulting in the recreation of the internal and external worlds within the mind. This 3D default space is composed of all cells of the body, which communicate via gap junctions and electrical potentials to create this unified space. We use 3D illustrations to explain how both visual and non-visual sensory information may be filled-in within this dynamic space, creating a unified seamless conscious experience. This neural sensory memory space is likely generated by baseline neural oscillatory activity from the default mode network, other salient networks, brainstem, and reticular activating system.

However, there is inconclusive scientific evidence concerning the potential risks associated with the energy deposition in the brain from Wi-Fi and whether Wi-Fi electromagnetism interacts with cognitive function. In this study we investigated possible neurocognitive effects caused by Wi-Fi exposure. First, we constructed a Wi-Fi exposure system from commercial parts. Dosimetry was first assessed by free space radiofrequency field measurements. The experimental exposure system was then modeled based on real geometry and physical characteristics. Specific absorption rate (SAR) calculations were performed using a wholebody, realistic human voxel model with values corresponding to conventional everyday Wi-Fi exposure (peak SAR(10g) level was 99.22 mW/kg with 1 W output power and 100% duty cycle). Then, in two provocation experiments involving healthy human volunteers we tested for two hypotheses: 1. Whether a 60 min long 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi exposure affects the spectral power of spontaneous awake electroencephalographic (sEEG) activity (N = 25); and 2. Whether similar Wi-Fi exposure modulates the sustained attention measured by reaction time in a computerized psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) (N = 19). EEG data were recorded at midline electrode sites while volunteers watched a silent documentary. In the PVT task, button press reaction time was recorded. No measurable effects of acute Wi-Fi exposure were found on spectral power of sEEG or reaction time in the psychomotor vigilance test. These results indicate that a single, 60 min WiFi exposure does not alter human oscillatory brain function or objective measures of sustained attention.

Multilevel Computational Modelling in Epilepsy: Classical Studies and Recent Advances	VALIDATING NEURO-COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS	Springer Series in Computational Neuroscience		English	Article; Book Chapter						Epilepsy; Networks; Seizures; Microscale; Neurons	NEURAL MASS MODEL; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; FIELD-THEORY; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; BRAIN; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY	In this chapter we present a review of computational models for studying the dynamic mechanisms that describe the function of the human brain, with a specific focus on epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterised by an increased likelihood of recurrent seizures, which in turn are characterised by transient, pathological episodes of hypersynchronised neural activity resulting in a variety of behavioural symptoms. Our chapter introduces some of the key concepts of epilepsy from a clinical perspective, before describing some of the classical approaches to modelling brain activity across multiple levels of description. We then focus on how these models have been used to explain and predict experimental and clinical phenomena within the field of epilepsy research. Here we focus on techniques that seek to integrate computational modelling with experimental and clinical measures, as we believe this "systems approach" to epilepsy research is from where the most significant new advances, particularly with regards model validation, will occur. We highlight some of the key studies, as well as emphasising more recent breakthroughs to provide a useful entry point into this rapidly expanding field of research.

J	Strozzi, I; Nolan, SJ; Sperling, MR; Wingerchuk, DM; Sirven, J				Strozzi, Isabella; Nolan, Sarah J.; Sperling, Michael R.; Wingerchuk, Dean M.; Sirven, Joseph			Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							SEIZURE-FREE PATIENTS; UNCOMPLICATED CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; ANTICONVULSANT THERAPY; EARLY DISCONTINUATION; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDREN; RECURRENCE; MEDICATION; PROGNOSIS; RELAPSE	Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects millions of people around the world. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are the main interventions used to prevent seizures and control epilepsy. Although effective in most cases, AEDs are related to long-term adverse effects, such as cognitive and behavioural alterations. Thus when epilepsy is in remission, it may be in the individual's best interest to discontinue medication. However, the optimal timing of AED discontinuation is still unknown. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2001. Objectives (1) To quantify and compare risk of seizure recurrence, status epilepticus and mortality after early and late AED discontinuation in adult and pediatric epilepsy patients. (2) To assess which variables modify the risk of seizure recurrence. (3) To define a subpopulation in which early AED discontinuation is safe. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2014); CENTRAL (Issue 5, The Cochrane Library, May 2014); MEDLINE (1946 to June 2014); CINAHL (23 June 2014); Scopus (1823 to June 2014); ClinicalTrials. gov (23 June 2014); and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (23 June 2014). We also checked the reference lists of studies found through the electronic searches. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs after varying periods of seizure remission in adults and children with epilepsy. Included studies compared an early AED discontinuation time (defined as a period of remission of seizures of less than two years) versus a late AED discontinuation time (defined as a period of remission of seizures of more than two years). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each trial. Summary RRs and 95% CIs for dichotomous data were calculated using a fixed-effectmodel. A test of statistical heterogeneity was conducted for each pooled risk ratio calculation. Each included study underwent a 'Risk of bias' assessment, based on the Cochrane Handbook recommendations, and we examined the overall quality of information through the GRADE system, presented in two 'Summary of Findings' tables. Main results Five trials were included in this review, representing 924 randomised children with epilepsy, all under 16 years of age at randomisation, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No eligible trial evaluated adults or assessed mortality or status epilepticus as outcomes. The pooled risk ratio for seizure relapse after AED withdrawal was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.59, P = 0.0007). Conforming to this estimate, the number needed to harm, that is expose an individual to a higher risk of seizure relapse because of early withdrawal of AED, is 8 (95% CI 5 to 20). Early discontinuation was associated with greater relapse rates in people with partial seizures with a pooled risk ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.35, P = 0.07). Absence type epilepsy showed a lower risk of relapse. Variables associated with higher risk of seizure relapse were abnormal EEG findings (pooled RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.83, P = 0.003), especially epileptiform activity (RR 2.58, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.28, P < 0.0001); epilepsy onset before 2 years or after 10 years of age; history of status epilepticus; intellectual disability (IQ < 70); and high seizure frequency before and during treatment. Gender and family history did not show any significant influence over seizure relapse. Overall, the included trials were classified as low or unclear risk of bias wheremethodological information was not reported and could not be provided by original study authors. Authors' conclusions There is evidence to support waiting for at least two seizure-free years before discontinuing AEDs in children, particularly if individuals have an abnormal EEG or partial seizures, or both. There is insufficient evidence to establish when to withdraw AEDs in children with generalised seizures. There is no evidence to guide the timing of withdrawal of AEDs in seizure-free adults. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed, particularly recruiting adults and recruiting those with generalised seizure types, to identify the optimal timing of AED withdrawal and risk factors predictive of relapse. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used to prevent these seizures but have long- term side effects. When in remission (seizure free), it may be best to stop using the drugs but the right time to withdraw them is still unclear. We searched electronic databases in June 2014, adding to the trials included in a previous version of this review. Five trials were added to our analysis, comprising 924 epileptic children (all below 16 years old) who were randomly assigned to either early removal of AEDs (before completing two years without seizures); or late withdrawal of AEDs (after completing two years without seizures). Considering all evidence, we found that stopping AED intake before completing two years without seizures increases the risk of seizure relapse by around 34%. This percentage is increased if the child has partial seizures (if the electrical burst only involves a part of the brain, resulting mainly in localized symptoms); or an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) record (unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brain). Other factors that might be related to a higher relapse rate are: age below two years or above 10 years when epilepsy started; history of status epilepticus (convulsions longer than 30 minutes); an IQ lower than 70; and high frequency of seizures before and during treatment. Overall, the included trials provided a moderate quality of evidence. The review of trials found that there is evidence to support waiting at least two years or more seizure free before discontinuing AEDs in children, especially if they had partial seizures or abnormal EEG. There is not enough evidence to show the best time to withdraw antiepileptic drugs in adults with epilepsy who are free of seizures. There is not enough evidence that demonstrates the optimal time to remove antiepileptic drugs in people (children or adults) with generalised seizures (if the electrical discharges affect the whole brain, causing global symptoms). More research is needed, particularly involving adults and those with generalised seizure types.

We hypothesized that the modulation of SWA by means of a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could reveal residual patterns of connectivity, thus supporting the DOC clinical differential diagnosis. We enrolled 10 DOC individuals who underwent a 24 hh polysomnography followed by a real or sham 5 Hz-rTMS over left primary motor area, and a second polysomnographic recording. A preserved sleep-wake cycle, a standard temporal progression of sleep stages, and a SWA perturbation were found in all of the MCS patients and in none of the UWS individuals, only following the real-rTMS. In conclusion, our combined approach may improve the differential diagnosis between MCS patients, who show a partial preservation of cortical plasticity, and UWS individuals, who lack such properties.

This requires the seizure onset zone to be localized to a specific area of brain tissue. Currently, this seizure locus is largely identified via expert visual assessment of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Therefore, localization could potentially be improved by (1) the incorporation of recording techniques with higher spatial and temporal resolution; and (2) by analyses that help to objectively and quantitatively identify the source of epileptic activity. Here, we discuss the application of signal processing and graph theory measures to human ECoG and depth electrode data. We demonstrate the application of a subset of these techniques, including cross correlation, coherence, and Granger causality, to analyze a recording of a seizure from a multi-electrode array (MEA) implanted in human cortex. The results are used to define epileptogenic networks, which can be validated against the visually identifiable development and propagation of the seizure. We then characterize each network and quantify the degree of similarity between networks in order to directly compare analysis techniques.

Disturbed temporal dynamics of brain synchronization in vision loss	CORTEX			English	Article						Vision loss; Blindness; Neural synchronization; Temporal dynamics; Glaucoma	VISUAL-FIELD MAPS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; IMPROVES VISION; RESIDUAL VISION; OPTIC NEURITIS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EEG ALPHA; REORGANIZATION	Damage along the visual pathway prevents bottom-up visual input from reaching further processing stages and consequently leads to loss of vision. But perception is not a simple bottom-up process rather it emerges from activity of widespread cortical networks which coordinate visual processing in space and time. Here we set out to study how vision loss affects activity of brain visual networks and how networks activity is related to perception. Specifically, we focused on studying temporal patterns of brain activity. To this end, resting-state eyes-closed EEG was recorded from partially blind patients suffering from chronic retina and/or optic-nerve damage (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 13). Amplitude (power) of oscillatory activity and phase locking value (PLV) were used as measures of local and distant synchronization, respectively. Synchronization time series were created for the low- (7-9 Hz) and high-alpha band (11-13 Hz) and analyzed with three measures of temporal patterns: (i) length of synchronized-/desynchronized-periods, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and (iii) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). We revealed that patients exhibit less complex, more random and noise-like temporal dynamics of high-alpha band activity. More random temporal patterns were associated with worse performance in static (r = -.54, p = .017) and kinetic perimetry (r = .47, p = .041). We conclude that disturbed temporal patterns of neural synchronization in vision loss patients indicate disrupted communication within brain visual networks caused by prolonged deafferentation. We propose that because the state of brain networks is essential for normal perception, impaired brain synchronization in patients with vision loss might aggravate the functional consequences of reduced visual input.

However, it is technically difficult to examine synaptic inputs into neuronal circuits in behaving animals. Here, we conducted current source density (CSD) analysis on local field potentials (LFPs) recorded simultaneously using a multi-contact electrode in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a behaving monkey. We observed current sink task-dependent spatiotemporal patterns considered to reflect the synaptic input to neurons adjacent to the recording site. Specifically, the inferior convex current sink in the PFC was dominant during the delay period, whereas the current sink was prominent in the principal sulcus during the sample cue and test cue periods. Surprisingly, sulcus current sink patterns were spatially periodic, which corresponds to the columnar structure suggested by previous anatomical studies. The approaches used in the current study will help to elucidate how the PFC network performs executive functions according to its synaptic input. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main function of BMIs is to detect, analyze and classify the modulation of EEG according to a user's intent and to decode it to demonstrate to others. Most of conventional BMIs with relatively high speed and high classification accuracy have a requisite that a user can open and move his/her eyes toward a target corresponding to user's intent and gaze at it. Locked-in patients, who have lost almost all motor function including facial muscle, cannot control the eye-movement as well as gaze. The present study aimed at developing a BMI which was independent of the eye-movement and eye-gaze as a final goal. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of binary class of BMI available with eyes-closed condition using a recent our newly observation that the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) could be modulated by performing the mental tasks even in the eyes-close state. Temporal evolution of the modulation of SSVEP was investigated using the amplitude of SSVEP and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The amplitudes of fundamental SSVEP (10 Hz) averaged across 11 participants showed significant difference between the mental focusing task and relaxed runs from the onset of the flicker stimuli with the frequency of 10 Hz and the intensity of 5 lx, whereas those of the second harmonic SSVEP (20 Hz) gave only small difference without statistical significance. For the image recalling task, the amplitude differences between the fundamental SSVEPs in the task and relaxed conditions did not show significant difference, whereas the amplitude differences of the second harmonic SSVEP showed the main effect of the image recall task. The KL divergences for the fundamental SSVEP amplitude showed large differences at the onset of flicker stimuli and gradual decrease with time at P4 and O2 for the mental focus task, yet no such characteristic evolution was not seen in KL divergence for the second harmonic SSVEP. On the other hand, the KL divergences during the image recalling were increased with time for both the fundamental and second harmonic SSVEPs at most of the electrode sites. The classification accuracies of the proposed BMI exceeded 75 % in average across the subjects for both tasks using Fisher's linear discriminant analysis.

Theories of antidepressant medication action traditionally have focusedon the level of cell-to-cell interactionand synapticneurotransmission. However, recent evidence suggests that modulation of synchronized electrical activity in neuronal networks is a common effect of antidepressant treatments, including not only medications, but also neuromodulatory treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Synchronization of oscillatory network activity in particular frequency bands has been proposed to underlie neurodevelopmental and learning processes, and also may be important in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments. Here, we review current research on the relationship between neuroplasticity and oscillatory synchrony, which suggests that oscillatory synchrony may help mediate neuroplastic changes related to neurodevelopment, learning, and memory, as well as medication and neuromodulatory treatment for MDD. We hypothesize that medication and neuromodulation treatments may have related effects on the rate and pattern of neuronal firing, and that these effects underlie antidepressant efficacy. Elucidating the mechanisms through which oscillatory synchrony may be related to neuroplasticity could lead to enhanced treatment strategies for MDD.

Although selective attention allows us to filter out task-irrelevant information, there is a substantial number of unattended, yet relevant, events that must be evaluated in a flexible manner so that appropriate behaviors can succeed. Here we inspected the extent to which unattended conflicting visual information, which cannot be consciously identified, influences behavior and activates medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mechanisms of action-monitoring and regulation, traditionally associated with conscious control processes. To that end, we performed two experiments using a novel variant of the Eriksen flanker task in which spatial attention was manipulated, preventing the conscious identification of unattended visual events. The first behavioral experiment was conducted to validate the efficacy of the novel paradigm. In the second experiment, we evaluated electrophysiological correlates of mPFC activity (a frontocentral negative ERP component and medial-frontal theta oscillations) in response to attended and unattended conflicting events. The results of both experiments demonstrated that attended and unattended conflicting stimuli altered subjects' behavior in a similar fashion, i.e. slowing down their reaction times and increasing their error rates. Importantly, the results of the EEG experiment showed that unattended conflicting stimuli, similarly to attended conflicting stimuli, led to an increase in theta-related frontocentral ERP activity and medial-frontal theta power, irrespective of the degree of conscious representation of the sources of conflict. This study provides evidence that medial-frontal theta oscillations represent a neural mechanism through which the mPFC may suppress and regulate potentially inappropriate actions that are automatically triggered by conflicting environmental stimuli to which we are oblivious.

We investigated whether real-time neurofeedback training of the alpha lateralization enhances participants' ability to modulate posterior alpha lateralization and causes subsequent short-term changes in visual detection performance. The experiment consisted of three phases: (i) pre-training assessment, (ii) neurofeedback phase and (iii) post-training assessment. In the pre- and post-training phases we measured the threshold to covertly detect a cued faint Gabor stimulus presented in the left or right hemifield. During magnetoencephalography (MEG) neurofeedback, two face stimuli superimposed with noise were presented bilaterally. Participants were cued to attend to one of the hemifields. The transparency of the superimposed noise and thus the visibility of the stimuli were varied according to the momentary degree of hemispheric alpha lateralization. In a double-blind procedure half of the participants were provided with sham feedback. We found that hemispheric alpha lateralization increased with the neurofeedback training; this was mainly driven by an ipsilateral alpha increase. Surprisingly, comparing pre- to post-training, detection performance decreased for a Gabor stimulus presented in the hemifield that was un-attended during neurofeedback. This effect was not observed in the sham group. Thus, neurofeedback training alters alpha lateralization, which in turn decreases performances in the untrained hemifield. Our findings suggest that alpha oscillations play a causal role for the allocation of attention. Furthermore, our neurofeedback protocol serves to reduce the detection of unattended visual information and could therefore be of potential use for training to reduce distractibility in attention deficit patients, but also highlights that neurofeedback paradigms can have negative impact on behavioral performance and should be applied with caution.

Pioneering studies on perceptual suppression (PS) described specific local neural network responses in primary visual cortex, thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex of the macaque brain. Yet the neural effects of PS have rarely been studied with intracerebral recordings outside these cortices and simultaneously across distant brain areas. Here, we combined (1) a novel experimental paradigm in which we produced a similar perceptual disappearance and also re-appearance by using visual adaptation with transient contrast changes, with (2) electrophysiological observations from human intracranial electrodes sampling wide brain areas. We focused on broadband high-frequency (50-150 Hz, i.e., gamma) and low-frequency (8-24 Hz) neural activity amplitude modulations related to target visibility and invisibility. We report that low-frequency amplitude modulations reflected stimulus visibility in a larger ensemble of recording sites as compared to broadband gamma responses, across distinct brain regions including occipital, temporal and frontal cortices. Moreover, the dynamics of the broadband gamma response distinguished stimulus visibility from stimulus invisibility earlier in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus than in temporal regions, suggesting a possible role of fronto-insular cortices in top down processing for conscious perception. Finally, we report that in primary visual cortex only low-frequency amplitude modulations correlated directly with perceptual status. Interestingly, in this sensory area broadband gamma was not modulated during PS but became positively modulated after 300 ms when stimuli were rendered visible again, suggesting that local networks could be ignited by top down influences during conscious perception.

We examined the temporal characteristics of cognitive control across conflict adaptation using prestimulus electroencephalogram oscillatory activity and an event-related potential component, N1. Prestimulus frontal (Fz) and posterior (01 and 02) alphal (7-9 Hz) and alpha2 (10-13 Hz) activities were enhanced in trials preceded by incompatible stimuli more than those preceded by compatible stimuli. Furthermore, there were significant differences of alpha2 current densities between previous trial compatibilities in the superior/medial frontal cortex. We suggested that the modulation of alpha activity by previous trial compatibility was associated with proactive attentional control. N1 amplitude was decreased in trials preceded by incompatible stimuli more than in those preceded by compatible stimuli. N1 current densities in the right inferior frontal cortex were smaller for an incompatible stimulus preceded by an incompatible stimulus than those preceded by a compatible stimulus, suggesting that demands of transient cognitive control induced by an incompatible stimulus were decreased by the proactive control. Moreover, correlational analysis showed that participants with a larger increase in alpha2 activity tended to have a larger decrease in N1 in trials preceded by incompatible stimulus. These findings revealed that the manner of cognitive control for the incompatible stimulus was transited from reactive control to proactive control across conflict adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Each subject's WM capacity was estimated using a modified digit span task prior to participation in an N-back task that varied difficulty from 1- to 4-back. While performing the N-back task, subjects wore scalp electrodes that allowed measurement of both event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD). Those subjects classified as low WM were more affected by the higher cognitive demands (many more errors in the 4-back task and generally slower responses) than those classified as high WM. These behavioral differences between the two groups were also apparent in the neural markers. Specifically, low WM subjects, when compared with high WM subjects, produced smaller P300 amplitudes and theta ERS, as well as greater alpha ER]) at the most difficult level. Importantly, the observed differences in electrophysiological responses between the two groups were also observed at the lowest difficulty level, not just when the task challenged WM capacity. In addition, P300 amplitudes and alpha ERD responses were found to correlate with individual WM capacities independent of the task difficulty. These results suggest that there are qualitative neural differences among individuals with different WM capacities when approaching cognitive operations.

Tecumseh			Finding the beat: a neural perspective across humans and non-human primates	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						beat perception; beat synchronization; neurophysiology; modelling	PREMOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY SEQUENCES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; TIME PERCEPTION; VISUAL RHYTHMS; MOTOR AREAS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN	Humans possess an ability to perceive and synchronize movements to the beat in music ('beat perception and synchronization'), and recent neuroscientific data have offered new insights into this beat-finding capacity at multiple neural levels. Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (induding direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.

Objectives: Based on the assumption that early neurodegeneration in AD is asymmetrical and that olfactory input is primarily processed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, we assessed whether unirhinal psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of olfactory function can contribute to the diagnostic workup of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Olfactory function of 13 MCI patients with positive amyloid PET, 13 aged-matched controls (AC) with negative amyloid PET and 13 patients with post-infectious olfactory loss (OD) was assessed unirhinally using (1) psychophysical testing of olfactory detection, discrimination and identification performance and (2) the recording of olfactory event-related brain potentials. Time-frequency analysis was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the electrophysiological responses. Psychophysical and electrophysiological assessment of auditory and trigeminal chemosensory function served as controls. Results: As compared to AC and OD, MCI patients exhibited a significant asymmetry of olfactory performance. This asymmetry efficiently discriminated between MCI and AC (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 77%), as well as MCI and OD (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 70%). There was also an asymmetry of the electrophysiological responses, but not specific for MCI. In both MCI and OD, olfactory stimulation of the best nostril elicited significantly more activity than stimulation of the worse nostril, between 3-7.5 Hz and 1.2-2.0 s after stimulus onset. Trigeminal and auditory psychophysical testing did not show any difference between groups. Conclusion: MCI patients exhibit a marked asymmetry of behavioral olfactory function, which could be useful for the diagnostic workup of MCI.

Thus, there is a need to identify and characterize new antiepileptic drugs. In this study, we used the pilocarpine model of MTLE to establish the effects of a third generation drug, lacosamide (LCM), on seizures, interictal spikes and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples: 80-200 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz). Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g) were injected with pilocarpine to induce a status epilepticus (SE) that was pharmacologically terminated after 1 h. Eight pilocarpine-treated rats were then injected with LCM (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 4h after SE and daily for 14 days. Eight pilocarpine-treated rats were used as controls and treated with saline. Three days after SE, all rats were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the hippocampal CA3 region, entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum and EEG-video monitored from day 4 to day 14 after SE. Results: LCM-treated animals showed lower rates of seizures (0.21 (+/- 0.11) seizures/day) than controls (2.6 (+/- 0.57), p < 0.05), and a longer latent period (LCM: 11 (+/- 1) days, controls: 6.25 (+/- 1), p < 0.05). Rates of interictal spikes in LCM-treated rats were significantly lower than in controls in CA3 and subiculum (p < 0.05). Rates of ripples and fast ripples associated with interictal spikes in CA3 and subiculum as well as rates of fast ripples occurring outside of interictal spikes in CA3 were also significantly lower in LCM-treated animals. In controls, interictal spikes and associated HFOs correlated to seizure clustering, while this was not the case for isolated HFOs. Significance: Our findings show that early treatment with LCM has powerful anti-ictogenic properties in the pilocarpine model of MTLE. These effects are accompanied by decreased rates of interictal spikes and associated HFOs. Isolated HFOs were also modulated by LCM, in a manner that appeared to be unrelated to its antiictogenic effects. These results thus suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie interictal-associated and isolated HFOs in the pilocarpine model of MTLE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several studies with full-night sleep recordings have reported a positive association between sleep spindles and fluid intelligence scores, however more recently it has been shown that only few sleep spindle measures correlate with intelligence in females, and none in males. Sleep spindle regulation underlies a circadian rhythm, however the association between spindles and intelligence has not been investigated in daytime nap sleep so far. In a sample of 86 healthy male human subjects, we investigated the correlation between fluid intelligence and sleep spindle parameters in an afternoon nap of 100 minutes. Mean sleep spindle length, amplitude and density were computed for each subject and for each derivation for both slow and fast spindles. A positive association was found between intelligence and slow spindle duration, but not any other sleep spindle parameter. As a positive correlation between intelligence and slow sleep spindle duration in full-night polysomnography has only been reported in females but not males, our results suggest that the association between intelligence and sleep spindles is more complex than previously assumed.

Complexity Measures in Magnetoencephalography: Measuring "Disorder" in Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG; BEAMFORMER; NONLINEARITY	This paper details a methodology which, when applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, is capable of measuring the spatio-temporal dynamics of 'disorder' in the human brain. Our method, which is based upon signal entropy, shows that spatially separate brain regions (or networks) generate temporally independent entropy time-courses. These time-courses are modulated by cognitive tasks, with an increase in local neural processing characterised by localised and transient increases in entropy in the neural signal. We explore the relationship between entropy and the more established time-frequency decomposition methods, which elucidate the temporal evolution of neural oscillations. We observe a direct but complex relationship between entropy and oscillatory amplitude, which suggests that these metrics are complementary. Finally, we provide a demonstration of the clinical utility of our method, using it to shed light on aberrant neurophysiological processing in schizophrenia. We demonstrate significantly increased task induced entropy change in patients (compared to controls) in multiple brain regions, including a cingulo-insula network, bilateral insula cortices and a right fronto-parietal network. These findings demonstrate potential clinical utility for our method and support a recent hypothesis that schizophrenia can be characterised by abnormalities in the salience network (a well characterised distributed network comprising bilateral insula and cingulate cortices).

The reasons for this can be traced largely to methodological difficulties associated with recording neural activity in behaving newborn rats and mice. Over the last decade, however, the evolution of methods for recording from head-fixed newborns has heralded a new era in developmental neurophysiology. Here, we review these recent developments and provide a step-by-step primer for those interested in applying the head-fix method to their own research questions. Until now, this method has been used primarily to investigate spontaneous brain activity across sleep and wakefulness, the contributions of the sensory periphery to brain activity, or intrinsic network activity. Now, with some ingenuity, the uses of the head-fix method can be expanded to other domains to benefit our understanding of brain-behavior relations under normal and pathophysiological conditions across early development.

REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			English	Review						Animal model; Hippocampus; EEG; Epilepsy; Hyperthermia; Kainate; Status epilepticus	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PROLONGED FEBRILE SEIZURES; GRANULE CELL DISPERSION; TETANUS TOXIN MODEL; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; IMMATURE RAT; MOUSE MODEL; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; DENTATE GYRUS	The fact that epilepsy consists in multiple heterogeneous syndromes with different etiologies and different symptoms is insufficiently taken into account in current animal models. This is in particular the case when modeling mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) for which clinical, electrophysiological, histological and pharmacological features have been well described in the clinic but only partially reproduced in most rodent models. In this review, we report the data of our recent survey of european neurologists with expertise in epilepsy. The answers of 82 of them (out of 258) indicated that seizures with mild behavioral signs, hippocampal sclerosis and focal discharges were the three most critical features to be considered when developing an animal model of MTLE. We then examined how these features are reproduced in three different types of animal models of MTLE depending on their induction: (i) generalized convulsive status epilepticus; (ii) hyperthermic seizures in immature animals and (iii) focal status epilepticus. Among them, only rodent models resulting from the induction of a focal status epilepticus appear to present most characteristics of human MTLE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Human Physiological Benefits of Viewing Nature: EEG Responses to Exact and Statistical Fractal Patterns	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS PSYCHOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						attention restoration theory; restorative environments; landscape preference; nature; biophilia	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; ARCHITECTURE	Psychological and physiological benefits of viewing nature have been extensively studied for some time. More recently it has been suggested that some of these positive effects can be explained by nature's fractal properties. Virtually all studies on human responses to fractals have used stimuli that represent the specific form of fractal geometry found in nature, i. e. statistical fractals, as opposed to fractal patterns which repeat exactly at different scales. This raises the question of whether human responses like preference and relaxation are being driven by fractal geometry in general or by the specific form of fractal geometry found in nature. In this study we consider both types of fractals ( statistical and exact) and morph one type into the other. Based on the Koch curve, nine visual stimuli were produced in which curves of three different fractal dimensions evolve gradually from an exact to a statistical fractal. The patterns were shown for one minute each to thirty-five subjects while qEEG was continuously recorded. The results showed that the responses to statistical and exact fractals differ, and that the natural form of the fractal is important for inducing alpha responses, an indicator of a wakefully relaxed state and internalized attention.

J	Hao, N; Wu, MX; Runco, MA; Pina, J				Hao, Ning; Wu, Mengxia; Runco, Mark A.; Pina, Jeremy			More mind wandering, fewer original ideas: Be not distracted during creative idea generation	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA			English	Article						Mind wandering; Creativity; Creative idea generation; Executive functions	WORKING-MEMORY; DIVERGENT THINKING; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CONTROL ABILITIES; TASK ENGAGEMENT; THOUGHT; INSIGHT; EEG; INTELLIGENCE	Several studies suggest that mind wandering (MW) benefits creativity when the MW occurs in the incubation period of creative problem solving. The aim of present study was to examine the effects of MW that occurs in the course of creative idea generation. Participants received an Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and were asked to generate ideas for 20 min. Their MW frequencies as time passed were measured by means of probe-caught MW. Comparisons of the AUT performances of high and low MW groups revealed that greater MW was associated with lower fluency and originality scores on the AUT. Furthermore, the high MW group showed greater MW as time passed, while the low MW group's MW was steady during the course of idea generation. Accordingly, the originality of idea generation decreased with time passing for the high MW group but was steady for the low MW group. The findings suggest that the MW during the course of creative idea generation is negatively related to creativity, perhaps because the control processes involved in idea generation are impaired by the mind wandering.

J	Zhang, D; Huang, BS; Wu, W; Li, SL				Zhang, Dan; Huang, Bisheng; Wu, Wei; Li, Siliang			An Idle-State Detection Algorithm for SSVEP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces Using a Maximum Evoked Response Spatial Filter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potentials; idle state detection; spatial filtering; maximum evoked response	FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNAL	Although accurate recognition of the idle state is essential for the application of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in real-world situations, it remains a challenging task due to the variability of the idle state. In this study, a novel algorithm was proposed for the idle state detection in a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI. The proposed algorithm aims to solve the idle state detection problem by constructing a better model of the control states. For feature extraction, a maximum evoked response (MER) spatial filter was developed to extract neurophysiologically plausible SSVEP responses, by finding the combination of multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that maximized the evoked responses while suppressing the unrelated background EEGs. The extracted SSVEP responses at the frequencies of both the attended and the unattended stimuli were then used to form feature vectors and a series of binary classifiers for recognition of each control state and the idle state were constructed. EEG data from nine subjects in a three-target SSVEP BCI experiment with a variety of idle state conditions were used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Compared to the most popular canonical correlation analysis-based algorithm and the conventional power spectrum-based algorithm, the proposed algorithm outperformed them by achieving an offline control state classification accuracy of 88.0 +/- 11.1% and idle state false positive rates (FPRs) ranging from 7.4 +/- 5.6% to 14.2 +/- 10.1%, depending on the specific idle state conditions. Moreover, the online simulation reported BCI performance close to practical use: 22.0 +/- 2.9 out of the 24 control commands were correctly recognized and the FPRs achieved as low as approximately 0.5 event/min in the idle state conditions with eye open and 0.05 event/min in the idle state condition with eye closed. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm for implementing practical SSVEP BCI systems.

However, it is largely unknown if some are more suited than others for various types of investigations. In this study, the authors investigate seven connectivity metrics to evaluate which, if any, are sensitive to audiovisual integration by contrasting connectivity when tracking an audiovisual object versus connectivity when tracking a visual object uncorrelated with the auditory stimulus. The authors are able to assess the metrics' performances at detecting audiovisual integration by investigating connectivity between auditory and visual areas. Critically, the authors perform their investigation on a whole-cortex all-to-all mapping, avoiding confounds introduced in seed selection. The authors find that amplitude-based connectivity measures in the beta band detect strong connections between visual and auditory areas during audiovisual integration, specifically between V4/V5 and auditory cortices in the right hemisphere. Conversely, phase-based connectivity measures in the beta band as well as phase and power measures in alpha, gamma, and theta do not show connectivity between audiovisual areas. The authors postulate that while beta power correlations detect audiovisual integration in the current experimental context, it may not always be the best measure to detect connectivity. Instead, it is likely that the brain utilizes a variety of mechanisms in neuronal communication that may produce differential types of temporal relationships.

Particularly, it was reported that the gamma-band ASSR plays an important role in working memory, speech understanding, and recognition. Traditionally, the ASSR has been determined by power spectral density analysis, which cannot detect the exact overall distributed properties of the ASSR. Functional network analysis has recently been applied in electroencephalography studies. Previous studies on resting or working state found a small-world organization of the brain network. Some researchers have studied dysfunctional networks caused by diseases. The present study investigates the brain connection networks of schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations during an ASSR task. A directed transfer function is utilized to estimate the brain connectivity patterns. Moreover, the structures of brain networks are analyzed by converting the connectivity matrices into graphs. It is found that for normal subjects, network connections are mainly distributed at the central and frontal-temporal regions. This indicates that the central regions act as transmission hubs of information under ASSR stimulation. For patients, network connections seem unordered. The finding that the path length was larger in patients compared to that in normal subjects under most thresholds provides insight into the structures of connectivity patterns. The results suggest that there are more synchronous oscillations that cover a long distance on the cortex but a less efficient network for patients with auditory hallucinations.

Phencyclidine Disrupts the Auditory Steady State Response in Rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; CORTICAL GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HALLUCINATION SYMPTOMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; 40 HZ; KETAMINE; DEFICITS; SYNCHRONIZATION	The Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is usually reduced in schizophrenia (SZ), particularly to 40 Hz stimulation. The gamma frequency ASSR deficit has been attributed to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction. We tested whether the NMDAR antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP), produced similar ASSR deficits in rats. EEG was recorded from awake rats via intracranial electrodes overlaying the auditory cortex and at the vertex of the skull. ASSRs to click trains were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 55 Hz and measured by ASSR Mean Power (MP) and Phase Locking Factor (PLF). In Experiment 1, the effect of different subcutaneous doses of PCP (1.0, 2.5 and 4.0 mg/kg) on the ASSR in 12 rats was assessed. In Experiment 2, ASSRs were compared in PCP treated rats and control rats at baseline, after acute injection (5 mg/kg), following two weeks of subchronic, continuous administration (5 mg/kg/day), and one week after drug cessation. Acute administration of PCP increased PLF and MP at frequencies of stimulation below 50 Hz, and decreased responses at higher frequencies at the auditory cortex site. Acute administration had a less pronounced effect at the vertex site, with a reduction of either PLF or MP observed at frequencies above 20 Hz. Acute effects increased in magnitude with higher doses of PCP. Consistent effects were not observed after subchronic PCP administration. These data indicate that acute administration of PCP, a NMDAR antagonist, produces an increase in ASSR synchrony and power at low frequencies of stimulation and a reduction of high frequency (> 40 Hz) ASSR activity in rats. Subchronic, continuous administration of PCP, on the other hand, has little impact on ASSRs. Thus, while ASSRs are highly sensitive to NMDAR antagonists, their translational utility as a cross-species biomarker for NMDAR hypofunction in SZ and other disorders may be dependent on dose and schedule.

Pathophysiologically it has been attributed to bottom-up deafferentation and/or top-down noise-cancelling deficit. Both mechanisms are proposed to alter auditory thalamocortical signal transmission, resulting in thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD). In deafferentation, TCD is characterized by a slowing down of resting state alpha to theta activity associated with an increase in surrounding gamma activity, resulting in persisting cross-frequency coupling between theta and gamma activity. Theta burst-firing increases network synchrony and recruitment, a mechanism, which might enable long-range synchrony, which in turn could represent a means for finding the missing thalamocortical information and for gaining access to consciousness. Theta oscillations could function as a carrier wave to integrate the tinnitus-related focal auditory gamma activity in a consciousness enabling network, as envisioned by the global workspace model. This model suggests that focal activity in the brain does not reach consciousness, except if the focal activity becomes functionally coupled to a consciousness enabling network, aka the global workspace. In limited deafferentation, the missing information can be retrieved from the auditory cortical neighborhood, decreasing surround inhibition, resulting in TCD. When the deafferentation is too wide in bandwidth, it is hypothesized that the missing information is retrieved from theta-mediated parahippocampal auditory memory. This suggests that based on the amount of deafferentation TCD might change to parahippocampocortical persisting and thus pathological theta-gamma rhythm. From a Bayesian point of view, in which the brain is conceived as a prediction machine that updates its memory-based predictions through sensory updating, tinnitus is the result of a prediction error between the predicted and sensed auditory input. The decrease in sensory updating is reflected by decreased alpha activity and the prediction error results in theta-gamma and beta-gamma coupling. Thus, TCD can be considered as an adaptive mechanism to retrieve missing auditory input in tinnitus.

Firing patterns in a random network cellular automata model of the brain	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Networks dynamics; Cellular automata; EEG; Random networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONIZATION	One of the main challenges in the simulation of even reduced areas of the brain is the presence of a large number of neurons and a large number of connections among them. Even from a theoretical point of view, the behaviour of dynamical models of complex networks with high connectivity is unknown, precisely because the cost of computation is still unaffordable and it will likely be in the near future. In this paper we discuss the simulation of a cellular automata network model of the brain including up to one million sites with a maximum average of three hundred connections per neuron. This level of connectivity was achieved thanks to a distributed computing environment based on the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) platform. Moreover, in this work we consider the interplay among excitatory neurons (which induce the excitation of their neighbours) and inhibitory neurons (which prevent resting neurons from firing and induce firing neurons to pass to the refractory state). Our objective is to classify the normal (noisy but asymptotically constant patterns) and the abnormal (high oscillations with spindle-like behaviour) patterns of activity in the model brain and their stability and parameter ranges in order to determine the role of excitatory and inhibitory compensatory effects in healthy and diseased individuals.
